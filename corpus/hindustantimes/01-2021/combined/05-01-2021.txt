05-01-2021||News||Eliminate State and social interference in matters of conscience||Uttar Pradesh (UP)’s Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion law — colloquially called the “love jihad law” — has attracted controversy ever since it was initially enacted as an ordinance two months ago. On the surface, the law proclaims itself to be against “unlawful conversions”, which, in turn, are defined broadly as conversions secured through coercion or other forms of inducement. To start with, it is unclear why the State should be specially concerned with something as personal as religious conversions, when the Indian Penal Code already has provisions against both criminal intimidation and various forms of fraud. However, as such laws have existed on the statute books for many years — and have been upheld by the Supreme Court — their continued existence needs a larger and longer debate.More specifically, however, there are two ways in which UP’s law contravenes fundamental principles of the Constitution. First, it discriminates on the basis of gender. The law provides for greater penalties if the unlawful conversion is with respect to a minor, a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, or a woman. Furthermore, the law also stipulates that an unlawful conversion conducted for the purpose of marriage will be void in cases where the woman has been unlawfully converted before the marriage. This provision makes it clear that the law continues to be based on a patriarchal mindset that views women as lacking agency and autonomy, and therefore in need of “special protection.”Such logic has been strongly repudiated by the courts — most recently while striking down the criminalisation of adultery, which had a very similar gender asymmetric provision — and it has been made clear that the Constitution does not allow ostensibly “beneficial” laws for women that are based on patriarchal or stereotypical assumptions.Second, the law requires an advance notice of any conversion to be provided to the district magistrate, who is then required to initiate an inquiry — through the police — into the “real intention” behind the conversion. To this is added the fact that the law places the “burden” of proving that a conversion is not illegal upon the person who desires to convert (or someone who has facilitated the conversion). Shorn of legalese, therefore, the effect of the law is that any person who wants to change their religion must first convince the State and the police that they are doing so for reasons that the State deems to be genuine.It should be clear that the law infantilises Indian citizens, reduces them to the level of subjects, and authorises State intrusion into the most personal of domains, that of individual conscience. Secular law already has provisions penalising coercion, intimidation, and fraud, and there is no reason why coercion or fraud deserves any special treatment where religion is concerned.The requirement of a public notice accompanying a decision of conversion also requires a larger debate, as variants of it are found in many laws, including the Special Marriage Act, which was ostensibly enacted to protect the rights of inter-faith couples. Let us, for the purposes of argument, assume for a moment that the State has some interest in regulating valid marriages and conversions. This does not change the fact that both marriage and conversion are decisions that lie firmly within the domain of individual choice, and individual privacy. There is, therefore, no justification for requiring people choosing to be married under the Special Marriage Act — or individuals choosing to convert — to publicly announce their intention to do so. In essence, this sanctifies social interference with individual privacy, and goes far beyond any interest the State may have to ensure that the laws are upheld.The UP conversion law is unconstitutional. But the debate does not end with this one law, as it also replicates many existing provisions from other laws, which have been left standing for too long. India cannot call itself a constitutional democracy until social interference in matters of conscience is eliminated from its laws, once and for all.

The authorities concerned must ensure proper maintenance of such places to avoid any untoward incidents in future posing danger to human lives,” the NHRC said on Tuesday. The Commission has also asked the state government, through its senior officers, about the present status of the investigation of the case as well as the health condition of those injured. “The incident is required to be investigated thoroughly so that the guilty could be adequately punished, as per the provisions of the law,” the Commission added.In the meantime, the Ghaziabad district administration has started the process of providing relief to victim families.“We have deployed several teams of counsellors and health officials who are taking up counselling of victim families as they are under severe trauma. The education department is also taking up works related to free education and scholarship for their children. Besides, food items and ration are being provided to the families,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.He added that the officials have identified 12 of the 18 affected families who will be provided benefits under different government schemes such as the Parivarik Pension Yojna, Vidhwa Pension, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna and also under schemes meant for disabled persons.An FIR has been lodged into the incident and so far, five persons have been arrested. The DM has also initiated action against the erring persons and directed the police to initiate strict action against the suspects under provisions of the National Security Act, the Uttar Pradesh Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act and also under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. “It has also been directed to the Ghaziabad development authority and the municipal-corporation to get a quality of works taken up by the contractor checked and to stop payments to him, besides getting the firm blacklisted. It has also been directed to other agencies to blacklist the contractor if he is registered with any respective agency,” Pandey said, adding that recovery of payments made, along with interest, is to be initiated with issuance of recovery-certificates. “A team of senior engineers from the authority, the civic agency and the UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam has been constituted to check the quality of construction at the cremation ground and for other works taken up at Muradnagar. If the quality is not up to standards, recovery certificates will be issued for recovery of the funds,” Pandey added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/muradnagar-roof-collapse-nhrc-issues-notice-to-uttar-pradesh-govt/story-AHohuy3ENi14xOR3kerSwM.html

Till Tuesday, five suspects, including the prime suspect, were arrested. The Ghaziabad police have arrested Niharika Singh, the executive officer of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika, besides CP Singh, a junior engineer, and Ashish Kumar, a supervisor, as well as prime suspect, contractor Ajay Tyagi. His alleged accomplice, Sanjay Garg, who is a contractor of another private firm, was arrested Tuesday morning. A reward of ₹25,000 had been announced on Tyagi’s arrest. “The CM has directed that the government’s losses in the incident should be recovered from the respective contractor and engineers. The CM has also directed that action under the National Security Act should be initiated against the suspects,” the UP government said in a statement Tuesday. Families of the victims on Monday had blocked the Delhi Meerut Road for seven hours by placing the bodies on the road. They had demanded compensation of ₹20 lakh for each family, besides free education for their children and a government job to one of the family members. The CM had announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh each for the families of the deceased on the day of the incident, which on Tuesday, was increased to ₹10 lakh per family.“He has also directed for the provision of a house for each of the affected families, if they have no home of their own,” the statement issued on Tuesday added. The 40 foot structure at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground collapsed on Sunday morning killing 24 persons who were part of a group there to attend the funeral of a 65-year-old man, who died a day earlier. The Ghaziabad police later lodged an FIR naming the contractor, executive officer, junior engineer and supervisor, besides several other unidentified persons under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 (causing hurt to any person by doing any act rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (causing damages) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant etc). “Tyagi was arrested on late Monday while his accomplice was arrested Tuesday morning. Tyagi had fled the city soon after the incident and went to Hapur and Meerut to evade arrest. He was nabbed while he was trying to go to Delhi. The three others – the executive office, junior engineer and supervisor – had been arrested Monday morning,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/recover-losses-from-suspects-book-them-under-nsa-cm/story-rpMkODfecOPGPwoJLYCo6M.html
05-01-2021||Noida||Contractor bribed officials, resorted to malpractices, say Ghaziabad police||Ghaziabad: Ajay Tyagi, the 45-year-old contractor who was arrested on late Monday night in connection with the roof collapse incident at Muradnagar cremation ground, has allegedly told police that he gave a bribe of ₹16 lakh to officials of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika. According to police officials, Tyagi allegedly also said that he used inferior quality material and formed a cartel in order to carry out the work at the cremation ground. As many as 24 persons were killed in the incident on January 3. Tyagi, from Morta in Muradnagar and resident of Raj Nagar, was arrested from the canal road area in Muzaffarnagar while he was allegedly trying to flee to Delhi. The police said that he had allegedly fled his house in Raj Nagar without any vehicle and took local transport to reach Hapur and Meerut districts in order to hide himself. The police also arrested Tyagi’s accomplice Sanjay Garg from Ghaziabad. “He told us that he fled his house around 11.30am on Sunday as soon as he received information about the incident. Then he took lifts in trucks and commercial vehicles and finally reached Muazffarnagar. He said that he bribed officials of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika and paid ₹16 lakh to them from the first instalment for the work that got released in March,” said an investigating officer, adding that a commission of about 28-30% of the tender value was allegedly shelved out as bribe. The work for construction of shelter at Muradnagar crematorium was tendered to Tyagi in February last year for ₹50 lakh and it was to get complete in 60 days. The work, however, got delayed due to the Covid-induced lockdown, the officials said. “Tyagi said that he received first instalment of ₹26 lakh in March and another ₹16 lakh in July, and hurried up the work otherwise the funds would have lapsed. So, he said that in order to expedite the work he formed a cartel with two other firms and took up the construction of the shelter. He also told police that there was no need for the design of such shelter at the cremation ground, but the firms inflated bills in order to mint money,” the officer said. An initial inspection report of the incident site by engineers of the Ghaziabad development authority and the municipal corporation has indicated the use of “inferior quality material” and “design issues” which led to the structural failure. Based on the statements of Tyagi and Garg, the Ghaziabad police have initiated process for levy of provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act to the ongoing investigation. The police officials said that they are also probing if such malpractices were inherent in other works taken up by the contractor. “Initially, it has come to light from Tyagi’s statements that he allegedly bribed the officials and resorted to certain practices which led to the roof collapse incident. A departmental inquiry is going on against the officials of the Nagar Palika and we are taking up expert legal opinion to initiate proceedings for corruption,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). “We are also investigating other persons linked to Tyagi and even those who provided him shelter,” he added. The investigators also said that they will probe all such malpractices during the ongoing investigation and will also take remand of the three suspects, including executive officer and junior engineer of Nagar Palika, who were arrested on Monday and lodged at Dasna jail. Officials said that Tyagi, through his firm, was also taking up works with the Ghaziabad municipal corporation and had been a contractor for the past 8-10 years. Several of his photographs with officials also went viral over social media. “We have a list of about 12 projects costing about ₹7 crore which he is taking up. We have formed a team to check the quality of works and will take action if any issue comes to light,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. Tyagi and Garg on Tuesday afternoon were also taken for their medical examination to MMG Hospital before being taken to Ghaziabad district court where Tyagi was attacked with slippers by a woman, identified as Poonam Pal, whose husband, son and son-in-law were severely injured during the roof collapse incident. “Most of the people who were killed in the incident were our family members, relatives and neighbours. I want the police to hand over the suspect to us. Any compensation cannot bring back 24 people who died due to his negligence and malpractices,” Poonam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/contractor-bribed-officials-resorted-to-malpractices-say-ghaziabad-police/story-UNw4v0GxWaeVc2HKxlWUnL.html

With January expected to see the arrival of more international travellers and migrant workers, the health department is on its toes to check another spike in infections, as seen in September last year.Dr Kuldeep Kumar, who is supervising the sampling process, said, “We collect nearly 300 samples daily for RT-PCR tests, mostly of auto-rickshaw drivers and their passengers. Besides, we also look for foreign travellers who are in taxis. Besides sampling them, we collect their address details, so that they can be traced and quarantined if found positive.”Stating that most of the people tested were usually asymptomatic, he said the number of positive cases daily varied, with one day even detecting 30 positive cases and others none at all.Neeraj Kohli, who was travelling to Jalandhar, appreciated the move. “It is a great initiative. Normally, only a person with symptoms visits the hospital for testing, while asymptotic people roam around carefree. It also saves travellers’ time as they don’t have to visit the hospital for testing.”Recently, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had stated that samples of all people, including farmers returning from the agitation at Singhu border, will be collected.Since the new strain was reported in the UK, so far, 18 people have returned to the district from there. Out of those, 16 have tested negative, while a positive patient, a female from Amritsar, was admitted at the civil hospital and later found negative for the new strain. Another positive patient had shifted to Uttar Pradesh.Suspended since December 22, flights to and from the UK will resume at the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Mumbai on January 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-keep-watch-on-int-l-travellers-health-dept-sets-up-covid-naka-near-ludhiana-s-ladhowal-toll/story-pQq1eEcKBzfBPkL63hosSK.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh recorded 35% drop in vehicle registrations in 2020||Hit by Covid-19 pandemic, vehicle registrations in Chandigarh fell by 35% in 2020. According to data available with the Registration and Licensing Authority and State Transport Authority, 30,259 vehicles were registered in the city in 2020, down from 45,984 in 2019, which was already the lowest in a decade. In the segment of light motor vehicles, which comprises of cars and jeeps, 13,899 units were registered, a dip of 22% from the previous year’s 17,745. When it came to two-wheelers, 15,028 units were registered in 2020 as compared to 25,895 in 2019, a drop of 42%.“The year saw low sales. Even as a spike was seen during the festival season, sales again came down in December,” said Ronny Hoon, president, Federation of Chandigarh Regional Automobile Dealers. With Navratras, Dhanteras and Diwali in October-November, the two months recorded 3,396 and 3,848 vehicle registrations, respectively. In 2019, when all these festivals were celebrated in October, 7,400 vehicles were registered during the month and the figure fell to 3,173 in November.Nitin Mehan, who owns the Maruti Suzuki dealership Autopace, said: “Virtually no sales took place in April and May due to the lockdown. However, the trend is changing. Our sales during the festival season were more than in the previous years.”Mehtani said many people from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh also buy their vehicles from Chandigarh, but that data is not reflected in the local registration figures.“The performance of dealerships has varied from company to company. While Ford and Toyota have lost business, companies like Kia and Nissan have built new ground. Newly launched models of cars after the lockdown have done particularly well,” said Varinder Singh Saluja, former head of the federation and owner of a Ford dealership in the city. On drop in the sale of two-wheelers, Karan Gilhotra, who is the proprietor of Platinum Honda dealerships, said: “We were majorly hit as colleges and the university didn’t have physical classes this year. Even in offices, work from home culture has been adopted in most places, so people don’t need two-wheelers to go to work. The spending capacity of consumers has also come down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-recorded-35-drop-in-vehicle-registrations-in-2020/story-X9H4b4SUjuGUowO7ONeiSM.html

After 3mm rain recorded on Tuesday and chances of light rain on Wednesday as well, temperature is likely to fall from Thursday onwards.Chandigarh had also recorded its warmest January day in more than a decade on Monday, when maximum temperature stood at 25.8°C. However, it came down to 20.7°C on Tuesday owing to cloudy weather and spells of light rain.“After a warm Monday, cloud cover acted like a blanket, not allowing the surface to lose heat through radiation at night. Warm and moisture-laden easterly winds circulating in the region also led to rise in night temperature,” said Shivinder Singh, scientist, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh.Singh said dense fog can be expected from Thursday onwards, and although day temperature will plunge, it is unlikely for cold wave conditions to return. In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 18 and 19 degrees while minimum temperature will remain between 11 and 14 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/night-temperature-rises-to-14-c-in-chandigarh/story-U4ftAMYZhqdxfpZYirTS5K.html

Kumar, 45, had joined the police force 26 years ago. He was last deputed in the commando unit.Meanwhile, following his transfer to police lines, assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Sukhwinder Singh, in-charge of the Mundian police post, has also been suspended and replaced by ASI Dalbir Singh. Apart from Sukhwinder, 11 more cops were transferred to police lines.A hunt is on for the arrest of the rest of the accused, including three women and a man, who had assaulted the victim, torn her clothes, molested her and also filmed her. “A medical examination of the woman will be conducted on Wednesday. Her statement will also be recorded in court under Sections 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,” said inspector Kulwant Singh, SHO, Jamalpur police station.He added that the police will also record statements of her husband and his friend, who was also beaten up by the accused for allegedly having illicit relations with the woman.‘No one came for help’The 24-year-old woman said despite her pleas, cops took her to the police post on December 6 after the accused filed a false complaint against her. She alleged that around 1.30am on December 7, head constable Kumar took her to a room on the first floor of the police post, stating that a female cop will question her, but there was no woman there. He then raped her repeatedly and did not allow her to get dressed. He released her at 4.30am and threatened her to stay mum.“At least four police personnel were present in the police station. I cried for help, but no one came to my rescue and kept laughing at me,” she alleged.“I then went to the civil hospital for medical examination, but the cops followed me and made me leave without getting examined. They threatened to implicate my husband in a fake case if I filed a rape complaint,” she added.But, after staying quiet for 11 days, she gathered the courage to file a complaint with the police commissioner on December 17, following which a probe was ordered and the head constable was booked on January 3.Women commission seeks report from top copTaking cognisance of the incident, Punjab State Women Commission (PSWC) chairperson Manisha Gulati has asked commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal to submit a detailed action-taken report in two days.She has also sought a report on why there was a need to keep the woman at the police post overnight and details of the conditions surrounding her detainment.“I have asked the Ludhiana police to submit a report within two days and asked to make it clear why the woman was detained overnight if no female cop was available at the police post,” she said.Gulati has also written to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future and to take steps so that women feel safe while visiting police stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rape-at-ludhiana-police-post-head-constable-in-net-in-charge-suspended/story-vFThoUvWX7Kkliq90UWExM.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh BJP rebel mayoral candidate’s nomination rejected||The high-voltage drama on Monday over the Bharatiya Janata Party rebel candidate Chandervati Shukla staking a claim to the mayor’s post ended in an anticlimax on Tuesday with her nomination papers being rejected on “technical grounds”.After scrutiny of nomination papers of all candidates, returning officer Anil Kumar Garg rejected Shukla’s nomination.“As per rules, same person cannot propose or second two mayoral candidates. In this case, Congress councillor Satish Kainth was proposer in one nomination paper and seconded another candidate’s name,” said Garg, who is also the MC additional commissioner. Before seconding Shukla’s name, Kainth had signed as the proposer in Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla’s nomination papers for the mayor’s post. Kainth is also in the fray for the senior deputy mayor’s post.BJP’s internal rivalries had come out in the open on Monday after it announced outgoing senior deputy mayor Ravi Kant Sharma as its mayor candidate. While Shukla filed nomination papers against him, fellow councillor Bharat Kumar had claimed to have resign from the party in protest.Criticising the cancellation of Shukla’s nomination, Babla said: “BJP misused the state machinery. By putting pressure on the officials, it got Shukla’s nomination papers rejected. First, the party got the MC wards changed, as per its whims and fancies, and now this. There is no democracy left in the city under BJP.” In fact, Chandigarh Congress president Pardeep Chhabra had said on Monday that the party would back Shukla and Babla might withdraw his nomination.Responding to Babla’s allegation, BJP state president Arun Sood said, “The nomination papers have been rejected as per law; BJP has nothing to do with it. In fact, nomination papers of Congress mayoral candidate should have also been cancelled. How can a mayoral candidate propose the name of another mayoral candidate?”BJP’s troubles far from overEven as there is no rebel candidate in the fray, BJP’s troubles are far from over, say party insiders. There are apprehensions of cross-voting against the party nominees, especially for the mayor and deputy mayor posts. It won’t be a first for the party, as in 2019 elections, too, the rebel candidate (Kainth) had managed to get 11 votes due to cross-voting. BJP has 20 members in the House, followed by five of Congress and one of Shiromani Akali Dal. The member of parliament also votes, taking the total to 27. “The biggest grouse is that the party has rewarded those who earlier backstabbed it. Councillors who supported Kainth’s candidature in 2019 are getting posts now. It is unfair for dedicated workers,” said a BJP councillor, who didn’t want to be named.“Anger is also brewing among councillors over the party’s decision to elevate Sharma from senior deputy mayor to mayor’s post. Others should have also been given a chance. Though not openly voicing their resentment, some are furious that their opinion taken by state party in-charge Dushyant Gautam was not considered in the final nominations,” said another councillor.However, Sood claimed all differences within the party have been resolved and it will get all 20 votes. “The victory for BJP candidates is assured. Our councillors will vote in unison for party nominees,” he said.Meanwhile, Kumar said that he is yet to decide his future course of action. Even Shukla didn’t provide any conclusive comment over her next move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-bjp-rebel-mayoral-candidate-s-nomination-rejected/story-6x8W0hTvr0kcC3ACZkZvRJ.html

05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chhatbir Zoo bird enclosure closes for 5 days amid flu fears||Chhatbir Zoo officials on Tuesday said they were closing down the walk-in aviary for five days amid bird flu fears after Himachal Pradesh became the fourth state to confirm an outbreak with 1,800 migratory birds, most of them bar-headed geese, found dead in the Pong Dam Lake sanctuary and thousands of birds perishing in the poultry hub of Barwala in Haryana for reasons not known as yet.“We have closed down the birds section for five days, but since the sample reports of Barwala chicken are awaited we will decide on extending the closure, maybe for 15 days. We don’t want to take any risks,” said M Sudhagar, field director of Chhatbir Zoo. The move comes barely after a month when the zoo opened to public on December 10 after March 17 following the Covid-19 outbreak. It has been hit financially too, suffering losses of Rs 5 crore since it earned revenues of an estimated Rs 8 lakh a day before the lockdown.

05-01-2021||Patna||After horror tales, Bihar child care homes focus on making girls self-reliant||Away from the horror tales of Muzaffarpur children’s home, which led to a nationwide outrage soon after the findings of the social audit by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) reached the public domain in 2018 and resulted in CBI probe, Bihar’s social welfare department has now embarked on an ambitious scheme to make the girl inmates self-reliant once they turn 18. It plans to send 30 more girls for hotel management course to Bangalore and other places. Fourteen girls drawn from different child care institutions in Begusarai, Gaya, Madhubani, Patna, Motihari and Purnea were sent for the course to Bangalore in joint collaboration with Empowerment of Children and Human Rights Organisation (ECHO) - Centre for Juvenile Justice on December 29. Director, directorate of social welfare, department of social welfare, Raj Kumar, said the 14 girls were sent on a pilot basis, but now the need to do more has been felt for the girls and a detailed scheme has been worked out.

We are also in talks with banks to provide loans to self-help groups of girls. Earlier, they got training in stitching and beautician course, but due to lack of back up, they could not become self-reliant. The emphasis now is to help them become self-reliant,” he said, adding that the hotel management institute would also help them get job placement in the hospitality industry. As per the guidelines of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), for the aftercare of children completing 18 years, a monthly assistance of Rs 2,000 each is provided so as to help them in settling after exiting from the CCIs. “But that is not enough. The department’s initiative for alternative care of children outside the institutions is in keeping with the TISS recommendations,” said the director, adding that the girls sent to Bangalore would also keep getting Rs 2,000 each. Stung by the findings of the TISS social audit, which earned the entire state a bad name across the globe and the CBI investigation into it is still on, the department of social welfare has taken a range of steps to improve the quality of care being provided across child care institutions (CCIs). “The audit was an eye-opener for the department also and it immediately got down to a massive exercise to improve the system, viz. revision of entire inspection and monitoring system of CCIs by the state as well as the district administration, zero tolerance to any incident of abuse of children inside CCIs and development of better infrastructure and child-friendly environment etc. Exposure visits of caregivers of CCIs to Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad, Indore and Tripura were also undertaken to learn best practices,” said the official, adding that adequate funds have also been given to care homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/after-horror-tales-bihar-child-care-homes-focus-on-making-girls-self-reliant/story-AraPBodurhqDtrBCi4eTNO.html

A dead fish and frog were also found nearby. Officials said it could not be determined when exactly the bird had died. The samples have been sent to test for bird flu.Bird flu has been confirmed in four states across India, including Himachal Pradesh, where around 1,800 migratory birds were found dead in the Pong Dam Lake sanctuary. Other states are Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Bird flu or avian influenza can spread to humans and can trigger a person-to-person transmission.Closer home, over four lakh poultry birds have died in the past few days in Panchkula’s Barwala-Raipur Rani belt, and the test results are awaited.“We have taken samples of the bird found in the lake and will send them to Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory in Jalandhar for testing on Wednesday morning. This is first such sample that is to be sent from the city amid the bird flu scare. It generally takes a day or two for the results to arrive,” said Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator of forests, Chandigarh. Chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai said: “Our teams have been on alert for the past few days.Till now, migratory birds have not shown any unnatural behaviour. If there is any other bird found dead, it will be sent for testing too.” Dalai said although common coot is a migratory specie, many such birds have made Sukhna Lake their abode. “The veterinary department take samples of the faecal matter of birds every month even in routine. Samples were collected on Tuesday as well to ensure that birds are safe here,” he said.Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director, animal husbandry and fisheries department, said: “During winters, birds usually die of cold temperature. In case of a bird flu outbreak, multiple casualties are seen. Here it could be a case of a weak or aging bird succumbing to the extreme weather.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dead-bird-in-sukhna-lake-creates-flutter-amid-bird-flu-scare-in-and-around-chandigarh/story-4oWRYU8CCI8IMVNdL26YDL.html

Lab director Dr Mohinder Pal Singh said: “On Sunday, we received four samples. However, the quality wasn’t good, so we couldn’t establish the cause of death. As bird flu has been confirmed in other areas, we are taking the death of a large number of poultry birds in Barwala seriously.”Till Tuesday evening, the team had collected 45 samples from five poultry farms. After collecting more samples, it will be returning to Jalandhar on Wednesday morning. “The reports of fresh samples will be out by Wednesday evening,” said Dr Singh, adding that if they test positive for bird flu, then according to the protocol, the samples will be sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal for confirmation.Considered Asia’s second largest poultry hub, with a daily production of more than 1 crore eggs and employing 15,000 workers at around 120 farms, the Barwala belt has seen the death of 4 lakh chickens out of around 78 lakh, as confirmed by the Haryana government on Tuesday.“Among the suspected diseases can also be Ranikhet or infectious laryngo-tracheitis,” the animal husbandry department said in an advisory, adding that poultry and poultry products can be cooked and consumed as usual with no fear of acquiring infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fresh-samples-taken-from-barwala-poultry-farms-amid-bird-flu-fears-in-panchkula/story-geZQ5LZWo1kTs4HzjIHzfN.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh govt schoolteacher booked for job fraud||A government schoolteacher was booked on Monday for allegedly cheating the relatives of a Railway Protection Force (RPF) head constable of Rs 8 lakh after promising them jobs at a university in Gurugram.Sector 20 resident Parminder Singh has allegedly been involved in other cases of cheating too and suspended at least once from work by the education department, police say.RPF head constable and Mauli Jagran Railway Colony resident Inderjit Singh alleged in a police complaint that his acquaintance, Parminder Singh, a resident of Sector-20, had informed him in August 2019 about vacancies for a peon and lab cleaner at a University in Gurugram and that he could get his family members jobs if they paid Rs 4 lakh each per job. Inderjit Singh alleged that he had no reason to mistrust Parminder as he had helped his son get admission in a government school in Sector 21 where he taught , so he ensured that his nephew Jaswant and Jaswant’s cousin Bhupinder met the teacher at his house in August 2019. After filling in a form that Parminder Singh had given, Jaswant and Bhupinder paid him Rs 2 lakh each through cheque and the remainder of the money in cash. Soon, however, after he failed to deliver on his promise, Inderjit Singh complained to the police in July 2020. After legal opinions were sought a case has now been registered at the Sector 19 police station under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Interestingly, police officials say, Parminder Singh was suspended in September 2019 by the education department after he allegedly duped 11 persons of Rs 1.77 crore in other cases. He was, however, reinstated in November the same year even though a departmental inquiry was pending against him. Police also say that Parminder Singh was working in connivance with a UT excise and taxation department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-govt-schoolteacher-booked-for-job-fraud/story-0wvZt9bKjzeIBGjF9mbzIL.html

05-01-2021||Noida||NMRC staff test negative for coronavirus||Noida: The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Monday conducted an RT-PCR test drive for its 371 employees and all of them were found Covid-19 negative. The drive was conducted to safeguard the employees, their families and metro commuters, NMRC officials said. Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC managing director, said that the tests were conducted on January 4 and the reports came on Tuesday. “All the 371 employees have tested negative for Covid-19. The tests were conducted at three locations -- NMRC headquarters in Sector 29 (Noida), NMRC staff colony in Greater Noida and Sector 51 Metro Station of the Aqua Line,” she said in a press statement.NMRC had coordinated with the office of the chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, to organise the medical camp at the above locations. Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said the NMRC has always tried to take various measures in helping the government contain the Covid-19. “Even during the lockdown, the trains, metro stations, official premises and staff colony were regularly sanitised. NMRC has implemented strict guidelines for passengers travelling on the Aqua Line after it resumed operations on September 7,” she said.

05-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Covid vaccine dry run exposes glitches||The Covid-19 vaccination dry run at six hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar on Tuesday threw up glitches in the protocols that officials say would be fixed before the actual vaccination drive expected soon.Apart from patchy internet connectivity, the district also discovered wrong phone numbers and realised the importance of offering an option to change time slots for the shot.Six hospitals– Child PGI, Sharda Hospital, Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), public health centre (PHC) in Bisrakh and the community health centres (CHCs) in Bisrakh and Bhangel – were picked for the drill. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY visited the vaccination centres at Child PGI and CHC Bhangel during drill termed it as a success. ”The internet connectivity with the state portal (Co-Win) was an issue, but it was sorted out soon. I’ve asked the health officials to give full details of the vaccination process before inoculating them,” he said. Co-Win is a mobile application that has details of the beneficiaries of the vaccination drive. While at first it will contain details of only those who will be included in the first few phases, people can later get themselves registered on it when the government is ready to bring out the vaccine to the public.The vaccine, when it is rolled out, will be distributed in phases. The first phase will involve health care workers who are most at risk of infection.District chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that 50 “practice beneficiaries” were asked to arrive at each site via SMS during two separate sessions. “All the centres saw full participation. The drill also threw up a few technical glitches such as wrong phone numbers and a missing option to change time slots if a person cannot make it to a site,” he said. The district administration will seek three-level verification of beneficiaries -- at block level, sub-divisional level and district level -- to ensure proper phone numbers and offer them the chance to change time at each of these levels.One health worker at PHC Bisrakh said that the internet connectivity was an issue in the beginning. “It was rectified within half an hour. Since Co-Win App is a key component of Covid-19 vaccination, the system needs a steady internet connection to upload the details of beneficiaries and their dosages,” he said. Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, the director of GIMS, said that the beneficiaries were mock vaccinated between 10 am and noon. “A team of six was involved in each session. We had made arrangements to hold 50 people at the waiting area, a vaccination room and an observation area (to check for adverse reactions), besides two dedicated beds with a doctor and nurses for any emergency,” he said. Dr (Major) BP Singh of Child PGI said that the drill saw beneficiaries requiring to identify themselves with their government approved ID card at entry. “After verification, they were mock vaccinated in a separate room. All beneficiaries were observed for at least 30 minutes after the mock vaccination,” he said. At Sharda hospital, the dry runs for vaccinations were conducted in five rooms. Joint registrar of Sharda University Ajit Kumar said, “Workshops were also organised to ensure that the dry run was done correctly with few mistakes. From cold chain to the movement of storage and vaccine, real-time information was being monitored,” he said. District immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that all the Covid-19 standard protocols were followed meticulously during the exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-covid-vaccine-dry-run-exposes-glitches/story-rf9TieWTqJlbiFG7tWA23I.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Final ward notification issued for Ambala Sadar civic body||Almost a month after issuing a draft notification, the state government sent out a final notice on Tuesday for the delimitation of 31 wards of Sadar Zone of the Ambala municipal council.The earlier notification invited objections and suggestions for ward limitations but no other changes were included in the final notice, said a former councillor even as Apurva Chaudhary, executive officer of the council, said it had been uploaded on the department’s website on December 31. Political parties that were busy earlier with the recently concluded municipal corporation elections here are expected to swing into action again. The council elections gain importance as the local MLA here is home minister Anil Vij, also holds the urban local bodies portfolio. Onkar Nath Pruthi, Congress leader and former councillor, accused the state government of not taking any of the party’s objections into consideration for ward limitations.Now the reservation of wards will be done after which the election process will begin. “A decision will also be taken reserving or keeping the chairman’s post open. Earlier the elections of the council took place in 2005 and 31 councillors worked till 2010. Later, the corporation was formed in 2010 and the Sadar Zone was also added with its elections held in 2013 for 20 wards. Then, in 2019, the Sadar Zone was separated again leaving 11 wards in the city and nine councillors here. Of these nine, six were Congress-backed and three were from the Bharaitya Janata Party,” Pruthi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/final-ward-notification-issued-for-ambala-sadar-civic-body/story-yxOmiGFqVcfxAgWcEaphfM.html

The rains are actually going to be helpful in the fields and our brothers from Lucknow, Barabanki, Kasganj etc will also come down here soon to show their support to our cause.”The group also took out a mock funeral on Tuesday of the new farm laws depicting the farmer’s lack of faith in them. A separate group from the Lokshakti faction has been camped at the Dalit Prerna Sthal and have moved to the building in the park because of the rainy weather.Because of the sit-in, traffic from Noida to Delhi has been diverted via the DND flyway. But on Tuesday afternoon, a truck broke down at the exit loop from DND leading to traffic congestion for a while.“A crane was used to move the truck to road side after which traffic was cleared. It is moving steadily now and is being managed without any issues,” said Gautam Buddh Nagar deputy commissioner of police, for traffic, Ganesh Saha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-after-tent-collapse-farmers-put-up-waterproof-canopy-at-chilla-border/story-d8hy5Ks3uOpY383HZI2rgO.html

05-01-2021||Noida||Lessons from Muradnagar: Yamuna expressway authority forms teams to inspect projects||GREATER NOIDA: Learning from the Muradnagar incident, where poor quality of construction material led to the roof at a cremation ground to collapse, resulting in 24 deaths, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has decided to scrutinise ongoing works and verify the quality of a project before it is opened for public use.Two teams, headed by additional chief executive officers (ACEO), will ensure that the projects underway in the Yamuna Expressway region are built with prescribed construction material, said officials, adding that if it is found that rules were flouted then the contractor is to be blacklisted immediately.Since the Swiss firm – Zurich International AG – has released its schedule for the Noida International Airport at Jewar, in which it says it will start work by mid-2021, the authority has started taking up developmental works around the site. Around 20 projects, including drainage systems, water reservoirs, sewage treatment plants, roads and housing, among other projects, are going on near the airport site.“To make sure that quality construction materials are used and that all norms are followed, we have formed two teams, each headed by ACEOs. These two teams will conduct frequent inspections at the site to check the quality of materials. Once the project is built, the teams will again conduct inspections and verify quality,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of the authority.In Muradnagar, the contractor allegedly used sub-standard material for the construction of a roof at the crematorium which likely led to the tragedy, the initial report has found. In the Yamuna Expressway area, at least 50 small and big contractors are working on multiple projects.Apart from this, the authority has decided to take samples of construction material being used in projects to test them at an independent lab such as Shri Ram Institute and Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) in Delhi to verify the quality.“If the test reports confirm that the quality is not as per norms, we will act against the contractor during the construction stage itself. Besides, if any anomaly is caught at the stage of payment for work to the contractor, then also we will act sternly,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lessons-from-muradnagar-yamuna-expressway-authority-forms-teams-to-inspect-projects/story-WcJN7Js3nO3cG7rF3F2LlL.html

According to the police, this gang of five members have been active in Haryana for the last 14 months and was allegedly involved in more than 10 murders, 50 carjacking cases, 40 cases of loot, 50 robberies and 24 house thefts across various districts of Haryana and Rajasthan. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the gang was actively involved in carjacking and used to rob cars and SUVs to commit crime in other areas. “We have recovered four pistols, six automatic magazines, 20 live cartridges, four mobile phones and one master key from their possession,” he said. The suspects have been identified as Amit Godara of Ganganagar in Rajasthan and Sri Bhagwan of Rohtak. Sangwan said they were involved in cases reported from Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. “The They carried out several burglaries during the lockdown. The kingpin has been identified as Dalpreet alias Baba who operates from Ropar jail. The suspects during questioning revealed that they work for Baba, while another key member of gang is Rahul Bara. They wanted to rob a car on Sunday and had to reach Aurangabad in Maharashtra for a contract killing of a businessman on directions of Baba. We will take Baba on remand from Punjab for further questioning,” he said. The police added that on December 27, they had shot dead a businessman in Yamunanagar and robbed his Swift car. The car was allegedly used in a bank robbery in Hanumangarh in Rajasthan where they had looted ₹12.5 lakh and later set the car ablaze in village Salempur in Hansi. The police said they do not use the same car for more than two incidents. In the first week of December, they had robbed a Baleno car from Gurdaspur and then used it for another robbery in Ganganagar in Rajasthan, where they robbed ₹13.5 lakh from a cash collection van and left the car near Kaithal after they met with an accident. The suspects have also allegedly robbed sports motorbikes from Punjab. They later abandoned at isolated stretches after they snatched gold chains from six women in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-identify-mastermind-behind-gang-of-carjackers/story-35FKotv0lMdUyNsTZjIXmO.html
05-01-2021||Gurugram||26 transporters under scanner for involvement in drug trade||A day after a truck driver and his co-driver were held with a consignment of drugs worth ₹11 crore, the police on Tuesday said that 26 transport companies were under scanner for their alleged involvement in the drug trade. The police have identified transporters from Hisar, Sirsa and Gurugram, who are suspected to be involved in the smuggling of drugs from Odisha. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said they are yet to arrest the transporters involved but raids are being carried out in different areas.According to the police, the drug trade has increased manifold in the last five years and consignments are mostly routed from Odisha. Earlier the peddlers used to get it from Punjab but discontinued the practice due to the strict checks at the borders. Sangwan said that transporters sending consignments to Odisha tie up with drug peddlers and get drugs loaded while returning. “The transporter gets enough money and the drivers are paid a hefty amount if they successfully smuggle the drug consignment to the destination. Later, the consignment is delivered to different parts of the state,” he said. The police said that some transporters got involved in smuggling of drugs about two years ago after the increase in marijuana price in Haryana. A pack of 10 grams used to be illegally sold for ₹100 but now it is sold for ₹500. There are allegedly more than 500 drug peddlers who travel to Odisha from Haryana. “They used to smuggle drugs in tourist buses, cabs, trains and even on motorbikes but since the checking has intensified they are finding new ways to smuggle and make a quick buck. However, we are taking strict measures and have increased the deployment on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway and other border areas. Teams have been asked to check all trucks and other suspicious vehicles,” he said. The drivers are given new mobile phones and SIM cards and the peddlers are constantly in touch with them until they reach their destination, the police said. The police said this is a challenge as it becomes difficult for them to trace the suspects. The police said the drivers are paid between ₹2 lakh and ₹6 lakh per consignment depending on the quantity of drugs. Sangwan said the two suspects arrested on Monday —Bhupinder Singh and the co-driver, Omji Singh — are residents of Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh and were lured with money as they used to hardly get ₹10,000 per trip. For transporting the consignment, however, they were offered ₹4 lakh. “They have revealed that there are more drivers on the route who are also involved in drug smuggling and, many times, the dhaba staff approach them and offer them deals to smuggle drugs to different areas,” he said adding that this was their first consignment to Hisar. In 2019, police registered 225 cases and arrested 375 people allegedly involved in drug smuggling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/26-transporters-under-scanner-for-involvement-in-drug-trade/story-hI8lJYMGIaRTZfwdDDyAjJ.html
05-01-2021||Gurugram||Sporadic rainfall keeps air quality satisfactory, to dip again soon||Sporadic showers continued in the city for the third consecutive day on Tuesday, persevering its cleansing effort on the city’s air by retaining the air quality in the satisfactory zone for a second consecutive day. However, experts said that the relief will be short-lived as temperatures are expected to dip again from January 7.As per the data shared by the district administration, Gurugram district received between 11 to 17mm of rainfall until 8am on January 5.Among the tehsils (administrative division) in the area, Gurugram received the least rainfall, at 11mm, followed by Sohna (12mm), Pataudi (14mm), Wazirabad (15mm) and Farrukhnagar (17mm), as per the data.The automatic weather station (AWS) in Gurugram did not record the day’s minimum and maximum temperature readings, but data from the IMD’s nearest AWS in Delhi’s Palam area showed the minimum temperature to be at 14.4 degrees Celsius, up from 12.3 degrees Celsius on Monday, and the maximum to be at 19.2 degrees Celsius, down from 20.4 degrees Celsius the day prior, on Tuesday.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) seven-day forecast for Gurugram predicts a steep drop in temperature from January 7. From a predicted minimum and maximum temperature readings of 13 degrees Celsius and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively, on January 6, the mercury is expected to drop to a minimum of 9 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 19 degrees Celsius on January 7.“Cloudy skies will help trap the temperature for another day. Thursday onwards, we will have clearer conditions in Delhi-NCR. There is also a lot of moisture in the atmosphere after these rains, and once the clouds have passed, the heat will also dissipate much quicker. The residual moisture will drive down the minimum temperature more sharply, and there will be periods of dense fog in the mornings for about a week,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.This phenomenon will also cause air quality to deteriorate rapidly, said experts.While the city saw satisfactory air for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, with a reading of 83 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, experts said that the AQI would return to the upper end of the very poor category within a week.“Already, wind speeds have slowed down from 20kmph on the weekend, to just about 6 to 8kmph on Tuesday. When the temperature falls, wind speeds will become negligible and particles will remain suspended due to residual moisture. This will result in an airlock over NCR, and pollutants will accumulate with little chance of dispersal,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sporadic-rainfall-keeps-air-quality-satisfactory-to-dip-again-soon/story-Hj4JXT94Ii5OTqJluAOszM.html
05-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram reports lowest daily Covid-19 cases since May 2020||The city on Tuesday reported 35 new Covid-19 cases over the last 24 hours, marking the lowest daily tally in seven months. It was in May 2020, during the nationwide lockdown, that the daily case count was lower, with 33 infections being reported on May 26.At present, Gurugram has 785 active cases, which has decreased due to the constant decline in cases. The total tally has reached 57,083, with the Covid-19 toll at 344.Prior to May 26, when 33 cases were recorded, daily infections ranged between six and 17. As transmission started increasing with more number of people contracting the virus, the number of new infections escalated, reaching almost 1,000 cases a day in November. In the last 10 days, fewer than 100 cases are being reported every day. The test positivity rate — positives out of the total samples — remained between 2% to 2.5% last week, well below the threshold of 5% recommended by the World Health Organisation. In comparison, the positivity rate in May 2020 was almost 9.4%, which increased to almost 23% in June. It dropped to nearly 5% in July and August and again climbed to 10% in October, and more than 12% in November, and then dipping to 5% in December 2020. Maintaining the consistent stability in positivity rate — which indicates the spread is slow enough — the health department has reduced the number of Covid-19 tests per day. On Tuesday, about 2,824 tests were administered, of which only 261 were rapid antigen. Compared to May 2020, when only 200 tests were conducted every day, there has been almost 92% increase in the overall testing. In the initial months of the pandemic, only Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was being conducted. The rapid antigen testing started in June. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “The active caseload is consistently dropping. Therefore, testing has been reduced but we are continuing with our testing camps to keep a control over the situation.” With the continuous decline in new daily infections, the recovery rate has exceeded 98%, as per the health department data. Of the 785 active cases, at least 83 are seriously-ill patients admitted to hospitals, while three are in Covid care centres and 699 in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-reports-lowest-daily-covid-19-cases-since-may-2020/story-RKjWV6sYUkRen2HnRvpCPK.html
05-01-2021||Gurugram||Biodiversity park at Sakatpur put on the back burner due to failed plantation drive||More than a year after the forest department first began plantation work in Sakatpur village, to create a biodiversity park across 1,000 acres, the project has made little headway, with officials confirming that it is currently on the back burner. Officials said that a botched plantation drive, which is now the subject of a departmental inquiry, is the reason why the project failed to kick off.The proposed city forest in the Aravalli foothills of Sakatpur, Gairatpur Bas and Sikohpur villages was to be the largest in Gurugram, nearly three times the size of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Nathupur. It was announced in July 2019 at an RWA-related event in the city by the then forest minister, Rao Narbir Singh. The park was also intended to be a tourist attraction, with pedestrian trails, an education centre, and even a leopard safari for which a detailed project report was being prepared.A senior official in the forest department, requesting anonymity, said that these plans are unlikely to materialise soon. “We began planting saplings in the area in August 2019, but there was no separate fund created for the park. So we went ahead and planted species that were not very well adapted to survive in the area, such as papdi and neem, which are bred in our nurseries. None of the saplings survived. We are not actively pursuing the project right now. We will take it up next year.”The failed plantation drive is now being examined by an internal committee of the forest department. An official, who is serving on the committee, requesting anonymity, said, “We are yet to give our decision in the matter. The initial plantation drive was a failure. There was no baseline ecological study done of the area, no proper demarcation, no wildlife surveys. This should have been attempted with proper planning. There are plans to revisit this next year, but the leopard safari proposal will not be revived.” Vasvi Tyagi, the principal chief conservator of forests, declined to comment. She did, however, confirm the veracity of these developments, as did Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA). Yadav, who was the district forest officer (DFO) when this project was announced, said, “The initiative started off the wrong way. We did not have any means to procure native saplings, so we used tall trees like neem and papdi which did not survive. We should have, instead, planted species like dhau or dhak, which are better suited to the dry Aravalli conditions. The forest department committee has not yet held any officials responsible. They will decide on the future of the project.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/biodiversity-park-at-sakatpur-put-on-the-back-burner-due-to-failed-plantation-drive/story-JoYSAXFhZQOlP3SWduaSlM.html
05-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram gears up for vaccination dry run||The six session sites identified for a dry run of the Covid-19 vaccination on January 7 will be set up as model sites, along with a facility to track adverse reactions, besides three basic rooms — for waiting, vaccination and observation — according to the district health department officials.“Once the vaccine is rolled out, there can be chances some sites will lack ample space to set up an additional Adverse Reaction Following Immunisation (AEFI) room in urban and rural areas. In the drive itself, we are trying to put a system in place that will be a completely sufficient model that would be helpful in setting up other sites in the coming time,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer. The drill is a part of the preparedness to identify the challenges and logistics arrangements before the actual Covid-19 vaccination that is likely to start next week. The department has chosen primary schools for the dry run so that the routine work at the urban primary health centres is not disrupted. These are government primary schools in Wazirabad, Daulatabad, Basai Enclave and Chauma. A community centre and a primary health centre in Sector 56 (Tigra) have also been identified as session sites. In each of these sites, a waiting room, a vaccination room and an observation room will be set up. “Only for better management is an AEFI room is being set up, where people who might develop minor symptoms like swelling, rashes or low blood pressure due to vaccination can be treated. For this, an examination table, bed, required medicines and instruments will be kept in the room,” Singh said.On January 7, from 11am to 1pm, the dry run will be held simultaneously at the six centres. “It will be a physical verification exercise to check space, logistics, internet connectivity, electricity and safety at the session sites,” he said. In a meeting with the state administration on Tuesday, senior district officials said that each site will work like an exact vaccination site, where coordination between vaccination officers and focus upon infection prevention and control at site will be seen.He said that vaccinators and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), who will deployed in vaccination rooms and observation rooms as vaccination officers 3 and 4, are trained in all aspects. According to him, Gurugram police have agreed to provide six personnel to serve as for vaccination officer 1. The administration is providing six data entry operators, who will be vaccination officer 2, from Saral centres to feed the data on the Co-WIN. Singh said that the drill is crucial to test working of Co-WIN platform, a real time digital platform having all details of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-gears-up-for-vaccination-dry-run/story-PJrqtGfIm7Sr7vCjMWKrQI.html
05-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Doctor duped of her jewellery by man in traffic police uniform||A man dressed as a traffic policeman and his accomplice robbed a 55-year-old woman of her jewellery on Tuesday morning near sector 19, said police. They had managed to swap her jewellery with artificial ones.The victim was identified as Madhu Bhatia, a doctor and resident of sector 20. According to her complaint, she was on her way to work in a cab when the incident occurred.“Around 10 am my cab was stopped on the sector 19-20 road by two (masked) men, one of whom was wearing the uniform of the traffic police. They were on an unmarked black motorcycle. They told me that there had been a murder in the area yesterday and as a precaution, senior officials had instructed them to ask public not to wear jewellery and (if they saw anyone wearing some), they were told to get it off and place it in envelopes,” read the woman’s complaint.When she doubted their claims of being traffic policemen, they allegedly showed an ID card that made her believe them to be true. Upon their insistence, she said, she handed over her diamond bangles, which they made a show of wrapping in paper and returned it to her. Immediately, she unwrapped it to find that she had been duped but by then the suspects had fled and the cab driver could not spot them either, she claimed in the complaint.The complaint was filed with the sector 20 police and, based on it, a case was registered against the unidentified suspects under section 420 (cheating) and 379 (punishment for theft) of the Indian Penal Code.“We are on the lookout for the suspects. They were masked and the motorcycle did not have a number plate. But a probe is underway and we are looking through CCTV footage of cameras in the area,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer, sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-doctor-duped-of-her-jewellery-by-man-in-traffic-police-uniform/story-lWsE8TurpKvmBRBhcmzDqI.html
05-01-2021||Bangalore||All 118 BJP MLAs expressed faith in Yediyurappa’s leadership: Karnataka ministers||All 118 BJP MLAs in Karnataka have expressed faith and support for Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and his leadership, Ministers in the state cabinet said on Tuesday, while asserting that the government was stable.Several ministers of Yediyurappa cabinet on Tuesday jointly spoke to the media at the end of the CM’s region wise meetings with party MLAs since Monday. “All the 118 legislators are of the opinion that the Yediyurappa government has functioned effectively.All have expressed their support for his leadership..they have expressed satisfaction in the work he has done,” Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, flanked by other cabinet colleagues, said.Speaking to reporters here after two days of marathon region wise meeting with MLAs by the Chief Minister in the presence of BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel, he said legislators have lauded efficient and able administration despite COVID and flood situation and its management.“I thank all the MLAs, as all of them have expressed their faith in the government and its leadership,” he added.Another Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Ministers ST Somashekar, V Somanna, B Sriramulu, Shashikala Jolle were among those present in the joint briefing.There has been simmering discontentment among a section of legislators on the functioning of the government and certain ministers, to address which Yediyurappa is said to have called for region wise meeting of MLAs, even as speculation within the BJP circles about possible leadership change refuses to die down.During the meeting on Monday, Yediyurappa reportedly had a face-off with Vijayapura City MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, as he reportedly raised objections against the “step-motherly” treatment meted out to some assembly constituencies and alleged interference of CM’s son B Y Vijayendra in administration.Yatnal had been vocal against Yediyurappa’s style of functioning and had even predicted his removal as CM in the past.Conceding that at the meeting yesterday there was a “small confusion” because of one person, without taking Yatnal’s name, Karjol said other than that, the meetings went on well and all MLAs have expressed faith and support in the Chief Minister’s leadership.Responding to a question on Yatnal’s recent open statements and conduct, Minister V Somanna said state party president Nalin Kumar Katteel had yesterday spoken about it and he has sent a message in this regard to the Centre.“Whatever has to happen will happen at the right time...the Chief Minister is the captain of the government... as his colleague I condemn whatever happened yesterday,” he said.Karjol said tduring the meeting MLAs discussed developmental works and sought allocation of more funds to their constituencies, especially those affected by floods.He said the Chief Minister assured them that efforts will be made to allocate about Rs 25 crore for each constituency for development of roads and other critical infrastructure. He also assured more funds for developmental works in the days to come as the financial situation improves.The CM, who also holds the finance portfolio, has told MLAs the budget that will be presented in February or March, will be focused on development, he added.DCM Savadi said MLAs wanted ministers to stay put in office in Vidhana Soudha at least for two days a week for their meeting, and expressed serious reservations against MLAs or leaders making public statements on party affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/all-118-bjp-mlas-expressed-faith-in-yediyurappa-s-leadership-karnataka-ministers/story-4oOvrNkcAFSxqprnsg5XUN.html

05-01-2021||City||Ludhiana’s Focal Point CETP runs into rough weather for want of power connection||The 40MLD Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) project being set up for the Focal Point dyeing industry has hit a roadblock due to the non-availability of a power connection to run the plant.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had set December 31, 2020, as the deadline to complete the project, but the plant has not been made operational till now due to the absence of a power connection. Though trials have been commenced.Industrialists alleged that a 1,500KW connection is required to run the plant but the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) officials claim that only 500KW connection is available at present due to excessive load on the power substation.The PSPCL officials said that it may take a few months to upgrade the connection load, as per the demands of the industry.A member of the Punjab Dyers Association, Focal Point, Rahul Verma said, “The PSPCL had even allotted the power connection for the CETP in the past, but when we approached the authorities for connection after the plant was established, the authorities said that the substation cannot take the load of 1500KW connection and the system needs to be enhanced.”“Trials are going on at the plant and a 500KW connection will be good for the test runs but we will be needing a 1500KW connection to run the plant at full capacity. We have also taken up the matter with the PPCB officials,” said Verma. PSPCL chief engineer (Ludhiana central) Bhupinder Khosla said, “The industry will get a partial load of 500KW and the load capacity will be increased as per the demand which will be put forward by the industry as per the norms.”The total cost of the project is Rs 80 crores, of which Rs 22.5 crores is provided by the state government and the Centre as a subsidy. The CETPs are being established to stop the dumping of untreated waste of the dyeing industry into the Buddha Nullah through the MC sewer lines.Tajpur road CETP to be ready by March 31The PPCB officials said that the deadline for the 50 MLD CETP project for the dyeing industry situated on Tajpur road has been extended till March 31 citing a delay in payment of subsidies to the industry by the government.

05-01-2021||Dehradun||Congress’ Harish Rawat demands Bharat Ratna for Sonia Gandhi, Mayawati||Congress national general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat demanded the government of India to confer Bharat Ratna to Congress national president Sonia Gandhi and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati. Rawat made the demand by taking to social media wherein he said that “Sonia Gandhi and Mayawati made immense contribution towards women empowerment.”“Both Sonia Gandhi and Mayawati are eminent politicians. One may agree or disagree with Gandhi’s politics but can’t deny her tremendous contribution in woman empowerment and public service. Today, she is considered as an admirable image of womanhood in India,” said Rawat. “Similarly, Mayawati has raised the voice of the oppressed and the exploited, apart from instilling a sense of belief in them. The government of India should honour them by conferring Bharat Ratna to both this year,” he said.The state BSP leadership has, however, termed his demand as a “tactic to befool public.”Also read: India may have to make choices on arms deals, says outgoing US envoy“His demand is just a tactic to befool the public and nothing more than that. Erstwhile Congress governments failed to confer the highest honour to Dalit icon Babasaheb Ambedkar. It was only conferred after BSP founder Kashiram Sahu and other BSP leaders, including Mayawati raised the demand,” said Gautam.He added, “We have been demanding the same honour for Kashiram Sahu also but when Congress was in power it didn’t pay any heed to it. Now, when they are not in power they are making such demands.”The state BJP also countered Rawat’s demand of Bharat Ratna for Sonia Gandhi, saying, Rawat wants to “set a wrong precedent by awarding country’s highest honour to someone who is facing court cases.”“By conferring Bharat Ratna to Sonia Gandhi, does Rawat want that the honour should be given to someone who is on bail? What sort of precedent he wants to set by putting such a demand? It will never happen,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/congress-harish-rawat-demands-bharat-ratna-for-sonia-gandhi-mayawati/story-SaTcgZGdDZrCC6HQABuFiJ.html
05-01-2021||City||Six dogs found poisoned on banks of Pavana in Pimple Gurav||PUNE A man found at least six dogs, including his own pet, dead in the Pimple Gurav area of Pimpri- Chinchwad, early on Monday morning.The corpses, one of them allegedly partially charred, were found on the banks of the Pavana river in Pimple Gurav. The corpses were allegedly frothing from the mouth. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Vinod Rajan Murar (50), a resident of Shivneri Colony in Pimple Gurav.“My dog came home yesterday (Monday) morning and looked completely drained. We gave him water and took him upstairs, and he stopped breathing within minutes. We then discovered one female who was barely a year old near the river and four other dogs who were lying dead in the vicinity. I suspect that someone has given them something poisonous to eat,” said Murar.The dogs were all Indian local breeds. While the 5-year-old male was a pet in the care of Murar, the others were street dogs, he said.“One of them was the mother was frothing from the mouth, so were the other dogs. One other female, black in colour, was found in a white sack with her body partially burnt,” added Murar.The activists blamed the Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporation for the spread of dogs.“I blame this entirely on the corporation; it is their very bad implementation of the animal birth control programme. The corporation bodies keep on flouting the rules even after the sterilisation programme is conducted on one street, some people from corporations will relocate female dogs on the same street. Till such illegal activity does not stop such incidence will keep on happening. Neither PMC or PCMC have an animal birth control community which is a must for all the corporations according to the Animal Welfare Board of India,” said Vineeta Tandon, co- founder and trustee, Animal Rescue Trust.“It was unexpected, the reason is still not known, but generally people who are frustrated due to dog activities in their area they take such steps. People should consult NGOs who can help to solve their problems, but in haste they end up poisoning dogs which is not a right solution,” said Sumit Tarte, animal rights activist, Animal Adoption and Rescue Team.A case under Sections 427, 429 of Indian Penal Code along with Section 11(1)(L) of Animal Cruelty Prevention Act has been registered at Sangvi police station on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-dogs-found-poisoned-on-banks-of-pavana-in-pimple-gurav/story-JE4xjl0z4LqzGfm5icy1YK.html

05-01-2021||Delhi||Pollution watchdog CPCB seeks solution to high ammonia content in Yamuna within 1 month||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has constituted a study group to suggest solutions for increase in ammoniacal nitrogen in the Yamuna. The study group will comprise of Delhi Jal Board (DJB), Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Irrigation and Water Resources departments of Haryana and Delhi.The group will review the current monitoring protocol and requirement of strengthening monitoring mechanism, analyse past data and carry out field surveys to identify hotspots of high ammonia.The study group has been asked to submit its report within a month.CPCB convened a meeting on January 4, with the officials of Delhi and Haryana to discuss the recurring issue of increase in Ammoniacal Nitrogen in the Yamuna and short and long term remedial actions required.It was agreed at the meeting to constitute a joint surveillance squad comprising DJB, DPCC, Irrigation and Flood Control Departments of Delhi and Haryana.Officials said the possible reasons for high ammoniacal nitrogen could be discharge of untreated sewage from upstream towns in Haryana, discharge from industrial units, common effluent treatment plants (CETPs), sewage treatment plants (STPs), illegal discharge of sewage from unsewered colonies in outer Delhi through tankers, lean flow in the Yamuna and anaerobic decomposition of accumulated sludge on the riverbed.“High ammoniacal nitrogen in the Yamuna is mainly a result of untreated waste water from industries in Panipat and Sonepat. We don’t need a high level group to understand this. The industries need to be checked from releasing untreated waste. The government is only trying to buy time by setting up study groups. The other obvious problem is there is no water in Yamuna so only polluted water is entering the river and it has no way of getting diluted,” said Manoj Misra, convenor, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.Ammonia is one of several forms of nitrogen that exist in aquatic environments. Unlike other forms of nitrogen, which can cause nutrient over-enrichment of a water body at elevated concentrations and indirect effects on aquatic life, ammonia causes direct toxic effects on aquatic life according to the US Environment Protection Agency. Ammonia is mainly produced for commercial fertilizers and other industrial applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-watchdog-cpcb-seeks-solution-to-high-ammonia-content-in-yamuna-within-1-month/story-J4SPebi2OGgD71niln6t8O.html

While on one hand the Pune civic body got a good response to its amnesty scheme and increased its property tax collection, no one, so far, has availed of the loan facility. The PMC has extended its amnesty on property tax up to January 26, 2021 and is offering a 70 per cent rebate on the penalty amount. Standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane called on banks to help the corporation by providing bank facilities to taxpayers. After his appeal, five co-operative banks came forward to provide loans to taxpayers to pay their dues. The civic body has also formed a special cell to coordinate between banks and taxpayers. Vilas Kanade joint municipal commissioner, property tax department, said, “PMC is getting a response slowly. People are coming to enquire about loan facilities. Our officials are providing the information.” At present, Suvarna Sahakari bank, Janata Sahakari bank, Suvarnayug Sahakari bank, Janata Sahakari Bank and Saraswat co-operative bank are offering loans to tax payers. Baban Kasbe, an official of the Property tax department, who is part of the loan cell of PMC said, “Thirty people came to enquire about the loan facility. However, only one tax holder has put in a proposal to Saraswat bank to pay Rs 12 lakh in dues. He is residing in Hadapsar and his dues are for a commercial property. The proposal has reached the final stage. People who have a due amount more than one lakh rupees are coming to inquire about the scheme. We are providing logistical support to taxpayers who are keen to pay dues to PMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-s-loan-for-property-tax-offer-finds-no-takers-yet/story-5YuxvGo0aSmWqhnjDMWodL.html

05-01-2021||City||Maha-Metro MD backs “neo Metro” option on BRTS routes||PUNE Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (Maha-Metro) managing director, Brijesh Dixit, is strongly backing the introduction and use of the “neo Metro” transit option on the BRTS (bus rapid transit routes) in the city.Recently, Pumta (Pune unified metropolitan transport authority) discussed the introduction of the automobile system, known colloquially in India as “Neo Metros” on the existing BRTS corridors in Pune.Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) chairman and managing director, Rajendra Jagtap, put this proposal before Pumta.Dixit said, “Bus transit is better as long as the per-hour passenger flow is up to 4,000 citizens. Metro is for 12,000 commuters per hour. Considering that, Neo Metro is the solution for passenger flow between 4,000 and 12,000. It can be converted into a metro if the passengers flow increases.”Dixit said, “Most of Pune’s corridors have passenger flow of more than 4,000 passengers per hour and if the bus service continues on these routes, it creates traffic jams. Neo Metro is the new solution to cater this issue.The Neo Metro proposal was for the Swargate to Katraj corridor. We also prepared an underground metro proposal for this route, but elected members need to take decision on it. There are other BRTS corridors in the city which can get converted in to Neo Metro routes.”Dixit added, “The Neo Metro model had been approved at the national level. We introduced it in Nashik city and then adopted it in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Now many cities at the national level are obtaining this new solution. It is hybrid model in between the metro and a bus service, with lower infrastructure cost. In short, it is a metro on wheels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maha-metro-md-backs-neo-metro-option-on-brts-routes/story-3xf9MogceyqY9JHjcrxKKP.html

05-01-2021||Pune||Outbreak crisis turned job losers into entrepreneurs in Pune||Pune: While the nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak left many without jobs and no income, some have turned the adversity into opportunity. Filled with the spirit to not give up, they have come up with different ways to sustain this financial bind. Civil engineer-turned- spice master Rahul Nimbalkar and security guard-turned-tea entrepreneur Revan Shinde are two such successful stories. After losing his job as a security guard just before the pandemic hit, 28-year-old Shinde launched his startup to deliver hot fresh tea on people’s doorstep. His venture “Abhimanyu” started with little investment now gives a profit of Rs 55,000- Rs 60,000 per month. He supplies tea and coffee to corporate offices and industrial workers. “After losing the job, I knew I had to do something about it. Most of the employees in offices need tea throughout the day. Amid lockdown, when offices were reopening in phases, staff were scared to go to their regular tea stalls because of the fear of virus spread. I filled the gap by bringing hot hygienic tea to them instead.” Armed with masks, sanitisers, thermos brimming with hot brewed tea, Shinde hit the roads of Pimpri-Chinchwad giving tea to passers-by. He started by supplying tea for free to many offices proving to them that the cuppa was prepared by following all safety measures. He got his clients hooked onto the tea and converted them into regulars. He now has a monthly contract with over 70 offices. According to Shinde, one can order tea by calling him and the hot beverage will be hand delivered within minutes. Now, five persons work under Shinde. “I was working with Shinde at his last job as a security guard. After the job loss, I had no way to feed my family. This new opportunity has saved my family from running into debt,” said Shantaram Navgire, 40, who is working with Shinde. Rahul Nimbalkar, a farmer from Belmachi village in Wai taluka, lost his job as a civil engineer in Pune after the lockdown left him stuck in his village. The 32-year-old started helping his father in turmeric farming. Tired of traders’ arbitrariness, Rahul decided to sell the spice on his own. “We have been growing turmeric for the last seven years. I would help my father in farming on and off, but never paid attention to the monetary side of the trade. This year, however, I noticed that farmers were extorted by traders and middlemen and they ended up getting less profit for their product. The payments were always late and very low. After taking family into confidence, I decided to start my business,” said Nimbalkar, owner of Anand Halad Powder. Nimbalkar started supplying packaged turmeric all over the country. Now, he gets inquiries from abroad and has also supplied spices to the United States. “Social media helped us. We get orders from all over the country through Facebook and WhatsApp. People started sharing about our brand online and that helped us sell around 750kgs of turmeric in the first 100 days of our business,” said Nimbalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/outbreak-crisis-turned-job-losers-into-entrepreneurs-in-pune/story-i3teeZ1NSw8OM5bSZ56jMN.html

The test report identifies Avian Influenza subtype H5N8 in the birds, which according to experts, is less infectious. The death of birds is spreading at an alarming speed across Rajasthan. Till Tuesday morning, the tally had reached 625 from 16 of 33 districts. The state has sent 86 samples for testing from 11 districts. Agriculture and animal husbandry minister Lal Chand Kataria said the samples sent from three districts are found positive for Avian Influenza. This virus is spreading in other states also and it is a matter of concern, especially amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “The virus has not affected chickens or eggs yet but all precautions are being taken, looking at the way it has spread among crows. But the positive news is that the samples from Jodhpur have come out negative. Samples from Jhalawar, Kota and Baran have come positive,”he said. Also read: Budget Session likely from January 29, Union Budget on February 1The minister said the area where the flu is found will be sanitised as done for Covid-19. “There will be no ban on the sale of eggs as no impact of flu is found on poultry. Looking to possibilities, awareness is created in advance among the poultry owners and people,” he said. Kataria said the issue is that the state doesn’t have a laboratory to conduct tests and the samples are sent outside. “We want to establish a lab to avoid any delay and have spoken to the government,” he added. Department principal secretary Kunji Lal Meena said only the laboratory in Bhopal is accredited by the government to conduct tests for such diseases. The government has agreed in-principal to encourage regional labs – a proposal to setup one in Jaipur will be sent today. The state has the expertise to run such labs. On the type of flu variant found in state, department secretary Arushi Malik said it is found to be Avian Influenza subtype H5N8, which is not dangerous for people but precautions need to be taken.

The government is also considering sealing Madhya Pradesh border for poultry transportation,” he said. Microbiologist Dr AK Kataria said the virus strain H5N8 is not fatal for humans and only H5N1 is known to be dangerous which leads to pneumonia. The strains, which are considered to be highly pathogenic, are N1, N2, N5, N6 and N9. “The situation can be dealt opting required precautions such as burying dead birds three feet down and away from water sources,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/bird-flu-samples-from-rajasthan-s-kota-baran-found-positive-over-600-birds-dead/story-ovMEtS4LdEwcyqBvcKotLO.html

However, this year, cue Covid-19 last year, it has not happened. Extended rainfall delayed cultivation and production. Therefore, the price was high in the pick of the season November and December. In the Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani and Wai belt of Satara district, 4,000 farmers produce strawberries. Balasaheb Bhilare, head of the Strawberry Growers Association of Maharashtra, said, “The rate of strawberry is Rs 250 per kg . The rate is high as compared to last year. Due to late cultivation, the fruit has come late into the market. The latest cloudy conditions affected fruit quality and size. Production is not up to the mark. Next month the price will drop as other seasonal fruits like grapes, apples, and watermelon will come into the market,” he said. At least 80 per cent of the year’s strawberry crop in India comes from Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra); while rest comes from Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. Arvind More, a wholesaler of fruits in Market Yard said, “We sell strawberries in two-kg and one-kg boxes. Size and quality changes the rate. The top quality starts from Rs 200 per box to Rs 350 per box, per kg. There are three types of quality based on size - small, medium and jumbo.” At present, Pune is receiving its maximum quantity of strawberries from Nashik, Bhor and Velha districts. “Normally, the Pune market gets five to six tonnes of strawberries. Right now, we are getting only two tones of strawberries per day,” More added. According to the Strawberry Growers Association of Maharashtra, farmers this year, cultivated only 60 per cent of their usual layout. “Of the total 4,000 acres of farming land, farmers cultivated strawberries only on 2,500 acres of land fearing market uncertainty, bad weather and losses thereof,” an association member said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/strawberry-supply-dwindles-cost-shoots-up-tp-rs-250-kg/story-BUe71BH03VUO1RTOJZtcaI.html

05-01-2021||City||46 lakh trees in the city... and counting; Pune tree census could get city past Bengaluru for no of trees||PUNE The geo-enabled tree census being conducted by Pune the Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now covered as many as 46 lakh trees in the city, even as the private agency conducting the census claims that a “few more” trees are yet to be counted. The PMC had allocated the tender for the tree census to SAAR IT Resources in 2016. According to the Environment Status Report (2019-2020) released by PMC, the census of 41,94,623 trees had been completed, while by the end of 2020, the number has gone up to 46 lakh. During the tree census conducted in 2013, PMC had counted 38.60 trees in the city, which has 350 sq km area and a population of 35 lakh, as per the 2011 census. PMC’s boundary has been extended twice after the tree census began in the city. In 2017, the state government merged 11 villages with the PMC, while recently the process of including 23 more villages into the civic limits has been cleared by the state government. The number of trees in PMC limits is expected to rise exponentially as the tree census in these newly merged villages has not been done yet. Also, apart from these 46 lakhs trees, over three lakh trees from the old limits of the city are yet to be included in the census, said officials from PMC and SAAR IT. “We have now completed the census of 46 lakhs trees in the city. There are 3-4 lakhs trees yet to be included. Right now we do not have any idea by how much this number will grow once we complete the census from these newly merged villages,” said Guruswami Tumale assistant garden superintendent, PMC. According to the officials from SAAR IT, most of the work related to the census was completed in 2018. Due to administrative approvals some patches of census work remain, expected to be finished in the next six months. “Till now we have completed the census of 46 lakh trees in PMC limits. Due to approvals and permissions census of 2-3 lakh trees is remaining. Some properties are closed permanently. Owners are abroad. We can’t go in there to complete the work. Some patches are still to be included. We hope to complete this work in the next six months. I don’t have any idea about the tree census in the newly merged villages. Maybe PMC will float another tender,” said Yogesh Kute, head of geospatial, SAAR IT Resources.“We have the data of a lot of cities. We all know Bengaluru as the green city. If the tree census of these newly added 34 villages is done then Pune will surpass Bangalore,” Kute said. Experts cite many reasons behind Pune’s leap in the number of trees that exist in the city. “Punekars are more aware now. We conduct a lot of tree plantation drives across the hills in Pune. We emphasize the plantations of diverse tree species. We are preparing a budget proposal for the 2020-2021. We aim to complete the tree census of these newly included villages as soon as possible,” said Sandip Kale, nominated member of Vruksha Pradhikaran, PMC||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/46-lakh-trees-in-the-city-and-counting-pune-tree-census-could-get-city-past-bengaluru-for-no-of-trees/story-nx7TBKtSVRTu0nAaIm6T3N.html

As the post of the headmaster is lying vacant for the last few months, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Multipurpose, Navdeep Romana, has been handling the additional charge of the school, apart from the science teacher. After the teacher informed Romana about her Covid test result on Monday night, the latter informed the health department, who asked the teacher to remain in home quarantine for 14 days. The school has been shut down and 11 other teachers have been tested at the civil hospital. Meanwhile, the students of Classes 9 and 10 have been directed to stay at home and revise their syllabus. Romana said a clerk of GHS, Lakkar Bazaar, visited the multipurpose school for some official work recently. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, all their teachers will also get themselves tested.Earlier on January 3, some teachers of the high school were also deputed at the senior secondary school as invigilators for the Punjab State Talent Search Examination. District education officer, elementary-cum-secondary, Rajinder Kaur said, “The teachers, who have been tested, have been asked to stay isolated till the results arrive. Students who came in contact with the teacher concerned should also get themselves tested.” Over the past four months, two principals, 16 teachers, one clerk and a mid-day meal worker at 10 schools have been found infected. Among them were four teachers and a mid-day meal cook at Government Senior Secondary School, Manak Majra, who tested positive in December last year. The same month, three teachers of Government High School, Kailash Nagar, were also found positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-school-in-ludhiana-sealed-as-officiating-in-charge-tests-positive/story-4UwVx0gyWImEEvdyqGW1SN.html
05-01-2021||City||‘At the Pune railway station I personally conduct inspections on regular basis’||PUNE Renu Sharma, divisional railway manager (DRM) of Pune railway division speaks about the division’s work last year and its plans for future. When you look back at 2020, what major achievements do believe the Pune railway division has achieved? Safety of the train operations was our main focus. Railway track maintenance and improvement in signalling systems were some of the focus areas we worked hard on last year. As passenger trains were not running during lockdown, so we used our funds accordingly, more for development of our railway tracks and stations than passenger amenities. Overall, train operations and train punctuality improved in the last one year. At present, our focus is on loading of goods. Passenger trains are few, but we are taking all the necessary safety precautions related Covid at the stations. We followed all the guidelines given by the central and state government regarding the train operations. Safety information is displayed at each and every railway station and inside the trains, related to Covid. There was not a single unsafe incident on the railway tracks in the division last year. We voluntarily gave some optional services at the Pune railway station like luggage sanitation machines, face masks, hand sanitisers and other safety equipment for passengers. It is not compulsory for passengers, those who need it they can buy it at the station before travelling. What works were carried out by the division during the lockdown period? As passenger train operations were less, we are now focusing on maintenance and safety works. In this, we have recently completed the work of overhauling of 24 level crossing (LC) gates. For 11 LC gates we inserted boxes for subway roads and at four locations girders were replaced by concrete slabs. Apart from that, the doubling of railway tracks is going on at full speed across the division on various routes. While Pune to Kolhapur electrification work is on, it will be complete this year, 2021. At the Pune railway station I personally conduct inspections on regular basis. We are doing repairing and maintenance of circulating areas and platforms. Also flooring work at the platform No 1 is going on and new benches for passengers are being installed. For safety, we have stopped the entry from the ramp coming inside the station from the main chowk. When passenger movement gradually increases, then that entry gate will be opened as per requirement. What would be your appeal to passengers using the Pune railway station? As the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us a lot about personal hygiene and safety precautions, so every passenger needs to maintain social distance and wear a face mask while travelling by train. Only those people should come to the railway stations that are required to come, or are travelling. Avoid unnecessary crowding. It is our responsibility to keep our railway station and environment clean. Often we see people don’t have common civic sense. The railway station and the trains are our own property, our country’s property and we should treat it properly and keep it clean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-the-pune-railway-station-i-personally-conduct-inspections-on-regular-basis/story-907r6T9dI9v802jwG5CVCM.html
05-01-2021||City||Pune railway division’s business development units keep cash inflows on track||PUNE In a bid to improve train operations and facilities for passengers travelling from the Pune railway division, several new projects were undertaken in 2020. Right from the redevelopment of stations, to completing the electrification work of the Pune–Kolhapur section and working on track safety measures - all were undertaken done by the Pune railway division in 2020.“2020 has been a tough year for all of us due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but we looked at it as an opportunity to develop and improve our infrastructure, and passenger facilities under our division. Accordingly, various works and projects were undertaken. Some were completed, some are in progress and some are proposed. We redeveloped nine major stations in our division last year with improvements in lighting, a building for special toilets, a goods shed and installation of steel benches at all 72 stations in our division. Booking office augmentation was completed at five stations and most importantly, doubling of railway tracks on three major routes is done,” said Renu Sharma, Pune divisional railway manager.Over the last year seven stations platform were fully covered, four new foot overbridges (FOBs) were completed, at eight stations, high-level platforms were built, and at the Pune, Pimpri and Kolhapur stations escalators were installed; at the Miraj station a lift was installed. The Pune railway division has in place infrastructure to provide free Wi-Fi service at 72 stations. As passengers trains were stopped during the lockdown, the division focused on goods transport for revenue generation, for which, the division set-up business development units (BDUs). “These BDUs are for aggressive marketing to boost freight and parcel loading of railways. This unit consisting of senior officers interacts frequently with traders and industry to generate more traffic and revenue for railways. We have identified several goods sheds across the division to allow for traders to work. Also waggon repairing and maintenance work is going on. Our officials approach the traders and other logistic companies to get more trade. This project work is going on a big level now, and whomever we meet - industrial people, politicians or traders - we first tell them about BDU trade. The main reason behind this BDU project is to improve the earnings of the railways which has suffered allot due to Covid-19 pandemic.” added Sharma. Talking about the Pune division work and passengers requirement, Harsha Shah, president, Railway Pravasi Group, said, “Last year passengers trains were stopped due to Covid-19 pandemic, but now train operations are increasing and accordingly, the passenger crowd is seen at the railway stations. Considering this, railways now need to work as per the new normal, post-Covid, and improve its safety arrangements at the station, in circulating areas and inside the trains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-railway-division-s-business-development-units-keep-cash-inflows-on-track/story-d8Nm0QSytDnN5mVHmR1r7H.html

There had been several releases since Durga puja, but nothing changed the scenario. Even Christmas and New Year failed to draw audiences. This has made the producers and distributors jittery,” Saha told PTI.“We think removing the 50 per cent-occupancy cap will certainly help us recover the cost of running theatres to an extent. It will further boost confidence of the producers,” Saha, also the director of a local multiplex chain, stated.He said that a formal request to sanction full occupancy in theatres has been made to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and cinema hall owners have agreed to abide by all Covid-19 protocols to ensure safety of people.Arijit Dutta, the owner of Priya Cinema, one of the iconic movie theatres in the city, said the entertainment industry is bleeding.“We haven’t registered more than 5 per cent occupancy even during Christmas-New Year. If the entertainment industry has to sustain, this cannot continue...” Dutta said 100 per cent occupancy should be allowed in cinema halls to help them stay afloat.“There has been a drop in active COVID-19 cases; almost everything has opened up with precautions. Then why do cinemas still suffer? We are implementing all safety guidelines,” he said.An EIMPA official said around 120 of the 250 single screen theatres are currently operational, the rest have closed shop, and some permanently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/single-screen-theatre-owners-urge-bengal-govt-to-allow-100-occupancy-in-halls/story-hubNOGiF56aRdKhWwGWI9M.html

Though hotel occupancy has gone up to 75%, a welcome change from 15% last year when the Covid-19 lockdown hit the industry hard, the visitor influx raises concerns about an infection spike and other problems.Traffic jams are frequent, especially on the Kalka-Shimla and Mandi-Manali highways.Hotel staff tested“Medical teams have been constantly conducting rapid testing of hotel staff in Shimla and so far only two staff members have tested positive at the government run guest house at Willy’s park. We are trying to keep the sampling rate high to detect as many cases as possible. Hotel owners have been requested to get their staff tested on priority,” said Surekha Chopra, chief medical officer here.Police data shows that more than 1.4 lakh vehicles entered Shimla town from the barrier at Shoghi during the last 10 days. The biggest traffic inflow was reported on December 31 for New Year Celebrations with 18,000 vehicles,mainly from Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh, entering the city. On January 1, 2021, it was 15,000 after a snowfall forecast.20-year-old tourist arrivals record broken Tourism officials also estimate that more than five lakh tourists visited Shimla between December 25 and January 4, 2021, breaking a 20-year-old tourist arrivals record.High arrivals were also reported from Kullu-Manali, where Rohtang Tunnel has become a biggest attraction, Dharamshala –McLeodganj, Dalhousie, Khajjiar and Kasauli and Chail. “Tourists are thronging Shimla in large numbers since December 22 because of which the industry is slowly recovering from the huge setback of the total lockdown since March 22, 2020. Hotel owners are ensuring that all standard operating procedures are followed and are providing details of guests to the tourism department. Till now we have not received any news of cases in hotels or restaurants,” said Sanjay Sood, president of the Shimla Hoteliers and Restaurateurs association . Himachal Pradesh till date has recorded 55,811 Covid-19 infections with 934 fatalities, the maximum in Shimla with 258 deaths followed by 191 in Kangra and 119 in Mandi. Active cases have come down to 1,646 after while recoveries have reached 53,180 at a rate of 95.3%. To date, tests have been conducted in the state.

05-01-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Why ‘gender budget’ is key to Pune’s well-being||Come the New Year and we await the draft municipal budget from the civic administration. It is usually presented around mid-January. This year, newspapers report a shortfall in revenue, resulting in a smaller kitty for new projects. All the more reason funds should be carefully allocated, especially for those who have been worst affected. By law, at least 5% is supposed to be a “Gender Budget”. On January 3, Savitribai Phule’s Jayanti, political and social leaders extol women’s empowerment. How should the municipal budget back these words? I asked Kiran Moghe, Poornima Chikarmane and Lakshmi Narayanan, who have for many years been strengthening livelihoods of waste-picker women and domestic workers. Women workers, such as waste collectors, domestic workers, street vendors, and construction workers, who are in public spaces for their work, are estimated to number at least three lakh in Pune. They provide critical services to the city, its neighbourhoods and families. Supporting them can help improve the resilience of our society as a whole. Marginalised women need a place to register for work and welfare, build skills, hold meetings to discuss and plan their work. A budget to create such Women Workers’ Facilitation Centres across the city would help their cause. Secondly, there is a need to ensure income support and work continuity. For example, public procurement of products like uniforms, office supplies, and mid-day meals from self-help groups of home-based workers. Continuing to contract SWaCH for doorstep waste collection provides stability of income, supports recovery of recyclables and helps create a circular sustaining economy. Studies show that poor women are more dependent on public transport, as well as walking and cycling for work and domestic chores. In the PMC 2021-22 budget, we would like to see allocations for street development using the Urban Street Design Guidelines, and implementation of the Pune Cycle Plan. Good street design would also make space for street vendors, an important livelihood sector in our city. Lakh ko Pachas, a recent campaign highlighted the need for 50 buses per lakh population. By rights, Pune should have at least 3,500 buses on road by next year. PMC and PCMC must provide a large grant to PMPML for the bus-fleet size we need, to avoid dangerous air pollution, road accidents and congestion. Working women and families also need creches and children’s centres near their homes and work places, near or at schools. How wonderful it would be to have well-run learning and play spaces, for children to be cared for before and after school hours, even as we wait for schools to reopen. Free or highly subsidised, not dependent on uncertain earnings from informal work, this is a critical service that PMC could enable. It’s not enough to just make budgetary allocations. Three crores were allocated for creches a couple of years ago, but never spent! We need more than noble pronouncements! Could a city with a multi-thousand crore public budget, generating several billion dollars worth of GDP every year, provide such services and facilities? After all, behind Pune’s success as a city, partly lies the hard work of its informal sector women workers. I also want to say what we don’t need in the civic budget - flyovers taking funds away from buses, cycle tracks and footpaths; conversion of water streams into concrete drains, increasing flash floods and destroying biodiversity. We don’t need tunnels through hills destroying local groundwater catchment areas and making us steal water from neighbouring villages. Let’s hope the civic budget will be spent wisely to enhance public well-being, support economic recovery, and environment conservation!

05-01-2021||Pune||‘Blackspots are a scientific study on police record; it is time action is taken’||She has been actively campaigning for safe road and blackspot free roads in the city with special focus on Western suburbs of Pune What is your view of the issues related to the traffic “blackspots”? We have been facing several issues related to accident and traffic jams at these blackspots on city roads and there is a need for complete transformation of these areas by scientific application of available traffic knowledge. The traffic police, PMC, PMRDA, district collector and citizens must come together to solve these pressing issues. Massive and intense social awareness and public awareness campaigns should be conducted with the help of students and NGOs. Other government bodies like the regional transport office (RTO), traffic engineers and experts must be involved to reduce accidents and fatalities. Blackspots are a scientific study on record of the police and it is time action is taken to reduce the accidents. What ails the rectification process? There is no plan in action to curb the menace of growing accidents. Accidents are regularly taking place in East, West, North and South Pune where the blackspots have been identified. The police have pointed out all the flaws, but no action is forthcoming at the spots. Measures to curb rash and negligent driving, inculcating traffic sense and self-discipline are the need of the hour. What does the Aundh Mohalla Committee plan to do? We are going to take up the issue with the police, state and central government and ensure that technology and other necessary assistance is sought for reduction of accidents at these blackspots. We believe that blackspots are not good for the city. We need smooth, accident-free roads for our citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/blackspots-are-a-scientific-study-on-police-record-it-is-time-action-is-taken/story-MCoABos7adX6zTfDUprWuK.html
05-01-2021||Pune||White marks at blackspots: Hope for change?||Twenty-three black spots – defined by the city police as specific roads and/or areas were accidents repeatedly take place – mark Pune’s topography entering 2021. The threat to lives of commuters and pedestrians at these 23 spots, several of them major chowks and thoroughfares in the city, is real. The Undri chowk is one such blackspot, and has been for the past decade. The panchayat samiti and gram panchayat members, including the sitting legislator, claim to have held a meeting with the public works department (PWD) to execute a series of changes to make the chowk safer for traffic. The changes include, land acquisition to widen the chowk, completion of cementing the roads and erection of traffic safety signs. Undri chowk connects the Katraj-Kondhwa-Mantarwadi bypass and therefore sees heavy traffic throughout the day. The chowk is a strategic junction which connects Khadi machine chowk, Kondhwa Budruk, Pisoli, Wadachiwadi and Saswad. The poor road condition generates clouds of dust that block motorists’ vision. Local residents allege that the condition of the chowk has made their lives miserable. A spot visited by HT found huge potholes on the road made commuting difficult. There was a constant stream of heavy vehicles which led to severe congestion at Undri chowk throughout the day. No traffic police were seen at the junction at 12 noon on January 3, 2021. Undri village, spread over a 10km area has a population of two lakh and was merged with the PMC in 1997. It was then de-merged in 2002 after objections were raised by the local gram panchayat. Panchayat Samiti deputy chairperson Sachin Ghule said, “We have developed an elaborate plan for decongesting the chowk and making it safe for commuting. Recently a meeting was held and the PWD has agreed to pay pending dues to the tune of Rs 7 crore to the contractor and he will construct the road with all the safety guidelines given by the traffic department.” Shweta Ghule Patil, former sarpanch of Undri village, said, “The chowk is prone to accidents and we have been following up with the government authorities. The PWD has committed that work will start soon. Authorities have been requested to make immediate changes to the chowk and permanently solve the traffic congestion and accidents issue at the chowk.” Jawatmal Solanki, a businessman who has a shop at the chowk, said, “Dust is a serious issue and I am taking tablets due to complications arising out of dust due to heavy vehicles and traffic jams. We clean the chowk with tanker waters by spending from our pockets to avoid dust-related diseases.” Prashant Inamdar, convenor, Pedestrian First, said, “The blackspot areas see very high traffic flow. There is a complete lack of planning which has led to this haphazard development of roads leading to accidents and fatalities. It is time for penal action including prosecution of concerned officials.” The Mai Mangeshkar chowk in Warje, also on the traffic police’s black-spot list is prone to heavy traffic jams due to traffic coming onto the chowk from the service road. There is no traffic signage at the location. Commuters find it difficult to locate the direction in which other commuters are moving, leading to accidents. In a major accident at the Mai Mangeshkar chowk, an oil tanker exploded on the connecting flyover on December 5. The chowk led the list of blackspots for traffic accidents in the city released by the traffic branch in 2018. Commuters habitually violating rules to travel short distances is also causing a number of accidents. Social activist Vaishali Patkar said, “The chowk has become a major death trap and there is little the government authorities are doing to clear traffic congestion and reduce the growing number of accidents in the area. The rules of traffic are not being followed by commuters and we need greater presence of traffic police at the chowk. Also, the CCTVs must be activated to ensure that the violators don’t go unpunished. The citizen groups of the area must work closely with police and civic authorities.” Area resident Virendra Chitrav said, “The service road is two-way, but that is a huge problem leading to congestion resulting from undisciplined driving. There is an auto-stand on the said road and two-wheeler parking is also a major issue. Parking areas must be earmarked properly and proper dividers must be in place.” Inamdar futher added, “There is a need for holistic planning for the resolution of the prevalent problems at the accident blackspots. Citizens’ lives are precious and as taxpayers, it is the need of the hour for all the departments to come together to put an end to this menace forever.” DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “We will study these areas and based on new citizen inputs will add to the list of blackspots and ensure the earlier blackspots are successfully removed. Our efforts are to have no blackspots in the future, which we will achieve by coordinating with all the agencies of the government involved in traffic work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/white-marks-at-blackspots-hope-for-change/story-AGZMM4ohewobSUSHaAcnyH.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||NCS conducting surveys to study quakes in Delhi-NCR: MoES||The National Centre for Seismology (NCS) has started a geophysical survey over the Delhi region for accurate assessment of seismic hazards, following tremors in the NCR last year.The NCS will also carry out analysis and interpretation of satellite imageries and geological field investigations for locating the faults in the Earth’s surface, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said. Both the field surveys, geophysical and geological, are expected to be completed by March 31.Further, the seismic network in Delhi and surrounding areas has been strengthened after the tremors in 2020 to improve the accuracy of epicentre location to 2 kilometres, the MoES said.The NCS is a body under the Ministry of Earth Sciences. Delhi experienced four small earthquakes during April – August 2020, with the first event of magnitude 3.5 on April 12 in the northeastern boundary of Delhi. These earthquakes were followed by a dozen micro-events and a few aftershocks. Soon after the second event of magnitude 3.4 on May 10, the MoES held a detailed discussion with experts to address the ongoing earthquake activity. “It was felt that it is necessary to characterise the earthquake sources in Delhi and surroundings through strengthening of local seismic network and delineation of sub- surface features such as fault, which may cause earthquakes. A fault is a fracture or discontinuity in a volume of rock,” the MoES said.The seismic network in Delhi and its surrounding areas was strengthened by deploying 11 temporary additional stations covering the known faults in the region to precisely locate the earthquakes and their aftershocks for a better understanding of the causative sources. Data from these stations are received in near real-time and used for locating the micro and small earthquakes in the region. “A geophysical survey, namely, Magneto-telluric (MT) is also being conducted over the Delhi region,” the MoES said. Magneto-telluric (MT) is a geophysical method which uses natural time variation of the Earth’s magnetic and electic fields to understand geological structure and processes. These measurements are being conducted across three major seismic sources, namely the Mahendragarh-Dehradun Fault (MDF), Sohna Fault (SF) and Mathura Fault (MF). This will help ascertain the presence of fluid, which generally enhances the possibility of triggering of earthquakes. This survey is carried out in collaboration with the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun. Analysis and interpretation of satellite imageries and geological field investigations for locating the faults are also being carried out, the MoES said. “This information along with the results of MT survey will be useful in accurate assessment of seismic hazard. It can also be used for designing the earthquake resistant buildings, industrial units and critical structures, like hospitals and schools,” the MOES said. The study is being conducted by the NCS in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ncs-conducting-surveys-to-study-quakes-in-delhi-ncr-moes/story-WgZe4punD8dXujoJxA4C8N.html

The state government has said it would raise the issue during a video conference with the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on January 7.State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that people below the poverty line cannot afford the vaccine even if its two doses are priced at Rs500 and so, the Centre should bear the cost for them. “People below the poverty line, persons with comorbidity and population above 60 years should be given the vaccine for free. We are going to raise this demand during our conference with the MoHFW on Thursday. Though there is no clarity on it as yet, we believe that it has been made free for health workers, frontline workers by the Centre. The poor people too should get it for free,” he said.Also read | 10 states with most number of fresh Covid-19 infectionsTope said that epidemic diseases and their handling is the responsibility of the Centre and the state has followed all its instructions and protocol right from the beginning of the outbreak. “For the past three months, the Centre has not been providing us equipment like ventilators, RT-PCR kits, and tablets like Remdesivir and Tocilozumab. The state has borne the expense of making them available through public health services...We have also been bearing the establishment cost for the drive including training of the vaccinators, storage of the vaccine. Now, the Centre should take the responsibility of cost of the vaccine for the poor,” he added.The health minister said that the state is going to conduct dry run for vaccination in all the 36 districts, including Mumbai, on January 8. “Maharashtra is all set for the vaccination, which we expect to be rolled out in the next 8-10 days. We have a cold chain system in place, 16,000 vaccinators have been trained and are ready for the drive. 780,000 health care workers have already been registered on CoWIN app, while people from other categories, like frontline workers, are being registered by the respective departments. We are all set to roll out the programme once it is announced by the Centre. We expect the release of the vaccine doses by the Centre in proportion of the registrations done,” Tope said.He said that in the wake of the second strain of the virus found in some of the UK returnees in Maharashtra, the state has decided to strictly follow the quarantine protocol. As per the new guidelines, asymptomatic passengers found with second stain of virus will have to go through 14 to 21 days of the quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-should-provide-free-covid-vaccine-to-poor-maharashtra/story-AwemlKdXaa3ddkDqyRihPO.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula poultry samples inconclusive, Jalandhar lab sends team to Barwala for bird flu retest||The cause of the death of more than 1 lakh birds in the poultry hub of Barwala in Haryana’s Panchkula district since December remains a mystery two days after 80 samples were sent to a Jalandhar laboratory, prompting the authorities to collect samples afresh on Tuesday. Since the 80 blood samples of poultry sent by the state animal husbandry department to the Regional Disease Diagnosis Laboratory in Jalandhar were inconclusive, a team from the RDDL arrived at Barwala to take fresh samples. Five carcasses were also sent to the laboratory to know the cause of the deaths. Also read: Zoos on alert across the country after bird flu deaths in HimachalNOT TAKING ANY CHANCES: LAB DIRECTOR RDDL director Dr Mohinder Pal Singh said: “On Sunday, we received four samples of birds. However, we couldn’t establish the cause of death of birds in such large numbers from the four samples.” “As bird flu has spread in adjoining areas, we don’t want to take any risk. We are taking the death of the large number of poultry birds seriously. We have sent a four-member team of experts to Barwala to collect fresh samples. The reports will be out on Wednesday evening,” he said. IF BIRD FLU, SAMPLES TO BE SENT TO BHOPAL The director said that in case the samples tested positive for bird flu then according to protocol, the samples will be sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal for confirmation, as it is the final authority to declare any kind of virus. Considered Asia’s second largest poultry hub, with a daily production of more than 1 crore eggs and employing 15,000 workers at around 120 farms, the region has seen the death of over 1 lakh chickens in 10 farms over the past few days. Bird flu or avian influenza can spread to humans and can trigger a person-to-person transmission. While no updated mortality figures have been shared by the Panchkula administration, an official, requesting anonymity, said: “Deaths have increased manifold.” A poultry farmer in Barwala, who did not wish to be named, said over 1 lakh chickens had died at his farm alone since December 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panchkula-poultry-samples-inconclusive-jalandhar-lab-sends-team-to-barwala-for-bird-flu-retest/story-xqdDFf1M6T4XWpHQINzLlN.html

There has been heavy snowfall in South Kashmir for the last three days which has led to the closure of the Srinagar -Jammu national highway. At the Jawahar Tunnel, close to four feet of snow was recorded leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded. Since Tuesday morning, almost all parts of Kashmir are witnessing moderate to heavy snowfall.Morning flights have also been cancelled at Srinagar airport due to fresh snowfall.“Today [Tuesday] weather at Srinagar airport not looks favourable for flight operation, Although @Aaisnrairport team working on it but it is requested to avoid inconvenience before reaching Airport, contact with concern airlines for status and then move,” the Srinagar airport handle tweeted.Today weather at Srinagar airport not looks favourable for flight operation , Although @Aaisnrairport team working on it but it is requested to avoid inconvenience before reaching Airport, contact with concern airlines for status and then move.@AAI_Official @aaiRedNRThe heavy snowfall has prompted the Jammu and Kashmir Disaster Management Authority to issue medium and low level avalanche warning for the upper reaches of avalanche-prone areas of Jammu and Kashmir. “Medium level avalanche warning has been issued for upper reaches of Poonch, Rajouri, Ramban, Jawahar Tunnel, Doda, Kishtwar, Anantnag, Kulgam, Kupwara and Tanghdar.

05-01-2021||City||Akhilesh tweaks vaccine remark, says never raised questions on scientists||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday clarified that he had only questioned the preparedness of the governments at the Centre and the state in the Covid vaccination campaign and had not cast doubts on scientists, researchers, experts, or volunteers engaged in vaccine development.Yadav, who had triggered a controversy earlier last Saturday by saying that he would not take “BJP vaccine”, went on to say that “BJP (people) should get vaccinated first”.This was his third successive attack on the BJP-- the party leads the government at the Centre and also runs the state-- in as many days over the Covid vaccine. On Sunday, he had said the government should not treat the immunisation campaign as a cosmetic event but make concrete arrangements for it before the launch.At a press conference at the party headquarters on the sidelines of a Samajwadi Party Vyapar Sabha meeting here, Yadav said, “We do not trust the BJP’s decisions. The BJP government is in the habit of doing ornamental work, turning everything into an event. I questioned the preparedness for vaccination. The government is doing a dry run, but where are the priority lists, charts and protocol for the vaccination drive? Other countries made priority lists —frontline workers, 80+ citizens, 60+ citizens and so on. What is the BJP government’s plan?”He also asked, “When will the poor people get the vaccine, in one year, two years or three years? Would they get it free? They should get it free.”When it was pointed to him that people were expressing apprehension over the vaccine’s possible reactions, Yadav said, “The government should dispel doubts, if any. Yes, people are raising such doubts... Social media is flooded with it, other leaders and political parties are also asking questions.”The Samajwadi Party chief also attacked the Yogi Adityanath government in the state over the Ghaziabad crematorium tragedy that has claimed 25 lives so far. “This government is responsible for it. This is how they build structures...A compensation of Rs2 lakh (to kin of victims) is meagre, the government must give Rs50 lakh each instead,” he said.Yadav also hinted at having no alliance with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the 2022 UP assembly elections. “It (AAP) can be considered a big party. It has a government, a chief minister and MPs. We will not ally with any major political party, we will ally with smaller parties,” he said.The SP chief said if his party came to power after the 2022 assembly polls, it would make some special arrangement for protection of businessmen in the state.“Our businessmen raised important questions because they suffered the most during the lockdown. They did not get support from the banks and the government. They were forced to pay electricity bills even when factories were shut...,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-vaccine-questioned-govt-s-preparedness-not-scientists-says-akhilesh/story-KIUmJGVH16Anm9lhEso0TP.html

At least 2,688 students shifted to government schools in Panchkula, which is lowest in the state.Satpal Ahlawat, a resident of Jhajjar, said he moved both his kids to a government school due to the pandemic because private schools were charging high fees without conducting online classes on time.“Children have suffered a lot during online classes this year and they are unable to retain attention as compared to offline classes. While seeing all the pros and cons, I have shifted my son, who studies in Class 5 and daughter, a Class 7 student, to a government school,” he added.Nand Kishore Verma, assistant director, Haryana secondary school education department, said over 34% students, who have switched over to government schools are in classes 9 and 11.“We have recorded an improvement of 8%in enrolment this year. Students are choosing government schools due to improvement in education standards and infrastructure, apart from Covid-19 crisis. Income of people has declined during the pandemic and they have realised that good education can be achieved in government schools too,” Verma added.He said both the toppers in Haryana board’s Class 12 exams are from government schools in the 2019-20 academic session.“We have started online classes on Edusat and local cable TV channels free of cost.

In September, the CBI had sought sanction from the Haryana government to prosecute three former officials of the TCP department for their alleged role in facilitating grant of real estate development licences on land released from the acquisition process in Gurugram.The CBI, which is investigating the case pertaining to release of about 95% of 1,407 acres under acquisition land in Gurugram during the Congress rule in 2009, had in January 2019 registered a case against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, an official and 15 real estate developers in the matter. The probe was ordered on directions of the Supreme Court.The three TCP officials have been accused by the CBI of making “back references” to real estate developers who had submitted applications for grant of licences. The “back references”, sources said, allowed the developers to rectify the deficiencies in the applications. The FIR also names Bhupinder Singh Hooda and others. However, no charges have so far been pressed against them. More chargesheets could be filed. The next date of hearing is January 18.The caseThe Congress government had in June 2009 issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 1,407 acres for developing residential Sectors 58-63 and commercial Sectors 65-67 in Gurugram by HUDA.While issuing the declaration under Section 6 on June 2, 2010, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. Finally, the award dated May 29, 2012 was passed for 87 acres only. The SC had said about 1,300 acres were released in the favour of private builders.The CBI in its preliminary Inquiry had prima facie established irregularities in the release of land from acquisition process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-land-release-probe-cbi-submits-chargesheet-against-3-ex-tcp-officials/story-kbTqEI7ailqzojX2a2mneM.html

A figure as low as this was last recorded in the state more than six months ago in the first week of June when 2,357 infections were reported. Health department data showed that last week’s count was also less by 1,102 cases as compared to the week before (December 21-27) when 3,263 new infections were reported. The sample positivity rate also declined to 5.7% . The case fatality rate was 1.1% and the recovery rate stood at 97.8%, officials said. While the infection rate continued to fall down and sampling also remained at an all-time high, there are now indications that sampling will get reduced gradually, officials said. As per the sampling data, the state health department has tested over 14.49 lakh people in the past six weeks (from November 23 till January 3) and more than 90% of the suspects were tested using RT-PCR kits. However, the sampling numbers declined last week with about 1.82 lakh people getting tested in comparison to over 2.27 lakh tested the week before. A record 2.81 lakh people were tested across the state during November 23-29 followed by 2.79 lakh people during November 30-December 6, 2.43 lakh during December 7-13, 2.36 lakh during December 14-20, and 2.27 lakh during December 21-27. Seven of the 22 districts continued to have a critical positivity rate of more than 6% though it’s on a continuous decline with every passing week. Faridabad’s positivity rate has come down to 10.4% while Gurugram’s has dropped to 8.4%. Rewari’s positivity rate has dropped to 7.9% followed by Panchkula at 7.1%. Panipat’s positivity rate has come down to 6.5% followed by Ambala at 6.3% and Hisar at 6.1%. Thirteen districts — Karnal, Mahendergarh, Sonepat, Rohtak, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad, Sirsa, Bhiwani, Yamunanagar, Palwal, Jind, Kaithal and Jhajjar — have positivity rate of less than or 6%, but higher than the desirable positivity rate of less than 2%. Kaithal and Jhajjar with a positivity rate of 2.7% and 2.4%, respectively are close to touching the desirable positivity rate. Charkhi Dadri (1.4%) and Nuh (1.1%) continued to maintain their desirable positivity rate of less than 2% for the last six weeks. Vaccine dry run across the state on January 7The Haryana health department will conduct a dry run across the state on January 7 as a precursor to the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out.ACS, health, Rajeev Arora, said the dry run will help the state to identify the challenges in operational and technical aspects of vaccine administration and help to review the preparedness at the district and block levels and gather empirical data.“The amount of vaccine available and prioritisation of population groups for vaccination will depend on what the central government decides. As far as fixing the date to start inoculation, we will expeditiously roll it out once the vaccine becomes available. The platform of existing universal immunisation programme with enhanced capacities is being used for Covid-19 vaccination. Data of more than 1.9 lakh healthcare workers, both from private and government sectors, have been uploaded on CoWIN portal,” he added.The ACS said department has already identified 19,000 vaccination session sites and about 5,145 vaccinators have been mapped for the process of administering the vaccine. For ensuring that vaccine reaches every district in proper cold chain, the health department will deploy 22 vaccine vans for transporting vaccine across the state.He said vaccine introduction will span over a year with multiple groups being included sequentially starting from healthcare workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-curve-continues-to-flatten-in-haryana/story-CGvXrCBRo4aPU3DqdI9rsL.html

In a statement, Hooda said that financial assistance would be paid to the families of farmers from the personal finances of Congress MLAs. Hooda, who is the leader of opposition, demanded that the state government should provide financial help and government jobs to one member of the family of such farmers. He said it is the responsibility of government to do so because all these people lost their lives because of the “stubborn attitude and insensitivity” of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-mlas-to-provide-rs-2-lakh-each-to-kin-of-deceased-farmers/story-SkaT73f5U3QYBzszhIPLFN.html
05-01-2021||City||Pakistan to make special arrangements for Indian pilgrims on Nankana Sahib massacre centenary||The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) on Monday said their government has agreed to make special arrangements for the Indian pilgrims visiting the neighbouring country on the 100th anniversary of Saka Nankana Sahib (Nankana massacre). Usually, such protocol is extended only to four jathas that visit Pakistan every year on the occasion of Baisakhi, Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary, Guru Arjan Dev Shaheedi Divas and Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death anniversary. It involves special security arrangements such as deployment of paramilitary personnel during the visit. The PSGPC office-bearers and government authorities including officials of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) on Monday met at Lahore to discuss the arrangements of the centenary function. ETPB chairman Ameer Ahmed and secretary Tariq Wazir attended the meeting.“As Saka Nankana Sahib does not come under the protocol of four jathas coming from India, it was a big issue for us. But it is certainly a good development for the sangat that the Pakistan government has given nod for the similar protocol for this special jatha,” PSGPC president Satwant Singh said on phone. “Also, there is no cap on the number of pilgrims. We will host all the pilgrims coming from India on the historic occasion,” added Singh. Nearly 260 Sikhs were killed in the massacre that took place at Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib on February 20, 1921. The gurdwara reform movement started in the wake of the episode.After the PSGPC got the nod of the Pakistan government for the event, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) initiated the visa process for pilgrims willing to go to Pakistan to attend the centenary event.SGPC chief secretary Harjinder Singh said, “A jatha to be sent by the SGPC will include prominent personalities and sangats. The pilgrims who want to visit Sri Nankana Sahib on this day can submit their passports along with recommendation of their area members of the SGPC by January 15.”Gurdwara body president Jagir Kaur said the PSGPC chief has personally invited her and Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh for the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-to-make-special-arrangements-for-indian-pilgrims-on-nankana-sahib-massacre-centenary/story-mk99IeYQxekkX3BYroouvM.html

Even the strength of students at the college run by a voluntary organisation, Sampardai Sant Baba Tara Singh, has seen a drastic dip from 2,300 in 2015 to 213 this year. The faculty members say the future of the staff and the students from scores of surrounding villages is hanging in the balance due to lackadaisical approach of the college management. They also demanded a vigilance inquiry into the financial transactions of the management since 2011. The college was built in 1970 by the voluntary organisation with the help and donation from residents of at least 22 villages in the area. “We have been working without salary for the last 25 months. Our repeated requests to the management have fallen on deaf ears. Some teachers have already left their jobs due to non-payment of salaries. We have also filed a court case against the management and the next hearing is scheduled in February,” said Prof Paramjit Singh who teaches Punjabi literature. The college has 18 members of teaching staff — some being permanent and others under the management quota. “The management is expressing inability to pay the salaries due to a decreasing number of students. But the reality is that they don’t want to run the college and are eying the land worth crores donated by the people to run the institution,” Prof Paramjit added. Prof Jasbir Singh, another faculty member, said the management deliberately closed several courses in the last few years. “Even, the fee is being increased by 8% every year on the lines of city colleges against the rules,” he said. Prof Balwinder Singh said they have written to the Punjab secretary (higher education) seeking a probe into the management’s functioning, but to no avail. The Punjab chief minister should intervene as it concerns education of students of this border district, he said. They accused the management of bungling crores of rupees from the college’s funds by flaying the guidelines of the University Grant Commission (UGC). College principal JK Arora said, “The issue of staff salary has been taken up.College chairman Baba Hakam Singh is the right person to tell as why the salaries are not being released. Even I have also not got my salary since March 2020.” Hakam Singh didn’t respond to repeated calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/staff-without-salary-for-2-years-sarhali-khalsa-college-in-tarn-taran-district-faces-closure/story-qQKBGZHZaQtHxv0J7BSE4L.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale| A tale of two Premchands||The life of this betel leaf stall owner is marked by two special facets. First, his modest (but longtime) stall is situated directly beneath the landmark clock tower of the Kamla Market in Central Delhi. Second — and perhaps this is even more special — he shares his name with one of the greatest Indian writers.“Yes, I’m familiar with some of Premchand’s work,” says Premchand. It is afternoon, there are no customers for the moment and the gentleman finds it harmless to spend some time on literary matters. Premchand is particularly fond of one story written by his 20th century namesake, who has left behind several short stories and novels set in the milieu of the stall owner’s own part of the world—eastern UP. Premchand, the writer, was born in Benares. Premchand, the betel leaf man, spent his childhood in a village in Jaunpur, a district close to Benares.Premchand doesn’t clearly remember the name of thar beloved Premchand story, but thinks that it might be titled Mantra. He shares what (or how) he remembers the tale. “It is about a rich man and a poor man. The poor man’s child is seriously ill so he takes him the rich man, who is a doctor, but the rich man is enjoying his daily walk so he refuses to check on the child, who dies. Much later, the rich man’s child suffers from a snakebite and it’s the poor man who comes to the rescue.”Premchand recalls that he first encountered this Premchand story as a 9th standard student in Sri Ram Inter College. “I read it at least three or four times. It was easy to understand the emotions. I’m from a poor class, and I have directly experienced this divide between the rich and the poor.”Some three years after first encountering the story, Premchand finished the school and left his village “to take over this stall in Delhi, that was started by my father.”It’s his 21st year in Delhi. Premchand’s father is enjoying his retirement in the village — perhaps reading Premchand’s fiction? Premchand smiles, shaking his head. “Both my parents are angootha-chaap (illiterate)... they could not read Premchand... they probably named me so without even thinking of that other Premchand.”Now, as a customer arrives, Premchand gets busy in preparing a paan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/a-tale-of-two-premchands/story-X1lFffASSWZKt6uKkuHbXK.html

05-01-2021||City||Mumbai wakes up to mild showers||Light spells of rain were reported across Mumbai and its neighbouring areas early on Monday morning. Cloudy weather associated with low visibility was observed owing to a cyclonic circulation spreading from Punjab to the Arabian Sea.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted thunderstorm and light rainfall for south Konkan, south-central Maharashtra and some areas Marathwada for the next four-five days. Mumbai is expected to see cloudy skies but no significant rainfall is predicted over this period. “An active western disturbance lies as a middle and upper-level cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan and the neighbouring areas with its induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and its neighbourhood at lower levels. A north-south zone of wind confluence continues to exist from north Punjab to northeast Arabian Sea, with strong interaction between the southwesterly, in association with the above western disturbance and lower-level moist southeasterlies,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Meanwhile, the minimum temperatures dropped marginally on Monday. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 21.6 degrees Celsius, which was 2.5 degrees above normal, but 1.4 degrees below Sunday’s minimum temperature. Santacruz recorded a minimum temperature of 20.4 degrees Celsius, which was 3.3 degrees above normal and 2.3 degrees below Sunday’s temperature. The maximum temperature at Colaba was 27 degrees Celsius— 3.5 degrees below normal— while Santacruz recorded a temperature of 29 degree Celsius— 2 degrees below normal. The city’s air quality continued to remain poor on Monday too, with an overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator—of 252 recorded. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Of the 10 stations where the air quality was measured, Mazagaon breathed the worst air with an AQI of 323 (very poor), followed by Navi Mumbai where AQI was 306 (very poor). “Mumbai’s AQI was poor on Monday because of low dispersion. The change in wind direction will increase the amount of clean marine air, leading to poor to moderate AQI for Mumbai for the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-wakes-up-to-mild-showers/story-lyOSOhTuaRgQRS7AEOJurN.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||70% parents want schools shut till April: Survey||Nearly 70% of parents who responded to a nationwide survey said they prefer schools in their respective states to reopen only post-April in light of Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown. The survey was conducted by Local Circles, a Delhi-based community social media platform, and was based on responses from 19,000 parents across 224 districts in the country – 58% from tier-1 districts, 21% from tier-2 districts, and 21% from tier-3, tier-4 and rural districts. In Maharashtra, more than 2,000 parents responded to the survey, of which about 52% said they want schools in the state to begin only in April this year. Of these, 1,325 parents were from Mumbai. In September 2020, Local Circles had conducted a similar survey, wherein only around 34% of parents had said that schools should begin from April 2021. Over the past months, the number of parents who think that way seems to have substantially increased. “A majority of parents are not willing to send their children to school even now, due to the risk involved. Some parents of students in Class 10 and 12 might send them as they have to prepare for board exams,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents’ Association. Parents were also asked about whether they would consider giving the Covid-19 vaccine to their child after it is rolled out for school children. Only 26% said they would approve of it, while 56% said they would wait for three months or more to see the data and findings, and then make a decision. In Maharashtra, as of December 14, over 10 lakh students are attending physical schools daily, while more than 15,000 schools have reopened in the state for Classes 9 to 12 since November 23. The administration of Pune will be reopening schools in the city for Class 9 to 12 from January 4, as per the Pune Municipal Corporation. In Delhi, education minister Manish Sisodia said that schools are likely to reopen only post-July 2021 after children are vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/70-parents-want-schools-shut-till-april-survey/story-C8Ee6DDuF80Ir3spjWciRK.html

The commissioner has asked all district collectors to submit detailed reports following thorough investigations.The orders were issued following a video of an alleged auction for the post of sarpanch went viral on social media a few days ago. The video allegedly shows an open auction for the post in Khondamali village in Nandurbar district of north Maharashtra, followed by supporters celebrating after the highest bidder won the post for ₹42 lakh. Responding to the video, activist Anna Hazare termed the incident an “auction of democracy”.“We have received complaints about auctions for the post of sarpanch, and candidates making bids of large sums. Considering that the gram panchayat elections should be held in a free, fair and transparent manner, the matter is serious. Hence, investigate any such incident, if it has happened in your respective districts and submit a detailed report while seeking permission to approve unopposed elections of the gram panchayats,” Madan said in his order to district collectors.The commission has further asked district collectors to immediately submit detailed reports about villages where only one candidate is left in the fray for the polls after the withdrawal of nominations by other candidates. “There is a possibility that the candidates may have been pressured to withdraw their nominations. To avoid this, declaration of the winner shall be made only after prior approval from the state election commission,” adds the order.The election commission declared elections for 14,234 gram panchayats across Maharashtra on January 15. The elections were postponed by over nine months in the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-election-commissioner-orders-probe-into-auction-of-sarpanch-post/story-uSy7dbJV1eHJMcETrVTKkM.html

A parent of a student at a private medical college in Pune said, “Since March 2020, my son has been studying from home. May onwards all second, third and fourth-year medical students were on Covid duty and there was no option of staying in hostels. Then why are we paying for services that were not used?”Some parents have raised their concerns with the respective college management. Certain institutions have offered discounts or given the option of paying the fees as instalments. A parent of a student at a Nashik-based private medical college said hostel and mess fees amounted to approximately Rs 1.45 lakh per year. “Based on our grievances, the institute agreed to reduce the component by Rs 15,000,” said the parent, who felt this was not enough.The director of a private medical college in Pune pointed out that medical institutes continued to incur costs during the lockdown. “No staff was sacked neither was their salary deducted because not only was our staff conducting classes, but we were also running the hospital, fighting Covid-19. We need the said fees to pay our staff and maintain the upkeep of the institute,” said the director.Not all parents are upset at the institutes claiming full fees. “Almost all state colleges asked for fees in 2020 and they gave enough time to make the payment. It was clarified that the institutes too have to incur cost of staff salary and maintenance of the hostels,” said activist Sudha Shenoy, who is also a parent of a medical student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parents-of-medical-students-in-maharashtra-seek-hostel-mess-fee-waiver-for-lockdown-period-colleges-deny-request/story-28NB4APt2nBZv1yrP0ulCL.html

The crime branch has alleged that Dasgupta had misused his official position and manipulated TRPs of certain news channels to benefit ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd’s Republic Bharat and Republic TV. It has claimed that Dasgupta is the key accused in the TRP fraud case. The crime branch also alleged that he had met Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in 2004 when they worked together at another news channel and Goswami was in touch with Dasgupta before launching Republic TV.The investigating team has claimed that Goswami had approached Dasgupta to manipulate TRP. It is alleged that the duo met around six times over the issue. The prosecution cited evidence in form of WhatsApp chats to prove the allegations against Dasgupta.The defence had argued against the charges under which Dasgupta has been arrested at the Esplanade court. “We submitted before the court that he had had no powers to make any decision [over the TRPs],” Ghumre said.Previously, a spokesperson from BARC India had said that the development is a part of an ongoing probe and it would be inappropriate for it to comment. Republic TV in its statement had earlier said the allegations against it by the police are “laughable”. It had also called the Mumbai Police’s allegations against the channel a “witch-hunt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trp-fraud-case-mumbai-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-barc-s-former-ceo/story-znVEPJjYt0VdrfDnGho8YI.html

They demanded that he pay ₹26 crore, and when he refused to do the same, they threatened to kill him.Lawyer Sameer Pradhan, who appeared for Rajan’s henchmen, said, “The court has convicted them for threatening and for demanding extradition money.

Her lawyer sought exemption for her appearance in the future. The special court, however, refused to grant permanent exemption and has asked her to appear whenever she is called. As soon as the special court resumed trial in November 2020, it had asked all the accused to appear. However, Thakur had missed the court dates on previous occasions citing health issues. Her lawyer had also submitted that she was admitted to AIIMS hospital owing to multiple complications. The prosecution had objected to the excuse and said she was deliberately trying to avoid appearing before the court. The prosecution told the court that appropriate action must be taken against her. Meanwhile, the court adjourned the hearing of the case, as the lawyer of one of the accused who had to cross examine the witness could not attend the hearing, owing to a death in his family. The hearing in the case is now scheduled for Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2008-malegaon-blast-case-bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-appears-before-nia-court-in-mumbai/story-1mIMo2AdqpUvdeibJkaggK.html

The woman later revealed to the police that the accused had been raping and blackmailing her since January last year. According to Dindoshi police, at 2.30pm on Sunday, they received a call from a traffic constable stationed on the WEH, stating that he had witnessed a man assaulting a woman inside an autorickshaw. The constable gave the police the rickshaw’s number, which helped them track the vehicle and arrest the accused. The 25-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old daughter, told the police that the accused, Irfan Shaikh, had been her gym trainer her since 2019 after the woman’s husband left for abroad to work. The woman and Shaikh later had an affair. Shaikh promised to marry him and had been forcing the woman to leave her husband. The couple had stayed together during the lockdown from March to May. During the period, she had left her daughter at her in-laws’ house. She continued the affair even after her husband’s return from abroad. Shaikh forced her to continue meeting him and threatened to reveal about their relationship to her husband. Last year on November 27, the woman’s husband saw the two in a compromising situation, said the police. Following this, she filed a rape complaint against Shaikh and he was arrested. “After getting bail, Shaikh threatened the woman that he would post her photos on the internet, and extracted Rs50,000 from her along with gold jewellery worth Rs1 lakh,” said an officer. Inspector Pradeep Madhure from Dindoshi police station said on New Year’s Eve, Shaikh went to the woman’s house and fought with her, after which she demanded her cash and jewellery back. On Sunday, Shaikh called the woman near his gym at Santosh Nagar in Goregaon and made her sit in a rickshaw. When the woman demanded her money and jewellery back, Shaikh assaulted her. “We have arrested Shaikh for rape, cheating, assault and criminal intimidation under the relevant sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code),” said Madhure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-gym-trainer-arrested-for-rape-assault/story-BWPX9UJKb9u6ZAaFSxYbxL.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||Eight cases of new Covid-19 strain detected in Maharashtra, five in Mumbai||Maharashtra on Monday found eight United Kingdom (UK) returnees, who had tested positive for coronavirus, to be infected by the new variant of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Of the eight patients, five are in Mumbai, while there is one each in Thane, Pune and Mira-Bhayander, state health minister Rajesh Tope said, adding that they are kept in isolation and there is no need to panic. The active caseload in the state went below 50,000 on Monday with 10,362 patients being discharged, taking the tally of recoveries to 1,847,361.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with officials on the health of the eight patients and directed them to remain “extra vigilant”. Thackeray is expected to request the Centre to make quarantine of passengers returning to India from the UK, Middle East and South Africa mandatory. Senior government officials said they have found several cases where travellers come into Maharashtra through other states to skip compulsory quarantine for passengers coming in from UK where the new strain originated.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that samples of those testing positive upon arrival from UK were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to ascertain the type of virus they were infected with.“Between November 25 and December 21, over 4,000 passengers came to Mumbai airport from UK. They were kept in [an] institutional quarantine [facility] and were tested. Of them, 43 tested positive for coronavirus. To ascertain if positive cases are of the mutant strain, samples were sent to NIV [where] genomic sequencing was found. From the reports that came today, of the 43 patients, eight cases are of the mutated virus. “Five of them are from Mumbai and one person each from Thane, Pune and Mira-Bhayander. The contact tracing and tracking is happening at an expedited speed. However, there is no need to panic. Certainly, the new mutated virus spreads faster. Therefore, we must take all precautions. Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed,” Tope said. Meanwhile, the Mumbai civic body said it has traced 40 close contacts of the five patients, and all 40 have tested negative.The discovery of the mutant virus that is believed to be 70% more transmissible than the original strain has created a flutter among the administration and the government. The Covid-19 cases in the state are seeing a decline, with the emergence of the new strain that spreads faster, the CM has asked the municipal commissioners in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune to remain more vigilant in the wake of the new development. The new variant of the virus has affected people from the areas — Mumbai, MMR and Pune — that have recorded the highest number of Covid-19 cases. Health secretary, Dr Pradeep Vyas, said that eight patients are in isolation centre and their contacts are been thoroughly traced.Thackeray, meanwhile, will ask the Union government to make institutional quarantine compulsory for passengers entering the country from UK to keep a check on people entering by road from states where there is no compulsory quarantine. “Although, the state is on a high alert due to the new strain in the UK, but considering the influx of abroad passengers arriving in Maharashtra from other states, the Centre must quarantine passengers at the airport they land,” Thackeray said in a statement from the CMO.He added, “Over the past few days, it has been observed that passengers arrive in Maharashtra by landing at airports in other states. So, it becomes difficult to track them down.”Thackeray on Monday also reviewed the preparedness for the vaccination drive. He directed officials to keep a plan ready for any side effects for people after the vaccination. He said that a task force should be set up to guide treating doctors. Thackeray directed officials to set up vaccination booths at health institutions only.In Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Coporation (BMC) is going to keep the jumbo facilities, which includes facilities at Mulund, Dahisar, BKC, NSCI Worli, Nesco Goregaon, as centres for vaccination, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said. Besides, the jumbo facilities around 95 other centres will also be set up for vaccination. He told reporters that the civic body has planned to keep the entry exit points at these jumbo facilities separate to prevent Covid patients and people who come for vaccine to come in contact. Kakani said, “The five people who tested positive for the new strain arrived in Mumbai in the past 45 days, and we traced their 40 close contacts. All 40 have tested negative.”Kakani added, “Of the five, two have recovered, three are stable and are admitted in BMC’s hospitals. We have followed the existing protocols in tracing, tracking, testing and quarantining close contacts. We also sealed buildings of these five positive patients, following the existing protocols.”“There will be 100 centres in the city including the jumbo facilities that will be partially converted. Initially, we will start with 10,000 vaccinations a day and will take it up to 50,000,” he told reporters.Meanwhile, the state added 2,765 new cases on Monday, taking the tally to 19,47,011. Maharashtra also reported 29 deaths, pushing the death toll to 49,695. Mumbai reported 516 new cases and three deaths, taking the tally to 294,986 and death toll in the city to 11,138. So far, the state has tested 1,30,04,876 samples, and has an overall positivity rate of 14,97% for Covid-19 until today [Saturday]. In the last 24 hours, 46,374 samples were tested.Maharashtra also reported 29 deaths — the lowest single-day toll since May 3. Fresh fatalities pushed the toll to 49,695.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eight-cases-of-new-covid-19-strain-detected-in-maharashtra-five-in-mumbai/story-k7pf947gOho7NUATMLtDsN.html

The survivor is undergoing treatment at Cottage Hospital in Dahanu.According to police, the accused Rajen Burkhud is a resident of Patilpada, Talasari and worked at a factory at Kachigam, Daman. On Saturday, he abruptly entered a thatched hut, where the survivor was being breastfed by her mother. He snatched the child from the mother and ran into a thicket. The parents chased him, but he managed to escape. “Burkhud took the survivor to a paddy field, sexually assaulted her and then threw her. The survivor has suffered injuries. However, the accused left his footwear behind, which helped us trace him,” said senior inspector, Ajay Vasawe of Talasari police station. The police dog squad helped in tracking the accused.“We have arrested Burkhud under sections of 376(2) (rape) and 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012.

As of now, no specific date has been given to us.”“First 1.6 lakh health care workers in J&K will be vaccinated followed by 7 lakh frontline workers. Thereafter, around 20 lakh people who are above 50 years of age in the UT will be covered.”The financial commissioner, however, said it was not known as to when the vaccine will be made available in J&K.On Saturday, the dry run for Covid vaccination was conducted in three districts — Srinagar, Jammu and Kulgam. Dulloo inaugurated and monitored the sessions of vaccine administration to the beneficiaries at the selected sites.He said all protocols were strictly followed in all three districts adding that three rooms — waiting, vaccination and observation — designated for vaccination were set up as per the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-vaccination-in-j-k-1-6-lakh-healthcare-workers-7-lakh-frontliners-to-get-priority/story-DP3xDM5BLOm2Vg038uTgWN.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||First phase of Covid-19 vaccination will be completed within 10 days of receiving vaccines: Maharashtra govt||With the approval of two Covid-19 vaccines for restricted emergency use, the state health department is now gearing up for the mass immunisation process. Officials said the first phase of the vaccination will be completed within 10 days of receiving the vaccines from the central government.Expecting a roll-out of the vaccines by next month, the state health department has so far trained 16,000 vaccinators for the immunisation programme. They will be responsible for providing the vaccine to the 12 lakh healthcare workers including doctors, nurses, ASHA workers, Anganwadi, among others in the first phase. “One vaccinator can vaccinate around 100 people each day. So, we would take a maximum of 10 days to complete the first phase of the vaccination. We have enough manpower to vaccinate one lakh healthcare workers every day,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. So far, 7.50 lakh healthcare workers have registered themselves on the CoWIN app, which has been developed by the Centre to track vaccination and dosage. “Since the last 10 days, the registration has slowed down. So, we have decided to keep the registration process open,” he said.‘We are well prepared’Dr Archana Patil, director of health services also said the team is well qualified and trained to provide the vaccine. Every year, the immunisation department vaccinates around 20 lakh children, in addition to vaccinating 30 lakh pregnant women under prenatal programmes. “Overall, every year, we provide over 1.30 crore dosages. Our latest example was Rubella vaccination when we vaccinated around three crore children within three months. So, we hold practical experience in the immunisation process,” said Dr Patil.“The only new thing for the vaccinators will be to immunise adults. So, we also have to train them how to handle beneficiaries if they develop any discomfort,” said Dr Awate.The health department has identified 2,500 healthcare centres as vaccination points. “Depending on the need, we will extend the vaccination points. We have 2,500 healthcare centres for use. Along with that, if we need more centres, we can also ask the corporations to find places,” said Dr Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-phase-of-covid-19-vaccination-will-be-completed-within-10-days-of-receiving-vaccines-maharashtra-govt/story-yQ4pqZcdD6s7cZ34s6OrXP.html

While two people were arrested around 10 days ago, the third arrest was made on Sunday. According to officers, the gang used to steal cars and would change the registration number and sell them in Gujarat, where these vehicles were used to deliver liquor illegally from Daman and Diu. The vehicles were also used to transport drugs, said officers. They also claimed that they have solved other cases of vehicle thefts registered at Virar and Mira Road police stations and the process of recovering cars stolen from those areas is on. The accused have been identified as Wadala (East) residents Nafis Shaukat Ali Khan, 23, and Mohammad Tafsir Mohammad Shaikh, 22, and Gujarat resident Rumil Dipakbhai Soni, 30. The police said Khan used to steal vehicles from areas where CCTV cameras are not installed. He used to hand over the stolen vehicles to Shaikh outside Mumbai check naka. Shaikh would drive the car to Navsari in Gujarat and then hand it over to Soni, who sell it to locals in Gujarat. After selling the vehicles, they distributed the amount among themselves, said police inspector Kedari Pawar from the property cell. Among the recovered cars, the first, which is around Rs3 lakh, was stolen on October 10 from Ghatkopar. The second car, worth Rs4 lakh, was stolen from October 28 from Santacruz and the third vehicle (worth Rs1.9 lakh) was stolen on November 13 from Bangur Nagar. The accused had allegedly stolen another car from Ghatkopar before the lockdown and the police are trying to trace where they had sold it, added the officer. After complaints of the car thefts emerged, the property cell checked the records of gangs and individuals who have cases of vehicle thefts against them in the city, and discovered about Khan. He was traced to Wadala and during inquiry, he revealed the names of Shaikh and Soni. Around 10 days ago, a police team visited Gujarat and recovered the three cars after arresting Soni, added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-police-bust-interstate-car-theft-gang-arrest-3/story-BA6iJAW9pb956oiAbpJL4O.html

05-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tollywood actor arrested by NCB in drug case||Tollywood actor Shwetha Kumari, who was allegedly detained by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) from a hotel in Mira-Bhayander, on Sunday, in connection with the alleged drug case, was arrested on Monday. Kumari was intercepted with an alleged drug supplier, Sayeed Shaikh. However, Shaikh managed to flee before the NCB officers could nab him. NCB officers have launched a manhunt for him. NCB had seized a small quantity of mephedrone (MD) from the hotel room, where she was staying. She has been booked under the relevant sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. NCB has found digital evidence as she was connected with Shaikh as well as arrested drug peddler Chand Shaikh, said an officer on conditions of anonymity. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed that she has been arrested and will be produced in the court today (Tuesday). “We have seized small contraband from the hotel room where she was staying,” said Wankhede.On January 2, the NCB officer laid a trap at Gurunanak Marg, near Bandra (West) railway station and had arrested Chand Shaikh and had recovered 400g mephedrone (MD), stored in a compartment of his two-wheeler. Chand lives in Bandra and has been supplying MD for a long time. After questioning Chand, NCB got another lead, and the team raided the Crown Business Hotel, near Golden Nest Circle in Bhayander (East), where they nabbed the actress. The drugs recovered from the hotel were allegedly sourced by Shaikh. After inquiry, it was learnt that he is the main supplier of MD in Mumbai and Thane areas, said the officer. NCB has registered an offence against Shaikh and Chand under NDPS Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-tollywood-actor-arrested-by-ncb-in-drug-case/story-qMqQDkjYww4Q0kelnwJrVK.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||14 Avanti cars, 40 engines seized during Mumbai crime branch raid of Dilip Chhabria’s Pune factory||The Mumbai crime branch’s criminal intelligence unit (CIU), which is probing the cheating case against car designer Dilip Chhabria, conducted raids at his factory in Pune and seized 14 DC Avanti cars and 40 engines. Additionally, CIU also found 19 other high-end cars and bikes on the premises.Chhabria was arrested on December 28 and is in police custody till January 7 for further probe. During the inquiry, police found that Chhabria and his firm had availed loans from some non-banking financial companies (NBFC) by posing as customers wanting to buy DC sports cars. The loans averaging ₹42 lakh per car had been availed by the firm, Dilip Chhabria (DC) Designs Pvt Ltd, on around 90 of the total 120 cars sold by the company in India. In some cases, loans had even been availed after the vehicles had already been sold to customers.The incident came to light after assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze of the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) had received a tip-off about a two-seater sports car – DC Avanti – plying towards south Mumbai with a bogus registration number. A trap was laid, and the car was stopped in Colaba on December 18. When police took the vehicle into custody, they learnt that another car with the same engine and chassis number had been falsely registered in Haryana.Chhabria had manufactured 127 DC-Avanti cars in the past four years, of which 120 had been sold in India. The crime branch suspects that 90 such cars were registered with the same engine and chassis number in different states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-avanti-cars-40-engines-seized-during-mumbai-crime-branch-raid-of-dilip-chhabria-s-pune-factory/story-Ihdqw8aNI96uqRgtLEXEUL.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Health workers demand transparency before Covid-19 vaccination||After the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency restricted usage of two Covid-19 vaccines, the healthcare workers are concerned about the lack of clarity. Several senior doctors are planning to wait for a few months to get the first shot until the central government brings more transparency about the efficacy rate and side effects of the vaccines.“I would prefer to wait for at least six months before taking the first shot,” said a senior officer who works with the state health department. “A vaccine’s side effect is dependent on the chromosomes and genes of people, which differs from place to place. So, if a vaccine shows 100% efficiency rate in the United States (US) or the United Kingdom (UK), it may not be suitable in India due to differences in genome structure. So, we know Covishield has a 70% efficacy rate, but we don’t know if they have found a similar result from the trials in India.”As reported, in the first phase of the mass immunisation programme, around 12 lakh healthcare workers in the state will be vaccinated as they are the most vulnerable in contracting Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Till December 25, as many as 16,102 healthcare workers in Maharashtra have contracted Covid-19. Out of these, almost 11,000 were working in the government sector. A total of 178 health workers have succumbed to the infection in the state. Among these, 46 were doctors, 11 were nurses and 121 were paramedical workers and other staffers who were involved in the Covid-19 treatment.So far, 7.50 lakh healthcare workers including doctors, nurses, ASHA and Anganwadi workers, among others have registered for the vaccination. But the health officers speculate that due to the opaqueness of information, the central government has failed to gain their trust and many would avoid getting vaccinated, after the starting of the immunisation process.“I believe in scientific development, but it should also take people into confidence. In the US, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) holds public hearings where manufacturers present all data to the authorities, which are even available online for the public. Whereas in India, all the data is hidden. We don’t know if Covaxin works or not, as the regulating body isn’t providing its efficiency rate,” said Anant Bhan, public health expert. “Public wants to make an informative decision,” he added.The DCGI approved of Covaxin as ‘clinical trial mode’, but doctors aren’t aware if they will have to give written consent for the dosage, as done in clinical trials, and if a placebo (a replica of the actual drug) will also be part of it.“In clinical trials, volunteers are covered under insurance if they develop any adverse reaction. But in this case, I am not even aware if I will also get the benefit or not. If not, then why would any knowledgeable person take the risk?” said a senior epidemiologist.All India Drugs Action Network (AIDAN), a pan-India NGO has called Covaxin as an ‘untested and unproven vaccine’. “Concerning Covaxin, we are extremely shocked that the regulatory body has approved of the vaccine without any efficacy data. The phase-3 trials are currently ongoing and it is too early for data to meet the criterion for an interim analysis. The only human data available on safety and immunogenicity is on 755 participants in phase 1 and 2 trials. Other than this, the only data available are from animal studies,” said Malini Aisoli, co-convenor, AIDAN.At present, the state has achieved almost 95% recovery rate. On Sunday, for the first time since March, the city reported the lowest mortality rate with only three deaths related to Covid-19.In this background, the health workers are also contemplating to wait for a few months before taking the vaccine. “The pandemic curve in the city has flattened and things are under control. So, I would prefer waiting for a few months and see how the vaccine works. I don’t want to take the vaccine and worry about my health,” said a nurse with 15 years of experience, from King Edward Memorial (KEM), Hospital.Lastly, many senior doctors with over 25 years of experience in medicine have expressed dissatisfaction over the fact that they would have to go to vaccination centres for the dosages.“I am a resident of Bandra (West) but most of my hospitals where I consult are in South Mumbai. So, the question is, how the civic body would select my vaccination point. Also, it is impossible to stand in a long queue at these centres and leaving my patients and surgeries, to get vaccinated,” said a senior neurosurgeon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-health-workers-demand-transparency-before-covid-19-vaccination/story-wRvGVi5hRBSSYvxCpfSNqN.html

05-01-2021||Mumbai||4 years after Shiv Sena’s property tax waiver vow, Mumbai civic body now says it will issue bills||Four years after the Shiv Sena promised voters it would waive property tax of structures up to 500 square feet and won the Mumbai civic polls, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday said it would issue property-tax bills to owners of such structures, with a partial waiver. The Sena-led BMC’s decision, even as it said the state government in 2019 had waived only the general tax component, would mean owners of 1.85 lakh properties (all less than 500 square feet) in the city will be issued bills worth over ₹500 crore, considering the BMC issues notices for unpaid taxes of the past two years.While the Sena, earlier, had blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Devendra Fadnavis government for not clearing the entire proposal for waiving property tax for structures less than 500 square feet, there has been no development on the same in the past year even though Sena is the ruling party in the state. The Sena, ahead of the 2017 civic polls, had made a promise that if voted to power, it will waive off property tax for structures up to 500 square feet. However, the decision could not be implemented as the waiver mandated the state government to amend the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act. Following this, the BJP-Sena government led by Fadnavis in 2019 made the required amendment. However, the rider was that the waiver would only be limited for the general component of the tax, which is 10-20% of the total.There are six to seven other components, including sewage charge, drain charge, which the property owners would be required to be paid. But the BMC did not implement this, and owing to the sensitivity of the matter, the BMC did not issue bills to property owners, citing ambiguity, for two years now. Later, it had also sought some clarification from the state and the BMC’s law department said it has written to the state, seeking some clarification on the waiver.However, now the BMC has decided that it will issue bills to such property owners as the state government has waived off only the general component. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We have given the bills for printing and now all property owners will be issued bills for property tax. In case of properties below 500 square feet, we will issue bills, excluding the general component of the tax.” Velrasu added, “We had sought opinion from our law department and it has given us the opinion that excluding the general component, the BMC should levy property tax from owners of properties below 500 square feet.”Property tax is one of the biggest revenue avenues for BMC. It collects annually around ₹4,000 crore to ₹5,000 crore in property tax, and the outstanding amount is around₹1,500 crore.The BJP has now claimed that the Sena has backtracked on its promise made to voters. The BJP on Monday staged a walk-out from the BMC’s law committee meeting, where there was a discussion on levying property tax for structures below 500 square feet.Atul Shah, BJP corporator, said, “We walked out of the meeting as the BMC is not implementing the order, regarding the 500 square feet waiver. We asked BMC to clarify. The BMC said they will look into the matter after getting details. After this, we [BJP] decided to walk out.”Harshad Karkar, Sena corporator, said, “The BJP is doing only politics on the waiver of property tax. In the BJP-Sena government also, we had taken up this issue. Also, in the coming days, we are confident that our state government will completely waive off property tax for owners of properties below 500 square feet.”Meanwhile, Nikhil Desai, a civic activist said, “The Sena should have clarified it earlier in 2017 that only the general tax component will waived and not complete property tax. But now due to slowdown caused by Covid-19, if BMC cannot waive entire property tax, the Sena should promise to implement a complete waiver in the coming years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-years-after-shiv-sena-s-property-tax-waiver-vow-mumbai-civic-body-now-says-it-will-issue-bills/story-qClUDD5Gj6bxsdAsJgsK8O.html

GMADA had acquired 229 acres under land pooling scheme in 2015, but around 70 acres are under litigation. Under land pooling, farmers were offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land. Initially, 144 acres of land will be developed, said a senior GMADA official, privy to the development. According to the plan, residential plots measuring 100 to 500 square yards will come up over 29 acres, commercial sites will come up over 14 acres and 11 acres will be earmarked for institutions. Parks will be developed over 8 acres, waterworks will take up 2 acres and roads will be constructed over 28 acres. “We are hopeful of sending the draft to the higher authorities for final approval this month,” said the official.GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said: “Once we get the drawings, we will start the development within a month. Sector 90 is a prime location for both residential end users, commercial real estate markets and investors.”Industries to come up over 500 acres in Sector 101After the Punjab cabinet gave its nod to a new land pooling policy for industrial development, GMADA has begun the process to acquire 500 acres of land in Sector 101.The land acquisition process has already begun at two villages: Manuli and Durali. Industrial plots of 550 and 1,100 square yards will come up at these sites.“The department has started the process to get approvals under Section 4 (publication of preliminary notification and powers of officers thereupon) of the Land Acquisition Act, which will be done within a week,” said the official, adding that the entire process will be completed by March this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-chalks-out-plan-to-develop-mohali-s-sector-90/story-7xi91VIW3QUEqHXRVewJ5L.html

For this, 75 vaccination centres have also been identified.Expecting a roll-out of the vaccines by the second week of January, the BMC has converted a few more peripheral, maternity hospitals and primary health centres into vaccination centres. This has increased their total vaccination points to 75, which was only eight last week. With this, the BMC will be able to finish vaccinating the 1.25 lakh healthcare workers within just three days.“We are trying to increase the infrastructure as much as possible. We have identified 75 vaccination points. If needed, we can extend it further. This will enable us to vaccinate almost 50,000 beneficiaries every day,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Many doctors have raised the concern of waiting in long queues to get vaccinated which would affect their practice and patients have to suffer. Taking note of this, BMC is expanding the centres, so that healthcare workers don’t have to wait longer in lines.“We know the role of healthcare workers in the pandemic. So, we have created many vaccination points, which will help to save their time, while maintaining social distances,” he added.During the first phase of vaccination, around 1.25 lakh healthcare workers are expected to be immunised, while in the second phase, frontline workers such as police personnel and conservancy workers, will be vaccinated. In the third phase, around 50 lakh citizens will be vaccinated, of whom 30 lakh people are above 50 years of age, which are identified through ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey.The civic body is in the process of uploading the details of these citizens on the Co-WIN application, the centralised mobile application for registration of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-50-000-people-to-be-vaccinated-every-day-in-mumbai-75-vaccine-centres-identified/story-knlCj5CgL2yOAnpwwygZeL.html

It was a sunny day, even as India Meteorological Department had predicted rain along with thunderstorm in the city. According to IMD, the highest day temperature in January was recorded in 1991, when it had gone up to 31°C.“While the night remained warm, the day was sunny, leading to rise in temperature.

Despite repeated attempts, the Khans were unavailable for a comment at the time of going to print.The three had arrived from Dubai, but instead of quarantining at a facility, they went straight to their residences.A first information report (FIR) in this regard was filed against the three at the Khar police station on the complaint of Dr Sanjay Funde, a medical officer in H-West ward of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.The FIR stated that Arbaaz and Sohail on December 25, 2020, had arrived from Dubai, while Nirvaan arrived on December 30. They were supposed to undergo institutional quarantine for seven days, as per the rules, but they went straight to their homes, the police said.Funde said in the complaint that when he visited Sohail Khan’s residence, he told him that they had already made bookings at the Taj Land’s End hotel in Bandra, to quarantine, but on arrival when they tested negative for Covid, they decided to directly go to their homes.However, as per rules even if the test result comes negative, passengers are bound to quarantine for seven days, said Funde in the FIR.Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu said, “A case has been registered against the three under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (unlawful or negligent act) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-fir-against-arbaaz-sohail-khan-son-for-violating-covid-19-norms/story-4xpEDJsY65mmPKDl5isIfP.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||Congress’s Maharashtra unit may have a new chief soon||There is speculation that there may be a leadership change in the Congress’s state unit. Heavy lobbying for the post of state Congress chief has begun in Delhi.A close aide of incumbent state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said Thorat had offered to quit as state president. He met Congress general secretary KC Venugopal in Delhi on Monday in this regard.Last month, Congress in-charge of Maharashtra, HK Patil had said that the process of changing the state unit chief would begin after the appointment of a president for the Congress’s Mumbai unit. This assumes significance as the state Congress has been less active than other political parties since the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government came to power in the state.Days after Ashok Jagtap succeeded veteran Congress leader Eknath Gaikwad as Mumbai Congress president, aspirants for the position of state Congress chief have begun lobbying in Delhi. The central leadership of the party is expected to pick a non-Maratha face to head the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee in the wake of the changes in the state. Member of Rajya Sabha and the party’s Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav; Maharashtra Assembly speaker Nana Patole; women and child welfare minister Yashomati Thakur; and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar are all frontrunners for the post. Satav is believed to be a close confidant of Congress’s former president Rahul Gandhi, though a section of state leaders is opposing his appointment. Satav had opted out of Lok Sabha elections in 2019 though he was a sitting member of Parliament (MP). Patole is keen to give up the post of Assembly speaker for the top job in the state Congress. In the past, he had a stint in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and had quit as a sitting MP to return to Congress. According to a Congress leader in Delhi, the actual process of selecting a state chief is yet to begin, and it may take a few more months for an actual announcement. Patil is reportedly in favour of a change in leadership with immediate effect. At present, Thorat is the state Congress president, state revenue minister and Congress legislative party leader. Thorat’s detractors in the party have been demanding a change of guard in the state by pointing out that holding a key responsibility in the party while being a minister is against the Congress’s norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-s-maharashtra-unit-may-have-a-new-chief-soon/story-GiiWLNGIdycK9W53yFTO5I.html
05-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP demands arrest of NCP leader booked for rape; he claims charges are baseless||The state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit has demanded the arrest of Mehboob Shaikh, state president, youth wing of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The BJP alleged that the police are apathetic and not taking action against the political leader who was booked on rape charges in Aurangabad. Terming it a political conspiracy, Shaikh claimed his innocence and offered to undergo a narcoanalysis test to prove as much. Shaikh was booked for rape based on the complaint of a woman in Aurangabad, last week.“The state president of the NCP youth wing is being protected by those in the ruling party, hence the police are afraid of arresting the rape accused. Mehboob Shaikh should be immediately arrested and DCP (deputy commissioner of police) Deepak Girhe should be dismissed from the service for dereliction of duty,” said Chitra Wagh, state BJP vice-president, on Monday.“Going by the law, the accused should be immediately arrested so that he cannot pressure the victim or her family and destroy evidence. But the police have yet to make the arrest, even after eight days of filing the case,” she added.Shaikh denied the allegations and said they were unfounded and baseless. “It is a political conspiracy to defame me and my party. Following registration of the case, police had questioned me for seven hours. They have identified my mobile phone location on the days mentioned by the woman. They have also questioned all those who I have met on the day she claimed the rape was committed,” he said.“According to her complaint, I called her at a flat in Aurangabad on November 10 and said something objectionable. On November 14, the rape was committed. But the fact is, I was in Mumbai on November 10, to attend a programme at a party office, details of which are posted on our Facebook page. On November 14, I was in my village Shirur Kasar in Beed, to attend a Laxmi Puja event,” Shaikh claimed.The NCP leader said he was ready to undergo a narcoanalysis test and face the consequences if found guilty, but if not, I demand a narco test of the woman to find out those who are behind this conspiracy,” Shaikh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-demands-arrest-of-ncp-leader-booked-for-rape-he-claims-charges-are-baseless/story-yq7m540CsU3PMLSdkPNAKM.html

05-01-2021||City||Panchkula admn takes samples of 30 poultry workers to test for bird flu||The Panchkula administration on Monday collected samples of 30 poultry workers in Barwala-Raipur Rani belt to test for bird flu.Considered Asia’s second largest poultry belt, with daily production of more than 1 crore eggs and employing 15,000 workers at around 120 farms, the region has witnessed the death of over one lakh chickens in at least 10 farms in the past few days. Two days ago, the animal husbandry department had sent 80 blood samples of poultry and five carcasses to a laboratory to know the cause of these mass deaths. The report is awaited.Meanwhile, there have been reports of bird flu from various parts of the country, including Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh. Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds. It can spread to humans and can trigger a person-to-person transmission. While no updated mortality figures have been shared by the Panchkula administration, an official, requesting anonymity, said: “Deaths have increased manifold.” A poultry farmer in Barwala, who too did not wish to be named, said over one lakh chickens had died at his farm alone since December 17.Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula, said: “We have taken 30 samples from workers working at three poultry farms in the Barwala-Raipur Rani belt as a precautionary measure. The samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to test for avian influenza.”Instructions issued to poultry ownersThe health department has also issued instructions to poultry farm owners to restrict unnecessary movement and to immediately inform the Raipur Rani senior medical officer in case any worker shows flu-like symptoms. They have been asked to wear masks and take other precautions, said Dr Kaur.Dr Anil Kumar, deputy director, animal husbandry and dairying department, said: “We have asked the poultry farm owners to bury their dead chickens deep into the soil and spray sodium bicarbonate on the burial site.”Meanwhile, Darshan Kumar, president, Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association, maintained that the number of deaths had not gone up, and there was no impact on sales. Even Ashish Kumar, president of the meat market association in Chandigarh’s Sector 21, said the deaths were due to extreme cold and there was nothing to worry. He, too, said there had been no adverse impact on sales.Chandigarh wildlife dept on alert tooThe Chandigarh forest and wildlife department has sounded an alert in the city after reports of deaths of birds due to avian flu in neighbouring states. The veterinary department has been asked to keep tight vigil. “So far, no unnatural behaviour has been seen among migratory birds at Sukhna Lake or the sanctuary. That’s why no sample has been taken at the lake so far,” an official of the wildlife department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-admn-takes-samples-of-30-poultry-workers-to-test-for-bird-flu/story-dg9nLxpWfhEFwfH1MBtKNN.html
05-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh BJP, again, faces rebellion ahead of mayoral elections||Even a last-minute declaration of its mayoral candidate couldn’t help Bharatiya Janata Party from preventing an open rebellion in its ranks in Chandigarh on Monday.Only minutes after BJP nominee Ravi Kant Sharma filed his nomination, fellow party councillor Chanderwati Shukla too filed her papers as a rebel candidate for the mayor’s post. Soon afterwards, another councillor, Bharat Kumar, resigned from BJP in protest against Sharma’s selection.BJP enjoys majority in the House and would have sailed through if not for the rebellion. With Congress later in the day deciding to support the rebel candidate, BJP is now in a tight spot.Earlier, after much delay and suspense, BJP state president Arun Sood around 4.30pm declared outgoing senior deputy mayor Sharma as its candidate for the mayor’s post. Maheshinder Singh Sidhu was named for the senior deputy mayor’s and Farmila for the deputy mayor’s post.Miffed over this, accompanied by Congress leaders Devinder Singh Babla and Satish Kainth, Shukla filed her nomination even as her party leaders, including former mayor Asha Jaswal, tried to convince her against it. Babla proposed her name, and Kainth, who too had rebelled against BJP nominee in 2019 before moving to Congress, seconded it. There were also heated arguments between some BJP leaders and Shukla’s husband Gopal Shukla.“The party is rewarding those people with posts who repeatedly betrayed it. At the same time, it is ignoring people of Purvanchal, who have supported it wholeheartedly. It has to stop now,” said Gopal Shukla. He said the couple has no plans to leave the party as yet and will focus on winning the mayor elections.Party finds itself in a tight spotEven though BJP has 20 councillors in the House of 26, with a rebel candidate in the fray and one councillor tendering resignation, it finds itself in a precarious situation. There is a possibility that the winning candidate might need only 12 or 13 votes to get elected rather than 14.“BJP councillor Hira Negi and city MP Kirron Kher are unwell, and are unlikely to vote. Shiromani Akali Dal, a former ally, is likely to boycott the elections. If Bharat Kumar also absents on election day, there is possibility that only 12 votes will be required to win the elections,” said a BJP councillor, requesting anonymity. “Resentment is brewing in the party over Sharma’s candidature, and there are concerns that if it is not pacified immediately, this might even reverse the party’s dominant position in the House.”In 2019, rebel candidate Satish Kainth , supported by four Congress councillors and with the help of cross-voting by BJP councillors, had managed to get 11 votes. “Congress will support Chanderwati Shukla in mayoral elections. Congress candidate Devinder Singh Babla may withdraw nomination,” said Chandigarh Congress president Pardeep Chhabra.No cause for concern: City BJP chief Downplaying the rebellion, Sood said, “It is only a spontaneous expression of disappointment by councillors. Shuklas and Bharat are very responsible and dedicated party workers. We are confident that they will respect the party’s decisions, as we are already in talks with them.”Sood also contended that nomination papers of both Congress and Shukla are liable to be rejected after scrutiny. “When Babla and Kainth themselves are fighting the elections, they cannot propose or second another person’s candidature,” he said. While Babla filed papers for mayor’s post, Kainth is Congress nominee for the post of senior deputy mayor and Rajinder Kaur for deputy mayor. On the selection of party nominees, Sood said: “The decision was taken after consulting all BJP councillors, senior leaders and more than 80 party functionaries in the city. We have 20 councillors, and in five years, all of them cannot become mayor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-bjp-again-faces-rebellion-ahead-of-mayoral-elections/story-XpbRoYUg8QgdUQisDdQUTL.html

The judge said that the accused are entitled to bail considering the kind of investigation conducted and the type of the charge sheet that has been filed.“After going through the bail applications, reply and particularly charge sheet, I cannot help but notice the carelessness with which it has been prepared and filed. The investigation carried out, is perfunctory……..no statement under section CrPC 161 of any of the witnesses has been filed with the charge sheet.“The charge sheet was filed on May 22, 2020 in a very lackadaisical manner,” the judge said in a common order for all the three accused.While Aatir and Gulfam were formally arrested on April 8, 2020 from Mandoli Jail where they were lodged in connection to another case, Osama was arrested on April 10, 2020, from Tihar Jail .According to the charge sheet, the case was registered on the complaint of one fruit seller, Nasir Ahmad, who had contended that on Feb 25, 2020 at 11.00am, a group of more than 100 people came and looted fruits worth Rs. 2 lakh and burnt two fruit carts in his godown.The court, while granting bail, said, “Considering the period of custody of the accused that they have gone through and the nature of investigation and the charge sheet, all three bail applications are allowed”.The judge asked them not to leave the city without permission and not to tamper with the evidence or contact any witness.Communal riots had broken out in the north-east Delhi in February last year claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-accused-in-n-e-delhi-riots-granted-bail-by-court/story-gzyj2lJFa1HB6pRmAp1cPP.html

The arrest of Kapil Mehrania also helped investigators in cracking another robbery case that the suspect and two of his associates had committed in nearby Jamia Nagar minutes earlier, said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). The Ashoka Park robbery, police said, had taken place around 12.45am on Saturday, when a man was walking in the neighbourhood to meet a friend. “Mehrania and two of his friends approached the man and robbed his phone and R1,000 on cash,” said the DCP. The victim had described the scooter of the accused to be light blue in colour with a loud silencer. When the police checked CCTV footage, they found the scooter had moved towards Mathura Road after the crime. So, the police spoke to some people on the route and met a tea seller who said that three men riding a scooter of the same description had purchased cigarettes from him and then gone to Taimur Nagar. On the basis of this, the police zeroed down on the scooter rider as Mehrania and arrested him. The DCP said that he was found in possession of a pistol and two bullets. His interrogation revealed that the same night he and two of his friends had robbed another man in Batla House neighborhood of Jamia Nagar.

Senior officials said, these men used to allegedly receive the pornographic content on WhatsApp and through social media, and they circulated it by posting it on their own social media accounts. In a similar crackdown last year, police had arrested 26 men.Police have identified the arrested men as 26-year-old Ram Babu Kumar, Devender, 35, Abdul Rehman, 22, Mohammad Umar Alam, 22 and Santosh Kumar, 24. Police said, while Ram Babu is a school dropout and drives a cab, Umar Alam has completed his bachelor’s degree in business administration and sells mobile accessories online for a well-known e-commerce platform. Santosh is also a graduate and works as a delivery boy for a popular pizza chain, while both Devender and Abdul Rehman are school drop outs. Abdul is at present working as a data entry operator at a firm in Noida and Devender is aspiring to become a successful disc Jockey, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy said the cybercrime unit, through its operation “Masoom”, started last year as a crackdown against sexually offensive content against children, acted on the incident reports generated by the online social media and messaging platforms, which are being shared through international coordination mechanisms.“Our teams registered multiple cases on these reports and manhunt was launched to track the suspects indulging in circulation of child porn. Following the crackdown, the five men were arrested from different areas in Delhi. During interrogation, the five men told police that the pornographic material was either shared with them on WhatsApp or was shared with them on their social media profiles by some of their contacts. They said they used to then forward the same to their contacts further or posted on the internet through their own social media accounts,” Roy said.The DCP said efforts are being made to track the source of the content that these men used to receive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-arrested-in-delhi-police-crackdown-on-child-pornography/story-cHjyYZwzZQoBXX9sMVu9kJ.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi assembly panel tells MCDs to curb dust, cut pollution||The environment committee of the Delhi assembly on Monday summoned the commissioners of the three municipal corporations (MCDs) and asked them to submit action plans within seven days to curb dust levels and check air pollution.The House panel headed by Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Kalkaji MLA Atishi also directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to take strict action against errant officers so that accountability is fixed for the anti-pollution measures. In a series of tweets on Monday, Atishi said that the MCD officials failed to give basic details with regard to roads and mechanical sweeping in the areas within their jurisdiction.“Environment Committee summoned the 3 MCDs today regarding rising dust levels and air pollution in Delhi, and sought an explanation as to why mechanical sweeping was not being done. The negligence of all the three MCDs was shocking,” Atishi tweeted on Monday. “None of the MCDs even knew the total length of roads in their corporation area they are meant to sweep mechanically. There is no mechanism for fines or penalties in case the contractor running the machine does not clean the prescribed area,” she said in another tweet.MLA Ajay Dutt, who is a member of the committee, said all the three MCDs have been asked to submit an action plan for reducing dust pollution. The DPCC has been asked to take strict action against individual officers responsible for rising dust levels in Delhi, he said.The commissioners of the three MCDs did not comment on the matter. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the Delhi government and the assembly panel headed by Atishi are “targeting the BJP-ruled MCDs as part of its political agenda” ahead of the upcoming municipal polls in 2022. “The BJP stands committed to ensure clean environment in Delhi and BJP ruled civic bodies will cooperate with the Delhi government on such matters. But it sad to see the Delhi Assembly’s environment committee carrying out a hidden political agenda against the BJP ruled civic bodies by raising a new issue every other day,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“Everybody knows civic bodies are facing an economic crunch. The SDMC collects and gives crores of rupees of environment cess from vehicles entering in Delhi to the Delhi government which lie unspent for years. If the environment committee head, Atishi, is actually concerned to control dust pollution, she should ask the Delhi government to hand over funds of the environment cess to the civic bodies to ensure proper mechanical and manual sweeping in the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assembly-panel-tells-mcds-to-curb-dust-cut-pollution/story-cp02Q2RKPPMAge9eLfAeCK.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||DDA drafts norms for planned development in unauthorised colonies||A year after the Centre notified a policy to give ownership rights to people living in unauthorised colonies in Delhi, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has drafted norms for planned development in these areas. The new norms have provision for the amalgamation of plot, creating social infrastructure and redevelopment of colonies.The norms were approved by the land-owning agency in a meeting, which was chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, in December end. A senior DDA official said that the rules will soon be put in public domain for suggestions/objections, after which it will be sent to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for notification and added in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021.The DDA, along with the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), is working on a new master plan (MPD-2041), which is the vision document for planned development of the city for the next 20 years.In 2019, the Centre had passed the National Capital Territory of Delhi (Recognition of Property Rights of Residents in Unauthorised Colonies) Act, 2019, to confer ownership rights to residents living in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in the national capital. Under PM-UDAY (Pradhan Mantri- Unauthorized Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana), DDA has been giving ownership rights to property owners living in these colonies.A senior DDA official said, “The development control norms for unauthorised colonies is part of the NCT Regulations 2019. It is for the first time detailed norms have been prepared for unauthorised colonies. Now that they are getting the legal tag, there is a need to have norms for planned development/redevelopment in these areas.”The DDA has proposed two approaches for planned development: a regeneration scheme and regularisation of existing areas.DDA officials say that regeneration or redevelopment schemes will help residents. “Amalgamation of plots will be permitted. The minimum area required for availing the benefits under the scheme is 2000 sqm. For this, residents have to pool land and form a developer entity and submit a regeneration scheme to local authorities for approval,” said the official.The second option provided by DDA is for the regularisation of existing colonies wherein people can get the layout plans prepared and get individual building plans approved by the DDA. “The unauthorised colonies will have to meet certain planning requirements such as having access for fire-tenders, open space for evacuation for effective disaster management, structural safety of buildings at plot level, provision for social facilities like healthcare and education facilities nearby etc,” said the official.The developer entity or the RWA or the plot owner will have to pay for civic infrastructure development charges (sewer, water) to the service providing agency.Residents of unauthorised colonies say that the most important thing right now is ownership rights. Kuldeep Chillar, president of Raja Vihar colony where 10 residents were among the first to get ownership rights in January last year, said, “The priority is to get ownership of the property first. Development or redevelopment of the area is secondary. People will be able to do or plan development of the colony only when the government acknowledges our ownership.” Regularisation of unauthorised colonies in Delhi has been a longstanding issue and a poll issue since early 2000. While the Congress-led Delhi government has announced regularisation of authorised colonies in 2008, it couldn’t be done due to technical issues. Ahead of the assembly elections in 2020, the BJP had promised to confer ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies. In 2019, the BJP-led Centre passed a law in this regard. While urban planning experts welcomed the move by DDA to draft these norms, they say that redevelopment norms should be further relaxed as some of the provisions will be difficult to be implemented.Shamsher Singh, former chief town planner with erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi said, “It is good that they have drafted special norms for these colonies. For any planned development in these colonies, redevelopment is the only option. But these norms are more builder-oriented, as it will be difficult for RWAs or individuals to comply with them. As for paying infrastructure development charges, it will be difficult to get people to agree to it as last time when similar efforts were made, RWAs had refused to pay for layouts, which were prepared by the corporations.”The DDA’s decision to get a developer entity, Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with DDA, said, might pose a hurdle in the entire process. “In these colonies, on each plot there are three-four floors which have been sold individually. Getting people to agree to pool plots or amalgamate will be a challenge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-drafts-norms-for-planned-development-in-unauthorised-colonies/story-EHNChQt3JrFeFKfKmz1voJ.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||AAP to hold mohalla sabhas to highlight corruption in MCDs||The Aam Aadmi Party on Monday announced it will hold 2,500 mohalla sabhas (public meetings) across Delhi between January 7 and 15 to highlight the alleged rampant corruption within the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations (MCDs). Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said through these meetings, the Arvind Kejriwal led party will apprise the people of Delhi about the alleged “scams done by the BJP” during its tenure of 15 years in the civic bodies. He said the party has identified around 600 speakers who will address these mohalla sabhas. Pathak said members such as AAP MLAs, councillors, district in-charges, Lok Sabha in-charges, sangathan mantris and ward in-charges have been trained by the party to communicate with people during these public gatherings.“In the last 15 years, the BJP has transformed MCD to a den of corruption. Be it the Rs 2,500 crore scam about the north MCD waiving off dues of the South MCD or the fodder scam or Rs.1,400 crores house tax scam or Rs 180 crores scam, in every case the AAP has presented proper documents to expose the BJP‘s corruption. Now the AAP wants to take these issues within the MCD to every single citizen of Delhi,” said Pathak.In a statement, the party said the AAP will go door-to-door and apprise the people regarding these alleged scams done by the BJP. A senior party official said the campaign will be crucial for the AAP as MCD elections in Delhi are scheduled next year. “We will invite every citizen of Delhi to attend these mohalla sabhas. We will ask for the suggestions from the people of Delhi on the matters of corruption by the BJP. We will ask the people to give their opinion about the facts like the non-performance of the BJP ruled MCD. We will ask them about their opinion on how the BJP-ruled MCD has transformed Delhi into a Garbage Capital.”The BJP said the AAP, like also political parties is free to push its agenda. “But it is really shocking to see that the AAP’s politics always revolves around baseless allegations against the BJP ruled civic bodies. The AAP is running the Delhi government and if it feels that MCDs are corrupt then they should order an inquiry against the civic bodies through the local bodies wing of its urban development department or through any independent agency like CBI,” said Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.“On December 11, 2020, minister Satyendar Jain had announced that he has asked additional chief secretary of the urban development department to conduct an inquiry into a Rs. 2,500 crore scam related to a rent dispute between the North and South civic bodies and give report in 2 days. Over 3 weeks have lapsed and Delhi is yet to see any inquiry report, this is so because no scam took place. It’s a dirty political campaign by AAP to tarnish image of BJP ruled civic bodies,” the Delhi BJP said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-to-hold-mohalla-sabhas-to-highlight-corruption-in-mcds/story-2CKqobY2qtkIkjTxilEqzK.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||Police, paramilitary deployed in Chandni Chowk after temple demolition||A day after the North Delhi Municipal Corporation demolished the Hanuman temple in Chandni Chowk on the directions of the Delhi high court, there was heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces in the area. The political blame game over the issue also intensified with the AAP and the BJP stepping up the attack on each other, and the Congress accusing the two parties of demolishing the temple.Several shops remained closed in the area during the first half of the day when a protest march was taken out by a group against the temple’s demolition. Locals said police have cordoned off the area around the temple site.The temple was removed early Sunday morning following court orders for the Chandni Chowk redevelopment work--- which involves a plan to decongested and pedestrianise the heritage market along the 1.5-km road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid -- being executed by Shahjahanbad Redevelopment Corporation. As several right-wing organisations have given a call for protests at the temple site in Chandni Chowk on Tuesday, senior police officers said Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel will be deployed in the neighbourhood to maintain law and order.Officials said that since no public gathering or protests are allowed in Delhi due to the Covid-19 pandemic, no more than five persons will be allowed to assemble in the vicinity of the demolition site on Tuesday.“We will not stop any individual from visiting the place but groups will not be allowed near the site. No protests will be allowed. If anyone violates or attempts to violate the guidelines, we will take action as per law,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named, saying it was “sensitive” matter.The police placed four layers of iron barricades and deployed nearly 200 personnel so that people did not march towards the site in groups. “Similar security arrangements will be in place on Tuesday as well. The number of personnel may be increased, if required,” the officer cited above said.Pradeep Gupta, president of chemical traders’ association in the market, said, “Only shop owners and residents who live near the demolition site are allowed entry in the area, which has been cordoned-off. There is heavy police and para-military deployment in the area.”Traders in the market opened their shops after 1pm. “After police assured traders of their safety, traders opened their shop, though a little late,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal.Parties spar over the issueThe Aam Aadmi Party said the BJP-ruled North MCD demolished the temple in a suspicious manner, choosing 4am as the time to demolish the structure. The party also demanded action against the leaders responsible for demolition. Senior AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said, “The BJP-ruled municipal corporation first razed the ancient Hanuman temple at Chandni Chowk and is now accusing the AAP to escape public anger over this heinous crime. The BJP demolished the temple with the help of Delhi police when everybody was asleep. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and other top leaders of the BJP are directly responsible for demolition of the ancient Hanuman temple. The AAP demands stringent action against these leaders for committing such a heinous crime.”Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said Gupta he, along with senior BJP leaders, will meet Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal and request him to get the temple constructed in Chandni Chowk.He said, “The Delhi government’s religious committee is headed by Satyendar Jain and if he wanted, he could have resolved the matter in the committee itself. But he did not do so at the behest of the CM. During CM’s visit last year to assess the progress of the development work, various stakeholders and BJP leaders gave him a memorandum requesting to include the temple in the redevelopment project. But he ignored it.”The Congress blamed both the AAP and the BJP for temple demolition. Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said, “AAP and BJP are indulging in cheap publicity stunts. The North corporation and the Delhi government have admitted in the court that the temple is an encroachment. According to the procedure, if a temple or any other religious structure has to be removed for a development project, then they are allotted alternate place for relocation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-paramilitary-deployed-in-chandni-chowk-after-temple-demolition/story-SSFBD6N8z5ovapUpa9ReiI.html
05-01-2021||Delhi||Residents to be graded on basis of age, comorbidities for Covid vaccine shots in Delhi||The 42 lakh people, excluding health care and front line workers, who will be eligible for the Covid-19 vaccinations in Delhi in the first phase will be further graded on the basis of age and the number of comorbidities a person has, senior health officials said on Monday. With the Central government mulling to launch India’s Covid vaccination drive — the biggest such programme in the world — in a week’s time, state health officials urged people, especially senior citizens and those with co-morbidities not to panic and throng the vaccine centres once they are opened. “The Co-WIN mobile application is going to go live for everybody in a few days. One thing which the district administrations are being asked to publicise widely is that the government will only select individuals who are less than 50 with co-morbidities and those above 50 for the vaccination. The Co-WIN app will accept registrations with valid documents only if their names show up in the list within the app. Also, there will be an option to register through camps wherein distirct health officials will do the registration after basic verification. Just walking up to a vaccine centre will not work,” said Dr Suneela Garg, who is leading the Capital’s vaccination programme and is the director professor at the department of community medicine in Maulana Azad Medical College, University of Delhi.She, however, clarified that there will be division even within senior citizens and those having comorbidities. Read more| ‘From Andhra Pradesh to Assam’: How states are gearing up for Covid-19 vaccination“Within the third category also there are priorities. For example, if a person is 49 years of age and is diabetic and has hypertension and there is another person of the same age, who is diabetic, then priority will be given to the person with two or more comorbidities. Similarly, in the 50+ category, those who are above 60 years of age and with comorbidities will be given the vaccine shot first. The idea is to bring down Covid fatalities to bare minimum first,” she said. Senior government officials said database of those above 50 years is being taken from electoral rolls. “Just like before a polling day, voters get SMSes about their polling booth and other details, here also the same process will be followed. The beneficiary will have to wait for the SMS alert from the district after registration, to know the date, time and place of getting the vaccine shot,” said a health official. For vaccination of those below 50 years of age with co-morbidities, database from the door-to-door survey which started from November 20 in all the hot spots and containment zones of Delhi is likely to be considered.However, when HT contacted officers of at least five of the 11 districts of Delhi, all of them said there were no clear directions as on Monday evening on which datasets should be considered for compiling the “under-50 list”. “We have some data of all 11 districts from the multiple surveys conducted during the last seven months. But we don’t know whether that will be used or will some other mechanism will be used,” said one district magistrate. Read more| ‘Give me one week’s time’: Bharat Biotech chief on questions about Covaxin efficacyAnother revenue official from the New Delhi district said there is no dedicated or fresh survey being conducted as of now to identify those below 50 with comorbidities.The last such survey was conducted between November 20 and December 31, when the Delhi government had initiated a massive survey, covering 5.73 million people, to identify those with symptoms of Covid or a history of contact with a Covid patient. “In all likelihood, it is from this survey that all districts will be asked to compile the final lists of those having comorbidities. But no clear directions have been issued to districts yet. The focus currently is on preparing the lists of health care and front line workers,” said a senior official in the office of the divisional commissioner of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/residents-to-be-graded-on-basis-of-age-comorbidities-for-covid-vaccine-shots-in-delhi/story-UTDyiFQA0dCZY77AxmepuO.html

The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Ajit Pawar, deputy chief Minister of Maharashtra, at Mantralaya in Mumbai on Monday.Apart from home minister Anil Deshmukh, the police chiefs of the district’s three forces— Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad city and Pune rural —were present.As per the plan, the nine existing police stations will be divided into the jurisdictions of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad while parts of Pune rural police jurisdiction will be reduced, according to the distribution statement issued by Pune district administration. Pune cityPune city police will get three additional police stations, two from Pune rural (Lonikand and part of Loni Kalbhor), and six newly formed police stations, including Wagholi, Nanded City, Baner, Kalepadal, Phursungi, and Kharadi. “A part of Loni Kalbhor will be turned into Uruli Kanchan police station and that part will remain with Pune rural, while a leaner version of Loni Kalbhor will be a part of Pune city. From Haveli police station, Nanded City police station will be formed and added to Pune city police while Haveli will remain with Pune rural,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police. The city police will also need to increase the number of zones from its present count of five, according to the police. Pune city currently has approximately 9,000 personnel including staff and officers. “Manpower and increase in zones will happen eventually after the police stations are established which will take some time,” said Gupta. Pimpri-ChinchwadThe Pimpri-Chinchwad police will get three new police stations, including Ravet, Shirgaon and Mhalunge. A part of Chatuhshrungi and Hinjewadi will be combined to form Baner police station. The separate commissionerate for Pimpri-Chinchwad came into being on August 15, 2018. “Baner police station will absorb Bavdhan police outpost which was earlier in the jurisdiction of Hinjewadi police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police,” said Gupta. Pimpri-Chinchwad police will get Rs 2 crore for purchase of vehicles for police use. The force has a strength of 2,000 personnel which controls over 1.72 million population. Pune rural Pune rural police will hand over the responsibility of Lonikand, partial Loni Kalbhor and Haveli police stations to Pune city.

05-01-2021||Pune||Pune city’s accident ‘black spots’ put major roads in high-risk category||On Thursday, December 31, 2020, a woman pillion rider died, while her husband and two children escaped with various degrees of injuries, after the two-wheeler they were riding met with an accident involving a fuel tanker atop the Fursungi bridge in the Hadapsar area. According to the traffic police branch of the Pune police, there are 23 black spots in the city, prone to frequent accidents. These black spots have witnessed a number of accidents, including fatalities, over the past three years. However, according to police, a fewer number of accidents were recorded in 2020 due to the impact of the Covid-19-induced lockdown. According to statistics shared by the Pune police, there were 15 accidents at these black spots in 2020. These sites, as an HT spot check revealed, continue to be plagued with potholes, dim lights, ill-constructed and ill-designed speed-breakers.This is compounded by a lack of proper traffic enforcement and in some cases, the footpaths in a flawed alignment with the streets. Fursungi, where the accident took place last week, has been identified as an accident-prone spot by the police and has witnessed eight fatal accidents since 2017. The accident spot is close to a point on the bridge where what looks like a makeshift footpath, abruptly begins, reducing the width of the already-narrow road. No road sign informs vehicle users of the same. According Rahul Shrirame, deputy commission of police (traffic), the list of black spots has been prepared after a careful study of the frequency of accidents. “Due to Covid-19, the traffic volume has reduced on city roads, which has brought down the number of accidents at the blackspots in 2020 ,” said DCP Shrirame. The 23 traffic blackspots listed by the Pune traffic police include, Khadki Machine chowk in Kondhwa; Hemant Karkare chowk in Koregaon Park; Viman nagar chowk - Tata guard room - Kharadi dargah road in Viman nagar; Ramwadi octroi post - Sangamwadi parking in Yerawada; Vaiduwadi chowk–Phursungi phata in Hadapsar.Also, Walvekar chowk-Mundhwa railway bridge in Mundhwa; Sancheti hospital chowk –Shivajinagar; New Katraj Tunnel-Dari Pul - Bharati Vidyapeeth ; and Walvekar chowk in Sahakarnagar. As per the traffic police, the city had 27 accident-prone spots in 2017, 18 in 2018 and 23 in 2019. According to the citizen activists, the road department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is responsible for faulty planning of chowks and the city roads being in a state of disrepair. The PMC started several initiatives for road improvement and four road maintenance vans were deployed in four zones on a trial basis, to carry out on-spot road repairs wherever required. Later, the project seems to have been discontinued with no official willing to speak about it.The PMC then started a helpline number where citizens can call and report potholes, and request immediate repairs. Similarly, the PMC had even started surveying the speed breakers that do not adhere to the Indian road congress (IRC) guidelines, but the project has not been taken to its logical conclusion, till date. At present, traffic police personnel have been deployed at most of the crowded junctions, including the blackspots. Prashant Inamdar, convenor of the citizen forum Pedestrians First, said, “It is time that all the agencies of government, like PMC , Traffic Police, district administration and the planning authorities come together and find a holistic solution to this issue. We must bring down accident rates further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-city-s-accident-black-spots-put-major-roads-in-high-risk-category/story-8Tnn1VVPFcM0mC6PMscciL.html

The ruling parties also said that the BJP had sinned and the sin could not be washed off even if the party apologised to the people of Maharashtra.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut slams Urmila Matondkar amid reports that she bought Rs 3 cr office after joining Shiv Sena: ‘Wish I was as smart as you’A day after Ranaut took a dig at Shiv Sena leader and actor Urmila Matondkar, the ruling parties said the people of Maharashtra will take a stand against the betrayal by the BJP. Ranaut had criticised Matondkar over a new office purchased by the latter after joining Sena. “Dear@UrmilaMatondkar ji the houses I constructed through my hard work were demolished by Congress. By appeasing BJP, I was handed just 25-30 cases. Had I been as smart as you, I would have appeased Congress. How stupid I am, right?” Ranaut tweeted in Hindi.Dear @UrmilaMatondkar ji maine jo khud ki mehnat se ghar banaye woh bhi Congress tod rahi hai, sach mein BJP ko khush karke mere haath sirf 25-30 cases he lage hain, kash main bhi aapki tarah samajhdar hoti toh Congress ko khush karti, kitni bevakoof hoon main, nahin? pic.twitter.com/AScsUSLTAAShe was referring Matondkar purchasing an office in a plush commercial area for Rs3 crore weeks after joining the Shiv Sena. Matondkar replied to the allegation in a video on Sunday, in which she said the facts related to the office purchased by her were twisted. “It is true that I purchased an office at Pali Hill, but it has nothing to do with me joining the Shiv Sena. The office was purchased from the amount I had received after selling a flat in Andheri. Ever since I entered into politics, there have been attempts to defame me, but I am not going to deviate from my aim. These attempts are not going to make any difference to me. I am open to disclose all the documents of the transactions related to the office to anybody,” she said. Matondkar also said the documents related to both her transactions (sale and purchase of the two properties) were available with the authorities concerned and she could make them available for media persons too. Congress’s state general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said it has been established that BJP was behind the conspiracy to defame Maharashtra and Mumbai. “Ranaut herself has admitted that she was trying to make BJP happy. This proves that BJP was behind the conspiracy [which according to the Congress was planned during the Sushant Singh Rajput death case probe] to defame Mumbai Police and Maharashtra. BJP cannot get wash off its sin even if it apologises to the people of Maharashtra. We condemn BJP,” he said. Sawant said it was unfortunate that BJP supported the actor who likened Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and termed Mumbai Police “mafia”. NCP legislator and party chief Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar, too hit, out at BJP. “We should congratulate Kangana for her candid admission that she was targeting Maharashtra government to make BJP happy. By doing so, she has exposed BJP. Now the people of Maharashtra will decide about this betrayal by BJP,” he tweeted in Marathi. BJP spokesperson Vishwas Pathak dismissed the controversy. “It is a battle between two film actors and no serious attention needs to be given to it. BJP has nothing to do with it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-ncp-slam-bjp-over-kangana-ranaut-s-tweet-about-appeasing-the-party/story-O9hgK8fRwyzx4SUYaX2xkK.html

05-01-2021||World||China has been waging ‘cognitive warfare’ against Taiwan, warns think tank||China has been waging “cognitive warfare” against Taiwan by using misinformation and an army of online trolls as weapons to sway public opinion in Beijing’s favour, a local think tank reported.The report was published by the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, a government-funded think tank. It asserted that the effect of the warfare had been limited due to strong-anti Beijing sentiment, however, urged the Taiwan government to remain on guard in case it started to influence public sentiment to the extent that it influenced policy decisions, reported South China Morning Post.The think tank said that Beijing was trying to use both officials and unofficial channels, including Taiwanese and international media organisations and social media, to feed the public disinformation in an attempt to stoke resentment towards President Tsai Ing-wen’s government.“The cognitive warfare launched by the Chinese Communists became more aggressive in 2020 as reflected by its employment of social media platforms to spread misinformation and create cognitive confusion through stepping up of military intimidation,” the think tank said in its annual report issued in late December.China has tried to sell Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” as a model for cross-strait unification - a mission mainland leader Xi Jinping hopes to accomplish before he leaves office - but seeing what has happened to Hong Kong has scared Taiwanese away and undermined the efforts to sway opinion, Su Tzu-yun, a senior researcher at the institute, said.“The growing military intimidation of Taiwan and the introduction of the national security law that abuses human rights and sabotages the so-called ‘one country, two systems’ in Hong Kong serves only to create a counter effect as people in Taiwan become more resentful of Beijing than ever,” said Su.He said the government should set up a comprehensive fact-checking system to prevent misinformation.Alexander Huang Chieh-cheng, a professor of international relations and strategic study at Tamkang University in Taipei, said: “Cognitive warfare is part of the ‘grey zone conflict’ targeting the human brain to deceive, alter the enemy’s perceptions, and crush the will to defend via cyberspace, traditional media and shows of force (short of waging war).”He said the growing anti-Beijing sentiment in Taiwan had expanded the psychological distance across the Taiwan Strait.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.For several months, China’s People’s Liberation Army has been increasing military pressure on the island, sending warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone and stepping up military exercises on nearby islands, moves widely interpreted as a threat to Taipei, reported CNN.In order to bolster its defensive capabilities, Taiwan is building a submarine fleet to mitigate Chinese nefarious designs to invade the island or install a naval blockade.Chinese President Xi Jinping has already made his intentions clear about Taiwan as he has vowed to never allow the island to become independent and has refused to rule out the use of force if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-been-waging-cognitive-warfare-against-taiwan-warns-think-tank/story-mZHXiKnj9qK0riir7tnApK.html

(KFCC), saying it specialized in the manufacture of carbon materials and provided thousands of metric tonnes of materials to Iranian steel companies between December 2019 and June 2020.Among the 12 Iranian companies blacklisted are the Pasargad Steel Complex and the Gilan Steel Complex Co, both of which were designated under Executive Order 13871 for operating in the Iranian steel sector.The others are: Iran-based Middle East Mines and Mineral Industries Development Holding Co (MIDHCO), Khazar Steel Co, Vian Steel Complex, South Rouhina Steel Complex, Yazd Industrial Constructional Steel Rolling Mill, West Alborz Steel Complex, Esfarayen Industrial Complex, Bonab Steel Industry Complex, Sirjan Iranian Steel and Zarand Iranian Steel Co.The Treasury said it was also designating MIDHCO’s Germany-based subsidiary GMI Projects Hamburg GmbH, its China-based World Mining Industry Co Ltd and UK-based GMI Projects Ltd for being owned or controlled by MIDHCO.“The Trump Administration remains committed to denying revenue flowing to the Iranian regime as it continues to sponsor terrorist groups, support oppressive regimes, and seek weapons of mass destruction,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. Trump’s term ends on Jan. 20, when Democrat President-elect Joe Biden is to be sworn in to succeed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-iran-with-fresh-sanctions-as-trump-term-nears-end/story-4Me2JwZi8KW32QZynrZkpI.html

Its efforts however have not paid off and the app currently only has 2% of China’s music streaming market, behind KuGou Music, QQ Music, KuWo, and NetEase Cloud Music, according to Beijing-headquartered data intelligence company TalkingData.Xiami’s closure also comes after Chinese regulators announced that they had launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba, which beyond its core e-commerce business also operates in sectors such as financial services, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.However, it does not mark the end to Alibaba’s participation in the online streaming market. In September 2019, Alibaba invested $700 million in one of Xiami’s competitors, NetEase Cloud Music.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-alibaba-to-shut-down-xiami-music-app-next-month/story-S1Q6kzKkOt4Q4aQUvVIwfI.html
05-01-2021||World||US Attorney in Eastern Virginia announces resignation||The leader of one of the nation’s most prominent US Attorney’s offices said Tuesday he is resigning after nearly three years of prosecuting terrorists, spies and political operatives.G. Zachary Terwilliger, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, is joining the private sector with a post at the Vinson and Elkins law firm.Terwilliger, 39, is the youngest US Attorney in the country and has led the office since 2018, but his connections to the office go back to 1999, when he worked there as an intern. He also served for years there as a line prosecutor.It is common for US attorneys to resign their posts during presidential transitions, giving the new president an opportunity to appoint his own prosecutors.The office routinely handles high-profile prosecutions. Last year, the office obtained indictments against accused Islamic state members Alexanda Amon Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, British nationals known as the “Beatles” because they were two members of an English-accented foursome that allegedly participated in holding and executing Western hostages.Building the case and bringing the pair to Virginia required years of work, domestically and internationally, with competition from other US Attorney offices looking to build the case.“To have those two individuals sitting in the Eastern District of Virginia — innocent until proven guilty — but to have them here on US soil knowing everything that went into the charges being built, getting the evidence we needed from the U.K. and then the lengths to make sure they were safely in custody during a global pandemic ... Iogistically, that was probably one of most difficult cases I’ve ever seen,” he said.Terwilliger, a Republican whose father, George Terwilliger, was a a deputy attorney general and acting attorney general in GOP administrations, is leaving at a time when the Justice Department faces criticism that it became politicized during the Trump administration and particularly under US Attorney General William Barr.Terwilliger said he expects some people will always hold it against him that he was an appointee of President Donald Trump, but he does not think most people feel that way, and he said his independence as a prosecutor was never compromised.“I didn’t see things done out of politics,” he said in an interview. “I can’t think of a single instance where someone turned around said ‘You will do this. This is your decision.’”Before his time as US Attorney, he served as chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who wrote the memo that laid out justification for firing FBI Director James Comey for his handling of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, when most people believe Trump wanted Comey fired for pursuing the investigation into Russian election interference.Rosenstein’s memo specifically faulted Comey for a news conference he held in 2016, without informing the attorney general, that the investigation had concluded with insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges, but still commenting that Clinton and her team had been “extremely careless” in their handling of classified information.“We all shared in the same belief that that press conference was highly inappropriate and just wrong,” Terwilliger said. “Those reasons were absolutely legitimate. .. The FBI director is not an independent contractor. There’s an org chart. He or she may be appointed for 10 years but they report to the attorney general and the deputy attorney general, and that was the problem with what Director Comey did.”National security cases like the Beatles prosecution, and successful espionage prosecutions of Chinese spies Kevin Mallory and Jerry Lee, have always been a priority in the Eastern District of Virginia, home to the Pentagon and CIA. Terwilliger also sought to make violent crimes and white-collar crimes a priority. He brought multiple fraud cases related to the coronavirus pandemic. He focused on violent crimes in the Tri-Cities region south of Richmond and in Hampton Roads, where he says some beleaguered communities needed federal partners to help chip away at unacceptable crime rates.“He helped put actual boots on the ground here in Petersburg. He traveled to the city, walked the streets and met with citizens, and ensured them that he was committed to providing the city with the necessary resources,” said Petersburg police Chief Travis Christian in a statement.Sometimes his priorities drew criticism. Early in his tenure, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema criticized the number of cases he brought for illegal entry into the US Terwilliger, though, defended the policy, saying the majority of those cases originated because of some other underlying crime, like domestic violence or drunken driving.Terwilliger’s resignation takes effect Jan. 15. First Assistant Raj Parekh will serve as acting US Attorney and is the first minority to lead the office in its 232-year history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-in-eastern-virginia-announces-resignation/story-NaKBBFcxzHdPUj7ocOSJkK.html

05-01-2021||World||Georgia votes to decide who controls Senate||The US state of Georgia will wrap up polling on Tuesday evening in two key elections that will determine which party will control the 100-member Senate.If Democrats win both the seats that are up for grabs, the Senate will have a split majority of 50 seats each for the two parties, which will put Democrats in control of the chamber – given that the tie-breaking vote will come from vice president-elect Kamal Harris, a Democrat. Democrats already control the House of Representatives. President-elect Joe Biden will have an easier time pursing his legislative agenda if his party wins these two seats in Georgia.If Republicans win the two seats, the GOP will continue to hold sway over the Senate that they currently control.Democrats Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Reverend Raphael Warnock, a preacher, are running to unseat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.“Georgia, there is no one in America with more power to make it happen than you, the citizens of Georgia,” Biden said at an election rally in Atlanta, Georgia on Monday. “By electing Jon and the Reverend, you can break the gridlock that has gripped Washington and this nation. With their votes in the Senate, we’ll be able to make the progress we need to make on jobs and health care and justice and the environment and so many other things.”More than 3 million voters in Georgia have already cast their votes in the runoff election through early in-person and mail-in voting.Also Read | Georgia’s economic might on display in race to control SenatePresident Donald Trump held an election rally for Loeffler and Perdue, who is in quarantine after exposure to a person infected with Covid-19, in another part of the state. He spent more time airing unproven claims of election fraud that he has alleged caused his defeat in the state, a Republican stronghold.“Hello, Georgia. By the way, there is no way we lost Georgia. There’s no way,” Trump said as he took the stage. “That was a rigged election. But we are still fighting it.”The outgoing US president used the rally to drum up support from Republicans for his election fraud charges that lawmakers allied to Trump are planning will cite on Wednesday to force congress to overturn his poll defeat. The Senate and the House will meet in a joint session to certify election results sent in by the states - the last stage in the presidential election process. The efforts are expected to fail because they don’t have the numbers and or the constitutional authority to block the certification of Biden’s victory. Many Republicans, too, are opposed to this bid.Trump will also address a rally in Washington, DC to further his case. The US capital is bracing for violence, and as his supporters have begun arriving there, city officials have called in the National Guard, arrested a leader of the group Proud Boys, and prohibited firearms at the site of the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-votes-to-decide-who-controls-senate/story-iN8mDe7fbtkef5h7bwH3VK.html

Representatives for YouTube didn’t respond to requests for comment, and it’s not yet clear what triggered the suspension.Blocking a news brand run by billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch marks one of YouTube’s highest profile suspensions. It’s previously taken down swathes of content including the account of the Trump-supporting One America News Network, citing breaches of rules.Murdoch’s News Corp. bought TalkRadio’s owner Wireless Group in 2016, and has recently expanded its digital broadcast media offering further. He’s been an outspoken critic of Silicon Valley technology firms as he pushes for what he deems a fairer share of their advertising revenue.TalkRadio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer complained about the move on Twitter. Without naming YouTube specifically, she asked government Minister Michael Gove about big tech “censorship” on her Tuesday morning show.TalkRadio calls itself the “home of free speech” in its Twitter biography and its presenters have questioned the wisdom of government lockdown measures aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.“We regularly interrogate government data and we have controls in place,” TalkRadio said. “We use verifiable sources and give space to a careful selection of voices and opinions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-suspends-murdoch-backed-radio-station-in-uk/story-8oT8agl7DEQ5OeFLg0H6wO.html
05-01-2021||World||Divorces and marriages tumbled in US during Covid, study shows||The number of Americans getting divorced plummeted last year, while the marriage rate also dropped precipitously as thousands of weddings were postponed or cancelled, according to a new study.The early look at Covid-19’s effect on US divorce and marriage statistics comes from Bowling Green State University’s Center for Family and Demographic Research, which analyzed five states that have released monthly numbers for much of last year.The data contradict early predictions that Covid-19 and the stresses of quarantine would cause divorce rates to surge.In Florida, the largest state analyzed, marriage numbers from March through September were 33% lower than researchers would have expected based on previous years’ trends. Divorces in the Sunshine State dropped 28%.If trends in Florida and other states -- Arizona, New Hampshire, Missouri, and Oregon -- were repeated nationwide, the US had an estimated “shortfall” of 339,917 marriages and 191,053 divorces, according to the paper by Bowling Green’s Wendy Manning and Krista Payne. In 2019, there were roughly 2.2 million marriages in the US, and about 1 million divorces.The sharp decline in divorce doesn’t mean couples are necessarily happier together in lockdown. Instead, the pandemic may be forcing dissatisfied spouses to stay together for practical reasons.“Divorce can be expensive, and couples may be reluctant while facing economic uncertainty and/or health issues,” said Manning, a sociology professor who’s director of the Center for Family and Demographic Research. “These folks may feel ‘stuck’ and they could be delaying divorce until life feels more normal.”Both divorce and marriage rates have been declining for years, as Americans have changed how they approach the institution of matrimony. Young people are waiting longer to tie the knot, and many couples are forgoing marriage entirely, choosing to live together without a wedding. Those who do marry tend to be better educated and more affluent, a self-selected group that’s also likelier to stay together.In 2019, the US divorce rate was 15.5 per 1,000 married women, according to the National Center for Family & Marriage Research, down from its peak of 22.6 in 1980.A dearth of weddings and divorces in March and April of 2020 was probably inevitable. Government offices were closed and Americans were being told to stay home. However, the data don’t show a big rebound in the summer and autumn -- when states mostly re-opened -- that would reflect a large pent-up demand from the spring.One exception is Arizona, where divorce numbers did bounce back over the summer to bring the state slightly above expected levels. In New Hampshire, meanwhile, data from March through November show a 10.1% drop in marriage and a 36% plunge in divorce.In the first half of 2020, there were signs of an impending spike in divorce, with reports of a surge of filings in China as it came out of quarantine, and a disturbing rise in domestic violence arrests and calls to the police while US cities were under stay-at-home orders in March. But Manning said surveys conducted at Bowling Green show most couples report little change in the amount of conflict in their marriages.Even if couples want a divorce right now, “for lots of people, it’s just not practical,” said Linda Ravdin, an attorney at Pasternak & Fidis in Bethesda, Maryland. While couples with relatively simple divorces have been able to reach deals, she said, Covid-19 makes other negotiations difficult. Child custody decisions are hard when schools and daycare centres are closed. Financial settlements are trickier when spouses are out of work or uncertain what the economy holds for their jobs or businesses.“People are not ready to make big decisions,” Ravdin said. “People are -- to their credit -- trying to do the right thing by their children, by themselves, realizing we’re all in this predicament together.”For marriage in the US, a key question is how many weddings called off in 2020 will eventually go ahead. If a significant number don’t, Covid-19 could have a lasting impact on a generation that was already cautious about tying the knot. In 2019, Bowling Green’s figures show, there were just 30.5 marriages per 1,000 unmarried American women, about a third of the rate’s peaks in the early and mid-20th century.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divorces-and-marriages-tumbled-in-us-during-covid-study-shows/story-LNUJHIFvHOhQ1n81sUW7EP.html
05-01-2021||World||How safe is it to switch and space Covid-19 vaccine doses?||Britain and other nations are considering ways to stretch scarce supplies of Covid-19 vaccines, including by delaying second doses, reducing dose sizes and switching vaccine types between the first and second shots.The proposals have generated fierce debate among scientists. Here is the rationale behind, and criticism of, these alternative strategies:WHY DELAY THE SECOND DOSE?In clinical trials, companies tested specific doses of their vaccines at precise time intervals to generate evidence showing how well they work. All Covid-19 vaccines approved, so far, are designed to teach the immune system to recognise and defend against the virus with a first dose, and then provide a second booster dose to reinforce that lesson.Faced with a fast-spreading pandemic and new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, some countries are hoping to widen immunisation by giving some protection to as many people as possible with a first dose, and delaying second doses.Maximising the number of people who have partial immunity “should reduce the number of severe Covid-19 cases and thus alleviate the burden on hospitals”, said Michael Head, a global health expert at Britain’s University of Southampton.WHAT ABOUT SWITCHING BETWEEN Covid VACCINES?Mixing or switching between Covid-19 vaccines is largely driven by the same aim - vaccinating as many people as possible as the pandemic still rages.Giving a priming dose of one vaccine and a booster dose of another offers flexibility to offer whichever shots are available, rather than holding shots back so individuals always get both doses of the same vaccine.HAVE THESE STRATEGIES BEEN TESTED IN RIGOROUS TRIALS?No.None of the late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trials compared these dose-sparing strategies or the effects of mixing vaccine types, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).Officials have cited limited evidence from trials that the Pfizer/BioNTech , the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and the Moderna vaccines all confer some protection against Covid-19 after the first dose.Britain’s MHRA health regulator said on Dec. 30 it had found an 80% success rate for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine when two full doses are administered, three months apart, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found.The UK government’s vaccine advisory committee said on Dec. 31 that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine conferred 89% protection from two weeks after the first dose, and that for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine “the evidence shows that the initial dose ... offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus”. It did not give detailed data.Moderna reported its vaccine was 80% protective after one dose, with efficacy peaking two weeks after the first shot.But there is no long-term evidence that any of these vaccines will offer lasting immunity based on just one dose, or how effective they will be if the second dose is delayed.BioNTech and Pfizer warned on Monday they had no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first.Evans said that ideally “it is safest and most cautious” to use vaccines in conditions exactly matching those of their trials, but added: “In the real world, this is never so.”Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday the United States was unlikely to delay giving second doses.“We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing,” he said.Likewise, scientists have raised concerns over the idea of mixing two different types of vaccines. Some experts speculate that, because all of the vaccines target the same outer “spike” protein of the virus, they could work together to train the body to fight off the virus.But there is no evidence this approach will work.“There is literally zero data. It has not been tested, or if it has been tested, the data have not been made available,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.WHAT ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF VACCINE IN EACH DOSE?In the United States, some health officials are considering offering half doses of Moderna’s vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 55. There is some clinical trial data backing this strategy.Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the U.S. vaccine programme Operation Warp Speed, told CBS on Sunday that evidence from a Moderna trial showed the half dose induced an “identical immune response” to the higher 100 microgram dose in adults aged 55 and under. He said the U.S. government was discussing the issue with Moderna and regulators.Slaoui said he believed injecting half of the volume of vaccine was “a more responsible approach that would be based on facts and data”.Several U.S. scientists agreed, but noted the data was not publicly available. “It’s very fuzzy. I want to see that data,” said Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.SO ARE THESE STRATEGIES SAFE? AND WILL THEY WORK?It’s not clear.While there is no scientific evidence on the impact of delaying Covid-19 vaccine doses, some experts believe it could be safe to wait and the potential payoff in protecting a larger swath of the population may be worth it.Others aren’t so sure.“There’s just no data,” said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain’s Reading University.The British Society of Immunology said in a statement on Monday that delaying a second dose by eight weeks “would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response”. It added that it would not expect any extra safety risks from the delay beyond the potential increased risk of disease during the interim between doses.Some scientists also said that while there was no evidence to support the strategy of mixing vaccine doses from different manufacturers - a method known as heterologous prime-boost - evidence from other vaccines provided some reassurance.“Based on previous studies which combine different vaccine types, a combination of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines is likely to be safe,” said Helen Fletcher, a professor of immunology at LSHTM.Topol called the mix-and-match strategy “a big mistake” with “unpredictable” results - including the potential for adverse reactions or a significant drop-off in efficacy. “It makes no sense whatsoever,” he said.Some worry about safety issues, particularly with delaying the second dose for several weeks. The gap could allow time for the virus to evolve and develop resistance to the vaccine.Weak antibody protection could also increase the risk of having an abnormal immune response - such as antibody-dependent enhancement - when people encounter the real virus, Topol said.HOW PRACTICAL IS IT TO PROLONG DOSING TIME SCHEDULES?Extending the interval poses adherence risks, raising the chance people may forget or fail to return for a second dose.It also increases the length of time during which they are less than optimally protected, and it could make it harder for health authorities to keep track of who has had which vaccine, when, and how often.Given these risks, immunology and public health experts say clear communication is imperative to ensure people understand that although dosing schedules may be subject to change, two Covid-19 vaccine doses are needed to give the best protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-safe-is-it-to-switch-and-space-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-iflA8aePa8M3aZrperjMbJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Pandemic haunts new year as virus growth outpaces vaccines||Despite growing vaccine access, January is looking grim around the globe as the virus resurges and reshapes itself from Britain to Japan to California, filling hospitals and threatening livelihoods anew as governments lock down businesses and race to find solutions.Mexico City’s hospitals hold more virus patients than they ever have. Germany reported one of its highest daily death tolls to date Tuesday, and South African undertakers are struggling to keep up with virus mortalities. Even pandemic success story Thailand is fighting an unexpected wave of infections.And as doctors face or brace for rising numbers of Covid-19 patients after end-of-year holiday gatherings, more and more countries are reporting cases of a new, more contagious virus variant that has already swept across Britain.January is going to be “a tough one,” Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, told The Associated Press. “This idea that seems to be ‘Ah, we’re all sick of it. We want to look at something else. Oh, this doesn’t apply to me’ .... That’s got to go away. It really is all hands on deck.”While Britain rolled out a second vaccine this week and some US states are starting to give booster shots from the country’s first vaccine, access to inoculations globally is sharply unequal. The supply also isn’t remotely close to meeting the massive demand needed to fight a microscopic foe that has already killed over 1.85 million people.“We’re at intense pandemic in Europe, intense pandemic in the US,” Harris said. “The more you can bring the transmission down, the better chance you have of your vaccine vaccination strategy working.”England is facing a third national lockdown that will last at least six weeks, as authorities struggle to stem a surge in Covid-19 infections that is threatening to overwhelm its hospitals.Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a tough new stay-at-home order for England that takes effect at midnight Tuesday and includes shutting schools, restaurants and all non-essential shops, and won’t be reviewed until at least mid-February. Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon imposed a lockdown that began Tuesday.The two leaders said the restrictions were needed to protect the National Health Service amid the emergence of new, more contagious virus variant that has sent daily infections, hospitalizations and deaths soaring.The NHS “is going through probably the toughest time in living memory,″ said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst of the King’s Fund think-tank. He said some UK emergency rooms have waiting times of 12 hours and doctors were treating people lined up in ambulances outside.Elsewhere in Europe, Italy extended its Christmas lockdown, Spain is restricting travel and Germany’s chancellor was meeting Tuesday with state governors to decide how long to extend the latest lockdown. Cyprus and France are likely to announce tougher measures Thursday, and Ukraine is closing schools and restaurants starting Friday.In Latin America, some warn the worse is yet to come.Mexico’s capital has more virus patients than at any point in the pandemic and is flying in doctors from less hard-hit states. Its beach resorts are readying for more cases after thousands of US and European tourists visited over the holidays.“Probably in the third week of January, we are going to see the system stressed more, that there will be more ambulatory cases and cases requiring hospitalization,” said Dr. Mauricio Rodriguez of Mexico’s National Autonomous University. He blamed the rise on fatigue with social distancing, mixed messages from public figures and Mexicans lowering their guard during the holidays.Beach parties were blamed for surging cases in Argentina, notably among young people, and the government is considering new restrictions.In South Africa, the continent’s hardest-hit nation, authorities re-imposed a curfew, banned liquor sales and closed most beaches. Zimbabwe reintroduced a curfew, banned public gatherings, and indefinitely suspended the opening of schools.South Africa’s undertakers are struggling to cope with the rise in deaths, National Funeral Practitioners Association of SA President Muzi Hlengwa told state broadcaster SABC.“It is something that you have never seen before. ... We have run out of coffins, we have run out of space at the mortuary,” he said. “We normally have cremations during the day but now we have cremations even at night.”The pandemic is even reaching countries that seemed to have the virus under control.Thailand is facing an unexpected surge that has infected thousands in a few weeks blamed on complacency and poor planning. The government is locking down large parts of the country, including the capital Bangkok, and considering tougher measures.“We don’t want to lock down the entire country because we know what the problems are, so can you all lock down yourselves?” Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha pleaded with his nation.Japan getting ready to declare a state of emergency this week, beefing up border controls and speeding up vaccine approval after a surge of cases around New Year’s Eve.Italy has been trying to control its latest surge with local measures. After two months of restrictions, infections have plateaued but hospitals are still under pressure, hundreds of people are still dying every day and officials fear cases will surge again due to holiday get-togethers.And holiday worries aren’t over now that 2021 has arrived.Pope Francis abandoned an annual ritual of baptizing babies in the Sistine Chapel tied to Wednesday’s Epiphany holiday. Orthodox Christian countries like Russia and Greece could face more infections after they celebrate Christmas on Thursday. And China is closing schools early ahead of next month’s Lunar New Year holiday, telling migrant workers not to go home and tourists to avoid Beijing.Vaccines offer an exit, but are getting off to a slow start in many places. Some US states are struggling to secure enough shots and organize vaccinations. The Netherlands has come under heavy criticism for being the last European Union nation to start inoculations, which it will do Wednesday. Australia isn’t planning to do so until March. And most poorer countries are even farther behind.Opposition politician Geert Wilders called the Dutch government “the village idiot of Europe.”Yet India offers a glimmer of hope. Its infection rate is down significantly from a September peak, and the country is kicking off one of the largest inoculation programs in the world, aiming at vaccinating 300 million people by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-haunts-new-year-as-virus-growth-outpaces-vaccines/story-rZEs69KGGYGj9FrSJymf3O.html
05-01-2021||World||Switzerland says residents who want a Covid-19 shot should get one by summer||Everyone in Switzerland who wants to be vaccinated against Covid-19 should be able to get a shot by summer, a Swiss health official said on Tuesday, as the nation anticipates imminent approval of a second vaccine, this one from Moderna. With 233,000 doses delivered by Pfizer and BioNTech, so far, the country is expecting vaccine deliveries to hit at least 1.5 million doses by the end of February, provided Moderna’s shot wins the regulator’s blessing.The shots require two doses several weeks apart, to confer maximum protection shown in clinical trials to be around 95%. Switzerland is concentrating initial shots on older people, including in nursing homes, and those with chronic diseases. Switzerland has ordered a total of about 15 million doses, including from other manufacturers whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) to buy shots. High global demand from virtually everywhere, combined with limited production, means there is too little to go around.“We continue to be in negotiations, to see how we can boost volumes,” said Nora Kronig, head of the Swiss Federal Health Ministry’s international division that is leading talks with companies, during a press conference in Bern.Kronig declined to say if talks extend to companies including Johnson & Johnson, which is due shortly to release results of clinical trials of its one-dose vaccine in tens of thousands of volunteers.Switzerland has, so far, recorded 28 documented cases of Covid-19 infections caused by an especially infectious variant of the new coronavirus that has been circulating rapidly in Britain. That’s up from just a handful reported late last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-says-residents-who-want-a-covid-19-shot-should-get-one-by-summer/story-LJyd50b3fMXYiJs0Njh9qJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Japan weighs state of emergency in Tokyo area as Covid-19 cases surge||Japan will decide this week whether to impose a state of emergency in the Tokyo area, a top official said on Tuesday as daily Covid-19 infections hit a record, a move some derided as too little, too late in a nation set to host the Olympics.The government’s top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said a decision would likely come on Thursday, after local media said a state of emergency, the second since the pandemic began, would take effect by Friday and last about a month. A panel of experts advising Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga later recommended that restriction to curb a surge in coronavirus cases be imposed as soon as possible.“There is a risk of nationwide and rapid spread of infections taking place if the infection situation in Tokyo and surrounding regions does not subside,” Shigeru Omi, head of the panel, told a news conference. New cases in Tokyo surged to 1,278 on Tuesday, the second highest daily total since the pandemic began, with the national daily tally reaching a record 4,670, public broadcaster NHK reported.Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures, which have requested an emergency declaration, asked residents to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings after 8 p.m. from Friday until at least the end of the month, and said restaurants must close by that time.But measures are likely to be far less sweeping than they were during last year’s roughly month-long state of emergency, during which schools and none-essential businesses shut down, as the government seeks to keep economic damage to a minimum.A second lockdown in and around Japan’s capital could cause the economy to contract in the first quarter of this year, analysts said. Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda said the government wouldn’t seek to close all schools, leaving that decision to local authorities.Senior ruling party lawmaker Hiroshige Seko said later on Tuesday the government should declare the state of emergency for a month and later extend it if needed. Suga said on Monday that “limited, concentrated measures” would be most effective, but details remained unclear, including whether sports venues, theatres and cinemas would close.A lack of legal teeth to enforce measures means they must be couched as “requests”, although a bill may be submitted later this year to rectify this. Frustration reignsFrustration reigned on social media, with many questioning the piecemeal measures, especially as the country is still planning to host the Olympics, postponed from 2020 but set to open in under 200 days.“Do you really think you can extinguish a fire by leaving it until it’s big and then just splashing it with water from a bucket?” wrote user Kei Koike.Suga’s initial political honeymoon after taking up his post last September has ended, his support rating battered by criticism of his response to the virus and his decision to attend a group steak dinner in defiance of his own calls for caution.He has also drawn criticism for his initial reluctance to pause a domestic travel subsidy programme.“They asked us to stay home and promoted travel, they ask us to eat in small groups and promote restaurants. Their deeds are the exact opposite of their words,” wrote another Twitter user, Jinrui Minakyou.Since the start of the pandemic, Japan has recorded more than 245,000 cases and about 3,600 deaths - far fewer than many other countries. But the numbers have been climbing rapidly.Though Suga has pledged to have enough vaccine supply for the nation’s population of 126 million, Japan has yet to approve any for use and only aims to begin inoculations by the end of February.Pfizer Inc last month became the first drugmaker to apply for Japanese approval of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Japan has arranged to buy 120 million doses, or enough to inoculate 60 million people. But when those shots will be available remains unclear, as Pfizer has encountered production and roll-out snags in other parts of the world where its vaccine has already been approved for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-weighs-state-of-emergency-in-tokyo-area-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-c2SCzpRgCA96KldlgdIjBJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Fake Covid-19 vaccines are flooding the dark web as slow vaccine rollout frustrates||As millions of people await their turn to get a Covid-19 vaccine that could be months away, scammers online, in emails and on messaging apps are luring victims with claims they can deliver shots within days for as little as $150.Covid-19 vaccine scams are on the rise, according to European and US government officials who are warning the public of fraudsters out for money and personal data.A Reuters search online, in dark web forums and on messaging app Telegram found seven different offers for alleged Covid-19 vaccines.Scams include emails promising entry to supposedly secret lists for early vaccine access and robocallers impersonating government agencies. Message boards on the so-called dark web have added Covid-19 vaccines to more traditional illicit goods for sale. The US FBI and Interpol, among others, have warned of emerging pandemic-related fraud schemes, saying false cures and vaccines advertised on fake websites could pose cyber threats and a significant risk to peoples’ health, or even lives.Website domains containing the word vaccine in combination with Covid-19 or coronavirus more than doubled since October to roughly 2,500 in November, when the first legitimate vaccines were nearing regulatory approval, according to cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, which is tracking Covid-19 fraud online.“So far a lot of these domains just appear to be opportunistic registrations, but some are going to be used for phishing attempts to have people click on (malicious) links,” said Lindsay Kaye, director of operational outcomes at Recorded Future.Kaye said her team, which also scours the dark web, so far has not come across any legitimate vaccine diverted from healthcare facilities or national stockpiles.The scams are preying on concerns about the far slower-than-promised rollout of vaccines to protect against the virus that has claimed more than 1.8 million lives worldwide so far. Most people will likely have to wait well into the spring, or even summer, to get their shot.In the United States, only about 4.5 million people had received their first shot as of Monday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. That is a fraction of the 20 million who were supposed to have been vaccinated by the end of 2020, according to earlier government forecasts. Vaccines, guns, and moneyOn dark web forum Agartha, fake Covid-19 vaccines were offered next to cocaine, opioid medication, “super high quality fake money,” hand guns and gift cards. Posts showed stock photos of vaccines and offered vials for $500 and $1,000, or the equivalent in Bitcoin.On another dark web site, a seller claiming to be from the “Wuhan Institute of Science” offered Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for a donation, and asked buyers to provide their medical history.On Telegram, several channels claimed to offer Covid-19 vaccines, accompanied by stock images. One user offered supposed Moderna Inc vaccines for $180, and claimed the vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE could be had for $150 and AstraZeneca’s for $110 per vial.Asked how the vaccines would be shipped, the account creator said they were transported in “regulated temperature packs” and ice packs within a few days, or overnight for an additional charge. Actual Covid-19 vaccines, particularly the Pfizer/BioNTech offering, must be temperature controlled to remain effective, with drugmakers equipping shipments with temperature trackers to ensure the cold chain. Vaccine shipments and distribution are also tightly controlled by officials and will be administered at no cost.The United States has so far authorized two CovidD-19 vaccines for emergency use - the ones from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. The European Union to date has authorized the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and is expected to clear the Moderna vaccine this week.The UK has already authorized those two and just added the vaccine developed by Oxford University with AstraZeneca.Asked about vaccine scams, Pfizer said it had taken meticulous steps to reduce the risk of counterfeiting and tracked trends very carefully.“Patients should never try to secure a vaccine online - no legitimate vaccine is sold online - and only get vaccinated at certified vaccination centers or by certified healthcare providers,” a Pfizer spokesman said in a statement.Moderna referred a request for comment to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which did not respond. AstraZeneca did not respond to a request for comment.The HHS, FBI and US Department of Justice have urged the public to report any Covid-19 vaccine scams, including people asking for out-of-pocket payments for the vaccine and online vaccine advertisements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-covid-19-vaccines-are-flooding-the-dark-web-as-slow-vaccine-rollout-frustrates/story-np5obyVikJ2TkLE8g65KSM.html
05-01-2021||World||EU says it will redouble efforts to save Iran nuclear deal||The European Union says it will redouble its efforts to save the Iran nuclear agreement despite what it calls Tehran’s “important breach” of commitments made in the 2015 deal by starting to enrich uranium to new levels.EU spokesman Peter Stano said that Iran’s actions “will have serious implications when it comes to nuclear nonproliferation.” Stano said it was in everyone’s interest to rescue the deal and said the 27-nation bloc “will strengthen” its attempts to make sure all adhere to the commitments made in the landmark deal.Iran began enriching uranium Monday to levels unseen since its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The decision appeared aimed at increasing Tehran’s leverage in the waning days in office for US President Donald Trump, whose unilateral withdrawal from the atomic accord in 2018 began a series of escalating incidents.Increasing enrichment at its underground Fordo facility puts Tehran a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the action was “fully reversible” if other partners in the deal fully complied too, without elaborating.Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency of its plans to increase enrichment to 20% last week.Iran’s decision to begin enriching to 20% purity a decade ago nearly triggered an Israeli strike targeting its nuclear facilities, tensions that only abated with the 2015 atomic deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-it-will-redouble-efforts-to-save-iran-nuclear-deal/story-n3kaJzYcrDUzGXMqSyznUL.html

Seven others have died.The dog was found late Monday “in good condition” in an area where rescuers had been working, said police spokesman Ivar Myrboe.“It is a joy for us and gives motivation to further work hard,” said rescuer Goeran Syversen.But just before midday Tuesday, a smaller landslide forced rescuers to evacuate the site in the village of Ask, 25 kilometer (16 miles) northeast of Oslo. No one was injured, police said. Rescuer Kenneth Wangen said the landslide was “not dramatic,” adding they were warned by drones and other rescuers. They would wait for an assessment from geologists before continuing their search.Search teams with dogs have been looking through the rubble in below-freezing temperatures while helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras flew over the ravaged hillside.The village of 5,000 people was hit Dec. 30 by the worst landslide in modern Norwegian history, which destroyed at least nine buildings with more than 30 apartments. At least 1,000 people were evacuated. Some buildings are now hanging on the edge of a deep ravine, which grew to be 700 meters (2,300 feet) long and 300 meters (1,000 feet) wide.The exact cause of the landslide isn’t yet known but the area has a lot of quick clay, which can change from solid to liquid form. Experts said the quick clay, combined with excessive precipitation and damp winter weather, may have contributed to the landslide.In 2005, Norwegian authorities warned people not to construct residential buildings in the area, saying it was “a high-risk zone” for landslides, but houses were eventually built there later in the decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dog-found-alive-raises-hopes-in-deadly-norway-landslide/story-2RHNPi6NrxTPNsfUnDsZkK.html
05-01-2021||World||‘We’d had enough’: Why are Google employees unionizing?||More than 400 employees of Google and the parent organization Alphabet Inc. announced the creation of an employees union on Monday. Dubbed the Alphabet Workers Union, it is a watershed moment in staunchly anti-union Silicon Valley, where no other union of this kind exists. This union is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), a union that represents workers in telecommunications and media in the United States and Canada.The group has already received an outpouring of support with both Senator Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “I stand in solidarity with @AlphabetWorkers who are organizing to form a union at Google. What these workers are fighting for is not radical. They want fair wages and a workplace free from abuse, retaliation, intimidation and discrimination. And that is exactly what they deserve.” tweeted Sanders. Google software engineer Kimberly Wilber, an activist with the new group, told Bloomberg that the union was their way of building power “so executives can’t ignore us”. “We’d had enough,” wrote the union’s vice chair and executive chair in an op-ed piece in the New York Times. Here’s everything you need to know about what led to the formation of Alphabet Workers Union 1.The Alphabet Workers Union is a minority union because only 400 out of more than 260,000 full-time employees and contractors of the company formed the union. This means the group cannot ask the company to the bargaining table for negotiating contracts. However, the union’s primary aim lies in giving shape to the long-standing demands of employees and not simply negotiating contracts.2.The union is seen as a culmination of the 2018 walkout at Google, where some 20,000 employees staged a walkout after Google had paid tens of millions of dollars to two executives who had been accused of sexual misconduct by employees, letting the accused execs off the hook without any consequences. 3.Google has been accused of racial bias towards minority employees. Timnit Gebru, who worked as artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at Google was fired after she pointed out the racial bias inherent in the company’s AI system. The union’s vice chair Chewy Shah wrote an op-ed in the New York Times where he used Gebru’s treatment at the hands of Google as one of the reasons for unionizing. “Most recently, Timnit Gebru, a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the few Black women in her field, said she was fired over her work to fight bias. Her offence? Conducting research that was critical of large-scale A.I. models and being critical of existing diversity and inclusion efforts,” he wrote. 4.Google employees have long criticised the company’s involvement in projects with the Pentagon and plan to launch a censored search engine in China. The New York Times reported in December that the US federal authorities had wrongfully terminated the employment of two employees who had spoken out against the company’s work with immigration authorities in 2019. 5.The union is open to all employees of all Google in North America regardless of their role and position. “We are the workers who built Alphabet. We write code, clean offices, serve food, drive buses, test self-driving cars and do everything needed to keep this behemoth running. We joined Alphabet because we wanted to build technology that improves the world. Yet time and again, company leaders have put profits ahead of our concerns. We are joining together — temps, vendors, contractors, and full-time employees — to create a unified worker voice. We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in.” said the union’s vice and executive chairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-d-had-enough-why-are-google-employees-unionizing/story-p8oZa0VjKoyzbKEPoaRlUM.html
05-01-2021||World||10 people to stand trial in deadly Brussels attacks case||Ten people including the lone known surviving suspect in the 2015 deadly Paris attacks have been ordered to stand trial in connection with the suicide bombings which killed 32 people and injured hundreds in the Brussels subway and airport nearly five years ago.According to the federal prosecutor’s office, the Brussels Chamber of the Council also decided on Tuesday that charges against three others suspects should be dismissed.Earlier this year, prosecutors requested that eight of the 13 main suspects should be referred to the criminal court of assizes — the court that tries the most serious crimes — for charges of assassinations and attempted assassinations in a terrorism context, and for belonging to a terror group.But the Council Chamber decided to refer to the court all 10 people who were ultimately charged, meaning that only one trial related to the case should take place.Among those to stand trial is Salah Abdeslam, who is also suspected of playing a major role in the Paris attacks, and Mohamed Abrini, the Brussels native who walked away from Brussels’ Zaventem airport after his explosives failed to detonate.Abdeslam was captured in Brussels on March 18, 2016, and his arrest may have prompted other members of the Islamic State group cell to rush attack plans already in motion. Four days later, suicide bombers detonated their explosives in the Brussels airport and metro during the morning rush hour. In Paris, the network of French and Belgian fighters killed 130 people in attacks at the Bataclan concert hall, the national stadium and in bars and restaurants.Around 900 people are among those who suffered physical or mental trauma in the Brussels attacks, which were claimed by IS.The case will now be transferred to the Court of Appeal, which will decide when the case will be heard by the Chamber for Indictments. A date has yet to be set for the trial, which is expected to start in the autumn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-people-to-stand-trial-in-deadly-brussels-attacks-case/story-jjlT778jI4u6sNSUczfHqL.html
05-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s Iran problem is getting worse by the day. Here’s why||Joe Biden has an Iran problem. And, it’s getting more complicated by the day.Thanks to provocative moves by Iran and less-than-coherent actions by the outgoing Trump administration, the president-elect is facing an increasingly uncertain situation when it comes to Iran, a decades-long American nemesis that has been a target of blame for much of the Middle East’s instability.In the past week alone, President Donald Trump’s team has dispatched B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to alleged Iranian attack planning and reversed an order to bring home the USS Nimitz, the only US aircraft carrier in the region.On Monday, Iran not only announced it had resumed advanced uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal but also seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker and its crew. This combustible combination coming just two weeks before the president-elect’s inauguration threatens to derail or at least delay Biden’s hopes to return the U.S. to the nuclear accord that Trump withdrew from in 2018.A look at the latest developments:Does this amount to a dangerous escalation of tensions?Concerns have run high for some weeks about Iran stoking tensions, particularly around the Jan. 3 one-year anniversary of the US killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq. US officials have been on heightened alert for possible retaliation from Iran, including from allied militia in Iraq that have previously launched rockets at US facilities in the country.Although neither the enrichment announcement nor the seizure of the South Korean-flagged ship appeared linked to the death of the general, the two moves did raise tensions in the region, which has long been unpredictable.Does military action seem likely?Part of the worry is that a single wrong move — or intentional provocation — has the potential to trigger war.There is no sign the US is planning an attack on Iran, although Trump has said he would respond to any attack by Iran or its affiliated militias in Iraq that resulted in the death of an American. The US military has long had a wide variety of weapons and troops in the Middle East that could be called on if hostilities broke out. But Trump himself has derided the idea of getting further mired in Middle East wars.The scenario that worries US military officials is Iran conducting an attack, either inside Iraq or elsewhere in the Gulf region, that would prompt Trump to retaliate, leading to escalation that could spark a wider war. That is part of the reason the US has kept an aircraft carrier in the region on a near-continuous basis since May 2019, when the White House first asserted that Iran was planning attacks on US personnel.Why would the Nimitz be ordered home, then sent back?The highly unusual Nimitz flip-flop by the acting secretary of defense, Christopher Miller, seemed to undercut US Central Command’s efforts to convince Iran that it would not pay to launch an attack on US forces.The huge vessel, with a complement of attack and support aircraft, was literally leaving the region when it received word to turn around and head back.Sending the Nimitz home had been on the table for weeks, since the carrier was on a lengthy deployment and was scheduled to be home by the end of 2020. Its tour was extended by a few weeks to provide backup for US troop withdrawals in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. But as tensions with Iran rose in mid-December, Central Command wanted to keep the Nimitz nearby. Instead, on Dec. 31, Miller announced that he had ordered it to return home. Three days later, he reversed himself and said it would stay.Cancelling the go-home order for the Nimitz took some defense officials by surprise, suggesting that the decision may have been made at the White House rather than as a result of new arguments from military officers.What’s the point of flying B-52 bombers in the Gulf?These long-range bomber flights aren’t commonplace, but they’ve become a bit more routine in recent weeks as a show of military might. There have been three B-52 bomber missions to the region in less than two months, most recently on Dec. 30.The roundtrip flights from the United States are meant to show how quickly bombers can get to the area. They can be equipped with either conventional or nuclear missiles. Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East, made the message clear this week, saying, “We do not seek conflict, but no one should underestimate our ability to defend our forces or to act decisively in response to any attack.”What does all this mean for Biden’s Iran policy?Biden’s transition team has declined to comment in detail about the latest developments and what they may mean for their plans. But, Biden and his top national security aides have laid out their approach to Iran in broad strokes. Top of that list is bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal and then expanding that pact to take into account non-nuclear behavior that wasn’t covered by the initial agreement.Iran, however, has said it will only return to compliance if the US rejoins the deal and rescinds sanctions that Trump reimposed over the past two years. At the same time, Biden aides have said Iran cannot win sanctions relief unless and until it respects the deal.Iran’s latest actions, coupled with the Trump administration’s movement of forces, complicate diplomacy and raise the risk of miscalculation, particularly as tensions continue to run high between Iran and its neighbors.The increased tensions, which have triggered the highest alert levels for US personnel in Iraq, may make it difficult for the incoming Biden administration to pivot the military more aggressively toward Russia and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-iran-problem-is-getting-worse-by-the-day-here-s-why/story-FS8pWmNZqlZ5EtYOdMPojK.html

Sri Lanka joined the COVAX facility last year and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has accredited the nation, making it eligible to receive the vaccines through the programme.The Lanka Cabinet will sign part two of the COVAX agreement with the WHO this week, enabling the country to obtain a limited quantity of the COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of this year, according to an official statement.The signing of the second part has to be done by January 8, it said. Eligible countries are required to submit request applications under two phases to receive the vaccine facility. The first part -- which include information regarding the target group, storage capacity and technical information -- was required to be submitted before December 7 and Lanka has done it on time, the statement said.The Lankan government had earlier said that it would also opt for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Russia.There has been a surge in COVID-19 infections in Lanka since early October. The number of deaths which stood at just 13 till October has now passed the 200-mark.

Australian camping retailer Boating Camping Fishing store (BCF) released an advert designed to encourage people to explore their own backyard while there remain several travel restrictions around the world. In the video, a man jokes that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was caused by someone eating a bat.A spokesperson for the Advertising Standards Bureau told the BBC that the ad watchdog has received several complaints about the BCF’s commercial. The spokesperson added that Ad Standards is in the process of assessing these complaints to see if they raise an issue. A BCF spokesperson had earlier told Australian media that they understand the severity of the pandemic, adding that the camping commercial was a light-hearted marketing campaign. The YouTube video has garnered over 250,000 views so far but the bat sequence has been edited out for TV.“Over the years BCF has established a tradition of irreverent campaigns in the spirit of good-natured fun,” the spokesperson said. “They will have their detractors and we recognise that.Also Read | China doubles down on Covid-19 narrative as WHO investigation loomsWhile the initial coronavirus outbreak was reported from a wildlife market in Wuhan, there has not been any definitive proof of how the virus originated. However, preliminary studies suggested that the bats could be the source since the coronavirus present in bats has a genome that is 96 per cent identical to SARS-CoV-2.Australia was one of the first countries to a demand an independent inquiry into the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, triggering a decline in its relationship with China. China punished Australian beef producers and barley farmers in apparent retaliation and asked Chinese students to reconsider studying Down Under. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison maintained that the call for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak was reasonable and not meant to target any country. The call for a probe was followed by China launching another investigation into the alleged subsidies on Australian wine imports and, in November, Beijing imposed taxes on Australian wine of up to 212%.

The spokesperson added that Johnson hopes to visit India in the first half of 2021, and ahead of the UK’s G7 Summit that Modi is due to attend as a guest.In New Delhi, people familiar with developments said PM Modi has expressed hope that the UK PM will be able to visit India in the near future. PM Modi also hoped that the UK would overcome Covid-19 challenges successfully, the people said, adding that both leaders reaffirmed commitment to work towards deepening bilateral relationship. The British government has been grappling with continuing spikes in Covid-19 infections, especially since the recent detection of a new and fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus. Johnson was to be the first British prime minister as the chief guest on India’s Republic Day since John Major was invited in 1993. The British PM’s India visit was expected to see a major change in bilateral relations over the next decade, as the post-Brexit UK embarks on a new path free from the obligations of being a member of the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-worries-force-uk-prime-minister-boris-johnson-to-call-off-india-visit/story-ETJBL85nfEgFDoxlxSbibP.html
05-01-2021||World||Georgia’s economic might on display in race to control Senate||As Republicans and Democrats battle over who will run Georgia’s economy the best, the state itself is an example of how government intervention in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis has aided its recovery.Georgia’s economy has rebounded, and unemployment has dropped below the national average in the wake of more than $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve cutting rates to near zero. That’s lifted the housing industry, fueling development in metro Atlanta and the US carpet capital of Dalton, as well as auto manufacturing in the state. One weak spot, that none of the country escaped, has been tourism.More stimulus could be on the way with $2,000 checks for Americans if Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff win, President-elect Joe Biden pledged in a campaign stop Monday. Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, by contrast, won support by President Donald Trump in a rally in Dalton, where unemployment has plunged to 5.2% from 20% in April.“Georgia has more leverage than most states from the housing boom,” said Jeffrey Humphreys, director of economic forecasting at the University of Georgia’s Terry College of Business. “We are seeing a V-shaped recovery in housing and vehicles. That is working to Georgia’s advantage.”Meanwhile, the results of the Senate race on Tuesday also could determine the near-term direction of the US economy. If Democrats gain control of the upper chamber and Congress quickly passes $2,000 stimulus checks, it would add 1.1 percentage points per quarter on annualized growth in 2021, according to Bloomberg economists.Here are some ways that economists cite that Georgia’s economy is doing well compared to much of the USEmployment“The Georgia economy is weathering the pandemic better than most other states,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Employment through November is down 3% from the pre-pandemic peak, which is less than half the over 6% drop in employment nationwide. Georgia’s unemployment rate at 5.7% is a full percentage point below the nation’s.”Industry“The Georgia economy is doing relatively well, particularly Northern Georgia,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo & Co. “The floor coverings business -- which used to be carpets but now includes hardwoods and laminates too -- is doing extremely well. The poultry industry is doing well and the state continues to attract new industry. Economic development was fairly strong this past year.”Migration“The state is less urban than the rest of the country, Atlanta notwithstanding, which has mitigated the economic fallout of the virus,” according to Zandi. “The state is also likely benefiting from the work-from-anywhere phenomena, as it attracts migrants from big urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest due its lower living costs and the allure of its resort towns on the coast.”Government Coffers“State and local governments in Georgia face less daunting fiscal challenges than in many other states. So state and local government is not the headwind to growth here that it will be in a lot of other states,” said Humphreys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-s-economic-might-on-display-in-race-to-control-senate/story-n9fMeGT1F75GuiQFGhi5IM.html
05-01-2021||World||Iran says South Korea holding $7 billion Iran funds ‘hostage’||Iran denied on Tuesday it was using a South Korean ship and its crew as hostages, a day after it seized the tanker in the Gulf while pressing a demand for Seoul to release $7 billion in funds frozen under US sanctions.The seizure of the MT Hankuk Chemi and its 20-member crew near the strategic Strait of Hormuz has been seen as an attempt by Tehran to assert its demands, just two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in the United States.Iran wants Biden to lift sanctions imposed by outgoing President Donald Trump. Tehran’s critics have long accused it of capturing ships and foreign prisoners as a method of gaining leverage in negotiations.“We’ve become used to such allegations,” Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a news conference. “But if there is any hostage-taking, it is Korea’s government that is holding $7 billion, which belongs to us, hostage on baseless grounds.”South Korea summoned the Iranian ambassador, called for the ship to be released and said it was dispatching a delegation to Iran to discuss it. Iran says the ship was held over environmental violations.Iran’s ability to challenge shipping in the Gulf is one of its main points of leverage in what is expected to be a difficult negotiation when the Biden administration takes office on Jan. 20. In 2019, Iran held a British tanker for two months.South Korea, like other countries, is required to limit Iran’s access to its financial system under the US sanctions, which were imposed by Trump after he abandoned a nuclear agreement reached with Iran under his predecessor Barack Obama.Iran says the sanctions are illegal and have hurt its economy, including its ability to respond to the worst outbreak of Covid-19 in the Middle East.Biden aims to revive the nuclear agreement, but any thaw is likely to pose a diplomatic challenge. Since Trump abandoned the deal, Iran has taken steps that violate it; Biden says Iran must be fully compliant before the deal can be restored, while Iran says Washington must first lift the sanctions.On Monday, Tehran announced it had stepped up uranium enrichment at an underground facility, its latest move in violation of the nuclear deal’s terms.Crew ‘safe’South Korea’s Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday she was making diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the tanker and had made contact with her counterpart in Tehran.Iran’s ambassador in Seoul, Saeed Badamchi Shabestari, asked about the status of the ship’s crew before his meeting at the foreign ministry, told reporters “all of them are safe”.In addition to a South Korean delegation expected to go to Iran as soon as possible to try to free the ship, South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister, Choi Jong-kun, is scheduled to visit Iran on Sunday. Iranian state TV cited a Tehran government official as saying the visit had been scheduled earlier, to discuss the frozen funds.‘Armed Soldiers’The ship’s Busan-based operator, Taikun Shipping Co. Ltd., told Reuters there had been nothing to indicate before the vessel was seized that Iranian authorities were probing possible violations of environmental rules.“If it really was marine pollution, as they say, the coastguard was supposed to approach the ship first,” Taikun’s management director, Lee Chun-hee, said by telephone. “But instead, armed soldiers approached the crew and said they needed to be investigated.”Last Sunday, the Tehran Times newspaper reported Iran was hoping to negotiate an agreement to use the frozen funds to trade for commodities, including coronavirus vaccine doses.According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, a foreign ministry official said the Iranian government had tried to secure vaccines through the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization. Tehran had been in talks with the ministry and the US Treasury to pay for the doses with South Korean won.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-south-korea-holding-7-billion-iran-funds-hostage/story-PXqKLEZ2v1GSwSr56zEy1M.html
05-01-2021||World||Speedy distribution of Covid-19 vaccine a major challenge for global govts: WHO experts||As India launches the world’s most ambitious and biggest vaccination drive against Covid-19, the country will encounter the formidable challenge of rapidly scaling up distribution of the vaccines to secure immunity for its entire population, two prominent Indian scientists at World Health Organization (WHO) have said.This daunting challenge is not only for India but also for all the governments across the globe as they start inoculating their populations to tackle the pandemic, noted Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist of WHO, and Dr Hamsadvani Kuganantham, Consultant, WHO. On Sunday, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO),India’s drugs regulator, had approved Oxford vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use for the frontline warriors and senior citizens in the country.Currently, there are 45 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 156 candidate vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation, the WHO scientists said. COVAX,a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 treatments and vaccines,is jointly led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance set up by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and WHO. “It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure Covid-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries,” they wrote in an article for Manorama Yearbook 2021. “The goal of COVAX is to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines that have passed regulatory approval and/or WHO prequalification, by the end of 2021.These vaccines will be offered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritizing healthcare workers, then expanding to cover vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions,” the scientists pointed out.Further doses will then be made available based on a countrys need, vulnerability and Covid-19 threat.The scientists said it is equally important to ensure sustained surveillance, tracing, test and treat. “Vaccines will help us achieve herd immunity but, until then we need to keep practicing the non-pharmacological measures to prevent infection and spread,” said Dr Swaminathan and Dr Kuganantham. “What is clear is that the virus has a foothold in most parts of the world, and transmission increases as soon as public health control measures are relaxed. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing and mask-wearing will reduce spread and, ideally, keep infection and death rates down,” they observed. Quoting the global health security index published last year, they said no country is prepared to handle an epidemic or a pandemic. It concluded that most countries lack foundational health systems capacities vital for epidemic and pandemic response. With regard to reopening of schools, the scientists said schools operate not in isolation but within the community.Thus, anything that affects the community affects the schools too. Data shows that even though the schools have moved online, around 463 million children across the world have no access to remote schooling, the article said adding that education of one-third of the world’s children has been affected and one in four countries presently do not have a reopening date for their schools. “This has devastating outcomes that can affect the children for a lifetime. They will be more exposed to physical and emotional violence, more prone to be pushed to child labour, suffer sexual abuse and further intensify the cycle of poverty. We need the decision-makers to closely check the factors and ensure a safe environment for the children,” they stressed. Observing that there are many lessons from the pandemic that can be learnt to adapt and prepare for the future,the experts said, “This pandemic will come to an end, but the world needs to work together to ensure that we are better prepared next time. It is only through science and solidarity that solutions will be found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/speedy-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccine-a-major-challenge-for-global-govts-who-experts/story-NaI6KpLB6E9H0pqnBumn6N.html

Interviewed by radio station 103FM, he declined to give details of the size of the shipment and said the date of its arrival was under discussion.Moderna has received authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine in the United States and Canada and additional authorisations are under review in the European Union, Singapore, Switzerland and Britain.Israel has begun to vaccinate its population at one of the quickest rates in the world, and it aims to reach all vulnerable citizens by late January. Authorities started vaccinations on December 19 using the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.Israel has also imposed a third national lockdown to fight climbing infection rates. Edelstein called for an immediate tightening of restrictions, with any final decision pending a cabinet meeting due later on Tuesday.The Bank of Israel said on Monday it expected the economy to rebound quickly in 2021 if the fast start to vaccinating people against Covid-19 was maintained.Israel, which has a population of about 9 million, has reported more than 450,000 Covid-19 cases and 3,448 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-authorises-use-of-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-D5o1KCv9nb4KpDEDnlTdMO.html

A violent face-off took place between the Indian and Chinese soldiers when a sizeable number of Chinese Army transgressed into the Indian side.Since taking over as president and head of the CMC in late 2012, Xi has consistently pushed the PLA to be prepared for war. He also initiated a massive overhaul of the PLA in 2015 to modernise the Chinese military, planned for completion in 2020, reported SCMP.In order to checkmate the US in South China Sea PLA also stepped up exercises and air force fly-by operations targeting Taiwan during 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-orders-chinese-military-to-scale-up-combat-readiness-to-act-at-any-second/story-fVhMtQ33zWIQzYxnRJd0rI.html

05-01-2021||World||Hong Kong: Amid protest and pandemic, experts warn govt of social unrest among youth||Experts have raised alarm over Hong Kong youths simmering grievances and frustration over Covid-19, which may turn into social unrest.The pent-up resentment against the government and frustration over the coronavirus pandemic among students has been described as ‘powder keg waiting to go off’, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).Lilian Cheng and Tony Cheung writing for SCMP cited an unpublished survey by two universities that found that nearly 90 per cent of students had no confidence in the government.In a survey of 250 students last year, Chinese University Professor Angel Lai Hor-yan and HKU Professor Terry Lum Yat-sang found 87 per cent reported having no confidence in the government. They warned the city could be engulfed in a crisis similar to the one that erupted two years ago over the now-withdrawn extradition bill and led to the arrest of thousands of students, reported SCMP.Amid psychological stress from a year of fighting coronavirus and unhealed wounds from 2019 protests could be a potent mix for unrest, suggested Lilian Cheng and Tony Cheung.Although students were no longer taking to the streets to protest, the administration would be wrong to believe their animosity had died down, warned Paul Yip Siu-fai, chair professor at the University of Hong Kong’s (HKU) department of social work and social administration.Yip attributed the relative calm over the past year to tough social-distancing rules that had kept people at home and the enactment of the national security law in June that threatened heavy punishments for activists.“Students are trapped at home, with limited social interactions, and the government has done little to consider their mental growth during such a difficult time,” he said.Professor Daniel Shek Tan-lei, chair professor of applied social sciences at Polytechnic University called for reconciliation between the government and the city’s youth, as well as for officials to acknowledge some of their wrongdoings to rebuild trust.“The government needs to think of ways to move forward, to reconcile with the young people,” he said.The analysts agreed Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor had already taken a step towards reconciliation by promising young people who had joined the often-violent demonstrations that erupted in June of 2019 they would not be tried for their crimes if they admitted their wrongdoing and expressed contrition, reported SCMP.Since taking office in July 2017, Lam has been keen to demonstrate the government can reconnect with the city’s youth. The government’s think tank, the Central Policy Unit, was restructured as the Policy Innovation and Coordination Office and young people were encouraged to join.The Commission on Youth, an advisory body, was renamed the Youth Development Commission (YDC), with Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung appointed as chairman with the aim of improving the administration’s communication with the younger generation.Meanwhile, experts suggested authorities to ensure students return as soon as possible to classrooms and sports to help ease the psychological stress arising from confinement during the health crisis, as a short-term solution.While, in a long-term solution, they suggested the top officials’ open avenues for young people to play a greater role in shaping public policy by joining the ranks of advisory bodies, pro-establishment voices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-amid-protest-and-pandemic-experts-warn-govt-of-social-unrest-among-youth/story-xKtnHNy4PvjToONnNhfRKL.html
05-01-2021||World||Germany set to extend hard lockdown as daily deaths mount||Germany’s disease control center on Tuesday reported 944 more Covid-19 deaths, fuelling expectations that Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors will extend the country’s lockdown until the end of the month. Germany’s latest lockdown took effect December 16 after a partial shutdown starting in early November failed to reduce the number of daily new coronavirus infections. It was initially set to expire January 10. Merkel’s meeting with the governors on Tuesday will decide how long the lockdown should go on and to what extent schools will reopen. Another topic high on the agenda will be addressing criticism of the country’s vaccination program amid frustrations over its gradual start. Vaccinations in Germany and the rest of the 27-nation European Union started over a week ago. In Germany, a nation of 83 million, nearly 265,000 vaccinations had been reported by Monday, the Robert Koch Institute said. Opposition politicians and even some within Germany’s governing coalition have criticised the EU’s cautious advance ordering of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine — the only one so far cleared for use in EU nations. The EU’s medical regulator is also evaluating a vaccine by Moderna. The country’s health minister has repeatedly said that the vaccinations are progressing as expected and that the slow start is because mobile teams are first going to nursing homes to vaccinate the most vulnerable, which takes more time than inviting people to mass vaccination centers. Still, in a nod to the heavy pressure, Health Minister Jens Spahn said he has asked the country’s agency in charge of vaccinations if the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be delayed in order to be able to vaccinate more people right away with a first shot. Britain has embraced such a plan with its vaccinations, but the move is being hotly debated by scientists and governments around the world. Germany’s new infections remain at more than twice the level of 50 per 100,000 residents over seven days, which the government wants to reach. In part because of lower testing and delayed reporting, it’s not yet clear what effect the Christmas holidays will have on Germany’s new coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Germany has reported 35,518 virus-related deaths overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-set-to-extend-hard-lockdown-as-daily-deaths-mount/story-X9vYZeD6PbKcEC442U05VJ.html
05-01-2021||World||German unemployment unexpectedly fell during December lockdown||German joblessness unexpectedly declined in December, though companies were heavily dependent on government subsidies to keep workers employed through the latest lockdowns.A decrease of 37,000 left the total number of unemployed people at 2.776 million and the rate unchanged at 6.1%, according to the Federal Labor Agency. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a gain of 10,000.At the same time, applications for state wage support increased, according to labor agency chief Detlef Scheele. Some 2 million workers benefited from the government’s furlough program in November, according to the latest estimates by the Ifo Institute -- a number that is likely to rise.The country has been in a hard lockdown since the middle of last month, with most retail stores, restaurants, bars, gyms and cultural venues shut to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Chancellor Angela Merkel is likely to announce an extension of the curbs beyond the current Jan. 10 deadline at a news conference later on Tuesday.That means labor market strains will persist in the coming weeks. Overall though, German employment has been more resilient than in other European countries, in part because of its focus on manufacturing.It’s also set to suffer less from school closures to contain the pandemic given there’s a lower share of households with children and working parents than in other European Union nations. Bloomberg Economics estimates that labor supply will fall by some 5% in Germany, compared with more than 10% in Slovenia.Euro-area jobless data is due to be released by Eurostat on Friday, with the rate forecast to have risen to 8.5% in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-unemployment-unexpectedly-fell-during-december-lockdown/story-c2u2M6EKWphu93fnE7FlvN.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19: UK announces £4.6 billion in new lockdown grants||Hours after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another six-week lockdown, chancellor Rishi Sunak on Tuesday announced £4.6 billion ($6.25 billion) in grants for companies that will be closed at least until mid-February, as new Covid-19 cases continued to spike.Calling the recent spike driven by the new variant “alarming”, Johnson clamped the third lockdown in England, effective from early Wednesday. Scotland went into a lockdown on Monday night while Wales and Northern Ireland have similar tough restrictions.Sunak said, “The new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge - and while the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further. Throughout the pandemic, we’ve taken swift action to protect lives and livelihoods and today we’re announcing a further cash injection to support businesses and jobs until spring.“This will help businesses to get through the months ahead – and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen.”The UK government has already borrowed nearly £250 billion since early 2020 and offered help to companies to furlough employees and to the self-employed, besides concessions and grants to companies.Michael Gove, cabinet minister, admitted on Tuesday morning that the lockdown may last until March. Parliament has been recalled on Wednesday to pass related legislation for the third lockdown since March 2020.A grim-faced Johnson said on Monday night, “(We) now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible.“As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000.”He added, “That number is 40% higher than the first peak in April. On December 29, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.“With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the government is once again instructing you to stay at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-announces-4-6-billion-in-new-lockdown-grants/story-HbO4mcyu7AdrJHeE9NLsnO.html
05-01-2021||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak to set out more aid for lockdown-hit businesses||UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will announce extra financial help for businesses on Tuesday, after England entered a third national lockdown to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.The economy has already suffered the deepest recession in more than 300 years and is facing the prospect of another downturn as a result of the latest restrictions.“It’s a specific package to help businesses through a very difficult time,” Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on LBC radio. “The Chancellor will be saying more today about additional support.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England into a fresh lockdown late Monday, amid warnings that the National Health Service is at risk of being overwhelmed by soaring coronavirus infection rates.The restrictions risk devastating retail and hospitality businesses, and industry groups have pressed for more help to avert company failures. The government could also close the border to non-essential international travel in a further blow to the aviation industry.Helen Dickinson, chief executive officer of the British Retail Consortium, said 178,000 jobs have been lost in the retail sector and more could go without extra help. Businesses are losing 2 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) per week in lost sales, Dickinson said in an emailed statement on Monday.MakeUK, which represents Britain’s manufacturing sector, and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) have also called for more government intervention.“There must now be a step change in support to equal the compensation offered during the first lockdown,” said Mike Cherry, national chair of the FSB. “The level of government grants is off the mark by an order of magnitude and has not kept the pace with events.”The U.K. Treasury announced a series of support packages through 2020 as the coronavirus crisis deepened, with the latest action being to extend the furlough program -- where the government pays 80% of the wages of workers who are unable to work -- through April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-to-set-out-more-aid-for-lockdown-hit-businesses/story-OvoVr32ij8Rv2FOrNd5HtJ.html
05-01-2021||World||China flies choppers over Lhasa in military drill to tame Tibet||China has carried out an aerial drill over the Tibet’s capital of Lhasa, a preemptive move designed to remind Buddhists scattered across the vast Himalayan plateau about the communist party’s military might that last crushed an uprising by young Tibetans ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The aerial drill comes days after the United States enacted the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 that reaffirmed the right of Tibetans to choose a successor to their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The Tibetan government-in-exile based in Himachal Pradesh’s Dharamshala had described the US legislation as historic.A China watcher in New Delhi said the drill could be only one part of the continuing effort by President Xi Jinping to sinicise Tibet that would pick up pace in view of the new US law.Also Read: China cautions against use of ‘Tibet card’, says it will damage bilateral ties“China wouldn’t want anything to happen in Tibet that reflects support for the US law… The military drill was a preemptive move and would be followed by other steps to stem any potential dissent,” he said.Sinicisation is an attempt to wipe out religious and ethnic identities by increasing the influence of Chinese, or the culture of the majority Han community, on non-Chinese ideas and entities within China.President Xi Jinping has talked about sinicising religions in China since taking over the Communist Party of China leadership in 2012. Three years later, Xi spoke about sinicising the five major religions practised in China: Catholicism, Protestantism, Islam, Buddhism and Daoism. For the last few years, China has been working on a plan to redefine the practise of Islam and align the beliefs of Muslims with the communist party. Xinjiang has been a focus area where the communist regime has implemented tactics that it has practised in Tibet for years.Also Read: China violates border agreements with India, swears by 2003 pact on Tibet | AnalysisPresident Xi sees the sinicisation of Tibetan Buddhism as part of a four-point programme that he unveiled at an August meeting last year to build, what he called, an “impregnable fortress’’ to maintain stability in Tibet that is so important to Beijing because of its long border with India. That Buddhist Tibetans, despite decades of Chinese rule, still worship the Dalai Lama as a living god, has long been considered a threat by the communist party.This is why China views the US law that supports letting Tibetans decide the Dalai Lama such a risk and wants to shape his succession, and claims that the Buddhist reincarnations must “comply” with Chinese law.This compliance, however, is not unique to Buddhist Tibetans. A new rule that kicked in on 1 February last year requires all religions in China to look up to the ruling communist party for leadership and promote its policies.Analysts believe that China could order a fresh crackdown in Tibet if the communist party assesses that there is even the slightest possibility of unrest in Lhasa. Rights activists who tracked Beijing’s response to the 2008 uprising said dozens of Tibetans were killed by the military to stop the protests against China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-responds-to-us-law-on-tibet-with-military-drill-over-lhasa/story-4WPewBatJNsig0Qn2JSZQM.html
05-01-2021||World||Peace talks to resume under shadow of targeted Afghan killings||Battling a resurgence in violence including a campaign of targeted killings of journalists, Afghanistan’s government is set to resume peace talks with the Taliban Tuesday, with efforts expected to be focused on securing a cease-fire agreement in the dying days of Donald Trump’s presidency.Since the intra-Afghan talks began in September in the Qatari capital of Doha, where the Taliban have a political office, violence has increased nationwide, including an attack on Kabul University which killed dozens of students and Taliban attempts to capture Lashkar Gah and Kandahar cities in the southern region.“The current levels of violence, including targeted killings, is unacceptable,” Zalmay Khalilzad, US special envoy for Afghan reconciliation, said in a series of tweets after he arrived in Doha overnight, two weeks before Trump is due to leave office. “Both sides must demonstrate they are acting in the best interest of the Afghan people by making real compromises and negotiating an agreement on a political settlement as soon as possible and an immediate significant reduction in violence/ceasefire.”Trump has long been determined to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. Under a deal signed with Taliban in February, the U.S. is seeking to leave the country by May 2021 in exchange for counter-terrorism assurances from the Taliban. The country is planning to reduce its military presence this month by about 2,000 from 4,500 troops, who are providing air support for Afghan forces.Future GovernmentAfter a break of almost a month, the second round of the talks “will be lengthier and more important,” said Ahmad Saeedi, a former Afghan diplomat in Pakistan who is now an independent political analyst in Kabul. In addition to the cease-fire, the two sides will also negotiate the structure of a future Afghan government.“We’ll discuss the most important agenda -- the violence reduction or a comprehensive cease-fire,” according to Ghulam Farooq Majrooh, a member of Afghanistan’s negotiating team. The targeted killings of journalists, civilian activists and others will also be on the agenda, he added.The Taliban “are interested in establishing an interim government,” Abdul Hafiz Mansour, another member of the Afghan negotiating team, told reporters on Sunday.However President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly denied the idea, saying it would reverse the hard-won achievements, including in human rights, made in the past two decades.Reporters SlainSince November, journalists across the country have been targeted by unknown armed militants.The fifth reporter killed, Bismillah Adil Aimaq, was shot dead in Ghor province on Jan. 1, according to Afghanistan Journalists Center. Elyas Daee from the Afghan branch of U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Europe -- or Radio Azadi -- Rahmatullah Nikzad from Associated Press and Al-Jazeera, and Malala Maiwand, who worked as an anchor for a local TV channel are among the dead. A further two journalists have also died in Kabul of unknown causes.In an address to the country’s parliament on Monday, Interior Minister Masoud Andarabi, who had been summoned over security failures to thwart the killings, blamed the Taliban for the journalists’ deaths, citing “accurate intelligence evidence and confessions from arrested perpetrators.”Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahed, denied the group was responsible for the attacks in emailed statements and a series of tweets.The head of National Directorate of Security, the country’s intelligence agency, Ahmad Zia Saraj -- who was also summoned to parliament over the violence -- told lawmakers that Taliban insurgents carried out about 18,500 attacks in one year and have no “pure intentions for peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peace-talks-to-resume-under-shadow-of-targeted-afghan-killings/story-Av8JQTu59IY9brByh7iGoO.html

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the pacific nation, an archipelago home to about 18,000 people, is yet to report its first case of coronavirus, Palau is a sovereign nation in free association with the United States and, under an agreement signed in 1982, the latter remains responsible for Palau’s defence until 2044. The archipelago has also access to Washington’s social services, making it a part of US’ mass Covid-19 vaccination program - Operation Warp Speed. The Pacific Islands country on Saturday received its first shipment of 2,800 doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, which has been authorised by the US Food and Drug Association (FDA) for emergency use. The vaccination commenced on Sunday at the Belau National Hospital, starting with healthcare providers and first responders. Palau has requested another 30,000 Covid vaccine doses from the United States.Also Read | US pharmacist who destroyed Moderna Covid-19 vaccines was ‘conspiracy theorist’: policeIncident Commander of the Ministry of Health, Ritter Udui, reportedly said that small population puts Palau in prime position to become one of the first countries in the world to be inoculated against the virus. According to a CNN report, Palau’s goal is to vaccinate 80 per cent of its population and achieve herd immunity.“It’s not compulsory to receive the vaccine, so our goal is to vaccinate about 80% of the population. We hope to achieve herd immunity (through the vaccination program),” the Palau official was quoted as saying by the US media network.Notably, Palau had hailed India at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly for its “invaluable support” to fight the ongoing pandemic. In September, Palau President Tommy Remengesau Jr told a largely virtual gathering of world leaders that the Indian government helped the country improve its healthcare system through India-UN Development Partnership Fund. "Government of India, through India-UN Fund, in partnership with UNOSSC&UNOPS, has provided invaluable support to improve our healthcare system, & rapid response to pandemic preparations" H.E.

05-01-2021||World||NYSE scraps plan to delist China telecom firms||The New York Stock Exchange abandoned plans to delist three state-owned Chinese telecom companies on Monday, reversing a decision that further dented already strained relations between the world’s two superpowers.In a brief statement, the stock exchange said it “no longer intends to move forward with the delisting action” for China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.No detailed reason was given for the sudden reversal, which the exchange said came after “further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities”.Shares in the three state-owned telecoms firms jumped on the news. In Hong Kong trading of China Unicom, which at one point soared 11 percent, ended up at more than eight percent. China Mobile climbed more than five percent and China Telecom added more than three percent.Mainland Chinese shares reversed earlier losses, while the yuan rose around 0.7 percent against the dollar.Jackson Wong, at Amber Hill Capital, said the move was “quite unexpected”.“Some funds that had an obligation to unload these shares will now need to buy them back. Some investors are also starting to pricing in a scenario that the decision to halt delistings could be a start of a de-escalation in tensions between China and the US,” he added.The reversal comes just four days after the NYSE said it was ending trading in the companies to comply with an order by the Trump administration barring investment in firms with ties to the Chinese military.Donald Trump signed an executive order in November banning Americans from investing in Chinese companies deemed to be supplying or supporting the country’s military and security apparatus, earning a sharp rebuke from Beijing.The order listed 31 companies it said China was using for the “increasing exploitation” of US investment capital to fund military and intelligence services, including the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction.It was one of a series of executive orders and regulatory actions that have targeted China’s economic and military expansion in recent months.Trump’s order prohibits US companies and individuals from owning shares in any of the companies, which also include video surveillance firm Hikvision and China Railway Construction Corp.National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said at the time the order would prevent Americans from unknowingly providing passive capital to Chinese companies -- listed on exchanges around the world -- that support the improvement of Beijing’s army and spy agencies.Under his “America First” banner, Trump has portrayed China as the greatest threat to the United States and global democracy, pursued a trade war with it, harangued Chinese tech firms, and laid all the blame for the coronavirus pandemic at Beijing’s door.China had criticised the moves to delist its companies and threatened countermeasures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-scraps-plan-to-delist-china-telecom-firms/story-Wvg6zvLxw3EaLQ2VBt5yrJ.html
05-01-2021||World||US pharmacist who destroyed Moderna Covid-19 vaccines was ‘conspiracy theorist’: police||An American pharmacist who allegedly destroyed hundreds of coronavirus vaccine doses last month was an “admitted conspiracy theorist” and believed in a baseless rumour about their safety, authorities have said.Steven Brandenburg removed 57 vials of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, each containing around 10 doses, from refrigerators at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, Wisconsin, in an attempt to destroy them because he believed -- wrongly -- that they were dangerous and could alter human DNA.The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are based on mRNA technology that delivers genetic information to the human body to help produce antibodies against the coronavirus. Experts say there is no evidence at all to suggest they alter human DNA, and millions have been inoculated using these vaccines.They require very low temperatures for storage and can be damaged or destroyed otherwise, which is what Brandenburg tried to do on two occasions, the prosecution said Monday during his first court appearance.“His intent... was to render them inert because he’d formed this belief that they were unsafe, that the RNA method of creating these medications rendered them unsafe,” Ozaukee County district attorney Adam Gerol said during the hearing.Brandenburg had initially told hospital authorities that the vaccines were left unrefrigerated by accident, but later admitted that he removed them on purpose.The 46-year-old also admitted on one occasion to putting the unrefrigerated vaccines back inside, which were later injected into 57 people, the hospital’s operator said.The people were notified and there is no evidence that the inert vaccines harmed them, according to the hospital’s operator.He was fired and the hospital informed the authorities, including the FBI. He was arrested on Thursday last week.“Brandenburg, an admitted conspiracy theorist, told investigators that he believed that Covid-19 vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their DNA,” according to a probable cause statement from the police, released by local media.The prosecution said his charges may be downgraded if they find the vaccines can still be used.He also told authorities he was also under stress because of ongoing divorce proceedings with his wife, who has filed for sole custody of their two children, according to local media.“He told me that if I didn’t understand by now that... the world is crashing down around us, I am in serious denial,” she said in an affidavit, according to The New York Times.“He continued to say that the government is planning cyberattacks and plans to shut down the power grid.”Brandenburg was released on bail and ordered to surrender his firearms.Baseless conspiracy theories about the pandemic, especially vaccines, have been rampant on social media despite efforts by tech giants to counter them.Authorities and experts have said such misinformation poses a serious threat to the fight against the virus by promoting vaccine hesitancy and even outright rejection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pharmacist-who-destroyed-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-was-conspiracy-theorist-police/story-J4MmTzskKf1897ae7ys3NO.html
05-01-2021||World||China state news agency urges end to long work hours in tech||China’s official Xinhua News Agency is calling for shorter work hours in the country’s tech sector following the sudden death last week of a young employee at a leading e-commerce platform.Last month’s tragedy refocused attention on “the pain of an abnormal culture of overtime,” Xinhua said in a brief editorial posted Tuesday on its Twitter-like Weibo account.Dreams should be pursued through striving, but workers’ legitimate rights and interests should not be sacrificed and employers may be breaking the law in encouraging health-sapping overwork, Xinhua said.“Strengthening the protection of legal rights and interests for workers, letting those chasing their dreams run along in a healthy manner and introducing more warmth into the development of enterprises — that’s the form striving should take,” the news agency said.The editorial follows the Dec. 29 death of a 22-year-old employee of Pingduoduo as she was walking home with a colleague at 1:30 a.m. Few details have been released, other than that the woman apparently suffered stomach pains before collapsing, but internet users have seized on the case as an example of the health impacts of long working days.Grueling hours have long been a hallmark of China’s tech industry, heralded by business luminaries such as Alibaba’s Jack Ma, one of China’s richest and most prominent entrepreneurs. Ma drew controversy in 2019 by endorsing the “996” week, entailing working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, with many arguing that would further discourage young people from marrying and having children.The ruling Communist Party’s flagship People’s Daily newspaper even weighed in at the time, saying it was unfair of dictatorial managers to demand excessive overtime.Worldwide, the tech sector is known for demanding long hours spent designing, coding and processing customer requests. While Chinese labor law limits the work week to five days and no more than 44 hours, increasing numbers of people work outside the state sector or in the informal economy where such regulations tend not to be adhered to as closely.China also outlaws independent labor organizing, allowing only one union, the tightly party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-news-agency-urges-end-to-long-work-hours-in-tech/story-KtOSmMPnod7XsAhzPG7NtK.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19 pushed India to be a force for good on the global stage: Indian envoy to China||The coronavirus pandemic has spurred India to strengthen itself to demonstrate that with greater capabilities it would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage, India’s ambassador to China Vikram Misri has said. In an opinion piece published in the Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post, Misri said that the “devastating impact” of the pandemic was hard to quantify and its implications have been profound. “But one of the biggest takeaways has to be more international cooperation, particularly as we get increasingly interconnected. Accordingly, while engaging with an emerging multipolar global order, India will continue to give the utmost attention to its immediate neighbourhood, where its Neighbourhood First policy, based on non-reciprocity, is creating the basis for shared activities,” he said. “At the same time, our extended neighbourhood has been an integral part of our history and heritage and our engagement has unfolded through an Act East policy and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi’s Sagar (Security and Growth for All In the Region) vision for the Indo-Pacific, which provides a template to engage with our maritime neighbours,” Misri wrote in the article on Monday. He said the world needed more trusted and capable players and India believes it can play the role. “The pandemic demonstrated that India with greater capabilities would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage. Atmanirbhar Bharat is thus a self-reliant India but not a self-centred one”, he said. Highlighting India’s commencing of its two-year term from January 1 in the UN Security Council for the eighth time as a non-permanent member, Misri said, “convinced that the multipolar world today needs more multilateralism, we will focus on efforts to make the UN and other international bodies more representative and in sync with contemporary realities”. “The challenges of 2020 are by no means over. Much remains to be done. India believes this is a collective enterprise and stands ready to engage with all and work for peace, development and cooperation,” he said. The year 2020 is one that all would like to forget in a hurry. The coronavirus pandemic created a global crisis with no parallels in living memory. The governments around the world were forced to deal simultaneously with a catastrophic health emergency, massive economic shocks and serious social disruption, he wrote. “Despite this, 2020 will be remembered in India as a year of reckoning when government and citizenry came together in a whole-of-society response marked by determination and discipline,” he said. “From an economy that previously did not make ventilators, testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 masks, India was soon manufacturing enough of them to cater not only to its own needs but also for export,” he said. India also emphasised the need for global cooperation. Guided by its civilisational ethos, which places humanity at the centre of global prosperity and cooperation, India assisted others even while tending to problems at home, Misri said. “When COVID-19 created a spike in pharmaceutical demand, we responded by ramping up our production, exporting medicines and other medical assistance to over 150 countries,” he said. “With the focus shifting to vaccines, India is involved in many international collaborations that give the world hope for normalcy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed that India will leverage its vaccine manufacturing capacities to help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all,” he said. As the pandemic dealt a blow to global mobility on account of severe travel restrictions, India mounted a massive operation, bringing more than three million citizens home from around the world and supported the movement of more than 110,000 foreigners out of India to 120 countries. “The pandemic’s health shock was matched perhaps only by its economic shock as trade and investment were disrupted and supply chains were unhinged. India’s response was articulated in the vision of an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India). It would be a mistake to interpret this as India turning inward,” Misri said. “In the words of Modi, Atmanirbhar Bharat ‘is not just about competition, but also about competence; it is not about dominance, but about dependability; it is not about looking within, but about looking out for the world’,” he said. “In a time of global crisis, it would have been easy for India to focus just on recovery. Instead, the government seized the opportunity for a spate of major reforms in domains ranging from manufacturing to agriculture and education,” he said. He said the government has introduced “landmark” agricultural reforms to end the monopoly of trading cliques. ‘The proposed laws allow farmers to sell their produce at a price of their own choosing and even outside their respective states, thereby leading to better rural incomes. They also encourage private-sector investment and leverage technology to enhance our farm productivity to near-global standards,” he said, defending the three agriculture reform laws enacted by the government.

05-01-2021||World||Pentagon gets diversity watchdog in bill passed over Trump veto||Defense legislation passed in spite of President Donald Trump’s veto will bring a heightened focus on diversity issues and efforts to combat white supremacy and extremist behavior within the US military.Along with billions of dollars for new weapons systems and a pay raise for troops, a new deputy inspector general’s position was created by the bipartisan defense authorization bill to carry out audits, investigations and evaluations of military personnel policies, programs and systems to ensure they address diversity priorities.The new watchdog will also have a key role in responding to white supremacist and criminal gang activity by military personnel, according to the legislation passed on Jan. 1 over Trump’s veto.The deputy inspector general “will keep the heat on the military to make sure that racial inequality does not fade from the priority list, that these provisions are implemented successfully, and that Congress will receive an independent source of findings and recommendations,” said Representative Jackie Speier, the California Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee’s military personnel panel.Once the position is filled, the deputy inspector general could, for instance, review the extent to which the military services are examining social media posts of recruits or personnel needing security clearances to see if they’ve disclosed support for extremist organizations.Military leaders have been supportive of moves to curb behavior and eliminate symbols that are offensive to service members of color, who now make up more than 40% of the active-duty force. In vetoing the annual policy bill, Trump took issue with a provision to rename military installations that honor Confederate generals.That provision and the less-noticed move to create a diversity watchdog followed national protests in 2020 over systemic racism in law enforcement that prompted Pentagon leaders to speak out more forcefully on diversity issues.Then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police “a horrible crime” and said that the officers responsible should “be held accountable for his murder.”The military’s response included an anguished Facebook post by then-Chief Master Sergeant Kaleth Wright, the Air Force’s top enlisted airman, who expressed his fear that “what happens all too often in this country to Black men who are subjected to police brutality that ends in death…could happen to me.”The move also comes as President-elect Joe Biden said he intends to nominate retired General Lloyd Austin to be the nation’s first Black defense secretary. Austin was previously the first African American to lead Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.While the US military desegregated units years ahead of key civil rights legislation passed in the 1960s, it has continued to lag behind in many critical areas. Last month the Air Force’s inspector general concluded that Black airmen in the Air Force and the Space Force face widespread disparities in opportunities and treatment compared to fellow service members, and many of them feel that the services are racist and biased against them.The review found enlisted Black troops are 57% more likely to face court-martials and are promoted less often, trends that continued across military criminal justice and professional development. In a survey of 123,000 Air Force members, one-third of Black respondents said the Air Force and Space Force do not provide them the same opportunities as White peers.One key oversight tool the new watchdog will be responsible for is an annual report with an assessment of the effectiveness of “policies, programs, systems, and processes in preventing and responding to supremacist, extremist, and criminal gang activity of a member of the Armed Forces,” according to the legislation.In addition to objecting to the renaming of military bases, Trump vetoed the defense measure because he wanted it to include an unrelated provision to eliminate a portion of the Communications Decency Act that protects technology companies from liability for most content published by their users. In his veto message, Trump also called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia, without clearly articulating his reasoning.But Trump’s repeated efforts to get Republicans to support his veto failed. Beyond the new weapons funding and pay increases for troops, it had become a point of pride for members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that the annual legislation has been enacted without fail for six decades. With that backdrop, the veto override became the first -- and most likely last -- of Trump’s presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-gets-diversity-watchdog-in-bill-passed-over-trump-veto/story-OxBBRUVwmhmvSsooWoG0DN.html
05-01-2021||World||Saudi Arabia reopens borders with Qatar in US-backed deal||Saudi Arabia opened its borders with Qatar for the first time in three years, a leap toward easing a dispute that split the energy-producing region and complicated US efforts to isolate Iran.The decision to open land, air and sea borders comes ahead of a summit of regional leaders in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Qatar’s ruler will attend for the first time since the 2017 row that cut trade, travel and diplomatic ties with the kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Bahran and Egypt.Egypt has agreed in principle to open its airspace for Qatari planes and will do so if unspecified conditions are met, Saudi-backed Al Arabiya TV reported. Spokesmen for Egypt’s Foreign Ministry and presidency didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The steps were pushed through as President Donald Trump prepares to leave office and his successor, Joe Biden, vows to renew diplomacy with Tehran. The breakthrough is timely -- on Monday Iran seized a South Korea-flagged tanker and announced it would ramp up its nuclear enrichment activities.Qatar’s main equities benchmark rose the most in the Middle East following the announcement, with the majority of its members gaining.The dispute stretched beyond the Gulf region, with the countries lining up on opposite sides of conflicts and geopolitical squabbles in the wider Middle East and in Africa.Abu Dhabi, which led the boycott with Riyadh, didn’t appear to immediately join the accord but signaled optimism. The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter that Tuesday’s Gulf Cooperation Council summit would “bring back Gulf cohesion,” prioritizing the region’s security, stability and prosperity.“There’s more work ahead of us and we’re on the right track,” he said. Gargash’s comments echoed the sentiment expressed by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who said the summit would create “reunification and solidarity to face the challenges that our region witnesses.”Leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council -- comprising Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE -- will hold their summit in the northwestern Saudi town of Al Ula.The resolution has wider economic and financial implications for Qatar, the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and one of the richest countries per capita. It is expected to bolster prospects for Qatar’s non-oil economy over the medium term, according to Fitch Ratings. It is also positive news for Qatar Airways, which had to abandon plans to add new routes and make lengthy diversions when it was unable to cross the Saudi airspace.“For Saudi Arabia, this is an effort to take a leadership role, to try and gain some diplomatic advantage with the incoming Biden administration,” said Karen Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. It’s also “a realization perhaps that the last four years allowed too much foreign policy adventurism and experimentation,” Young said.The boycotting nations had accused Doha of meddling in their internal affairs, supporting hardline Islamist groups and building ties with Iran, a foe for most Gulf Arab states. Qatar denied the charges.It was unclear how far the agreement would go in easing frictions after three years of heated rhetoric. Commentators cautioned that major differences would likely persist with most of the flash-points dividing the sides unaddressed -- including the critical reporting of Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network.“The ideological gaps have not been closed either, so the GCC will remain fractured such below the surface, even as they paper over differences to score points with the new White House,” said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East analyst at Stratfor.The deal nearly fell apart on Sunday, but the White House and other parties stayed on the phone overnight to reach an agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is traveling to Saudi Arabia for the accord signing on Tuesday, the person said.The person said the agreement was reached in exchange for Qatar dropping lawsuits it had filed in relation to the Gulf split. It wasn’t immediately clear which legal cases were involved.Qatar had increasingly turned to Tehran and Ankara for support and relied on Iran’s airspace for overflights.

05-01-2021||World||France promises faster Covid-19 vaccine rollout after criticism||The French government, under pressure for lagging behind EU neighbours in rolling out Covid vaccinations, promised on Tuesday to dispense jabs much more quickly and catch up.Health Minister Olivier Veran said more than 2,000 people had been vaccinated on Monday and that the “cruising speed of vaccinations will catch up with our neighbours in the coming days”.The French campaign had rolled out just over 500 doses as of January 1, with critics calling that figure “a scandal” compared with the 200,000 people immunised in Germany in a similar timeframe, after the EU-wide rollout began a week ago.President Emmanuel Macron, under pressure to take personal responsibility, met officials including Prime Minister Jean Castex on Monday to discuss the logjam. “By Thursday we will increase numbers in a major way,” Veran told RTL radio, saying that “we will be on an exponential curve”.France would now “amplify, accelerate and simplify” its vaccination strategy, he said.Veran said vaccinations for people over 75 years of age who are not in care homes would be authorised by the end of January, covering five million people.He said the campaign would also be widened to include firefighters and home helpers over 50.France was currently taking delivery of 500,000 doses of a vaccine developed by Pfizer per week, Veran said.Once approved for the EU, 500,000 doses of a vaccine by Moderna would be added every month, he said.Scepticism about vaccines is making the government’s task harder.Just 40 percent of French want to take the vaccine compared with 77 percent in Britain, according to an opinion poll last week by Ipsos Global Advisor in partnership with the World Economic Forum.Veran also said that France had detected “about 10 suspected or confirmed cases” of a new variant virus strain that emerged in England, adding that authorities were watching the highly-contagious mutant virus “like hawks”.French health authorities on Monday reported 4,022 new coronavirus cases confirmed in the previous 24 hours, taking the total to 2.66 million.French deaths from Covid totalled 65,415, they said, after 380 new deaths were recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-promises-faster-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-after-criticism/story-YsOMycsrIwUXQ4puId74qO.html

And for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the interval is 28 days between the first and second dose,” the FDA said on Monday https://bit.ly/38g9IsC.In a departure from other countries’ strategies, the British government said last week people could on rare occasions be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots, for example if the same vaccine dose was out of stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/premature-to-change-authorized-covid-19-vaccines-dosing-schedules-fda-says/story-QqlpJnkp2c3bDMRnynrB3L.html
05-01-2021||World||China doubles down on Covid-19 narrative as WHO investigation looms||As a team from the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares to visit China to investigate the origins of Covid-19, Beijing has stepped up efforts not only to prevent new outbreaks, but also shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began.China has dismissed criticism of its early handling of the coronavirus, first identified in the city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that the country would welcome the WHO team.But amid simmering geopolitical tensions, experts said the investigators were unlikely to be allowed to scrutinise some of the more sensitive aspects of the outbreak, with Beijing desperate to avoid blame for a virus that has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide.“Even before this investigation, top officials from both sides have been very polarised in their opinions on the origins of the outbreak,” said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think tank.“They will have to be politically savvy and draw conclusions that are acceptable to all the major parties,” he added.While other countries continue to struggle with infection surges, China has aggressively doused flare-ups. After a new cluster of cases last week, the city of Shenyang sealed off entire communities and required all non-essential workers to stay home. On Saturday, senior diplomat Wang Yi praised the anti-pandemic efforts, saying China not only curbed domestic infections, but also “took the lead in building a global anti-epidemic defence” by providing aid to more than 150 countries. But mindful of the criticism China has faced worldwide, Wang also became the highest-ranking official to question the consensus about Covid-19’s origins, saying “more and more studies” show that it emerged in multiple regions.China is also the only country to claim Covid-19 can be transmitted via cold chain imports, with the country blaming new outbreaks in Beijing and Dalian on contaminated shipments - even though the WHO has downplayed those risks. Transparency China has been accused of a cover-up that delayed its initial response, allowing the virus to spread further. The topic remains sensitive, with only a handful of studies into the origins of Covid-19 made available to the public.But there have also been signs China is willing to share information that contradicts the official picture. Last week, a study by China’s Center for Disease Control showed that blood samples from 4.43% of Wuhan’s population contained Covid-19 antibodies, indicating that the city’s infection rates were far higher than originally acknowledged.But scientists said China must also share any findings suggesting Covid-19 was circulating domestically long before it was officially identified in December 2019. An Italian study showed that Covid-19 might have been in Europe several months before China’s first official case. Chinese state media used the paper to support theories that Covid-19 originated overseas and entered China via contaminated frozen food or foreign athletes competing at the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.Raina MacIntyre, head of the Kirby Institute’s Biosecurity Research Program in Australia, said the investigation needed to draw “a comprehensive global picture of the epidemiological clues”, including any evidence Covid-19 was present outside of China before December 2019. However, political issues mean they are unlikely to be given much leeway to investigate one hypothesis, that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said MacIntyre. “I think it is unlikely all viruses in the lab at the time will be made available to the team,” she said. “So I do not think we will ever know the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-doubles-down-on-covid-19-narrative-as-who-investigation-looms/story-hAm4D6ozQUGKI6tcllaG2N.html
05-01-2021||World||Bill Gates hails India’s leadership in scientific innovation, vaccine manufacturing||US business magnate, philanthropist, and co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates on Tuesday applauded India’s effort in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.He also hailed India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability.“It’s great to see India’s leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic,” he tweeted, tagging PMO India in the post.The Microsoft founder had previously written to PM Modi hailing the Indian government’s utilisation of “its exceptional digital capabilities in its COVID-19 response and launched the Aarogya Setu digital app for coronavirus tracking, contact tracing, and to connect people to health services.”“We commend your leadership and the proactive measures you and your government have taken to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 infection rate in India, such as adopting a national lockdown, expanding focused testing to identify hot spots for isolation, quarantining, and care, and significantly increasing health expenditures to strengthen the health system response and promote R&D and digital innovation,” Gates had written in April 2020.Meanwhile, earlier today Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also lauded India’s action and its resolve to end the Covid-19 pandemic as the largest vaccine producer of the world. Lauding the efforts of PM Modi in the fight against the pandemic, he wrote, “If we #ACTogether, we can ensure effective & safe vaccines are used to protect the most vulnerable everywhere @narendramodi”.On Monday, PM Modi pointed out that the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination programme is also going to start in India and that the CSIR and other institutions are working together came together to face every challenge and find solutions for new situations.“For this, the country is very proud of the contribution of its scientists. Today is also the day to remember the time when our scientific institutions, all of you, worked day and night together to develop the vaccine to defeat Covid,” he added.Speaking at the inauguration of National Atomic Timescale and Bhartiya Nirdeshak Dravya, via video conferencing on Monday, PM Modi said, “Indian scientists have been successful in coming up with two ‘Made in India’ COVID19 vaccines. The country is proud of its scientists,” he added.India has one of the largest vaccine manufacturing capacities in the world (including the largest vaccine producer - Serum Institute of India) and has secured authorisation to mass-produce the AstraZeneca, Novavax and Gamaleya Research Institute vaccines.With a population of 1.3 billion (and 94 million over 65-year-olds), the domestic vaccination drive will be the largest in the world.The country has a good track record of such drives with masses of the population regularly gaining inoculation for various diseases such as polio and cholera.India’s vaccine rollout will begin with frontline healthcare workers and individuals over the age of 50 years gaining priority. The government aims to vaccinate some 250 million people over six-to-eight months.

The Hindu temple was vandalised and set ablaze by hundreds of people on December 30.Earlier, Pakistan’s chief justice, Gulzar Ahmed, who had taken suo motu notice of the attack on the place of worship, had said the Supreme Court would hear the case on January 5.The chief justice took the action after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being vandalised during their meeting in Karachi last week.The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Auqaf department have been directed to start the work immediately and submit a progress report in two weeks. The chief justice also observed that the people who vandalised the temple should pay for its restoration.The court has also asked for reports on the number of temples in Pakistan, encroachment on land belonging to the Auqaf department, and the steps taken by the authorities against land grab. All temples in Pakistan come under the Auqaf department.Earlier, the one-man commission on the rights of minorities at the Supreme Court submitted its report on the Karak temple vandalism. Muhammad Shoaib Suddle, a former police chief, had prepared the report.The commission recommended a comprehensive investigation into the vandalism of the temple. Maulvi Sharif, the main suspect in the case, is believed to have incited people to carry out violence, the report said. It added that the record of the temple land at the time of Partition should be looked into.The report also recommended that the home department should take steps to stop the entry of suspicious people inside the temple. Exemplary punishment should be handed out to suspects to prevent such incidents in the future, the report recommended.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics.After the latest incident, local police had detained at least 14 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/restore-vandalised-temple-in-two-weeks-pak-sc-tells-kp-s-provincial-govt/story-KEmCMXXjqs6sqZwONYj86N.html

05-01-2021||World||US, India are among countries with most Covid-19 cases. Here’s a list||As the world scrambled into the New Year after being severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, several countries are beginning their vaccination programmes to inoculate their citizens against the viral disease. The emergence of a new, the more infectious strain might have dampened some of the positivity going into 2021 but experts have said that a vaccine would work despite mutations.While some countries were not hit as hard by the coronavirus disease, some were hit the worst in terms of loss of life, overwhelming the medical system, and the economy.Here are the 10 countries with the most cases of Covid-19 so far:1. United States: The US is the country with the most number of coronavirus infections in the world at the moment. The country currently has an overall caseload of 20,805,262 while the death toll stands at 353,371, as per Johns Hopkins University.2. India: Second on the list with nearly half the number of cases as the US is India. India’s tally of the coronavirus disease stands 10,356,844 after 16,375 new cases and 201 deaths were reported on Tuesday, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) recently gave their approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use authorisation.3. Brazil: The South American nation is the worst affected in the continent in terms of infections with 7,733,746 confirmed cases and 196,018 deaths, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows. President Jair Bolsonaro downplayed the virus threat for months before himself getting infected. 4. Russia: Russia has seen a surge in coronavirus infections recently. Its current overall caseload stands at 3,203,743 while the death toll stands at 57,730, as per Johns Hopkins University.5. United Kingdom: The UK went into strict lockdown restrictions yet again as cases surged, topped off by the discovery of a new, even more infectious strain of the virus. Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows the UK currently has the highest caseload in Europe with 2,662,699 confirmed cases and 75,137 deaths.6. France: France was the first country to suspend travel from the UK after the discovery of the new virus strain. The country has seen a surge in cases over the winter like several other European nations with even their President contracting the virus. The country currently has a caseload of 2,712,975 and a death toll of 65,164, as per Johns Hopkins University.7. Turkey: Turkey currently has an overall caseload of 2,241,912 with the death toll at 21,488, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker shows.8. Italy: Italy was the worst-affected nation in the world during the earlier months of the pandemic. It has since controlled and checked the spread of the virus but the winter period has seen cases surging all over Europe. The country currently has a caseload of 2,155,446 with 75,332 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.9. Spain: Spain was also one of the worst-affected countries in Europe. The country currently has 1,928,265 Covid-19 cases with the death toll currently standing at 50,837, Johns Hopkins University’s tracker showed.10. Germany: Germany had announced lockdown measures from Christmas to New Year in a bid to check the spread of the coronavirus infection as cases surged all across Europe. The country currently has an overall caseload of 1,783,896 with the death toll standing at 34,791 as per Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-are-among-countries-with-most-covid-19-cases-here-s-a-list/story-zHHn438mXaVq9ROEI56JzN.html
05-01-2021||World||Iran seizes ship, ramps up enrichment as Gulf tensions mount||Iran seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz hours before announcing it would increase its nuclear activities, as tensions in the region mount in the final days of Donald Trump’s US presidency.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it detained the Hankuk Chemi vessel at 10 a.m. local time Monday “due to repeated violations of marine environmental laws.”It’s the latest in a series of shipping incidents in the Persian Gulf, where several vessels have been attacked or seized in recent years.The events have unfolded against a broader backdrop of rising anxiety in the Middle East as the Trump administration extended its offensive to weaken Iran and force it into deeper nuclear and military concessions.Concerns of further conflict have grown in the final weeks before Joe Biden takes over in Washington, especially around the recent assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist and this week’s first anniversary of the killing of the country’s leading general.“In the short run, these tactics run the risk of turning into a just cause for war in the waning days of the Trump administration, and in the longer run can poison the well with Biden’s team,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group.Iran’s army also announced large-scale drone exercises starting Tuesday following a weekend of defiant speeches accusing the US of aggression.Korea ReactsIran’s announcement Monday that it would start processing uranium to 20% purity marks a further breach of a nuclear deal that Trump, who leaves office Jan. 20, abandoned in 2018.That announcement came shortly after Washington decided to keep the USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf because of “recent threats” from Iran’s leaders against Trump. The aircraft carrier had been set to leave the region.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it ordered the deployment of its naval destroyer ROKS Choi Young to waters near the Strait of Hormuz on Monday.The Hankuk Chemi’s owner, DM Shipping Co., denied it had broken any marine environmental rules, adding that the vessel was still being held off Iran, according to an official from the company who asked not to be named due to internal policy.The ship was headed to Fujairah after loading petrochemicals including methane from Jubail in Saudi Arabia and was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz when it was intercepted, the official said. A total of 20 crew members from South Korea, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam were on board the vessel.The guard corps took the ship to Bandar Abbas port in Iran, the semi-official Fars News Agency said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry later appeared to play down the incident, saying the seizure was related to a “technical issue” and stressed that it’s nuclear move was easily reversible.Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that nuclear weapons had “no place” in the country’s defense program, according to Tasnim.Strained RelationsRelations between Tehran and Seoul have been strained since the US reimposed tough sanctions on Iran and banned countries, including major Asian customers, from buying its petroleum.Iran says it has at least $7 billion from oil sales trapped in South Korea and the money is needed to purchase humanitarian goods, including coronavirus vaccines. Seoul’s deputy foreign minister was scheduled to visit Iran to discuss the trapped funds, a spokesman for Iran’s Foreign Ministry said just before the tanker was seized.South Korea is not a member of the International Maritime Security Construct, a maritime force created in 2019 in response to Iranian attacks and to protect sea lanes in the Middle East. Seoul has previously indicated a willingness to work with IMSC, though it has not requested assistance from the alliance so far, said an IMSC spokesman.The Hankuk Chemi was sailing to the United Arab Emirates port of Fujairah after loading at Jubail on Jan. 2, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. It veered off course in the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow stretch of water between the tip of Oman and Iran, and headed toward Bandar Abbas.UK Maritime Trade Operations, which serves as a link between the Royal Navy and commercial vessels operating in high-risk areas, said there had been “an interaction” between a merchant vessel and the Iranian authorities in the Strait of Hormuz between 6:15 a.m. and 7:33 a.m. London time.The US Fifth Fleet, which is based in the region, is “monitoring the situation,” spokeswoman Commander Rebecca Rebarich said.On Dec. 31, a mine was discovered attached to the hull of an oil tanker off Iraq, near the Iranian border. A ship at the Saudi Red Sea port of Jeddah was hit by an explosion earlier in the month, which Riyadh labeled an act of terror.Iran detained the UK-flagged tanker Stena Impero for more than two months at Bandar Abbas in mid-2019 in retaliation for the arrest of one of its ships off Gibraltar. The Islamic Republic seized another oil vessel that was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-seizes-ship-ramps-up-enrichment-as-gulf-tensions-mount/story-4A2bafX2k1x1yYJH8f1tmM.html
05-01-2021||World||Top Georgia election official says White House pushed him to take Trump call||Georgia’s top election official said on Monday that President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, had pushed him to take an “inappropriate” call in which he pressured the state to overturn his November presidential election defeat there. In the call on Saturday, Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” enough votes to make him the victor in the Southern state, according to a recording published by US media. “I never believed it was appropriate to speak to the president, but he pushed out, I guess he had his staff push us. They wanted a call,” Raffensperger told ABC’s “Good Morning America.” Two Democratic members of Congress asked FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday to investigate the call. “We believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes. We ask you to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president,” they said in a statement. The Justice Department had no comment on the request by Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice.A state Democrat has called for a probe into whether Trump had violated Georgia election law on the call. Raffensperger and his office’s general counsel rejected Trump’s assertions of electoral fraud in the hour-long conversation.“We took the call, and we had a conversation. He did most of the talking, we did most of the listening,” Raffensperger said. “But I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong. He had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two. That’s an example of just he has bad data.”Trump for two months has been claiming contrary to evidence that his loss to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud. Multiple state and federal reviews, as well as courts, have rejected those claims as unsupported.Biden won the state-by-state Electoral College by 306-232 and carried the popular vote by more than 7 million ballots.The only Democrat on Georgia’s election board, David Worley, asked Raffensperger in a letter on Sunday to investigate whether the president had violated state law that prohibits solicitation to commit election fraud.Raffensperger said the district attorney in Fulton County, home to Atlanta, might be the appropriate authority to carry out such an investigation. The county’s district attorney, Fani Willis, said she found news reports about Trump’s phone call with Raffensperger “disturbing.”The state election board can refer the case to her office and the state attorney general, said Willis, a Democrat elected in November. “I will enforce the law without fear or favor. Anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable,” Willis said. ‘UNWISE PRECEDENTS’In another blow to Trump, staunch conservative Senator Tom Cotton refused to sign on to a long-shot campaign by some dozen other Republicans in the U.S. Senate this week to challenge Biden’s victory, warning it was outside of Congress’ power and would “establish unwise precedents.”In a statement on Sunday, Cotton said he would not join his colleagues Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and others in defying Republican Party leaders by objecting on Wednesday when lawmakers meet to tally the votes in the Electoral College - a largely symbolic act of certification.Cotton, Cruz and Hawley are among those considered possible 2024 presidential candidates. Trump, who has not conceded defeat, has also floated the idea of running again in 2024.Thomas J. Donohue, chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce, criticized the effort on Monday, saying it “undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.”Several moderate Republicans have also joined the criticism of Cruz, Hawley and others for undermining the will of the voters and planning to object - a move they say will not succeed in installing Trump but will erode confidence in US democracy. It was not immediately clear how the release of Trump’s call with Raffensperger could affect the Republicans’ objection plan.“This call was not a helpful call,” Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, who is among those planning to object to the certification, told Fox News in an interview on Monday.US Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, criticized the call as “deeply troubling” on Monday, according to a congressional pool report.But Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, who is defending her seat in one of two US Senate runoffs in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine control of the chamber, said on Monday she would join the effort to object to the certification.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has publicly acknowledged Biden’s win. Vice President Mike Pence, who will oversee Wednesday’s proceedings, has said the Republicans have the right to object.Even if Republicans in the Senate were successful in their objections, the campaign would fail in the House, which is controlled by Democrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-georgia-election-official-says-white-house-pushed-him-to-take-trump-call/story-soDagD2lZYosTAn0Avu7BL.html
05-01-2021||World||Donald Trump says he’ll ‘fight like hell’ to hold on to presidency||With mounting desperation, Donald Trump declared Monday night he would “fight like hell” to hold on to the presidency and appealed to Republican lawmakers to reverse his election loss to Joe Biden when they convene this week to confirm the Electoral College vote.Electoral voters won by President-elect Biden are “not gonna take this White House!” he shouted as supporters cheered at an outdoor rally in Georgia. Trump’s announced purpose for the trip was to boost Republican Senate candidates in Tuesday’s runoff election, but he spent much of his speech complaining bitterly about his election loss — which he insists he won “by a lot.”Also Read: ‘Truth matters,’ says Georgia official resisting Donald Trump pressureEarlier, in Washington, he pressed Republican lawmakers to formally object Wednesday at a joint session of Congress that is to confirm Biden’s victory in the Electoral College, itself a confirmation of Biden’s nationwide victory Nov. 3.Though he got nothing but cheers Monday night, Trump’s attempt to overturn the presidential election i s splitting the Republican Party. Some GOP lawmakers backing him are rushing ahead, despite an outpouring of condemnation from current and former party officials warning the effort is undermining Americans’ faith in democracy. All 10 living former defense secretaries wrote in an op-ed that “the time for questioning the results has passed.”It’s unclear the extent to which GOP leaders in Congress will be able to control Wednesday’s joint session, which could drag into the night, though the challenges to the election are all but certain to fail. Trump himself is whipping up crowds for a Wednesday rally near the White House.Also Read| ‘It’s not social media, it’s Trump Media’: 5 key points from Donald Trump’s phone callVice President Mike Pence, who is under pressure to tip the results for Trump, will be closely watched as he presides in a ceremonial role over Wednesday’s joint session.“I promise you this: On Wednesday, we’ll have our day in Congress,” Pence said while himself campaigning in Georgia ahead of Tuesday’s runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate.Trump said in Georgia: “I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.” He added, “No, Mike is a great guy.”One of the Georgia Republicans in Tuesday’s runoff — Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who faces Democrat Raphael Warnock — told the crowd she will join senators formally objecting to Biden’s win. The other Republican seeking reelection, David Perdue, who is running against Democrat Jon Ossoff, will not be eligible to vote.Trump repeated numerous times his claims of election fraud, which have been rejected by election officials — Republican as well as Democratic in state after state — and courts up to the U.S. Supreme Court. His former attorney general, William Barr, also has said there is no evidence of fraud that could change the election outcome.The congressional effort to keep Trump in office is being led by Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, along with rank-and-file House members, some on the party’s fringe.“Just got off the phone with @realDonaldTrump,” tweeted newly elected Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is aligned with a conspiracy group backing Trump.“He wants you to call your Rep & Senators TODAY, ALL DAY!” she tweeted Monday. “Don’t let Republicans be the Surrender Caucus!” She later joined the president on Air Force One as he traveled to Georgia.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tried to prevent his party from engaging in this battle, which could help define the GOP in the post-Trump era. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Trump ally, has declined to say much publicly on it.Both Hawley and Cruz are potential 2024 presidential contenders, vying for Trump’s base of supporters.Biden, speaking at a drive-in rally in Atlanta, said Trump “spends more time whining and complaining” than he does working on solving the coronavirus pandemic. He added dismissively, “I don’t know why he still wants the job — he doesn’t want to do the work.”During the day Monday, more current and former GOP officials rebuked the effort to upend the election.Former three-term Sen. John Danforth of Missouri said in a stinging statement, “Lending credence to Trump’s false claim that the election was stolen is a highly destructive attack.” He said, “It is the opposite of conservative; it is radical.”Two current Republican senators, Rob Portman of Ohio and Mike Lee of Utah, joined the growing number who now oppose the legislators’ challenge.Portman said in a statement, “I cannot support allowing Congress to thwart the will of the voters.”At the Dalton rally, Trump noted he was a “little angry” at Lee, but expressed hope that the senator would change his mind. “We need his vote,” Trump said.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the giant lobbying organization and virtual embodiment of the business establishment, said the electoral vote challenge “undermines our democracy and the rule of law and will only result in further division across our nation.”So far, Trump has enlisted support from a dozen Republican senators and up to 100 House Republicans to challenge Biden’s 306-232 Electoral College win.With Biden set to be inaugurated Jan. 20, Trump is intensifying efforts to prevent the traditional transfer of power. On a call disclosed Sunday, he can be heard pressuring Georgia officials to “find” him more votes from the Nov. 3 election he lost in that state.The challenge to the presidential election is on a scale unseen since the aftermath of the Civil War, though the typically routine process of confirming Electoral College votes has been hit with brief objections before. In 2017, several House Democrats challenged Trump’s win, but Biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert Trump’s victory.States run their own elections, and Congress has been loath to interfere.“The 2020 election is over,” said a statement Sunday from a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mitt Romney of Utah.A range of Republican officials — including Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland; Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House GOP leader; and former House Speaker Paul Ryan — have criticized the GOP efforts to overturn the election.Hawley defended his actions in a lengthy email over the weekend to colleagues, saying his Missouri constituents have been “loud and clear” in insisting Biden’s defeat of Trump was unfair.Cruz’s coalition of 11 Republican senators vows to reject the Electoral College tallies unless Congress launches a commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. Congress is unlikely to agree to that.The group, which presented no new evidence of election problems, includes Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-ll-fight-like-hell-to-hold-on-to-presidency/story-kOIg12CGh6lm9ZRhJOjuPP.html
05-01-2021||World||60,000 babies born in India on New Year’s Day, world’s highest: UNICEF||More than 371,500 babies were born worldwide on New Year’s Day and India is estimated to have recorded the highest number of births at around 60,000, according to the UN’s children’s agency. UNICEF said that an estimated 371,504 babies were born around the world on New Year’s Day. Fiji in the Pacific was projected to have welcomed 2021’s first baby while the United States would welcome its last. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to have taken place in 10 countries: India (59,995), China (35,615), Nigeria (21,439), Pakistan (14,161), Indonesia (12,336), Ethiopia (12,006), the United States (10,312), Egypt (9,455), Bangladesh (9,236) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (8,640), it said. In total, an estimated 140 million children will be born in 2021 and their average life expectancy is expected to be 84 years, the UN agency said. “The children born today enter a world far different than even a year ago, and a New Year brings a new opportunity to reimagine it,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said, calling on nations to make 2021 the year they start to build a fairer, safer, healthier world for children. The year 2021 will also mark the 75th anniversary of UNICEF. Over the course of the year, UNICEF and its partners will be commemorating the anniversary with events and announcements celebrating three-quarters of a century of protecting children from conflict, disease and exclusion and championing their right to survival, health and education. “Today, as the world faces a global pandemic, economic slowdown, rising poverty and deepening inequality, the need for UNICEF’s work is as great as ever,” said Fore. “For the last 75 years, throughout conflicts, displacements, natural disasters and crises, UNICEF has been there for the world’s children. As a New Year dawns, we renew our commitment to protect children, to speak up for their rights, and to make sure their voices are heard, no matter where they live,” Fore said. In response to the global pandemic, UNICEF launched the Reimagine campaign, a global effort to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from becoming a lasting crisis for children. Through the campaign, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, the public, donors and the private sector to join UNICEF as it seeks to respond, recover and reimagine a better, post-pandemic world. For the estimates, UNICEF used vital registration and nationally representative household survey data to estimate the monthly and daily fractions of births in countries. UNICEF used the annual live births numbers and period life expectancy from the latest revision of the UN’s World Population Prospects (2019) to estimate the babies born on January 1, 2021 and their cohort life expectancy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/60-000-babies-born-in-india-on-new-year-s-day-world-s-highest-unicef/story-BQs3DpGiP0sSpyRj6hhztM.html

While India is expected to shortly begin what will be the world’s largest immunisation drive, having cleared its first two vaccines on Sunday, the United Kingdom on Monday started giving shots of a second Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Last month, the UK also became the first country to begin a vaccination drive, administering shots of the Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE vaccine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith the global Covid-19 caseload at more than 85 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, here are some latest updates on the vaccination front:1. Brian Pinker, 82-year-old dialysis patient, became the first British citizen, as well as the first in the world, to receive a shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The immunisation drive began with 530,000 doses of the vaccine on a day that ended with prime minister Boris Johnson announcing another national lockdown due to begin early Wednesday.Also Read | Covid-19: Boris Johnson locks down UK again, says ‘variant spreading at an alarming rate’2. Mexico has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, its government announced on Monday, joining the UK, Argentina and India in giving a nod to the shot. The announcement was made by deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell on Twitter. Mexico is already administering shots of the Pfizer vaccine to its health workers.3. Moderna Inc, the American drugmaker, on Monday said Israel had approved its vaccine against Covid-19. “Israel’s ministry of health has secured 6 million doses and first deliveries are expected to begin in January,” the company said in a statement. This makes Israel the third country overall, after the US and Canada, the first outside North America and the first in Asia to authorise Moderna’s vaccine.4. Spain, which is using Pfizer’s vaccine, has administered 83,000 doses since December 27, health minister Salvador Illa said on Monday. Illa also said that Spain expects to vaccinate around 4.5 million people, of the country’s 47 million population, by the end of March. This, Illa said, depends on Spain receiving nearly 350,000 doses per week during the next few two months.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-begins-immunisation-drive-of-second-vaccine-mexico-okays-oxford-astrazeneca-candidate/story-BubxY92kBvfQf6zvCPuIHL.html
05-01-2021||World||Vaccines may not work on South African coronavirus variant: UK scientists||Scientists are not fully confident that Covid-19 vaccines will work on a new variant of the coronavirus found in South Africa, ITV’s political editor said on Monday, citing an unidentified scientific adviser to the British government.Both Britain and South Africa have discovered new, more infectious variants in the coronavirus in recent weeks that have driven a surge in cases. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday he was now very worried about the strand found in South Africa.Scientists including BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin and John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford, have said they are testing the vaccines on the new variants and say they could make any required tweaks in around six weeks.“According to one of the government’s scientific advisers, the reason for Matt Hancock’s ‘incredible worry’ about the South African Covid-19 variant is that they are not as confident the vaccines will be as effective against it as they are for the UK’s variant,” ITV political editor Robert Peston said.Public Health England said there was currently no evidence to suggest that vaccines will not be effective against the new strain. The health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.The world’s richest countries have started vaccinating their populations to safeguard against a virus that has killed 1.8 million people and crushed the global economy.There are currently 60 vaccine candidates in trials, including those that are already being rolled out from AstraZeneca and Oxford, Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinopharm.That has helped to lift global financial markets, but the discovery of the new variants has raised fresh alarm.Scientists say the new South African variant has multiple mutations in the important “spike” protein that the virus uses to infect human cells.It has also been associated with a higher viral load, meaning a higher concentration of virus particles in patients’ bodies, possibly contributing to higher levels of transmission.Oxford’s Bell, who advises the government’s vaccine task force, said on Sunday he thought vaccines would work on the British variant but said there was a “big question mark” as to whether they would work on the South African variant.He told Times Radio that the shots could be adapted and “it might take a month or six weeks to get a new vaccine”.BioNTech’s Sahin told Spiegel in an interview published on Friday that their vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with the variant first detected in Britain.“We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant and will soon know more,” he said.Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though it might require additional regulatory approvals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-may-not-work-on-south-african-coronavirus-variant-uk-scientists/story-ZmRbrICJAC4SqSyX547XhN.html
05-01-2021||World||Most US Covid-19 vaccines go idle as New York, Florida move to penalize hospitals||More than two-thirds of the 15 million coronavirus vaccines shipped within the United States have so far gone unused, US health officials said on Monday, as the governors of New York and Florida vowed to penalize hospitals that fail to dispense shots quickly enough.In New York, hospitals must administer vaccines within a week of receiving them or face a fine and a reduction in future supplies, Governor Andrew Cuomo said, hours before announcing the state’s first known case of a new, more infectious coronavirus variant originally detected in Britain.“I don’t want the vaccine in a fridge or a freezer, I want it in somebody’s arm,” the governor said. “If you’re not performing this function, it does raise questions about the operating efficiency of the hospital.”New York hospitals on the whole have dispensed fewer than half of their allocated doses to date, but performance varied from one group of hospitals to another, Cuomo said. The NYC Health + Hospitals system, the city’s main public hospital network, has only administered 31% of its allotment, compared with 99% for a few private hospitals in the state. In Florida, where officials have put senior citizens ahead of many essential workers for getting the vaccine, Governor Ron DeSantis announced a policy under which the state would allocate more doses to hospitals that dispense them most quickly, “Hospitals that do not do a good job of getting the vaccine out will have their allocations transferred to hospitals that are doing a good job at getting the vaccine out,” DeSantis said at a briefing.“We do not want vaccine to just be idle at some hospital system,” he added, although he did not say they would face fines.Florida will also deploy an additional 1,000 nurses to administer vaccines and will keep state-run vaccination sites open seven days a week, he said.UK VARIANT FOUND IN NEW YORKCuomo’s announcement that the more contagious COVID variant known as B.1.1.7 had been confirmed in a man in his 60s living in a town north of Albany gave new urgency to the state’s efforts to accelerate vaccinations. At least three other US cases of the so-called UK variant have been documented since last week, one each in Florida, California and Colorado. None of the four patients has a recent travel history, meaning the variant was likely spreading person-to-person within each of the communities where it turned up.Neither the UK variant, nor a similarly more contagious strain first found in South Africa, is believed any more lethal than the original form of the virus. Scientists say newly developed vaccines should be equally effective against both.But medical experts worry that the emergence of a more communicable variant could accelerate a months-long surge of infections and hospitalizations already straining US healthcare systems to their limits.The US death toll has climbed to well over 350,000 out of more than 20 million known infections to date, with the fatality rate averaging 2,600-plus lives every 24 hours over the past week. The staggering human toll, together with an upending of daily social life and a stifling of economic activity, has made the slower-than-expected uptake of available vaccines all the more vexing to authorities.‘WE HAVE TO DO BETTER’Some of the problem has been attributed to widespread distrust of immunizations, even among some healthcare workers, owing in part to the record speed with which Covid-19 vaccines were developed and approved 11 months after the virus emerged in the United States.But some U.S. officials also have cited a lack of adequate planning and logistical glitches in launching the most ambitious mass inoculation campaign in the nation’s history.The federal government has distributed more than 15 million vaccine doses to states and territories across the country, but only around 4.5 million have been administered so far, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released on Monday. Those figures put the government far short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, although officials said they expected the rollout would pick up significantly this month.“We have go to do better, and we are going to keep doing better, and I promise you, you will see in the next two weeks numbers increase substantially,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS News in an interview.Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said New York and Florida were being “overly bureaucratic” in penalizing hospitals over vaccine deliveries even as they coped with soaring patient caseloads.“Instead of fining hospitals, why not give them more resources to do this, more money, more staffing?” he said in a telephone interview.New York has dispensed about 175,000 doses of the 896,000 it has received since mid-December, according to CDC data. Florida has dispensed 265,000 of the 1.14 million doses it received.Monday also marked the first day when some Americans were due to receive their second vaccine shots, three weeks after getting the first. Among them was Maritza Beniquez, a healthcare worker in Newark, New Jersey.“I now have body armor,” she said after receiving the dose in a video shared on Facebook by state officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-covid-19-vaccines-go-idle-as-new-york-florida-move-to-penalize-hospitals/story-pQUw3JvX9UWoTn3gCVJphN.html
05-01-2021||World||UK is back in lockdown as hospitals face breaking point||Boris Johnson imposed a third coronavirus lockdown across England, shutting schools and ordering the public to stay at home, amid dire warnings that the National Health Service is at risk of being overwhelmed.The emergency measures will start immediately and last until at least February 15, potentially devastating retail and hospitality businesses and threatening to push the economy into a double-dip recession, as medics try to get a grip on the pandemic.In a televised address to the nation, the prime minister insisted he had no option but to close down all social activities, education and non-essential travel in the face of a sudden and severe surge in infections. Similar steps are being taken across the rest of the UK, he said.The government now aims to rush out a vaccination program, reaching 13.9 million vulnerable people and carers by mid-February so restrictions can begin to be lifted.“Our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic,” Johnson said in the broadcast. “With most of the country already under extreme measures it’s clear that we need to do more to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out.”Police FinesThe police will have legal powers to use fines and dispersal orders to enforce the rules. Parliament will be recalled to debate the measures on Wednesday but the regulations are due to become law on Tuesday, officials said.The prime minister was forced to act after data showed new infections soaring past 50,000 a day and more people in the hospital than in the first peak of the virus in April.By January 4, there were 26,626 patients in hospital with Covid-19, a 30% increase in a week, which the government is blaming on a surge in infections from a new, faster spreading strain of the virus.Johnson resisted pressure from scientists and opposition lawmakers to lockdown the whole country in December. He cut back plans to allow families to mix over Christmas, but insisted he wanted to avoid nationwide curbs like those seen in March, choosing to keep a regional tier system in place instead.But government chief medical officers for the four nations of the UK warned on Monday that the health service may not be able to cope without urgent action now. They issued a statement two hours before the prime minister’s announcement, saying the NHS is “under immense pressure” already.Overwhelmed“We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days,” they said in a statement which said the national alert level is now at the highest level five. “Cases are rising almost everywhere.”Scotland earlier announced a lockdown starting at midnight. “We are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus,” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said as she ordered Scots to stay home and for schools to remain shut.Johnson has made keeping schools open for face-to-face learning a priority for his government, but scientists warned last month they would have to close to stop the virus from spreading. While children rarely suffer badly from the disease, they can infect their families after catching it from their friends.It’s a far cry from the government’s optimism in early December, when the arrival of vaccines was described as the “scientific cavalry” coming to the rescue.On Monday, the premier insisted he wanted to vaccinate about 14 million older and vulnerable people and their carers, including frontline medics, by the middle of February.“If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of the virus,” Johnson said. “And of course, that will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have endured for so long.”But there will be a “time lag” between vaccinating patients and the pressure on the NHS easing, Johnson said, adding that he is “cautious about the timetable ahead.”The dilemma for the government has been to try to balance attempts to stop the spread of the virus against the need to keep shops and businesses open to protect the economy, which has already suffered its deepest recession since the Great Frost in 1709.A double-dip recession is looking increasingly inevitable as a result of the new lockdown. Before Johnson’s announcement, most economists expected the UK economy to eke out some growth this quarter.Four weeks of school closures could cost as much as 3% of GDP, according to a tweet by Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz SE. Bloomberg Economics estimates that as much as 6% of Europe’s labor supply could be affected by the narrowing of childcare options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-is-back-in-lockdown-as-hospitals-face-breaking-point/story-t2UNwK0BmxGHb13lQuWZ6I.html
05-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Boris Johnson locks down UK again, says ‘variant spreading at an alarming rate’||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday night announced another national lockdown from early Wednesday following continuing spike in the number of new Covid-19 cases – the country registered over 50,000 daily infections for seven consecutive days – as the race between vaccine and the virus entered a new phase.Johnson said in an address to the nation that the variant has been spreading at an “alarming rate”, which makes another lockdown imperative. The restrictions with the main message to ‘stay at home’ will last from early Wednesday for six weeks, he said, adding that they include closure of schools, not venturing out of homes unless for essential reasons and working from home.A grim-faced Johnson said: “(We) now have a new variant of the virus. It has been both frustrating and alarming to see the speed with which the new variant is spreading. Our scientists have confirmed this new variant is between 50 and 70 per cent more transmissible”.“As I speak to you tonight, our hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic. In England alone, the number of Covid patients in hospitals has increased by nearly a third in the last week, to almost 27,000”.“That number is 40 per cent higher than the first peak in April. On 29 December, more than 80,000 people tested positive for Covid across the UK – a new record. The number of deaths is up by 20 per cent over the last week and will sadly rise further.“With most of the country already under extreme measures, it is clear that we need to do more, together, to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out. In England, we must therefore go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant. That means the Government is once again instructing you to stay at home”, he added.This is the third nation-wide lockdown since March 2020. It was re-imposed in November, when cases rose after a dip over the summer months. The overall number of deaths in the UK is expected to reach the grim figure of 100,000 by the end of January or early February.Two vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca have been deployed, with over 1.5 million people so far vaccinated; the UK has ordered 40 million of the former and 100 million of the latter vaccine.The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales said that based on the latest data, the UK’s alert level moved from level 4 to level 5, which means hospitals and the health infrastructure is under “immense pressure”.They said in a statement: “There are currently very high rates of community transmission, with substantial numbers of Covid patients in hospitals and in intensive care. Cases are rising almost everywhere, in much of the country driven by the new more transmissible variant”.“We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-boris-johnson-locks-down-uk-again-says-variant-spreading-at-an-alarming-rate/story-TjbAv6FzJU6G9x4M6A6fiJ.html
05-01-2021||World||Joe Biden: Most closely watched man of 2021||No government will be watched as closely as that of United States President-elect Joe Biden’s. After four rollercoaster years of Donald Trump, the world will look for proof of the new Democratic President’s claim, “America is back.” Despite an emphatic election victory and an administration of Washington veterans, the going will not be easy. The political guerrilla war Trump is still waging against Biden is a warning the Republican Party will remain irascible and irrational. The Right may yet control the Senate and have a good chance of recapturing both houses in the 2022 midterm elections. Biden has indicated he is a one-term president which would confer lame duck status by early 2023. The president-elect wants to resurrect the spirit of bipartisanship of yore. But Trump is working hard and dirty to ensure that doesn’t happen.Read more| Biden flexes Georgia muscle alongside GOP in Senate racesBiden’s foreign policy strategy is to spend as little time on foreign policy as possible. He believes the US needs large-scale social engineering at home if it wants to avoid throwing up another populist like Trump. He wants to cut defence spending and has ambitious plans to rebuild America’s infrastructure, green its energy and transport, and revamp its health care and educational systems. But how will he do all this while also facing off the “Death to America” bloc of China, Russia, Iran and Turkey? That will be his primary global challenge.The Biden strategy is to revive the US’s alliance structure, the most extensive of any country in the world and pooh-poohed by Trump. Which is why he keeps talking up Europe and NATO. He will also be softer on Israel, India and other countries who are strategically close to the US but ideologically distant from the Democrats. Biden will seek to create coalitions of the willing to, say, counter China on 5G technology or Belt and Road infrastructure. But he will downplay military responses, so expect the US to push for the Quad to be more about supply chains and less about aircraft carriers. At the same time, Washington will try to work closely with Beijing and Moscow on multilateral issues. Biden has called for partnering with China on “climate change, nonproliferation, and global health security.”Read more| Biden has no record of missteps on IndiaAll this sounds good on paper. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating and Biden may yet choke. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi has already warned that if Washington wants to work, it must look the other way when it comes to Xinjiang and Hong Kong – both of which will be the world’s human rights black holes this coming year. And both governments have already begun sparring over Taiwan. The president-elect has said he sees Russia as a greater threat than China. A more positive element is Biden’s plans to revive nuclear talks with Iran. Tehran is already readying to expand oil production in expectation of an easing of sanctions. What is good for the Narendra Modi government is that India fits in nicely with a lot of what Biden wants to accomplish on the world stage. And what Biden’s team doesn’t like about India, largely civil rights issues on the domestic front, will be small fry compared to the unpleasantness of other governments. The incoming US president has said he plans to hold a climate summit – here Modi can expect a seat at the high table – and another of democracies – where he should expect a private lecture on what Biden has called “democratic backsliding.” Biden has said he won’t be doing trade agreements in a hurry just as well as New Delhi doesn’t do FTAs well.Read more| Joe Biden’s inauguration to include presidential escort, virtual paradeBiden takes oath of office on January 20 and will face two immediate tests. One is getting his senior personnel choices approved by the Senate. The other is showing he can handle the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out better than Trump handled any aspect of the pandemic. After that, he needs to push through his domestic agenda despite dogged and exhausting opposition from the Republicans.

05-01-2021||World||Will economy give Xi Jinping muscle to flex?||China enters 2021 on a high. Even if it wasn’t, Beijing would manufacture one. This is the Chinese Communist Party’s 100th anniversary so there must be bells and whistles. However, Beijing’s leadership feels the imperial ambitions of the Middle Kingdom are going well. China, though its own bungling led to Covid-19 becoming a pandemic, is spreading the word about its success in stamping out the virus. Xi Jinping faces novice leaders in two of China’s main rivals, the United States and Japan. Its sharply rebounding economy will be the driver of any global revival.They started the fire, but want to be remembered as the phoenix who rose from the ashes. That is the narrative Beijing will push over the next few months. It’s one reason China has gone hammer and tongs at Australia and others who have called for a robust investigation as to how the pandemic began. The other part of this Covid alt-news will be about how Sinopharm’s vaccine was the only one provided to the affected.Read more| EU sets aside China’s rights record, seals pact with Prez Xi that may upset USXi will see no reason to be less wolf warrior-ish this year. Things worked out reasonably well last year despite the pandemic. President Donald Trump’s tariff strikes were hard but not true. The United States earned as much negative press as China for committing less sins. Foreign minister Wang Yi last month dismissed the US’s attempts at stitching together an international coalition against China, correctly saying “the overwhelming majority of [other countries] do not want to take sides.” Beijing’s influence expanded across Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Leaders from Germany to Sri Lanka offered economic concessions as tribute. Some things did not go as planned. Galwan Valley was supposed to bring India down a peg but backfired quite bloodily. No matter, as far as the Chinese public is concerned the incident never happened.Read more| Chinese economy is recovering. But there are gaps | AnalysisBeijing will have more on its domestic plate in 2021. Besides the 100th anniversary party for the Party, it will also adopt its 14th Five Year Plan. Xi has promised some tectonic economic shifts. He has said the Chinese equivalent of “vocal for local” will play as great a role in growth as exports. He has also committed to creating a net zero carbon economy. Fluff or fact? That will depend on the Five-Year Plan’s fine print.

He said that the constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule will be discussed with the home minister. “We are confident of getting it because the home minister had given us his commitment. In fact, he had invited us to meet him soon after elections to Leh Hill Development Council but we could not go to Delhi because of the Covid pandemic,” he said. Also read: US welcomes LeT commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi’s arrest on charges of terror financing“Delay happened on our end but we are now hopeful of a fruitful discussion. We are confident that the discussion will pave way for the constitutional safeguards to allay our fears,” said Chhewang. Besides Rinpoche and Chhewang, other members of the delegation include former BJP minister Chering Dorjay, chief executive councillor of Leh Council, Tashi Gyalson, sitting BJP MP and Ladakh unit president Jamyang Tsering Namgyal. On December 21, Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM) decided to reach out to the opinion-makers in Leh and Kargil districts to press for the sixth schedule to the strategic Ladakh region. Apex body of People’s Movement, an apolitical body which has former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Thiksay monastery head Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora, has been demanding constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule of the Constitution to Ladakh on the lines of north-eastern states of having constitutional safeguards.The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organizations and all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association. The safeguards also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers. It may be recalled here that Thupstan Chhewang, former BJP MP, had resigned from his post and primary membership of the party in November 2018 for not conferring UT status to Ladakh region and other promises made by the BJP in 2014 general elections. Sixth schedule also guaranteed no settlement of outsiders in the strategic region. According to the 2011 Census, Ladakh has a population of 1,34,000, the majority of them being Buddhists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-delegation-to-meet-amit-shah-on-wednesday-for-6th-schedule/story-WoF6MNk1TsFlP3Po2Y7WdO.html
05-01-2021||India||BJP MP wants ‘Work From Home’ for techies to be scrapped, says its hurting other sectors||A senior BJP Member of Parliament, PC Mohan, has stirred up a controversy by demanding that ‘work from home’ (WFH) regulations for technology workers should be cancelled as it is negatively impacting the business of other sectors. Mohan, a three-time MP from Bengaluru Central, has said that the state which accounts for nearly a third of the IT exports from the country should cancel the WFH option for tech workers.“Several other sectors whether it is transportation like cabs, rickshaws, or even the hotel and hospitality sector and real estate maintenance workers are severely impacted because of the WFH option being provided to tech workers. While all other sectors have resumed normal work, why don’t tech workers also contribute their bit in normalising economic recovery? The spending done by tech workers in cities like Bengaluru is what sustains and enables other sectors and it is unfair that they are doing WFH,” the parliamentarian said while speaking to the media.Pointing out that a large chunk of the economy especially in a city like Bengaluru had been impacted due to the services not being used by tech workers; Mohan has said that he would request CM BS Yediyurappa to talk to the industry, so that they withdraw WFH. “If flights, trains and buses are running at almost full capacity what prevents IT and BT workers from going back to work? Let them take whatever precaution is required but they should resume ‘normal’ working”Most technology companies have enabled the WFH option for their employees till the end of June at least. A senior IT industry consultant, Lakshmi Vishwanath, however slammed the MP’s demand, “The MP’s demand is ludicrous. What the pandemic did was made companies realise that several functions can be permanently done outside the office with even greater efficiency. It is like demanding that we should not use mechanized tools in construction industry because it will affect the livelihood of some workers. Even now companies will be careful of bringing back their entire workforce to office premises. That model I think is permanently broken.”However, Mohan has said that he would raise the issue with state government so that it could talk to leading technology companies so that they cancel the WFH option for their employees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mp-wants-work-from-home-for-techies-to-be-scrapped-says-its-hurting-other-sectors/story-3v8OHbdSfNzmtIHqVx3tKP.html

The annual bird census in the lagoon was carried out in five ranges under the Chilika Wildlife Division. As many as 21 teams comprising 111 wildlife officials, experts and environmentalists were deployed at Satpada in Puri, Rambha in Ganjam and Balugaon and Tangi of Khurda districts for carrying out the migratory bird count exercise.Nanda said last year, the number of birds was estimated at around 11.04 lakh. In 2019, 10.47 lakh birds were counted at the lagoon that is counted among the world’s most amazing biodiversity hotspots.“Wetland ecosystems are highly resilient and bounce bank to normalcy in the shortest possible time. Removal of 160 sq km of encroachment in 2018-19, has resulted in a record arrival of birds. Population of avifauna is the best indicator of health of a wetland ecosystem. Thanks to all the staff involved in making Chilika a safe haven for migratory birds,” he said.Covering an approx area of 1,100 sq km, the lagoon is the largest wintering ground for migratory birds in India. It welcomes numerous species of endangered birds every winter season. The lagoon hosts birds from as far as Russia, Mongolia, Central and Southeast Asia and Himalayas, that flock to the lagoon during the migratory season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-s-chilika-lake-logs-its-highest-ever-count-with-11-42-lakh-migratory-birds/story-jNWnWvaor6CgJYTb2fQUjO.html
05-01-2021||India||Now, vendor in Bulandshahr booked for selling ‘Thakur’ brand shoes||The Uttar Pradesh have registered against a roadside vendor for selling footwear of ‘Thakur’ brand in Gulaothi police station area of Bulandshahr district. The vendor Nasir’s family has accused the police of keeping him in custody for over 48 hours. “He was taken into custody on Monday morning and thereafter a case was registered against him,” Nasir’s father Saleem told mediapersons. Circle officer of Secundrabad area Namrata Srivastava said that a case under Sections 153A, 323C and 504 of IPC had been registered against Nasir and he had been taken into custody. “A team has been sent to the shop from where he bought the shoes for further investigation,” said the CO.He said that members of an organisation had gone to buy shoes and thereafter reported the matter to the police. “The case was registered on their complaint,” said the CO. He did not mention the name of the members of the organization but sources said they belonged to the Bajrang Dal. A video circulated on social media shows Nasir explaining to a group of activists that he was simply selling the shoes and knew nothing about the brand name. The same activists are seen advising him that he should have removed that particular lot of shoes to protect his trade from a bad name. Ironically, Thakur Footwear Company is an Agra-based brand which has been in business for over six decades. The company sells shoes by the name of TFC and has a good customer base. But it is not clear whether Nasir was selling shoes of the original brand or counterfeits. The police have justified the action through a tweet which claimed, “Had police not taken action in the case, many people would have reacted critically/ differently. Therefore, police initiated action under the purview of law.” The Samajwadi Party has criticised the police action and said the government should instead act against officials who approved Thakur brand name. Samajwadi Party leader and former member of state planning commission Sudhir Panwar said, “It seems the police acted in haste to please their political bosses because the shoe vendor did not commit a crime. He was just selling shoes after purchasing them from a wholesaler. Action should be taken against those government officials who approved Thakur brand name”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-vendor-in-bulandshahr-booked-for-selling-thakur-brand-shoes/story-gTMkSqAMUoV6Q5Ec3pe5UN.html
05-01-2021||India||US welcomes LeT commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi’s arrest on charges of terror financing||The United States on Tuesday welcomed the arrest of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi by Pakistani authorities on charges of terror financing but also called for his prosecution for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. “We welcome Pakistan’s arrest of terrorist leader Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi as an important step in holding him responsible for his role in supporting terrorism and its financing,” the US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs said on Twitter.“We will follow his prosecution & sentencing closely & urge that he be held accountable for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks,” it said.Lakhvi, one of the alleged masterminds of the Mumbai attacks, was arrested by Pakistani authorities on January 2 on charges of involvement in terror financing, almost five years after he was freed on bail. His whereabouts had not been known since he was released on bail from a jail in Rawalpindi in April 2015. However, it was widely believed he had continued playing a key role in directing the activities of LeT even while he was in prison after being arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage. Six US citizens were among the 166 people killed when a 10-member LeT team attacked Mumbai in November 2008.A spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan’s Punjab province said in a statement that Lakhvi was arrested on charges of terrorism financing during an intelligence-based operation. “He is accused of running a dispensary [and] using funds collected for terrorism financing. He [and] others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the spokesman said. Lakhvi, who is also a UN-designated terrorist, will face trial in an anti-terrorism court in Lahore, the spokesperson said.Last year, LeT founder Hafiz Saeed was convicted in five separate cases of terror financing and given a jail term ranging from five years to fifteen-and-half years. These sentences will run concurrently. Lakhvi’s arrest came weeks ahead of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) planned reassessment of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing. In October last year, the multilateral watchdog retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, and gave the country time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-let-commander-zakiur-rehman-lakhvi-s-arrest-on-charges-of-terror-financing/story-PjypeqBZXfkhinxE05lbhM.html

The court pronounced the decision while hearing a petition filed by the parents of the accused claiming that he was a minor on the day of the incident last year.“Taking into account the age of the accused as per the matriculation certificate and birth certificate, the POCSO court ruled that the accused was a minor and hence needs to be produced before a juvenile justice board,” said public prosecutor Bansidhar Routray.The court also sent him to Angul Juvenile Home and ordered that hearing on SIT’s plea for a narco test on January 8 by the Juvenile Justice Board.The Opposition BJP which is demanding a CBI probe into the case, has been accusing SIT chief Arun Bothra of shielding BJD minister Arun Sahoo by arresting the youth. The party has made it a major political issue and organised a padyatra to the village of the victim demanding justice. Last year on July 14, the 5-year-old daughter of a rickshaw-puller in Nayagarh district, went missing while playing outside. Ten days later, her skeletal remains were discovered in a sack outside their house. The girl’s father alleged that his daughter was killed by one Babuli Nayak, an aide of higher education minister Arun Sahoo.The victim’s parents also alleged their daughter may have fallen victim to an organ racket which they claimed Nayan ran. With the local police slow to take action, the parents of the girl tried to bring attention to the case by attempting self-immolation outside the Odisha Assembly on November 24. The state government then set up the SIT which claimed that the accused was an 18-year-old youth.Bothra had also claimed that the accused had strangulated the little girl after failing to sexually assault her. The SIT even subjected him to bone ossification test and claimed he was above 18 years.Hours after the POCSO court order, the SIT issued a statement saying that as per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 amended after the Nirbhaya case, any accused between the age of 16-18 years would be tried as an adult in the POCSO Court if he is involved in heinous offence. “Since the present case relates to the most heinous crime the SIT will appraise the JJB to try the accused as an adult under appropriate provision of the law,” the SIT said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-pocso-court-says-accused-in-rape-and-murder-of-5-year-old-girl-is-minor/story-i2VUmbTOFwcb8SSs4gu8RK.html

05-01-2021||India||In their world of beanie caps||As the temperature begins to plummet, we tend to get layered. From sweaters, coats, boots to cardigans all add to our winter style statement. Lucknow is witnessing sharp fall in temperature and youngsters are all game for putting their best fashion foot forward with various winter clothing accessories including beanie caps, berets, stoles, scarves, mufflers and shawls being available online and in local market. The youth are leaving no stone unturned to make a fashion statement.According to Dr Rashmi Munshi, associate professor NIFT, accessorising right is the key to winter fashion. “Winter dressing is all about layering and dressing tends to give a bulkier look. So, one should use contrasting colour beanies, mufflers and others to break monotony of dark winter clothes. Also, it keeps you all warm and then woollen items have resurfaced as the most fashionable trend.”For law student, Naureen Rizvi and home maker Ruchika Kumar winter fashion is all about beanie, pullovers and boots. “For me beanie cap is a must to complete my winter dressing. It helps me to complete my fashionable look. I have a large number of beanies of pastel as well as dark shades to match it with my sweaters,” said Naureen.Then for some beanies are not only a fashion wear but they sport it to keep all warm and cozy. Banking professional Richa Jhingran says, “I actually wear beanie caps as they keep me warm and saves from catching cold. Whenever I sport these caps, they do add a lot of statement to my winter attires.”Youngsters who are constantly travelling to hills have beanie caps as their essential winter wear. UX designer Yamina, said, “I’m an avid traveller and love mountains, so for me, beanies are my travelling partners and they take maximum of luggage space along with trench coats.”Dr Munshi adds that the only thing that one should keep in mind with these clothing accessories are to keep your collection up-to-date and one should avoid bubbled caps. “As beanie caps are largely made of woollen their storage is challenging and then due to regular wear they do get bubbled. I suggest one should have fabric shaver handy to solve the constant bubbling issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/in-their-world-of-beanie-caps/story-AiTS2JoLAAMOJFqu6YXuPM.html

Both the series got a good audience response and the young director is now gearing up for the next season of the series which he says will be much bigger. With second season in the making Ritam is being very guarded and watchful. “The curse of sequels is weighing too much on me. Seeing the debacle of second seasons of some big shows, the kind of pressure I’m facing is much more then my debut release. I extra careful with the show,” he said. Though he cites examples of franchisees like ‘Peaky Blinders’, ‘Breaking Bad’, ‘The Wire’, ‘Money Heist’ and others that took their second season to the next level. “From my experience, I can say that we need to be close to the original characters and storyline while integrating new angles. One should not be repetitive and try to add a fresh milieu with same characters. So, I am working with this vision and combination.” The shoot of the second season is expected to start in February-March in Varanasi. Ritam has been chief assistant director with Prakash Jha in films likes ‘Raajneeti’ ‘Aarakshan’, Chakravyuh, ‘Satyagraha’ and ‘Jai Gangaajal’.

05-01-2021||India||Kerala gold smuggling: NIA files chargesheet against 20 accused||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the Kerala gold smuggling case on Tuesday filed the first charge- sheet against selected accused in a special court in Kochi. In a surprise move, fourth accused in the case Sandip Nair, who was arrested along with prime accused Swapna Suresh from their hideout in Bengaluru in July, was made an approver in the case.The NIA filed the first chargesheet since some of the accused were planning to move court for bail citing their 6-month long judicial custody. Twenty people have been named in the charge-sheet and they were booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act Sections 16, 17, 18 and 20, said NIA in a statement.But senior IAS officer M Sivasankar, who was Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s secretary, did not figure in the initial charge-sheet. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had arrested him in connection with money laundering related to the smuggling case. Among the 35 arrested, 20 figure in the first charge-sheet. A senior official familiar with the probe said a supplementary charge-sheet will be filed later as the investigation progressed. He also said hectic efforts are on to extradite some of accused staying in West Asian countries. The chargesheet was filed by investigating officer Radhakrishna Pillai before the NIA court. Earlier, while hearing the bail pleas of some of the accused, the court had repeatedly asked the agency to submit the terror angle evidence in the case. This is the first time the agency slapped the UAPA, which is usually invoked for terror incidents, in a smuggling case. “Investigation revealed that the accused had knowingly conspired since June 2019, raised funds and smuggled from the UAE, between November 19 and June 20 around 167 kgs of gold, through the import cargo addressed to diplomats at the consular general office of UAE in Thiruvananthapuram,” said the NIA. The main accused in the case also planned to smuggle more gold from countries like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, it said adding eight accused were absconding. The case was registered by the central agency on July 10. The sensational gold smuggling case came to light on July 5 after 30 kg of the yellow metal was seized by the Customs from a package camouflaged as diplomatic consignment addressed to the UAE consulate in the state capital. Later PS Sarith Kumar, a former public relations officer of the consulate who came to receive the baggage, was arrested by the Customs. Customs sniffed trouble after many household items were imported through the consular office. Five days later, two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru by the NIA. Later senior IAS officer M Sivasankar, Kerala CM’s principal secretary, was arrested after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced.Now a multi-agency team involving five central agencies is probing the case and has arrested 34 people. The Enforcement Directorate had grilled another secretary of the Chief Minister, CM Raveendran, and state minister KT Jaleel a couple of times in connection with the case. Meanwhile, Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan’s additional private secretary K Ayyappan, who was summoned by the Customs in connection with the case, failed to appear before the agency. He later informed the Commissionerate of Customs that he would appear after getting a proper notice. There is a strong speculation that the Speaker will also be summoned. There are many allegations saying he travelled with some of the accused during foreign trips.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-nia-files-chargesheet-against-20-accused/story-3NlZASK2ogrGp7y9RJGtpJ.html
05-01-2021||India||Flights to UK will begin from January 6 amid concerns over new mutant strain||Two Air India flights — one from Delhi and one from Mumbai — will fly for London on January 6, as the Indian government is reopening India-UK flights which were closed in the last week of December amid concerns over the new mutant strain first spotted in the United Kingdom. Flights from the UK will be allowed to come to India from January 8, the civil aviation ministry has clarified. According to UK government’s Covid-19 restrictions, people arriving in the UK need to complete a passenger locator form which requires passport details, travel details (times and dates), the address where you will stay in the UK (if applicable), a booking reference number and the name of the test provider, if you are using ‘Test to Release’ to find out if you can end self-isolation early. Test to Release is a travel scheme for international travellers who need to self-isolate. They can take a Covid-19 test with a private test provider to see if they can their self-isolation early.In the wake of the new mutant strain of Coronavirus, which is believed to be more contagious, India put an embargo on flight operations between the two countries on December 21, which became effective from December 23. Initially, the ban was till December 31, but was later extended to January 7. The ministry has clarified that while flights from the UK will be able to enter India from January 8, flights from India will start from January 6.As of now, only 30 flights will be operational between the countries instead of 70, the number with which India and the UK resumed flight services after lockdown.For passengers travelling to India from the UK, the health ministry has issued a detailed guideline where they will have to upload their RT-PCR test report on a portal. Department of Biotechnology secretary Renu Swarup on Tuesday said the number of people tested positive for the new mutant strain of Coronavirus has reached 71.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-to-uk-begin-from-january-6-amid-concerns-over-new-mutant-strain/story-Ca9fAbj4InxeakSTJgIP3M.html
05-01-2021||India||Budget session of Parliament expected to begin on January 29||The Budget session of Parliament is likely to begin on January 29 and is expected to be held in two phases; the first phase till February 15 and the second phase for a month beginning March 8, people aware of the details said. The tentative dates were decided after a meeting of the cabinet committee for parliamentary affairs on Tuesday, but a final decision will be taken after consultation with opposition parties by the end of the week, said a person aware of the details. The Budget session that comes amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation over the farm bills that were passed by Parliament in September and the controversy over the clearance given to indigenous Covid-19 vaccines, will be held keeping in view the protocols laid for the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure the safety of parliamentarians, the secretariat staff and mediapersons. On account of the pandemic, the Winter Session of Parliament could not be held. “Since the Budget has to be passed on February 1; the session has to be scheduled accordingly. All precautions will be taken to ensure the safety of the attending members,” said a BJP functionary not wishing to be quoted. The government is gearing up to face an aggressive opposition that has been critical of the farm bills that were passed amid a din during the Monsoon Session held in September. While the Opposition blames the government for not sending the bills to a select committee for further scrutiny, the government for its part said the opposition created a ruckus in the house and chose to disrupt the proceedings instead of seeking a division of votes when the bills were taken up for passage in the Rajya Sabha. The government has denied the accusation of the opposition and a faction of the protesting farmers that the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 will benefit corporates and end the minimum support price guaranteed by the government. The opposition is also expected to corner the government on the state of the economy, and its response to the coronavirus pandemic. “There is a whole gamut of issues that the government has to answer including the ongoing farmers agitation if that is not resolved by then (by the time Parliament convenes). Another important issue is the vaccine distribution; we need to know how the government plans to distribute the vaccine because the pandemic has been the biggest challenge. Besides there are other governance issues that the party will raise,” said Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP, Vivek Tankha. During the last session, owing to the pandemic, the Question Hour was dispensed with, which was criticised by the opposition. The opposition parties had alleged that the government was shying away from answering questions. “We hope the session is held in the usual way as is customary. There should be a Question Hour. The government seems to be gradually avoiding answering questions, whether it is inside Parliament or outside, even replies to questions filed under the Right to Information Act are either evasive or rejected on flimsy grounds,” said RS MP, Sukhendu Shekhar Ray of the Trinamool Congress. Pinaki Misra, Lok Sabha MP from Puri in Odisha and a BJD leader also said that the opposition will raise a range of issues during the session. “We are looking forward to the session because there are a lot of pressing issues to discuss,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-of-parliament-expected-to-begin-on-january-29/story-PbGlCElOG4NyuUhJKrj7qL.html
05-01-2021||India||SC says it is govt’s ‘bounden obligation’ to keep citizens well-informed about its actions||It is the “bounden obligation” of the government in a democratic set up to keep citizens well informed about its actions as disclosure of full information acts as an “enabler for meaningful participation”, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday.Granting open access to information also secures the goal of transparency to which “all public institutions are wedded”, the apex court said.It further said that unless complete and relevant information about government decision is placed in the public domain, the citizens would be ill-equipped to engage with the government in a meaningful manner.Dealing with the issue of participatory democracy in India, it said that the Right to Information Act, 2005 has empowered citizens to obtain information from the government but it would be “absolutely untenable” to say that there is no duty on the government to be open.The top court said this in its 2:1 majority verdict by which it paved way for the ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi.“In a democratic setup where the citizen has entrusted abundant governance to the government, it is bounden obligation of the government to keep the citizens well informed about its actions, as a prudent trustee would,” Justice A M Khanwilkar, writing the 432-page majority verdict for himself and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari, said.“In a democracy, disclosure of full information is empowerment and acts as an enabler for meaningful participation. Granting open access to information also secures the goal of transparency to which all public institutions are wedded,” the majority verdict said.It said that right from the days of struggle for freedom to the debates of Constituent Assembly and afterwards in independent India, “we have invariably embraced the representative model of democracy wherein political sovereignty vested in the people of India and legal sovereignty vested in the Constitution of India”.The majority verdict said that over a period of time, there has been a constant endeavour to encourage wider public participation, wherever possible and required, keeping in view the efficiency of administration and rule of law.“A holistic understanding of the dispensation envisaged under our Constitution would reveal that we are a representative democracy with strong elements of participatory democracy embedded in it. The element of participation, however, is regulated not only by statutes but also by the Constitution,” it said.It said the principle of participatory democracy has two integral elements -- public participation in decision making and placing information regarding government actions in public domain.“The citizens are completely free to advocate any notion along the government policy or the manner of making it in their free exercise of right to speech and expression, but enforcement of such notion cannot be fructified by resorting to judicial review,” it said.“The idea of public involvement in administrative matters is based upon the stage and extent of representation prescribed by the legislature. No country with a sizeable population like ours can give a promise of direct participation to every individual in the decision-making process (of the government) in administrative matters unless the law so prescribes,” it said.The top court said it must be borne in mind that such public participation is not to supplant the discretion of the government or to retard the development work. “We are in an information age and political justice would be incomplete without informational justice which essentially requires the decision makers to consider the subjects of their decisions as rightful recipients of all information that may have an impact on their lives,” it said.The verdict was delivered on a batch of petitions, which have questioned several aspects including the environmental clearance (EC) granted regarding the Central Vista project. The top court held that grant of EC and the notification for change in land use for construction of new parliament building under the project was valid.The Central Vista revamp, announced in September, 2019 envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project.Justice Sanjiv Khanna, the third judge on the bench, wrote a dissenting judgement on aspects relating to public participation in the decision-making process and on alleged failure on the part of the authorities in taking prior approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) for the project.He, however, concurred with the majority verdict on the aspects of “notice inviting bid, award of consultancy and the order of the Urban Arts Commission, as a standalone and independent order”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-says-it-is-govt-s-bounden-obligation-to-keep-citizens-well-informed-about-its-actions/story-oWLuKDVUNflFkOO3jnNqRN.html

05-01-2021||India||Apex court says judicial activism permissible to an extent in national interest||Judicial activism in “national interest” is certainly permissible to an extent, the Supreme Court said on Tuesday, rejecting submissions that it should not have transferred to itself the pleas challenging the Central Vista project from various forums as it led to denial of statutory right to approach other courts or panels. The observations were made by the top court in its majority judgement giving green signal to the Centre’s ambitious Central Vista Project, covering a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi.A three-judge bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, by 2:1 majority, dealt with the submissions that the top court should not have transferred to itself the pleas from the Delhi High Court and other judicial forum as it denied some of the litigants their statutory rights. “In any case, once a cause reaches this court and of this nature, the fundamental concern of the court is and must be not only of doing substantial and complete justice, but also expeditious resolution of all aspects in larger public interest. This we must do within the constitutional bounds. Judicial activism to this limited extent is certainly permissible, in national interest,” Justice Khanwilkar said in the 432-page majority judgement. While transferring the cases, the underlying principle at play is the duty of the top court to do complete justice as envisaged under Article 142 (extra-ordinary power of the apex court to impart justice) of the Constitution, he said. “We have had plethora of cases in the post-PIL period wherein prolonged litigation against infrastructural projects resulted in inordinate delays to the extent that the projects got buried forever or became unviable owing to excessive burden on the public exchequer (honest taxpayers’ money). That is where this Court’s power to do not only complete but substantial justice gets triggered,” it said.There is no doubt that the broad approach of a constitutional Court in dealing with a public interest matter has to be a vigilant one to further larger public interest, it said.“The laws delay due to tardy flow of Court processes (for variety of reasons attributable to different stakeholders or duty holders or so to say systematic one) must not let itself become an impediment in the fulfilment of development goals of our hallowed nation and consequently to the future generation,” it held.Depending on the subject matter, the Constitutional Courts must address the legal challenges at the earliest opportunity without being bogged down by technicalities, in national interest, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-says-judicial-activism-permissible-to-an-extent-in-national-interest/story-uRbMCIHpg68sbtcSAqnYFK.html

The US recently imposed secondary sanctions on Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for a $2.5-billion deal with Russia for S-400 systems, and experts have warned that India could face similar strictures. Also Read: China flies choppers over Lhasa in military drill to tame TibetParticipating in a question and answer session after delivering a farewell address at an event organised by the Observer Research Foundation, Juster said sanctions under CAATSA weren’t aimed against friends of the US. However, he cautioned that India might soon need to make choices between “trade-offs” and acquiring hi-tech US military hardware. “The CAATSA sanctions were never designed to harm friends and allies. They were aimed at a particular country. And there are many variables involved in it and I think...I would put that issue to the side because I see other issues that potentially affect the future of the defence relationship,” he said. India has sought to keep its options open on the issue of arms purchases and the country’s leadership has signalled its intent to continue with the acquisition of military hardware from Russia, which accounts for more than 60% of the weapons systems of the three services. Russia too has said the S-400 deal is on track despite the threat of US sanctions and the five systems ordered by India will be delivered over a five-year period. Also Read: Ladakh was the starting point. India-China ties are getting complicatedHowever, Juster said India’s approach had its limitations and “choices that might ultimately need to be made”. “As systems get more technologically advanced, country A that does not get along with country B will be less willing to sell technology that could potentially be compromised to country B,” he said, in an oblique reference to concerns that the S-400 could gather the electronic signatures of US-origin aircraft operated by India. “We haven’t hit that point yet but that could come down in the future and that will be an issue that – there are trade-offs. India has to decide how much it matters to get the most sophisticated technology, how much it matters to be as inter-operable as it can be, within its technology and potentially with other friendly forces, and how much it matters to diversify its sources of procurement,” he added. Only the Indian government can decide on the trade-offs but this issue could be a constraint to the transfer of advanced technology and the broader defence relationship, he said. The Indian government’s choices will set the “ceiling” for defence cooperation. “From the US perspective, we’d like to do more, and in a sense, I think you’re pushing on an open door,” Juster said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-have-to-make-choices-on-arms-deals-says-outgoing-us-envoy-kenneth-juster/story-F0zSPPG02XYZsNk09ltogI.html

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr VB Singh has sought a written explanation on the issue from the cold chain handler looking after the arrangement of vaccine transportation to the hospital from the storage centre.“The dry run was completed at district women hospital, Kabir Chaura successfully. A vaccine porter transported the vaccine carrier (boxes) on a bicycle to the District Women Hospital from Urban CHC, Chauka Ghat. As the matter came to light, the porter was asked to go back to the Urban CHC, Chauka Ghat. In this regard, an explanation has been sought from the cold chain handler working at Chauka Ghat based Town hall Vaccine Distribution Center as to why he sent the porter while the vaccine carriers were already kept for the Corona Vaccination to be done in the coming days,” he said.During the actual transportation of vaccines, the cold chain will have to be maintained and all vaccines would be transported in an AC van from storage centres to hospitals, officials said. Dr Singh said the dry run was completed successfully.“Dry run (mock drill) of Covid-19 vaccination at pre-determined six sites, including District Women’s Hospital, Kabir Chaura, Urban Community Health Center, Shivpur, Community Health Centre (CHC) Haathi, CHC Misirpur , PHC Pindra and Heritage Hospital in the district was completed successfully. Dry run means the rehearsal of vaccination was done without applying Covid-19 vaccine,” he said in a statement.District magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma said that there was no real vaccine in the dry run. Dry run was done using empty boxes, he said. “The vaccine storage point is already established at the Women Hospital. During the dry run, vaccine was not to be sent to the Women Hospital from Chauka Ghat. Therefore, a vehicle was not planned for the same,” Sharma said. The DM also said that a show cause notice has been issued to the cold chain handler at Chauka Ghat for sending the vaccine boxes by bicycle.He said a real vaccination round will be organised on the basis of feedback received in the dry run. Health department officials conceded that although it was merely a dry run, the transportation of the vaccine boxes in a bicycle was considered a lapse.“That’s because the dry run was held to ensure that such a lapse doesn’t occur during actual transportation,” an official said. “Twenty-five people in each of the 6 centres were present during the vaccine’s dry run,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dry-run-blooper-in-varanasi-leads-to-vaccine-boxes-transported-on-bicycle/story-243XkYqur8EbFVRe7xmGML.html

He asserted that the government has always been sensitive to environmental concerns.The apex court on Tuesday gave its nod to the Central Vista project by a 2:1 majority. The three-judge bench, however, insisted that the clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work.“We welcome the Judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court giving the go ahead for the ambitious Central Vista Project. Central Govt has always been sensitive to environmental concerns & will continue to adhere to the highest standards during the period of construction,” Puri tweeted.“Delhi is on course to becoming a World Class capital city and in the first step by the time nation completes 75 years of its Independence in 2022 a new Parliament building will be ready reflecting the aspirations of new India,” his tweet read.Also read: Karnataka to vaccinate 6.3 lakh healthcare workers in first phaseThe plan, being handled by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves a new Parliament by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022. The entire project is slated to be finished by 2024.According to the project implementing agency the Central Public Works Department, the construction of the new Parliament is required to be completed strictly within the prescribed time limit of 21 months with the “highest standards of quality and workmanship”.Last month, the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) conditionally approved new terms of reference for the development or redevelopment of common central secretariat buildings, a central conference centre, the Prime Minister’s Residence, Vice President’s Enclave and a building for the Special Protection Group (SPG) as part of the Central Vista project.Also read: Andhra ex-intelligence chief accuses Jagan govt of witch hunt, fears arrestThe EAC had specified as many as 18 conditions, asking the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to list the environmental, social and economic benefits of the project and the cumulative impact of all developments undertaken in the Central Vista avenue including its effect on baseline environmental quality, according to the minutes of a December 17 meeting.The total built-up area has been reduced from 18,37,057 sq.m to 17,21, 500 sq.m, but the cost of the redevelopment project has increased by Rs 1,656 crore, from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.The minutes suggest that around 4,58,820.0 sq m of built-up area will need to be demolished as part of the project.According to the tender for the next phase of the Central Vista redevelopment project — the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue, which includes most of the Rajpath stretch and the row of government offices that run parallel to it - the contractors will have to install air purifiers and keep construction noise under preset thresholds, HT had reported on November 9.The second phase of the project will include the demolition of dozens of office buildings. Broadly, the plan includes razing buildings such as Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan that house important government ministries to build a common secretariat for roughly 70,000 central government employees who are spread over 30 buildings now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/welcome-sc-verdict-on-central-vista-govt-sensitive-to-environmental-concerns-puri/story-SI2Ka02L0AUBeHfgXw6UMK.html
05-01-2021||India||Nearly 25,000 birds die of 2 strains of bird flu, states on alert||Close to 25,000 birds have died due to different variants of bird flu in states like Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh even as the Centre has issued alert to the states to monitor the health of birds in forest areas and near water bodies, officials from multiple states said.Forest department officials said the source of bird flu was migratory birds which probably came from Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and have spread to native species. In Kerala, about 20,000 ducks have died in past one week whereas in Himachal close to 3,400 migratory birds died in the past fortnight. In Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, there have been reports of crow deaths in several districts.In Rajasthan’s Kota and Baran districts and in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore and Malwa regions, the crow deaths was because of Avian Influenza subtype H5N8, which according to experts is less infectious. Till Tuesday, 625 crow deaths were reported from 16 of 33 districts in Rajasthan. “The virus has not affected chickens or eggs but all precautions are taken, looking at the way it spreads among crows. But the positive news is there that samples from Jodhpur have tested negative. Those from Jhalawar, Kota and Baran have tested positive,” said Rajasthan animal husbandry minister Lal Chand Kataria. The minister said the area where the flu is found will be sanitised as done during Covid-19.Also read: After schools reopen in Karnataka, more than 25 teachers test positive for Covid-19As a precautionary measure, prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) have been invoked within a kilometre of the infected area in Jhalawar and Pali districts. The government is also considering sealing Madhya Pradesh border for poultry transportation,” he said. Rajasthan animal husbandry department secretary Arushi Malik said avian influenza subtype H5N8 is not dangerous for people but precautions need to be taken as the disease can spread among birds. Microbiologist, Dr AK Kataria said the virus strain H5N8 is not fatal for humans, and only H5N1 is known, which leads to pneumonia. The strains, which are considered to be highly pathogenic, are N1, N2, N5, N6 and N9. “The situation can be dealt opting required precautions such as burying dead birds three feet down and away from water sources,” he said.Like Rajasthan, in Madhya Pradesh, the bird flu virus H5N8 has spread to 10 districts and about 500 crows have died since December 23. “There is no sign of other birds including poultry having been infected by any virus,” said director of animal husbandry department Dr RK Rokde.He added that bird flu found in poultry is H1N5. “We collected samples from poultry farms in the affected districts and we didn’t find any traces of bird flu. It is relief for us that the infection is limited to crows only,” said principal secretary, animal Husbandry JN Kansotia.The districts where crows were found dead include Indore, Mandsaur, Agar-Malwa, Khargone, Neemuch, Dewas, Ujjain, Shajapur, all in Malwa region; Sehore in central region and Guna in Gwalior-Chambal region of the state, according to officials. MP Integrated disease surveillance programme additional director Dr Shailesh Sakalle said a household survey is being done in the affected areas. Also read: Why Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin got nod, explains ministryIn Himachal Pradesh, the H5N1 strain has caused death of 3,400 migratory birds at Pong Dam in a week. The officials said that there have been no reports of the virus infecting humans in the vicinity of Pong Dam. Kangra district administration on Tuesday imposed strict restrictions in four sub-divisions adjoining the wetland. Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said that in the interest of protecting the health and safety of the public at large, sale, purchase and export of poultry, birds, and fish is prohibited in Fatehpur, Dehra, Jawali and Indora subdivisions. “The slaughter of poultry, birds and fish across all slaughterhouses or at home is barred in these four subdivisions,” Prajapati said. The practice of offering feed to birds and fish is also prohibited. “No movement of humans shall be allowed within a kilometre of Pong Dam or the alert zone except those related to managing the outbreak,” he said. He added that all agriculture or horticulture-related activities are prohibited and staff of the two departments would be deployed to check such activities. In Kerala, where 20,000 ducks died in Alapuzha and Kottayam districts in the past week, culling of ducks has started. Animal husbandry department additional secretary Dr Hari Kumar said 38,000 birds will be culled in Alapuzha and 8,000 in Kottayam. Poultry farmers will not be allowed to trade birds till further notice. He said culling and burying of birds will take at least three days.“I have turned pauper. I have lost around 20,000 birds in last one week. I bought 10,000 ducklings only two weeks back. I took banks loans and money from some lenders to fund my duck farming. Compensation from the government is minimal,” said K Kuttappayi, a farmer in Alapuzha. Surrounded by many water bodies in Alapuzha and surrounding area, duck farming is very popular and duck eggs sell for almost double the price of a chicken egg. Duck meat is also a delicacy in many areas of the state.States such as Uttarakhand, Bihar, Haryana, Jharkhand Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra have issued advisories and have asked forest department officials to monitor the health of birds in and around water bodies. JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said, “Following the guidelines from the Central government, we have issued an alert and advisory for all divisional forest officers to keep an eye on any unusual avian activity. No cases of bird flu or deaths have been reported from the state so far, but as many migratory birds fly to the state, officials are on alert.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-25-000-birds-die-of-2-strains-of-bird-flu-states-on-alert/story-g7iJsWIyjvldyU8rQLrwrO.html

The four youths have been booked for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion.“Since it’s a security breach, we have sought a report from the CISF in the next two to three days to understand what happened,” Vasant Swarnkar, Superintending Archaeologist, ASI (Agra Circle), told PTI. Police said the four youths who have been arrested are members of a right-wing outfit and they had entered the Taj Mahal Monday afternoon through the Eastern Gate. They waved saffron flags and also uploaded a 10-second video of the act on YouTube.As part of the security protocol, all visitors to the ASI monument are checked using metal-detectors, they cannot carry posters or any writing material. However, the use of selfie-sticks is not banned.Physical checking has been stopped at the gates of Taj Mahal after it reopened for visitors following the coronavirus-induced lockdown.“Tourists carry all kinds of clothes inside the premises. It is difficult to prevent them from carrying pieces of clothing like handkerchiefs or dupattas and they can be of different colours and may have any religious connotation. “However, we are updating our surveillance around the site, increasing and intensifying intelligence gathering and even patrolling. There are some steps internally that we are contemplating to ensure that such incidents do not happen again,” CISF commandant Rahul Yadav told PTI. “We have to be sensitive towards tourists as well and keep their convenience in mind. We have to be tourist-friendly,” he said. On the complaint of the CISF, the four youths have been booked under Section 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.The video which has gone viral on social media shows three of the youths waving the flags while the fourth is recording the act and even giving instructions to them to pose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cisf-to-review-taj-mahal-security-after-four-youths-held-for-waving-saffron-flags-on-premises/story-1sbcqLPinUysh2W5iFasVK.html
05-01-2021||India||After schools reopen in Karnataka, more than 25 teachers test positive for Covid-19||Just five days after schools and colleges reopened in Karnataka, a number of teachers have tested positive for Covid-19 creating a sense of fear among parents and students. In Belagavi district alone, 18 teachers have tested positive for Covid-19. The government had mandated that all teaching and non-teaching staff must undergo a Covid-19 test before educational institutions reopen.The results of thousands of such tests done have started coming in with several teachers themselves testing Covid-19 positive. The DC of Belagavi, MG Hiremath speaking to the media on Tuesday admitted that four teachers from Chikkodi and 18 from Belagavi have tested positive for the virus. “We restarted educational institutions under the Vidyagama scheme of the government by taking all precautions. For instance, in Kadoli, four teachers in a school have tested positive. We have sealed the school and it will be reopened a week later after it is full sanitised,” he added.In a similar case in Koppal, two teachers have tested positive and now 23 students are all set to undergo tests for Covid-19. While the education department is saying that they do not have a consolidate number of teaching and non-teaching staff who have tested positive for the virus, medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar said, “There are nearly 10 lakh students in the 10th standard alone. It is but natural that a few may have tested positive amongst the staff in spite of precautions. We are testing them, isolating them and getting them treated. Since it involves the future of lakhs of students, I appeal that we should not spread panic as normalcy is being slowly restored.” However, several parents have expressed apprehension over the re-opening of schools and colleges. “Nobody would deny that education is important but not at the cost of our children’s lives. I don’t know why the government is adamant on running schools. With the vaccine around the corner, why can’t we just postpone reopening by another few weeks or months?” Vijay Prasad the parent of a college student told HT.However, the minister Dr Sudhakar asserted that there was no need for any panic and the numbers of those who had tested positive were small. “I am getting the exact data of how many have been infected (due to the virus), meanwhile I appeal to the media that let us not unnecessarily spread panic among the students and parents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-schools-reopen-in-karnataka-more-than-25-teachers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-XDQ7rW9CiZp1z2XtucPi9N.html
05-01-2021||India||Former president Pranab Mukherjee lamented Congress’ loss of leadership in final book||The Congress’s failure to recognise the end of its charismatic leadership was among the many reasons for its 2014 Lok Sabha polls defeat, according to former president Pranab Mukherjee who felt lack of extraordinary leaders reduced the establishment to a “government of averages”.Mukherjee made these comments in his memoir “The Presidential Years, 2012-2017” which he wrote before his death last year. The book released on Tuesday.He also wrote that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not discussed the issue of demonetisation with him prior to his announcement on November 8, 2016 but it did not surprise him as suddenness is absolutely necessary for such announcements. In the book, Mukherjee mentioned that on the day of the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he directed his aide-de-camp to keep him informed of the trends every half an hour. When the results were announced in the evening, he was “greatly relieved over the decisive mandate but also disappointed at my one-time party’s performance”. “It was difficult to believe that the Congress had managed to win just 44 seats. The Congress is a national institution interlinked with people’s lives. Its future is always a concern of every thinking individual,” he wrote in the book, published by Rupa Publications.The former Congress leader and Union minister attributed this defeat to many reasons. “I feel the party failed to recognise the end of its charismatic leadership. Tall leaders like Pandit Nehru ensured that India, unlike Pakistan, survived and developed into a strong and stable nation. Sadly, such extraordinary leaders are not there anymore, reducing the establishment to a government of averages,” he wrote.According to Mukherjee, when he looked back on his years as president, he derived satisfaction not only from the fact that he followed the rule book in letter and spirit in dealing with governments and issues of the day, but also because he never veered from the constitutional parameters that have been laid down for an Indian head of state. He wrote he had very cordial relations with Prime Minister Modi during his tenure. “However, I did not hesitate to give my advice on matters of policy during our meetings. There were several occasions when he echoed concerns that I had voiced. I also believe that he has managed to grasp the nuances of foreign policy quickly,” the book said.Mukherjee’s approach to maintaining cordial relations with Modi was rooted in the fact that “I believe in the parliamentary form of government and its principle”. “Modi had received a decisive mandate from the people to administer the country. Administrative powers are vested in the Council of Ministers, which the PM heads. Therefore, I did not breach my jurisdiction. Whenever tricky occasions arose, the issues were resolved,” he wrote. “At an event in which PM Modi released a book and I was present, I remarked that it was not that I did not have any differences with him, but that both of us knew how to manage those differences, without bringing them out in public,” he added.However, Mukherjee lamented that the NDA government, during its first term of 2014-19, failed in its primary responsibility to ensure the smooth and proper functioning of Parliament. “I attribute the acrimonious exchanges between the Treasury and Opposition benches to the arrogance and inept handling by the government. But the Opposition is not without blame either. It had also behaved irresponsibly,” he wrote.According to Mukherjee, the mere physical presence of the prime minister in Parliament makes a tremendous difference to the functioning of this institution. “Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh, each of these former PMs made their presence felt on the floor of the House. PM Modi, now in his second term, must take inspiration from his predecessors and provide visible leadership, through his enhanced presence in Parliament to avoid situations that had precipitated the parliamentary crisis we witnessed in the first term,” the book said. Modi, Mukherjee said, must listen to the dissenting voices and speak more often in Parliament, adding he must use it as a forum to disseminate his views to convince the Opposition and inform the nation. On foreign relations, Mukherjee felt that Modi’s stopover in Lahore was “unnecessary and uncalled for, given the conditions that prevailed” in India-Pakistan relations.“It was evident that one could expect the unexpected from Modi, because he had come with no ideological foreign policy baggage. He was to continue with these surprises: he made a sudden and unscheduled stop at Lahore in December 2015 to greet his then Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, on the latter’s birthday; and he initiated an annual informal summit with the Chinese president - one was held at Wuhan in China in 2018 and the other, more recently, at Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu in 2019.” On Modi not discussing about demonetisation with him before announcing it, Mukherjee wrote: “I am of the firm opinion that demonetisation could not have been done with prior consultation because the suddenness and surprise, absolutely necessary for such announcements, would have been lost after such a process.”  “Therefore, I was not surprised when he did not discuss the issue with me prior to making the public announcement. It also fitted in with his style of making dramatic announcements,” he said.However, after delivering his address to the nation, Modi visited Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan and explained to him the rationale behind the decision. “He desired an explicit support from me as a former finance minister of the country. I pointed out to him that while it was a bold step, it may lead to temporary slowdown of the economy. We would have to be extra careful to alleviate the suffering of the poor in the medium to long term,” Mukherjee said.“Since the announcement was made in a sudden and dramatic manner, I asked the PM if he had ensured that adequate currency was there for exchange,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-president-pranab-mukherjee-lamented-congress-loss-of-leadership-in-final-book/story-w2F4eMDUYeXDigbPXSJbBK.html

As health secretary, Niti Aayog officials, ICMR director-general Balram Bhargava were present at the press meet, it was asked to them which vaccine they would take between Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Oxford-Serum Institute’s Covishield. Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul answered the question and, holding health secretary Rajesh Bhushan’s hand, said, “I will take the vaccine which my ministry of health will specify for me with great affection, love and gratitude.”Also Watch | Covid: What led to DCGI nod of Covishield & Covaxin in India?

No country is giving regular authorisation to any vaccine,” Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said.ChatBot, SMS in 12 languages: Health ministry releases new Co-win detailsDispelling doubts over Covaxin, ICMR DG Balram Bhargava said safety, immunogenicity and efficacy reports are required for approval in a non-emergency situation. “Efficacy data is not required for emergency use approval. Immunogenicity data serves as a surrogate for efficacy data in such situation,” Bhargava said.According to rules, phase two results of clinical data guide experts for approval, which Covaxin has. He also said there have been no safety concerns regarding Covaxin’s trial conducted so far.Covaxin has also been asked for restricted use in clinical trial mode. Explaining this, Dr Bhargava said, “There has to be consent from the trial participant and there will be follow up.” On Vaccinating children and reopening schools which many states have partially done, Dr Bhargava said, “Adults need to be vaccinated first. So teachers need to be inoculated. And as far as including children in vaccination trial is concerned, the Bharat Biotech trial included those in the age group of 12 to 18 years as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-take-that-vaccine-what-niti-aayog-member-says-about-his-preference-between-covishield-and-covaxin/story-wTGrgbwDawN589tA9qxKIM.html

According to a notification on January 1 issued by AN Deka, secretary, Assam legislative assembly, Saikia, who represents the Nazira constituency, would lose the salary and other perks associated with the position. With two MLAs - Ajanta Neog and Rajdeep Goala - quitting the party, Congress’s strength in the 126-member assembly had been reduced to 20 members. “The present strength of the Indian National Congress legislature party in Assam legislative assembly is not equal to the quorum fixed to constitute a sitting of the House, that is one-sixth of the total number of members of the House,” said the notification. “Therefore, the honourable Speaker, Assam legislative assembly has been pleased to withdraw the recognition of Debabrata Saikia, MLA, as Leader of the Opposition, Assam legislative assembly with effect from January 1, 2021,” it added. The Congress had won 26 seats in the 2016 assembly polls. The same year, its MLA from Baithalangso Mansing Rongpi resigned and later won as a BJP candidate from the same seat. The party’s MLA from Jania, Abdul Khaleque won from the Barpeta Lok Sabha seat in 2019. The seat was later bagged by All India United Democratic Front in the bye-election. The Congress’s strength came down further last year with the deaths of two MLAs, Pranab Gogoi of Sivasagar and former chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who represented Titabar seat. Last month Neog and Goala, who represented the Golaghat and Lakhipur seats respectively, quit the party and joined BJP, bringing Congress strength down to 20 members - one less than the 21 members needed to have one-sixth of the total members of the assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-mla-loses-status-of-leader-of-opposition-in-assam-assembly/story-ojs1wqFImHjDwgDS4gU3mJ.html

The federal contingency force said it has deployed seven teams in the affected areas of Kohima district in Nagaland and Senapati district of Manipur to assist firefighters in extinguishing the forest fire. The fire broke out in the picturesque Dzukou valley, a popular tourist destination, on December 29. “Originally it was confined to Nagaland state but now it has spread towards the hills of Manipur and is continuously increasing its magnitude,” a National Disaster Response Force spokesperson said in a statement issued here. He added that out of the total seven NDRF teams, three are approaching the affected area from the western side near Essi hills in Kohima district, while the rest are approaching from the eastern side at Mao in Senapati. “NDRF teams are employing all possible techniques to check further spread of fire,” the spokesperson said.

05-01-2021||India||Farmers postpone tractor march by a day to January 7||Instead of January 6, when the protesting farmers initially decided to conduct their tractor march, farmers on Tuesday announced that the tractor march would take place on January 7. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav said farmers protesting the new farm laws will take out a tractor march on January 7 at four borders of Delhi, in what would be a glimpse of what has been planned for Republic Day if the new laws are not rolled back. “We have decided that on January 7, we will take out a tractor march at four borders of Delhi including Eastern and Western peripheral. This will be a trailer for what lies ahead on January 26,” said Yadav. On Monday, the seventh round of talks between farmer leaders and the government failed to resolve the deadlock as the Centre continued to rule out the possibility of repealing the three new farm laws, adding that it can look into any clause the farmers had issues with. Both sides had agreed to continue with talks on January 8.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said on Monday that until the three contentious farm laws were withdrawn, the protesters will not be going home.“Discussion took place on our demands -- repeal of the three laws and MSP... Kanoon wapasi nahi, to ghar wapsi nahi (We will not go home until the laws are withdrawn),” he said as quoted by news agency ANI.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, had said on Saturday that thousands of farmers will drive into the Capital in their tractors to hold their own Republic Day parade if their demands are not met by January 26. Farmers have time and again promised to intensify their protests if their demands are not met. “The government is saying 50% of the demands have been met. For us, 85% of the demands are left.The agitation will become more intense now,” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the agitation. Yadav too echoed similar sentiments of intensifying protests as the next round of talks neared. “From tomorrow, for 2 weeks, ‘Desh Jagran Abhiyan’ will be started and protests will be deepened throughout the country,” Yadav was quoted as saying by ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-postpone-tractor-march-by-a-day-to-january-7/story-pwuVNeI7qzAtQnxZJwf1WN.html

These have adverse physical effects on the growing children which can cause damage to their vertebral column and knees.“Moreover, in the schools which are functioning in double or multi storey buildings, children have to climb the stairs with heavy school bags which further aggravates the problem,” the Directorate of Education (DoE) said in a letter to school principals.The Ministry of Education had notified the new school bag policy last month which is in line with the new National Education Policy (NEP). From no textbooks for pre-primary classes to single notebook for classes 1 and 2, frequent checks of school bags to ensure students do not carry heavy weight, informing the students and parents regarding appropriate kind of school bags and encouraging students to use both straps of bags, are among the recommendations made by the government.“The load of school bag is increased by bringing textbooks, guides, homework or classwork notebooks, rough work notebooks, water bottles, lunch box, and sometimes the heavy weight of the school bag itself. The number of textbooks in different classes should not exceed the number prescribed by the statutory bodies.“Heads of schools and teachers should frame a well-designed timetable for each class so that children do not have to carry too many books or notebooks to the school each day,” it said.“For other classes, there shall be one notebook for each subject for exercises, projects, unit tests, experiments, among others, which the students need to bring as per the timetable. Students should not be asked to bring additional books or extra materials to the school,” the letter stated.As per the suggestions, which are in line with the new National Education Policy (NEP), the weight of school bags for students between classes 1-10 should not be more than 10 per cent of their body weight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-asks-schools-to-implement-new-school-bag-policy/story-CTr2GwPqS2j6XnRrU4GO0J.html

Also Read: Andhra administration likely to operate from Visakhapatnam from April 13, hints ministerIn a letter to the secretary of IPS Officers’ Association, AP chapter, Rao said he had reliable information that the state government had decided to fabricate a criminal case against him and arrest him without giving him an opportunity to even to get anticipatory bail. “The government wants to suspend me again on the basis of being in judicial remand for 48 hours or more,” he said in the letter. Rao, who served as state intelligence chief during the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) regime, was suspended on February 8 last year for his alleged irregularities in procurement of security equipment from an Israeli company during his tenure. The Jagan government, which entrusted the case to Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleged that Rao had wilfully disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of police to the foreign defence manufacturing firm. Rao challenged his suspension in the Central Administrative Tribunal on February 13, but the CAT dismissed his petition in March. Later, he moved the high court, which revoked his suspension in July. The AP government challenged this order in the Supreme Court, which lifted stay on his suspension in November, pending inquiry.

Later, I was suspended following a case registered by the CID,” he said. Rao asked the IPS Officers’ Association to convene a meeting of general body of the association and intervene in the matter in a way deemed fit. “I am not seeking any favours from the association but seeking attention as it is only a case of harassment by the government,” he said. He said he would explain his version at the general body meeting of the association and clarify all the doubts of the members. “I will leave it to the wisdom of the general body to come to any conclusion and take a decision whether to intervene and if so, in what manner,” he said, adding that he only wanted a fair and impartial inquiry into the allegations made against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-ex-intelligence-chief-accuses-jagan-govt-of-witch-hunt-fears-arrest/story-6ClqZb2UHQVMEoz9fg6NgL.html

Go for govt facilities’: HC on petition seeking cap on Covid-19 charges in private hospitals||The Bombay High Court at Goa has disposed of a petition challenging the Goa government’s inaction on the high rates charged by the private hospitals for testing and treating Covid-19 patients. The High Court accepted the Goa government’s contention that “if any persons find the rates unaffordable, it is always open to such persons to avail of the government facilities - free of charge.”“Since most of the issues raised in this petition are subject matter of the suo motu writ petition pending before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, it will not be appropriate for this Court to adjudicate upon the very same issues. The submission/statement made by the Advocate General in relation to the rates for Covid tests, to a substantial extent, redresses the grievance on this issue, as well,” the HC stated. In his petition, Dr Aquaviva Fernandes, a medical practitioner said that the rates are “arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory, thereby violating the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India and need to be revisited and modified in favour of the interest of public health and safety at large.”The Goa government had last year, set caps on charges for Covid-19 treatment that were considered ‘astronomical’. According to the notification, a private hospital can charge a room rent no higher than Rs 12,000 per day for a bed in a general ward, Rs 15,000 per day for a twin sharing room, Rs 18,000 per day for a single private room and Rs 25,000 per day for a bed in an ICU with a ventilator.Also read: British PM Boris Johnson calls off India visit, cites need to oversee response to Covid-19Dr Fernandes pointed out that the rates capped in some other states were much lesser than Goa which has by far the highest rates amongst other states in India. He pointed out that rates in other states, such as Tamil Nadu (Rs. 2,500), Uttar Pradesh (at Rs. 1,600), Maharashtra (at Rs. 2,200), Kerala (at R. 2,750) and Delhi (at Rs. 2,400), were much lower than Goa.Dr Fernandes had also argued that “the poor conditions prevailing in government-run hospitals and the over-stretched infrastructure deter the general public from getting admission in government hospitals. “[On account of] the low capacity for admission of Covid-19 patients and exceedingly overcrowded wards at government hospitals, symptomatic Covid-19 positive patients are forced to move from pillar to post seeking admission, ultimately compelled to resort to treatment at private hospitals,” Dr Fernandes said in his petition.At the time the petition was filed in early October last year, Goa was at its peak of the Covid-19 crisis with images surfacing of patients being made to sleep on the floor of the state’s premier medical research facility - the Goa Medical College and Hospital - as well as a shortage of beds at the government-run facilities. Since then, however, the situation has improved with Goa’s active cases now being only around 900, down from the 3,000-odd cases back then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exorbitant-go-for-govt-facilities-hc-on-petition-seeking-cap-on-covid-19-charges-in-private-hospitals/story-2Mju9rImHcmxuzwAHxx8OP.html

Check eligibility, required documents here||The union health ministry already urged citizens eligible for the emergency vaccine to get vaccinated irrespective of their history of contracting Covid-19 in last December, though it made it clear that the vaccination drive will be voluntary. The government has highlighted that citizens need to register themselves for vaccination. The health ministry on Tuesday pointed out that healthcare workers and frontline workers would not need to register for the vaccination. “Healthcare workers and frontline workers would not need to register themselves as a beneficiary as their data is in a bulk database which has been populated on the Co-WIN vaccine delivery management system in a bulk manner,” union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The government believes that upon receiving a complete schedule of the anti-coronavirus vaccine will allow the body to build a strong immune response against the disease. Health ministry has also outlined that after receiving the second dose of the vaccine on a protective level of antibodies generally develops in 14 days while answering several frequently asked questions (FAQs) on its website with connection to the vaccination drive in December.“Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of the vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts,” the health ministry said.The government has already granted approval to two Covid-19 vaccines last week. Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin has been granted restricted emergency approval.The blueprint of the vaccination programme says that over 30 crore healthcare personnel and frontline workers will receive the vaccine as soon as it is rolled out. Following the vaccination of the essential workers, elderly people above the age of 50 will get vaccinated.The ministry said that eligible vaccine recipients will receive an SMS on their registered mobile number sharing the details of the due date, place and time of vaccination.The following documents will be required for registering for vaccination: • Driving licence,• Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) job card,• PAN Card,• Bank Passbook,• Passbook issued by the Post Office• Pension Document• Service identification card issued to employees of central government, state government or public limited companies,• Voter ID CardA QR code certificate will be issued to the vaccine recipient along with an SMS confirming that the recipient has been administered all the vaccine doses.The health ministry has also urged recipients to contact nearest health authorities, Anganwadi workers and ASHA workers if they experience any difficulties. “We request you to rest at the vaccination centre for at least half an hour after taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Inform the nearest health authorities/ANM/ASHA in case you feel any discomfort or uneasiness subsequently,” the ministry said.The government continues to urge citizens to follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour despite preparations for the vaccination drive. The government stresses that people still need to remain vigilant as the nation continues to record daily cases and deaths due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-recommends-citizens-to-get-vaccinated-check-eligibility-required-documents-here/story-mXoWvpJYsTowaYN85SdeUP.html

The procurement of 56 C-295 from Airbus with participation of an Indian production agency for the manufacture of 40 aircraft (out of total 56) in India is at financial approval stage and the contract is likely to be signed in the near future, the defence ministry said in its year-end review. “The case is first of its kind which envisages participation of private companies and would prove to be a boost for our defence industry,” the ministry said. While the C-295s are meant to replace the Avro-748 transport planes, the new aircraft will also be suitable for demanding roles that the AN-32 currently undertakes, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. The Avro-748 entered service in the early 1960s and has been long due for replacement, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “The replacement C-295 project has been in the works for the past eight years and has spawned a new term --- the Avro model --- in the acquisition field due the unique path adopted. Actually, there is an acquisition fatigue that has crept in, a state that needs to be broken by actually inducting the aircraft that is sorely required by the IAF. The C-295 would also be the natural replacement for AN-32s which too would be getting phased out soon,” Bahadur said. The first 16 planes will be supplied in two years, and the deliveries of the 40 locally-assembled ones will be spread over an additional eight years. The aircraft can operate from short, unprepared airstrips and carry out a variety of missions in all-weather conditions. The contract for buying 83 LCA Mk 1A aircraft for the IAF from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is also likely to be signed soon after approval by the Cabinet Committee on Security, the ministry said its review. Last March, the defence ministry gave a green light to the purchase of 83 advanced Tejas jets from HAL. The deal is expected to be worth Rs 38,000 crore. The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant is expected to come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array radar, advanced beyond-visual-range missiles and significantly improved maintainability. India is also likely to sign a deal with Israel for additional Harop (P-IV) loitering weapon systems in the first quarter of 2021, the year-end review said. The Harop is designed to locate and attack high-value targets with precision. The weapon (also known as a suicide drone) tracks the target, dives on to it and detonates the warhead on impact, according to its maker Israel Aerospace Industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-sign-2-5-billion-contract-for-56-transport-planes-for-iaf/story-2wPztr38s2bNoQPhzTj2SJ.html

On Tuesday, Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla too clarified that there was no ban on the exports of vaccine.“The Union government has not banned the export of any of the Covid-19 vaccines. This should be absolutely clear. When I say Union government, I mean ministry of health and family welfare, ministry of commerce, the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, directorate general of foreign trade. These are the departments which can ban the export of vaccines in any hypothetical situation. They have not taken any action regarding this. So, this is my earnest request to media friends that we should be on guard when such misinformation is spread,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Exports of Covishield allowed to all countries, clarifies Adar PoonawallaReferring to the joint statement issued by the companies — Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — which have got restricted, emergency-use approval, the secretary said, “Among other things, the statement said vaccines are a global public health good and that the companies are considering it as their duty to the nation and the world at large. So what does it mean? It means that neither the government and nor the vaccine makers are talking about any ban.”The Associated Press has recently quoted Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla as saying that the government has asked the world’s largest vaccine maker to not export vaccines to any other country. Serum Institute has earlier agreed to supply millions of doses of vaccines to Bangladesh, global vaccine alliance Gavi etc. Hence, the report led to confusions as Prime Minister Narendra Modi too reiterated that India’s ‘Make in India’ pledge has to translate to ‘Make for the world’. On vaccine too, specifically the prime minister had earlier said that India will be ready to supply vaccines to other countries. On Tuesday, both Adar Poonawalla and the health ministry clarified that there was no such ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misinformation-health-ministry-says-no-ban-on-export-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-ojAzo9BFLd1ZecdqQM51yN.html

A team of doctors was pressed into service, but he died at 11.50 pm on Monday,” Government Medical College spokesperson Pooja Tripathi said Tuesday.She said the man, a taxi driver, was administered blood regularly but he could not survive. “He died of shock,” she said.A resident of Hathorha village under Roza police station, the man had allegedly laid himself down on the tracks with the intention of killing himself, police said.Police have sent the body for post-mortem examination. Emergency medical officer Dr Mohammed Meraj had said Monday, Harshvardhan’s body was severed below the hip joint. The driver of a goods train was apparently the first to come across the macabre site of the severed portion of Harshvardhan’s body lying along the tracks. He had informed the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/26-yr-old-s-body-severed-below-waist-after-train-hit-dies-after-14-hr-battle-for-life/story-zhs556IevjZDJyNTOvdYsJ.html

The opposition leader will be undertaking the tour to extend thanks to people of the state for giving the RJD and Grand alliance (GA) big support during the recently concluded polls,” said the party’s senior leader and former MLA Bhola Yadav.He said the yatra would be stretching for several weeks with the 31-year-old scheduled to address meetings during the tour and also interact with the workers in a bid to strengthen the party for future electoral battles.It would be interesting to watch whether Tejashwi will attack the state government or not on various issues including law and order, unemployment and development given that the RJD in recent weeks has tried to soften its approach towards the ruling JD(U) by offering it to switch over to the Grand Alliance amid the speculations of internal rift in the NDA.Similarly, the LJP chief Chirag Paswan is also expected to launch a yatra after January 15. He has maintained a low profile after the party’s drubbing at the assembly election where it won only one seat out of nearly 150 that it contested. Sources said the LJP chief is keen on undertaking the yatra to highlight the party’s vision of state’s development under the slogan ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ that Paswan first used during the election campaign.Paswan junior is scheduled to start his yatra from either Gopalganj or Rohtas in mid-January and visit most of the districts in the state including the Seemanchal belt. “The LJP chief would be talking about the vision for the state’s development and also assess the party’s organisational strength during the tour as part of the party’s plan to expand its base in the state,” said Asraf Ansari, LJP spokesperson and senior leader.Sources said chief minister Nitish Kumar is also likely to undertake a yatra in the first week of February by visiting various districts to review development works and also attend political events. The tour proposal is still tentative and a final decision would be taken soon, people familiar with the development said.The ruling BJP has already conducted ‘dhanyawaad sabhas’ across the state in December as a part of the party’s plan to thank the voters for NDA’s win in the assembly election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-chirag-paswan-to-set-off-on-stock-taking-yatras-in-bihar/story-MhUCioVO8468Zn0NdP7aAP.html

Shukla is a legislator from Howrah district and served as minister of state for sports and youth affairs. Amid rumours that Shukla too might join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) like former TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari, chief minister Mamata Banerjee made the first official comment on the sudden development while addressing a media conference in the afternoon. “Laxmi is a good boy. He wrote a letter saying he wants to pursue sports wholeheartedly and wants to be relieved of all responsibilities in the party. He did not talk of resigning from the ministry. But we have accepted his resignation and written to the governor that he may be relieved as minster. Laxmi has said that he will continue to be a member of the legislative assembly till its current term comes to an end,” said Banerjee. “It is good that he wants to pursue sports. He said he wants to give more time to sports. That’s why he wants to leave politics. There is nothing more to this. He has our best wishes. There is no place for misunderstanding here. You (the media) try to make something out of every information,” said Banerjee. Shukla, who was born and brought up in Howrah district, avoided the media and did not make any comment. Saugata Roy, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson said, “Laxmi is a nice man. I never heard he had any grievance against the party.” Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP, did not say whether Shukla would join his party. “It is difficult for any person with strong principles to stay in the TMC. We are not surprised,” he said. Incidentally, Shukla is the second young minster from Howrah district to make news. Since October, forest minister Rajib Banerjee has been raising his voice against a section of leaders and avoiding government and party meetings. Shukla was a middle-order batsman and a medium pacer for the Indian team. He played for the Bengal cricket team as well as for the Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi in IPL matches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cricketer-bengal-minister-laxmi-ratan-shukla-quits-tmc-says-he-wants-to-pursue-sports/story-pEyQyrp6Yw3kcSxSJIRM7K.html

India wants to raise the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix from the current level of 6.2% to 15% by 2030.He said connectivity is the key to development. “Take any front – highway connectivity, railway connectivity, Metro connectivity, air connectivity, water connectivity, digital connectivity or gas connectivity – India has embarked upon these projects simultaneously that never happened earlier,” he said.Also read | Centre may bring natural gas within the GST ambitThe Prime Minister said he does not want to find reasons why the country could not do these infrastructural developments at a rapid pace earlier. “It is, however, certain that today’s young India, the impatient India that wants to stand out in the world, cannot afford to progress at a slow pace. That is why, in the last few years, the country has increased the speed, and scale and simultaneously enhanced the scope [of these projects,” he said in Hindi.The country could build only 15,000 kms natural gas pipeline in 27 years before 2014. The first inter-state pipeline was commissioned in 1987. Now, work is underway on more than 16,000 kms of new gas pipeline nationwide that will be complete in the next 5-6 years, he said.Similarly, the first compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel stations was set up in India 1992. By 2014, there were not more than 900 CNG stations. In the past six years, about 1,500 new CNG stations have been operationalised. “Now the government is working to raise the number of CNG stations to 10,000. This pipeline, which is commissioned just now, will help to open 700 CNG stations in various cities of Kerala and Karnataka,” he said.“There is another interesting data of PNG [piped natural gas] connections, which brings fuel to kitchens. Up to 2014, our country had only 25 lakh (2.5 million) PNG connections. Today, more than 72 lakh (7.2 million) households get cooking gas through pipelines. Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline will provide PNG facility to 21 lakh (2.1 million) more people,” he said. These increased connections have reduced usage of polluting kerosene and many states and Union Territories have declared themselves kerosene free, he added.Prime Minister Modi said, “The need of the hour is to prepare the country for its future energy needs. That is why, one the one hand focus is on the natural gas, on the other hand, the country is diversifying its energy needs.” He gave example of the proposed world’s biggest hybrid -- wind and solar -- renewable energy plant in Gujarat and stressed on producing ethanol from rice and sugarcane. The goal of ethanol blending in petrol is raised 20% in the next 10 years, he said, adding that the government is committed to provide every citizen affordable, pollution-free fuel and electricity.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan hailed the completion of state-run GAIL India’s Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline and said that the project, one of the major poll promises of his government, was delayed due to various obstacles, according to a PTI report from Kochi.“GAIL authorities also stood by us in making this project come to life. I am extremely happy that our combined efforts have borne fruit,” he said. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said the pipeline would supply PNG to about 400,000 kitchens besides supplying fuel to several commercial establishments.Experts said gas-based economy would not only help in reducing carbon emission but also lead to faster industrialisation. Besides, availability of gas it is also necessary to switch over to gas-based technologies in different sectors, said DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India. “In the automobile sector, major changes would be required to switch over to cars that run on gas or on batteries. For power production, the proportion of gas-based electricity generation should overtake the conventional coal-based technologies,” he said.According to Srivastava, there is a need to bring natural gas under uniform Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime to have a unified natural gas market in the country. At present, levies on natural gas vary from state to state, ranging as high as 24%, a major deterrent to making it a people’s fuel.“Fiscal policies other than taxation may also be used to encourage switching over to production and consumption processes favouring the use of gas particularly by subsidising non-polluting technologies. On the supply side, both domestic production of gas and import of gas on favourable conditions require to be promoted. As gas supply increases, its related infrastructure covering storage and distribution would need to be expanded at an accelerated pace,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-expansion-of-gas-based-economy-a-must-to-achieve-self-reliance-pm-modi/story-symFcI9kmKQcf47IJ0mAxO.html

Despite the pandemic, people are confident about travelling. And since the vaccine is coming, we expect the numbers to increase further,” said director of tourism, Kashmir, Nisar Wani.He said 20-30 tourists would arrive per day in July, 2020, and there have been over 1,000 visitors every day since December 25, 2020.The inflow of tourists, however, was disrupted after surface and air traffic was suspended from Sunday following heavy snowfall.Also Read: Continuous snowfall disrupts Kashmir’s air, road connectivity for 3rd consecutive day“Although we have zero arrival during these three days, we expect the fresh snowfall will give further impetus to tourism. We are hopeful of a good season this year,” Wani said.Mostly, tourists in winter rush to Gulmarg, located in the Pir Panjal mountain range in the western Himalayas, about 50km from Srinagar in north Kashmir. The place is home to one of Asia’s largest and highest cable cars.Assistant manager, Gondola Project, Fayaz Ahmad said that Gulmarg was packed on Christmas and New Year ’s Eve.“Snowfall was on time this year, and Kashmir is almost Covid-19-free. We follow proper protocol right from the airport. So domestic tourists prefer to come here than go abroad,” Ahmad said.All incoming passengers at Srinagar airport have to go through a mandatory Covid-19 test and anybody testing positive is immediately isolated. The daily number of Covid-19 infections in Kashmir Valley has dropped to below 100.Ahmad said that the hotels in Gulmarg are full and they hope the fresh snowfall will push the number up further. Tourism in Kashmir has taken a hit since August 5, 2019, when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked and restrictions imposed on the movement of people and communication for months. Two days before the revocation of Article 370, around 20,000-25,000 tourists in Kashmir were asked to leave the Valley along with the Amarnath pilgrims. The situation was then further aggravated by the Covid-19 lockdown since March 2020.“From August 4, 2019 till December 23,2020, the business has been down and tourism suffered a lot of losses. Now there is hope for some revival as there have been enquiries from outside tour operators,” said Mukhtar Shah, president, Gulmarg Hotels Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-snowfall-in-kashmir-gives-tourism-sector-a-boost/story-uVLVFNtYXQLIfNQrk3Oe8K.html
05-01-2021||India||Bird flu in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh: What we know so far||At least four states are reeling under bird flu scare with Kerala issuing a high alert against bird flu on Tuesday after declaring bird-flu as a state-specific disaster. Bird flu is a disease which can spread to human through generally poultry birds. The virus does not directly infect humans, normally. The Centre has issued alert to the states to monitor the health of birds in forest areas and near water bodies, officials from multiple states said.Here is what we know about the present infection scenario in India.RajasthanThe first case this time was reported om Rajasthan. On December 31, curfew was imposed in around one kilometre area in Jhalawar town in Rajasthan as avian influenza was confirmed in the area. On December 25, 50 crows were found dead at a temple in Jhalawar town. By January 4, over 300 more birds were found dead across Rajasthan.Madhya PradeshOn January 1, bird flu virus was confirmed in around 50 crows which were found dead in the last week of December in Indore. “Bird Flu has been detected in four samples of dead crows sent to the state lab. Around 100 crows died in Mandsaur between December 23 and January 3. Medical team to conduct surveillance within 1-km of the infected area,” Dr Manish Ingole of the animal husbandry department of Mandsaur told ANI.KeralaOn January 4, two districts in Kerala, Alappuzha and Kottayam, were put on a high alert after bird flu cases have been confirmed in ducks. The bird flu was reported from four panchayats--Nedumudi, Thakazhy, Pallippad and Karuvatta--in Kuttanad region of Alappuzha district and from a duck farm in Neendoor panchayat in Kottayam district. Officials said around 40,000 domestic birds, including 34,000 in Kuttanad region alone, will be culled to check the spread of the H5N8 virus.On January 5, the state government issues a statewide alert too.Himachal PradeshOn January 5, Himachal Pradesh became the fourth state to confirm bird flu. Around 1,800 migratory birds, most of them bar-headed geese, were found dead in the Pong Dam Lake sanctuary. Slaughtering, sale, purchase and export of any poultry, birds, fish of any breed and their related products, including eggs, meat, chicken, etc., has been banned in Kangra district. According to reports, Haryana too has reported a huge number of bird carcasses at Barwala in Panchkula district. A probe is on to find out whether the birds were infected by bird flu. Jammu and Kashmir sounded an alert and started collecting samples to check the health of winged guests flocking to the Union territory during winters.National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, is the nodal body for testing this disease. According to Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the US, the H5N1 virus was first detected in 1996 in geese in China. It was first detected in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. India is among the six countries considered to be endemic for H5N1, the other countries being Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam.The disease is transmitted from birds to human via an infected bird’s feces, or secretions from its nose, mouth or eye. The last major case of bird flu in Kerala was reported in 2016 — in the districts of Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flue-in-rajasthan-madhya-pradesh-kerala-himachal-pradesh-what-we-know-so-far/story-C6B1csGjFjtqNKDc2ptmlO.html
05-01-2021||India||Central Vista project case of ‘misplaced priorities’, says Congress after Supreme Court nod||The Congress party on Tuesday called the government’s Central Vista project a case of ‘misplaced priorities’ of a ‘whimsical autocrat’ hours after the Supreme cleared the redevelopment plan which includes construction of a new Parliament Building and a common Central Secretariat.“The ₹13,450 CR Central Vista Project is not a legalistic issue but a case of ‘misplaced priorities’ of a ‘whimsical autocrat’ seeking to etch his name in the annals of history with cement & mortar,” the grand old party’s national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala wrote on Twitter. He also took a swipe at the Centre over the purchase of “aircraft for the Prime Minister” and deduction of allowances for soldiers and central government employees. “Ironical that In times of Corona pandemic & economic recession, Delhi has ₹14,000 CR for Central Vista & ₹8,000 CR for buying aircrafts for PM. But the same BJP Govt imposes cuts of ₹37,530 CR in allowances of 113 Lakh Armed Forces & Central Govt Employees & Pensioners,” he wrote in another post on the microblogging site. Surjewala went on to accuse the government of having no time to provide ‘heated tents and equipment’ to army men braving the cold in Ladakh. “PM must not forget that he has imposed cuts of ₹11,000 CR on 15 lakh Soldiers & 26 lakh Military Pensioners. And the same BJP Govt at Centre has no time to provide ‘heated tents and equipment’ to our soldiers braving brazen Chinese incursions in Ladakh,” he tweeted. Earlier in the day, the apex court gave a go-ahead to the Central Vista project by a 2:1 majority. The three-judge bench, however, insisted that the clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work. The redevelopment plan includes a new Parliament building, and a common secretariat for Central government offices along with the Prime Minister office and residence, Special Protection Group building and Vice-President Enclave.Apart from a new Parliament building, the Central Vista project involves constructing a common Central Secretariat along with residences of Prime Minister and vice-president, and a revamp of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.The new triangular complex, often described as the centre-piece of the Central Vista project, will be big enough to house 1,224 MPs lawmakers — 888 in the Lok Sabha and 384 in the Upper House.

He underwent angioplasty after three tiny blockages were detected in his coronary artery.“This event will not affect his lifestyle or lifespan. He is going to lead a normal life like anybody else. Sourav can participate in a marathon, fly a plane, or even get back to cricket if he wants without this event being any setback as his heart has not suffered any damage. He can start working from home as soon as he reaches home,” said Shetty.Also Read: CPI(M) leader says Sourav under pressure to join politics, triggers stormGanguly is expected to be released from the hospital on Wednesday. He would be on oral medications and monitored on a daily basis at home. Doctors have advised him to undergo two more angioplasty for the other blockages after two to three weeks.“He has the option of both medication and angioplasty for the other blockages. It would be a good idea to go for angioplasty. We have left it for him to decide. He can wait for two weeks and then take a call,” said Shetty.He added Ganguly’s event has shaken the world raising a question as to how a 48-year-old athlete like him, who does not drink, smoke, or has any other vices, is a fit man, can have a heart attack.“Irrespective of how strict you are with your lifestyle, irrespective of how athletic you are, you can still have a heart attack if you do not go a preventive heart check-up at regular intervals,” he said. He added this event could have been predicted years ago and been prevented had Ganguly undergone check-ups.Shetty requested Ganguly to influence the country’s sports bodies to ensure sportspersons go for mandatory cardiac and body check-ups at least once in two years.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who met Ganguly at the hospital on Saturday, said she was surprised to know that he never underwent any preventive check-ups.Top cardiologists from India and abroad were consulted for Ganguly’s treatment. “If Ganguly was in any first world country, he would not have got any better care than what he has received in Kolkata,” said Shetty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sourav-ganguly-fit-enough-to-fly-plane-run-marathon-his-heart-is-strong-says-top-doctor/story-UUzkaIMfAgR6vMktJVsFfM.html

05-01-2021||India||CRPF jawan, 3 contract killers held for murder of former colleague in Bihar||The Bihar police, which is investigating the murder of a retired CRPF jawan, Jitendra Paswan, on Tuesday arrested his colleague, who had allegedly hired contract killers to eliminate Paswan so that he could marry the former jawan’s wife. According to reports, the police arrested four people including CRPF jawan Dayanand Paswan, currently posted in Latehar (Jharkhand), shooters—Santosh Nutt, Dhananjay Nutt—besides Fantush, who was also involved in the crime. One of the shooters, Manoj Sapera of Nawada and the deceased’s cousin Lavkush, who were also part of the plot are still at large. According to the police, both the conspirators—Dayanand and Lavkush—gave a contract of Rs 5 lakh to Nalanda goon Dhananjay, who engaged Santosh, Manoj and Fantush to carry out the crime. Dayanand paid Rs 2 lakh and Lavkush paid Rs 1 lakh as an advance to the contract killers. Later, both the conspirators took the three contract killers and showed them his shop. Police said that Jitendra, who used to run a canteen at the Patna-Gaya national highway was gunned down near Lodipur village barely 500 metres from the Jehanabad SP’s residence on December 23. A case was lodged against unidentified criminals with the Kadauna police out-post on the basis of the statement of Lavkush. Jehanabad SP Meenu Kumari said that the prime accused Dayanand and the victim worked together for many months during their posting at sector headquarters in Patna and during that time the former developed an intimate relationship with the victim’s wife. On the other hand, the deceased’s maternal brother Lavkush wanted to grab his canteen. The SP informed that on the day of the crime, three shooters from Patna, Nalanda and Nawada reached Jehanabad on a bike. Two of them entered the canteen and killed Jitendra while another was waiting outside the canteen on his bike. The fourth (Fantush) was stationed at Kako More and kept an eye on the movement of the police patrol car. During questioning, the CRPF jawan claimed that he fell in love with his colleague’s wife and wanted to marry her. He also claimed that Jitendra’s cousin wanted to grab his canteen so he hatched a conspiracy to eliminate the jawan and offered him monetary support, said the SP adding that the police had recovered the used weapon and empty cartridge from a ditch. The Jehanabad SP said that action in Jitendra’s murder case was taken after scanning CCTV footage. A manhunt has been launched for the third shooter and second conspirator. Jitendra’s wife has accepted having a relationship with Dayanand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-jawan-3-contract-killers-held-for-murder-of-former-colleague-in-bihar/story-HVX2s3LSk7L6Qe10Rt0RzO.html

05-01-2021||India||China tried to change status quo by force in Ladakh, says MoD review||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation in the sensitive Ladakh theatre by using unorthodox weapons against Indian soldiers and amassing a large number of troops during the ongoing border standoff along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), the defence ministry said in a year-end review of major developments. While the ministry did not elaborate on the unorthodox weapons used, the PLA troops attacked Indian soldiers with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs during skirmishes in Pangong Tso and the Galwan Valley last year. The PLA attempted to alter the status quo in the sector by force but the Indian Army was well-entrenched to counter any misadventure by the adversary, it said. Also Read: Ladakh was the starting point. India-China ties are getting complicatedIn its review, published on January 1, the ministry said the Indian Army—assisted by the Indian Air Force (IAF)—mobilised troops, accretionary forces, artillery guns, tanks and ammunition at a swift pace to deal with the emerging situation. Roads, habitat and bridges were constructed quickly to support the enhanced troop deployment, it said. “Unilateral and provocative actions by the Chinese to change the status quo by force in more than one area on the LAC were responded to in a firm and non-escalatory way, ensuring the sanctity of our claims in Eastern Ladakh,” the ministry said, adding that the Indian Army stuck to the protocols and agreements between the two countries even as the PLA took escalatory actions. The review reiterated that Chinese suffered significant casualties in the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed in action. The ministry elaborated on the steps taken by the Indian Army to occupy strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, thwarting China’s expansionist aims. The ministry said that Indian troops, in a precautionary deployment on August 28-19, “pre-empted Chinese expansionist designs” and occupied heights along southern bank of Pangong Tso. “Braving inclement weather, own troops continue to be deployed on these heights. Advance winter stocking (AWS) and winter preparations for the enhanced strength has been completed and troops are well entrenched to counter any misadventure by Chinese forces,” the review said. The review added that IAF’s heavy-lift planes altered the dynamics of “force posturing” in the Ladakh sector “by mobilising huge quantum of war-waging machinery along with battle ready troops in quick time-frames.” The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The review added that while the Indian Army was prepared for any eventuality, talks were in progress to resolve the issue in an amicable manner. Last week, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that talks with China on disengagement and de-escalation in the Ladakh sector—where the two countries have been locked in a border row for eight months—had not yielded any meaningful solution. Both sides are expected to hold the ninth round of military talks to reduce border but there is no indication of when India and China will hold the dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-change-status-quo-by-force-in-ladakh-says-mod-review/story-i3l2INcrilgQb2TnF8WPHL.html

05-01-2021||India||African swine fever reported in Manipur, illegal import of pigs blamed||The contagious African Swine Fever (ASF) has been reported in Manipur, said officials, assuring that the situation is under control. Director of state veterinary and Animal husbandry Dr Chaoba Singh said that the disease has been detected in the Salungpham area in Thoubal district and Nongmaiching Chingkhong(Wakha) area in Imphal East district. “So the said areas have been sealed and sanitised. One km radius of the area has also been contained to prevent further spread of the disease,” Dr Chaoba said. “The surveillance is going on within 10 km radius of the areas too.”Singh suspected the illegal import of pigs as the reason behind the disease.Last year, the ASF killed many pigs in Assam, subsequently the import of the animal was prohibited in Manipur.Meanwhile the district administration of Thoubal in its order issued on January 2, under the Prevention and Control of Infectious Contagious Diseases in Animals Act 2009, notified “controlled areas” for ASF at Kangyambem, Lokchao, Salungpham Mamang Leikai. At the same time, Imphal East District administration in its order on January 4, declared a piggery farm as “infected premises” at Nongmaiching Chingkhong(Wakha) area in the district.The district administrations also banned sale of pig, pork, feed and related items in these “controlled area” and “infected zones” apart from restricting the movement of pig from the place where it is kept within the above area and zone, the orders said.“Any person/institution/organisation found violating any of those containment measures shall be deemed to have committed an offence punishable under the Act,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/african-swine-fever-reported-in-manipur-illegal-import-of-pigs-blamed/story-xivMeigUTf5StfEOB8X6QJ.html
05-01-2021||India||Exports of Covishield allowed to all countries, clarifies Adar Poonawalla||Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla on Tuesday said exports of its vaccine, Covishield, which became one of the first Covid-19 vaccines in India to get restricted emergency-use approval, are permitted to all countries. Earlier it was reported that Pune’s SII got the approval on the condition that it will not export its shots as of now.  I would like to clarify two matters; as there is confusion in the public domain, exports of vaccines are permitted to all countries and a joint public statement clearing up any recent miscommunication with regards to Bharat Biotech will be made.The Associated Press reported that Poonawalla said his company has been barred from selling vaccines on the private market.Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest vaccine maker by the number of doses produced in a year. As it tied up with Astrazeneca and Oxford University to conduct trials in India and to produce the vaccines in India, several south Asian countries have shown interest in Covaxin. In November, an MoU was signed between the Bangladesh health ministry, Serum Institute and Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharmaceuticals according to which SII would provide three crore doses to Bangladesh.Demand for SII’s vaccine being manufactured in India is not only limited to the neighbouring countries, as the vaccine is likely to be cheaper than its global competitors. Global vaccine alliance Gavi has collaborated with Serum Institute and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to deliver up to an additional 100 million doses of vaccines, once proved effective, to low- and middle-income countries, as part of the Gavi-COVAX Advance Market Commitment.Hence, the approval of the vaccine for restricted emergency use is good news for the international market as well but reports that India has barred SII to export its vaccines led to confusion.SII is also part of another vaccine project — CoV2373 — in collaboration with Novavax.Serum Institute versus Bharat BiotechAfter both the companies got a go-ahead for restricted, emergency use in India, apparent competition between the two vaccine candidates mounted as many questioned the efficacy of Bharat Biotech’s vaccine, Covaxin, which is still undergoing trial. AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria said India will use Covishield/Oxford vaccine as the primary vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s vaccine will be a back-up option. Also, Bharat Biotech’s vaccine may be more potential against new Coronavirus mutant, it was said.In an interview, Adar Poonawalla reportedly said only three vaccines in the world have passed all scientific evaluations — Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-Astrazeneca. “...others were safe, ‘safe like water’,” he was quoted. Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella did not shrug off the criticism. He pointed out the trial error that Astrazeneca did in September and questioned why Covaxin would be considered as the back-up vaccine.In this backdrop, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech will issue a joint statement clearing up “any recent miscommunication with regards to Bharat Biotech will be made”, Poonawalla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exports-of-covishied-allowed-to-all-countries-clarifies-adar-poonawalla/story-OLaNc0JLCk5KwgzYuSW7fP.html

Noting that GAIL had to stop the project in September 2104 due to several obstacles, the Chief Minister said at the 450 km pipeline’s virtual inaugural function that his government, after coming to power in 2016, had to “clear obstacles by proactively addressing the genuine concerns of the people”. “GAIL authorities also stood by us in making this project come to life. I am extremely happy that our combined efforts have borne fruits,” he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the 450-km natural pipeline between Kochi and Mangalore in the virtual event attended by dignitaries including governors and chief ministers of Kerala and Karnataka, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, and authorities of GAIL. The 450 km-long pipeline will carry natural gas from Kochi in Kerala through Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasargod districts to Mangaluru in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka. The pipeline is a landmark example of project execution with active support of governments of Kerala and Karnataka. Officials said the pipeline will bring convenient and uninterrupted supply of environment friendlyand affordable fuel in the form of piped natural gas (PNG) to households, commercial units and compressed natural gas (CNG) across different city gas distribution (CGD) areas in different Geographical Areas. The pipeline will offer clean industrial fuel and feedstock for petrochemical and fertilized sectors and provide an opportunity for multiple gas-based industries to emerge, thus bringing about socio-economic benefits to the people of these states and creating direct and indirect job opportunities, they said.

05-01-2021||India||Kerala to reopen theatres from today: All you need to know||The Kerala government has released a set of guidelines and Covid-19 prohibitive measures that movie theatres have to strictly follow at all times after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said movie theatres in the state can reopen from Tuesday. “For nearly a year now, movie theatres have been fully closed in the state. This has led to a big crisis for thousands of people working in the film industry. Considering this, a decision has been taken to open film theatres with certain restrictions. Strict action will be taken against those theatres which do not abide by these restrictions. Since the theatres have been closed for so long, they should be disinfected before being opened on January 5,” the chief minister said in the press conference.However, not all cinemas will be opening on Tuesday as owners are awaiting a response from the government on the demands they put forward. Cinema owners have asked the government to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the tickets, and exemption from entertainment tax for a fixed period of time to allow recovery. They have also asked for a waiver on the monthly fixed electricity charge below Rs 50,000, allowing cinemas to make up for the losses they have incurred in the past nine months. Vijayan’s decision was preceded by the news of a major blockbuster’s (Drishyam 2) OTT release. Kerala currently has 63,135 active cases of Covid-19 and six fresh cases of the mutated coronavirus strain reported in the UK were detected in the state. All six patients had recently returned from the United Kingdom on December 14. Here are the guidelines movie theatres and cinema-goers have to follow:1. Theatres will only be allowed to run on 50% occupancy, meaning only 50% of available seats will be available for bookings. This has created contention amongst theatre owners who have asked the government to increase seating capacity to 80%. 2. Theatre goers will have to wear masks at all times and follow proper social distancing norms.3. Theatres will have to be cleaned and sanitised as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the government.4. Show timings of the screenings will have to be staggered and all movie-goers will have to be thermally screened before entry. 5. Theatre employees will have to be provided with proper protective equipment6. Phone numbers of moviegoers will have to be registered for purposes of contact tracing, should need be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-to-reopen-theatres-from-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-DhyEWbFtnWIvkkdsKsv2UM.html

He conceptualised the river regulation zone (RRZ) on the lines of the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) which would offer legal protection to river floodplains from various activities which can be detrimental to river health and ecology. Though the concept was discussed as early as 2002 and former environment minister Jairam Ramesh and later present environment minister Prakash Javadekar assured that RRZ will be implemented to secure floodplains from concretisation, the policy is yet to take off. Ramesh made a special mention in Parliament about RRZ on July 16, 2019, when he wrote, “ An RRZ notification for the protection of floodplains of various rivers along the lines of CRZ which exists is urgently needed…the absence of such a notification has led to environmental destruction of the floodplain areas which are the safety valves for rivers.” “Prof Brij Gopal helped me enormously on wetlands, especially when I was a minister. A true self-effacing scholar and mentor to many,” Ramesh tweeted on Tuesday. “Dear @PrakashJavdekar & @gssjodhpur Now that d real propounder & architect of River Zone Regulation (RRZ) draft Notification Prof Brij Gopal has died this morning without seeing it Notified wud u b kind enough to do it as a memorial to him? @moefcc @cleanganganmcg @Jairam_Ramesh” tweeted Manoj Misra, convenor of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan. Many researchers, scientists and environmentalists remembered Gopal as someone who was honest in his criticism of river and wetland policies. In September, after government reports showed that water quality had improved following lockdown, he said, “The reason Yamuna is in better quality is because industries are closed. This will not last more than a few months unless the government has a strategy for industries after Covid-19 pandemic. What we are seeing today is a natural consequence of less effluents and better dilution due to monsoon.” He called for long term conservation of floodplains and rivers through legal interventions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecologist-architect-of-river-regulation-zone-prof-brij-gopal-passes-away-at-76/story-EszE8fERvn7iIJGmfjDDmM.html

It has blamed the company’s business rivals of taking advantage of the ongoing farmers’ protests.Farm unions have launched the agitation to force the Centre to revoke the three laws, which provide for creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old government marketplaces. The laws allow traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming.Also read | Supreme Court will take up an open letter on farmers as PILReliance Jio has maintained in its petition that its parent company, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), retail arms, and affiliates, have “no interest” and do not “intend in future to do corporate or contract farming”. It emphasised that the conglomerate and its retail arms have not purchased any agricultural land directly or indirectly for farming.It underlined the conglomerate has the greatest regard for the farmers hard work and added it has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain “unfair advantage” over farmers or their produce.The petition was filed on Monday seeking direction to the state and the Centre to protect the firm’s infrastructure and ensure the safety of its employees.The firm’s lawyer, Ashish Chopra, said that the high court has sought response from Punjab and the Centre by February 8.The plea said subscribers were compelled to port to other networks and the vandalism has also endangered lives of the company’s employees. The company has also sought the appointment of competent authority to assess the damages to be recovered from the attackers as per a Supreme Court ruling.“The destruction has been done in a well-orchestrated manner, which is the result of a sustained disinformation campaign being carried out by vested interests,” said the plea.Protesters in Punjab have targeted the company amid allegations that the laws are meant to benefit certain corporate houses at the cost of farmers. Farmers say the laws will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-issues-notices-to-centre-punjab-over-damage-to-reliance-jio-s-infrastructure-amid-farmer-protests/story-GxTpbRvXdhRNzwmOxz0m8I.html

05-01-2021||India||Who will opt for a vaccine with question marks on its reliability: Manish Tewari||Congress leader Manish Tewari on Tuesday alleged the government has “politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety” as he also criticised it over the grant of approval to Bharat Biotech International Limited’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for restricted use. Tewari, however, did not name the Hyderabad-based company. Several leaders of the Congress have already called the approval to Bharat Biotech’s vaccine “premature” and said that it can prove dangerous.“The BJP government has politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety. The controversy over the vaccine is its latest manifestation. Who is going to get himself vaccinated with a vaccine that has question marks on its reliability,” Tewari was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here “The BJP government has done a great disservice to that company which must have invested crores of rupees in research and development. In their quest to prove their ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ they have licensed a vaccine whose phase III trials are not complete,” Tewari also said, according to ANI.Drug Control General of India (DCGI) on Sunday approved the Oxford University-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use.Before Tewari, his colleagues in the Congress party Jairam Ramesh, Shashi Tharoor and Samajwadi Party’s chief Akhilesh Yadav have raised doubts about the efficacy of Covaxin. Yadav who called it a “BJP vaccine”, said he wouldn’t get himself vaccinated for now added that “BJP (people) should get vaccinated first.” Tharoor on Sunday wrote on Twitter, “But it is typical of a govt that prefers slogans over substance. Chest-thumping ‘vaccine nationalism’, combined with the PM’s “Atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign, has trumped common sense and a generation of established scientific protocols.”Amid the political slugfest between the opposition and ruling party leaders, Bharat Biotech chairperson and managing director, Krishna Ella, on Monday hit out at comments suggesting that Covaxin, was “safe like water”, and said that their Phase 3 efficacy data, likely to be out by February or March, will silence all critics.The company also asked for a weeks’ time to prove with evidence that its vaccine also worked against the new UK variant of Sars-Cov-2 virus as 90% of the vaccines targeted just the spike protein of the virus but Covaxin was an inactivated whole virion vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-will-opt-for-a-vaccine-with-marks-on-its-reliability-congress-s-manish-tewari/story-OlX39mQGKb1Rt56RAfOtmM.html

05-01-2021||India||Ladakh was the starting point. India-China ties are getting complicated||Eight months to this date, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched aggression on Indian Army troopers at the finger four mountainous spur on the north banks of Pangong Tso and tried to unilaterally change the alignment of the 1,597-kilometre Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. It was premeditated. The soldiers had exchanged blows, threw stones at each other and attacked Indian soldiers with nail-studded clubs. But the PLA aggressors had been ready, wearing helmets and thickly-padded anti-riot uniforms.Also Read: Restore vandalised temple in two weeks: Pak SC tells KP’s provincial govtThe PLA then expanded the aggression horizontally, creating friction points at Galwan Valley and Gogra-Hot Springs near Kongka La. The conflict flared up on June 15 at Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley but the Indian Army led by Col Santosh Babu responded in kind to Chinese aggression. Patrolling point 14 is among the 65 patrolling points identified back in 1976 as the patrolling limits for the Indian troopers on the Ladakh LAC.On August 29-30, the Indian Army pre-empted a PLA military manoeuvre on the south banks of Pangong Tso and occupied the heights on the Rezang La-Rechin La ridgeline, which dominate the Chinese Moldo garrison in Chushul sector. The PLA tried to retaliate but the Indian Army was able to convey its seriousness by a counter move.Also Read: 10 Chinese spies caught in Kabul get a quiet pardon, fly home in chartered aircraftEight months down the line with both Indian Army and the PLA locked up in a military stand-off and eight rounds of military talks at the senior commander level completed, the negotiations between the two sides are still work in progress.“While the dates for the ninth round of military talks are still to be decided, we are in no hurry as the Chinese side is yet to get back with certain clarifications towards disengagement and de-escalation on ground. We are prepared for a long haul but the ultimate objective is to get the heavy armour of both armies back to bases,” said a senior official.While both armies are working out various permutations and combinations to disengage from the north banks of Pangong Tso, Hindustan Times has learnt that the solution, if and when it comes to fruition, will answer the concerns of both sides and lead to a rollback of the PLA’s May 2020 aggression.The change of XIV Corps Commander and the PLA’s western theatre commander could also work towards the resolution of the stand-off as the previous PLA commander General Zhao Zongqi had been aggressive on both the Indian and the Bhutan border during his tenure. While there is a military status quo along the Indian LAC, there has been no let up in the PLA push towards Bhutan with the Chinese army building infrastructure on both sides of the Amu Chu (river) that could threaten the Indian Siliguri corridor. The Sikkim-Bhutan sector is a matter of top Indian security concern with Bhutan largely having a ceremonial army and hardly any ability to stand a PLA onslaught.Also Read: Chinese economy is recovering. But there are gaps | AnalysisWhile the Ladakh LAC stand-off may get sorted out over time, the Chinese posture towards India will not change as it believes that the Modi government has synergised with the US over Indo-Pacific and QUAD - the informal grouping that brings together India, Australia and Japan with the United State - and thus become an adversary.What Beijing papers over is that the Indian posture towards China is a reaction to Middle-Kingdom’s encirclement of India through its tributary states in South Asia and South-East Asia.”If China has issues with India over its proximity to the US, Japan and Australia, then India also has very serious concerns over Beijing’s role in Gilgit-Baltistan, Balochistan and Sindh. Had India played the puppeteer in Nepal or Sri Lanka like China does, then it would have been called a hegemon. So the two rising powers need to find balance or else there will be friction,” said a government security expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-was-the-starting-point-india-china-ties-are-getting-complicated/story-sOcpYmrzS4FFFNfenYaS6O.html
05-01-2021||India||Coronavirus pandemic has turned the clock back by many years: Harsh Vardhan||Union health and family welfare minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday said the coronavirus pandemic has turned the clock back by many years and the lockdowns have raised insurmountable barriers and imposed many roadblocks.The Centre has initiated a series of actions to prevent the virus spread and was now taking up the vaccination drive in a big way, he said in remarks that came a day after India’s drug regulator approved the restricted use of Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech in the country.In his address at the 32nd Convocation of city-based Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER) held virtually, he said the pandemic showcased the contribution of the government sector towards adequate healthcare - both Intensive Care and otherwise. He also called for a powerful societal commitment to overcome the barriers imposed by the pandemic.Acknowledging that Covid-19 has turned the clock back by many years, if not decades, he said the “deadly virus has derailed painstaking efforts of many decades and diverted scientific attention.” “The lockdowns have raised insurmountable barriers, interrupted supply chains, diversion of manufacturing capacity and imposition of many roadblocks. This period needs strategised thinking, thought leadership and disruptive social entrepreneurship,” Vardhan said.There was a need for mass mobilisation, aggressive campaigns, powerful partners and deep commitments.“And most of all, it needs a powerful societal commitment. Doctors are the backbone of any society. If our doctors are committed, then many things will automatically fall into place,” he said.Stating that the Centre has initiated a series of actions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has interacted with chief ministers of all states and UTs and all stakeholders to regularly understand issues and collaborate with them for effective Covid management. This year, the Centre has already made a substantial increase in the healthcare spend and the Finance Commission has projected a massive increase in the health outlay in the next five years. “The recent pandemic has showcased the contribution of the Government sector towards adequate healthcare.... both intensive care and otherwise. The Central government is taking up the vaccination drive in a big way,” Vardhan said.Listing out the government initiatives,the minister said telemedicine has been promoted in a big way to ensure accessibility of quality treatment for both Covid and non-Covid health issues in far-flung areas.He said eSanjeevani, a web-based comprehensive telemedicine solution, is being utilised in 23 states with over 11 lakh teleconsultations held on this platform till date. To improve the nation’s health, the world’s largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was launched to create 1.50 lakh health and wellness centres by upgrading sub-health centres and rural and urban primary health centres.Around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families have been identified for a health cover of Rs five lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation, the minister said.The present doctor-patient ratio of 1:1700 needed to be improved to 1:1000 as per WHO norms.Similarly, the number of hospital beds available is 9 per 10,000 population and this needs to be immediately increased to 40 per 10,000.The number of people covered under health insurance has to drastically increase from the present 8-10 per cent, he added.“There is a lot of scope for medical professionals to innovate and improvise to facilitate the PMs dream of Atma Nirbhar India and Make in India concepts through Research and Development Initiatives,” Vardhan said and saluted the frontline health workers and all those who supported patient- care during the pandemic risking their own lives.He complimented SRIHER for providing a separate block for Covid patients and for conducting ICMR vaccine trials and serving as a testing centre since April 2020.Chancellor V R Venkataachalam conferred the degrees and along with Pro Chancellor R V Sengutuvan and Vice Chancellor P V Vijayaraghavan, presented 94 gold medals to meritorious students and distributed certificates to 1,266 students, including in Ph.D., super specialities, post graduate and under graduate disciplines. Earlier in his report, the Vice Chancellor said “our hospital has been undertaking clinical trials for CovidD- 19 vaccines with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech International besides BCG vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-pandemic-has-turned-the-clock-back-by-many-years-harsh-vardhan/story-TT3QYvpxxJTDMpQ9heQzTK.html

The seventh round of talks held on Monday to resolve the deadlock over the farm laws remained inconclusive. The farmers’ unions stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the new farm laws, which they say are pro-corporate, even as the government wanted to discuss only “problematic” clauses or other alternatives. Both the sides will meet again on January 8.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that he is “hopeful” that a conclusion will be found in the next round of talks. “We wanted farmer unions to discuss three laws clause-wise. We could not reach any solution as farmer unions remained adamant on the repeal of the laws,” the minister told reporters after the meeting.Also read | Supreme Court will take up an open letter on farmers as PILThe protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been at the border points of the national capital since November 26, braving the bone-chilling cold weather in the region.

The government said it is willing to pledge that guaranteed prices will continue. They also say the three farm laws will lead to the cartelisation and commercialisation of agriculture and make farmers vulnerable to corporate greed. The farmers have also threatened to hold a rally on January 26 on Republic Day if their demands are not met.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-brave-another-cold-day-rains-after-talks-fail/story-FMv8q21viq97ug21emT7BL.html
05-01-2021||India||Central Vista project gets Supreme Court go-ahead||The Supreme Court, by a 2:1 majority on Tuesday, approved the redevelopment plan for Central Vista that included construction of a new Parliament Building and a common Central Secretariat. The three-judge bench, however, insisted that the clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work. The Bench also directed installation of smog guns at the project site as a measure to curb pollution and asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests to consider having smog guns while carrying out any such development work in future. The majority verdict was given by Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari. The third judge on the bench, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, dissented with regard to change of land use and prior approval of HCC. The dissenting judge even found the environment clearance inadequate.However, his view would be of little avail as the majority bench gave a blanket approval to the Centre’s decision on change of land use and grant of environment clearance. Even the notice inviting bids and selection of project consultant HCP Designs was held to be fair. The majority view noted that HCC clearance would only be needed when the actual work commences and not at the initial stage. On November 5, the court reserved orders on a batch of ten petitions filed by Rajeev Suri, Anuj Srivastava and others which challenged the manner in which the Central Vista project got various clearances.The petitions claimed that the project has been planned by destroying heritage buildings and giving unified building by-laws a go by.The redevelopment plan includes a new Parliament building, and a common secretariat for Central government offices along with the Prime Minister office and residence, Special Protection Group building and Vice-President Enclave.Apart from a new Parliament building, the Central Vista project involves constructing a common Central Secretariat along with residences of Prime Minister and vice-president, and a revamp of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.The new triangular complex, often described as the centre-piece of the Central Vista project, will be big enough to house 1,224 MPs lawmakers — 888 in the Lok Sabha and 384 in the Upper House. It is targeted to be built by 2024.

Also Read: Maharashtra’s active Covid-19 cases drop below 50,000Among the sequenced samples, 10 samples tested positive in NIMHANS, Bengaluru, three in CCMB, Hyderabad, five in NIV, Pune, 11 in IGIB, Delhi, eight in NCDC, New Delhi, and one in NCBG, Kolkata. NCBS, InSTEM, Bengaluru, CDFD Hyderabad, ILS Bhubaneswar, and NCCS Pune have so far found no traces of the UK variant among the samples that have been sequenced in their labs.From November 25 to December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from UK. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to detect Covid-19. “All these persons have been kept in single-room isolation in designated health care facilities by respective state governments. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine. Comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on,” said the Union health ministry in a statement. “The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to Insacog labs,” the statement further read.The Indian government had suspended air travel from the United Kingdom December 23 onwards after a new variant of Sars-CoV-2 was found to be circulating in London and other parts of the country. The new variant – which has 23 mutations, including one on the receptor binding protein on the spike used by the virus to enter the human cells – is thought to be 70% more transmissible, raising concerns of super-spreading events. However, doctors monitoring these patients have not found severe illness because of the new variant. The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-more-people-test-positive-for-the-new-uk-variant-of-sars-cov-2-total-reaches-38/story-aZwO2FKK5QMveKHaBdkp4J.html

According to CAPA, international traffic is only expected to recover 35-40% of financial year 2020 levels, while domestic traffic in financial year 2021-22 is expected to reach 70-80% of financial year 2020 levels.It stated that discretionary domestic travel segments (business, institutional, MICE, leisure and foreigners travelling on the domestic network), that accounted for an estimated 55% of the market before the Covid-19 outbreak, is unlikely to return until the pandemic is under greater control or deployment of a vaccine is widespread. CAPA also said that even outbound travel will continue to be impacted by border restrictions and poor consumer confidence until there is effective roll-out of a vaccine.According to CAPA, there has been very limited discretionary travel demand that could be stimulated through lower fares. Though some carriers opposed pricing restrictions, CAPA expects no major push to change the regulations. CAPA also said that aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security will need to be reinvented as professional, independent institutions, to be able to serve the aviation industry of today,which includes generating funding directly from industry operators and consumers. “The need to modernise these agencies can no longer be ignored as the entire industry will soon be market-driven. Hiving off and corporatising the air navigation services division of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), in line with global best practice, is another overdue reform that should now be pursued. The AAI requires a new long-term business model given that the largest airports will have been privatised,” CAPA said in a report issued on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-travel-to-continue-to-be-impacted-in-2021-predicts-capa/story-WRjNcbkCtv7krjRt7IjKnO.html
05-01-2021||India||Maharashtra’s active Covid-19 cases drop below 50,000||Maharashtra’s tally of active Covid-19 cases has come down below 50,000 mark. On Monday, it came down to 48,801 from 54,317 reported on Sunday. Active cases are the difference between total cases and the patients who have recovered (or discharged from hospitals) as well as died. It’s basically ‘live’ Covid-19 cases at the given time.The state has seen a decline in active cases in the last four months. It had touched 3,01,752 active cases on September 17. However, a decline in daily cases changed the scenario and consequently active cases also started coming down. On October 17, the figure was 1,85,270, on November 17, it came down to 81,925 and on December 16 it was 61,454.With this, the ratio of active cases compared to the total cases reported also dropped to 2.5% against 26.33% recorded on September 17.Maharashtra is maintaining a trend of low Covid-19 cases for over two months. For the last 19 consecutive days, it is reporting fewer than 4,000 cases. However, there are concerns for a surge in cases this month. On Monday, eight returnees from the United Kingdom were detected with new coronavirus strain, which is believed to be 70% more transmissible than the previous strain. Of the eight, five are in Mumbai, one each in Pune, Thane and Mira-Bhayander. All are kept in isolation and their contacts are being traced, said the state health minister Rajesh Tope.“Between November 25 and December 21, over 4,000 passengers came to Mumbai airport from the UK. They were kept in institutional quarantine facilities and were tested. Of them, 43 tested positive for coronavirus. To ascertain if positive cases are of the mutant strain, samples were sent to NIV, Pune, where genomic sequencing was found. From the reports that came, of the 43 patients, eight cases are of the mutated virus. Their contact tracing and tracking is happening at an expedited speed. However, there is no need to panic. Certainly, the new mutated virus spreads faster. Therefore, we must take all precautions. Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-active-covid-19-cases-drop-below-50-000/story-3faJDfNkCJuR6xKihP6kXM.html
05-01-2021||India||Kochi-Mangaluru gas pipeline will boost economic growth in Kerala, Karnataka: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday inaugurated the natural gas pipeline from Kerala’s Kochi to Mangaluru in Karnataka via video conferencing and said the project will have a positive impact on the economic growth in the two southern states. “This is an important day for India, especially for the people of Kerala and Karnataka. These two states are being connected by a natural gas pipeline,” PM Modi said. He added that the pipeline will facilitate the ease of living for lakhs of people in both the states and also give a boost to the tourism sector. In a veiled dig at the previous governments at the Centre, Modi said he didn’t wish to talk about the reasons behind the rate of India’s progress in previous decades, adding, the country cannot develop slowly now. “In recent years, the country has increased its speed, scale, and scope of development,” he said.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement the 450km long pipeline built by GAIL (India) Ltd marks an important milestone towards the creation of “One Nation One Gas Grid”. The Rs 3,000-crore project, which will carry natural gas from the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Regasification Terminal at Kochi to Mangaluru, while passing through Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod districts, has the transportation capacity of 12 million metric standard cubic metres per day, the statement added. Modi’s office said over 1.2 million man-days of employment was generated during the construction of the pipeline. The pipeline will supply environment-friendly and affordable fuel in the form of piped natural gas (PNG) to households and compressed natural gas (CNG) to the transportation sector. It will also supply natural gas to commercial and industrial units across the districts along the pipeline, PMO said. Consumption of cleaner fuel will help in improving air quality by curbing air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-inaugurates-kochi-mangaluru-natural-gas-pipeline/story-ijf2F4OH6oggyM5JDuEdDL.html

Through these visits, the BJP leadership would galvanise the cadres for the rural polls,” a party leader said. At the nearly two-hour meeting, senior party leaders, including the chief minister as well as party’s national general secretary and office in-charge Arun Singh, authorised the party’s state chief Swatantra Dev to send a panel of names for clearance to the BJP’s central leadership. “Wait and watch. Soon everything will be before you,” said a senior BJP leader privy to the meeting when asked if the candidate list would also have some surprises. Apart from CM Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, UP BJP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi, minister of state Neelima Katiyar and UP BJP vice-president Kanta Kardam were present at the meeting. The six-year tenure of 12 members of the legislative council would end on January 30. They include six MLCs of the Samajwadi Party and three each of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Since its impressive victory in the 2017 UP assembly polls, the BJP is now in a position to send maximum MLCs to the upper house of the state legislature. It is comfortably placed to send at least nine candidates to the legislative council where, as of now, the opposition Samajwadi Party has a majority with 55 members. The BJP is a distant second with 25 members followed by the Bahujan Samaj Party (8) and the Congress (2). The number of MLCs a party can get elected to the legislative council is dependent on the number of members it has in the state assembly. The BJP has 305 members in the UP assembly, the SP 48 and the BSP 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mulls-panchayat-polls-plan-names-for-12-up-legislative-council-seats/story-9G0VtA1ZiirzgkZGUyTDyN.html
05-01-2021||India||Mass bird deaths in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh prompt remedial measures||Mass bird deaths in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have prompted authorities to take remedial measures, issue alerts, and enhance surveillance, officials in the two states said. Officials said 175 crows and other birds were reported dead across Rajasthan on Monday alone. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, over 500 crows have died over the last week.Officials in Madhya Pradesh said they were mixing antibiotics in water bowls for the birds in the affected areas. In Rajasthan, expert teams have been rushed and surveillance enhanced especially around poultry farms. Rajasthan’s animal husbandry department officials said they were collecting 10 samples each from wetlands in Rajasthan like Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur and Jaipur’s Sambhar Lake. Over 250 bird deaths were reported dead in the state on Sunday. They include 24 pigeons in Kota.Rajasthan’s additional director (animal husbandry) Bhawani Singh said migratory birds seem to be the possible source of the disease even as Bhopal’s National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases has confirmed the death of a bird in Jhalawar was due to bird flu. Officials said they were following the protocol and burying the birds.Microbiologist AK Kataria said the mass deaths are not unusual and happen annually. “The pattern of mortality and environmental conditions suggest these deaths of crows are due to cold shock. There are no clinical signs of bird flu,” he said. He added the poultry birds are more susceptible to bird flu. “But so far no deaths of poultry have been reported.” Kataria said in 2020, too, over 300 crows were reported dead. He added dead crows are usually found under the trees. “Crows migrate to warmer areas in winter, and do not reside in residential areas.”In Madhya Pradesh, an animal husbandry department official said birds there have died of bird flu. The state’s principal secretary (animal husbandry), JN Kansotia, said the situation is under control and they have sounded an alert in all districts. “We have started a sanitisation process in the affected area.”Dr Shailesh Sakallaye, the integrated disease surveillance programme additional director, said a survey is being conducted in the affected four districts to check the impact of bird flu among humans.Humans can be infected with avian influenza, or bird flu, primarily through direct contact and may cause disease ranging from mild fever and cough, early sputum production and rapid progression to severe pneumonia, sepsis with shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death, according to the World Health Organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mass-bird-deaths-in-rajasthan-madhya-pradesh-prompt-remedial-measures/story-UeouVTzzl1l1pqZYh9vqZJ.html

All eyes would be on Georgia’s run-off elections, in which two Senate seats have the potential to create fresh volatility in the markets,” he said.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong were trading on a negative note in mid-session deals, while Seoul was in the positive terrain.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark, Brent crude, was trading 0.14 per cent lower at USD 51.02 per barrel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sensex-down-112-74-points-in-opening-trade-nifty-at-14-094/story-FqcXyr9lRmNdLnWMwRLq1K.html
05-01-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh’s December revenue collection up by Rs 2,522 crore||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday said there has been an increase in its total collections of tax and non-tax revenue by about Rs 2,522 crore in December 2020 vis-à-vis its performance on this front in December 2019.Its total collections in the first three quarters of 2020-2021 (April 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021) have also improved considerably. The total receipts for the financial year, however, are still behind the overall targets and authorities are hoping for an improvement in the last quarter (January 1 to March 31 2021) amid the fight against Covid-19.State finance minister Suresh Khanna said, “Yes, our revenue collection is witnessing an upward trend since July 2020 despite the adverse impact that Covid-19 had on the state’s economy. We are recovering from the economic slowdown under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and directions of chief minister Yogi Adityanath. We hope to bring about a further improvement in the state’s total revenue collections in the fourth quarter of 2021-22.”For the first time since the lifting of restrictions, the state transport department’s collections have also increased. The state transport department’s total collections in December 2020 reached Rs 734.44 crore against the month’s target of Rs 648.75 crore and receipts of Rs 551.39 crore in the same month in 2019. The state government’s excise collections have also exceeded the targets in December 2020. A total excise duty realisation of Rs 3149.04 crore has been made against a target of Rs 3090 crore and receipts of Rs 2,106.14 crore in the same month in 2019. An increase in the transport department’s revenue collections is a reflection of an easier movement following gradual lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.A close scrutiny of the state government’s performance in the first three quarters indicates that its total collections remained at about Rs 80,006.34 crore between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020. This is about 65.7% of the target of Rs 1,21,845.42 crore for the same period. The state government’s shortfall in the revenue collections vis-à-vis the targets, however, remains an area of major concern for the authorities ahead of formulation of the state budget for 2021-22.As there was no winter session of the state legislature, the state government is likely to convene the budget session soon to present the budget for 2021-22. The annual budget is likely to pose a great challenge as this would be the Yogi government’s last full-fledged budget before the state goes into poll mode for 2022 assembly elections.Experts suggest that besides reviewing the receipts, the state government should also consistently monitor its expenditure that may help in giving a boost to development and the economy.“This clearly shows that the state’s economy is bouncing back. We hope the revenue collection will improve further in the last quarter of 2021-22. The state government should also review its expenditure and stick to meeting the targets as the government spending acts works like a stimulus to the economy,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor of the department of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttar-pradesh-s-december-revenue-collection-up-by-rs-2-522-crore/story-9y0cmcRy4WQdX3nojI8zkI.html
05-01-2021||India||World could see 1 mn additional TB cases due to malnutrition post pandemic||There could be an increase of 1 million cases of tuberculosis across the world, with India missing its target to eliminate the bacterial infection by 2025, said senior scientist of the World Health Organization and former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Dr Soumya Swaminathan. Tuberculosis affects an estimated 10 million people each year around the globe, killing 1.4 million. It is the leading infectious cause of death. “The pandemic affected the TB programme globally, with GeneX pert machine (that can be used to perform RT-PCR tests) and staff being diverted to Covid-19 management. The lockdown and other restrictions also led to a decline in the GDP that, in turn, would increase undernutrition. This undernutrition might drive an additional 1 million cases of TB a year,” said Dr Swaminathan, during the recently concluded India International Science Festival.Also Read: No Covid-19 posters outside homes: Supreme Court“TB notification dropped by 50 to 60% during the pandemic, which might result in higher cases in the future,” she said. India reported 2.69 million cases of tuberculosis in 2019, accounting for 26% of the global burden of the infection. India had set a target to eliminate TB, defined as restricting new infections to less than one case per 100,000 people, by 2025. “The pandemic has definitely affected India’s goal to end TB by 2025,” she said. The pandemic, however, offered many lessons and forged collaborations with the private sector that can be used to find innovative solutions to help the country stick to its target of eliminating the bacterial infection, she said. “There were a lot of innovations to address the challenges of Covid-19. Many of these innovations can be used for TB such as novel testing methods, contact tracing apps, creation of vaccine trial sites. The private sector also stepped up for manufacturing. These might help India in bringing the programme back on track,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-could-see-1-million-additional-tb-cases-due-to-malnutrition-after-pandemic/story-go2Kg1K50FhyOUF76yNhqK.html
05-01-2021||India||Extreme weather killed at least 2,000 people in India in 2020: IMD||India experienced some extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, thunderstorm, lightning, and cold waves that killed at least 2,000 people in 2020 according to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) statement on climate of India in 2020.Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were the most affected states during the year with over 350 deaths in each state due to thunderstorm, lightning and cold wave. Heavy rainfall and floods claimed over 600 lives from different parts of the country during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Thunderstorms and lightning also claimed over 815 lives in different parts of the country. Last year, five cyclones formed over the North Indian Ocean. Super cyclonic storm Amphan formed in the pre-monsoon season and crossed the West Bengal coast over Sunderbans on May 20. It claimed 90 lives and about 4,000 livestock, mainly in West Bengal. Last year was the eighth warmest since India started keeping records in 1991, according to the statement.During the year, the annual average temperature in the country was 0.29 degree Celsius (°C) above normal ( 29-year average from 1981-2010), said the report which looks at temperature and rainfall trends annually. Such temperature trends were reported despite the cooling effect of La Nina, a global weather pattern that prevailed in 2020 and is linked to substantially below normal temperatures in winter. In 2016, India recorded the warmest year when the mean land surface temperature was 0.71°C above normal. In 2020, the temperature during the pre-monsoon season was below normal by 0.03°C. But both monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were 0.43°C and 0.53°C above normal, respectively, and that contributed to warming. The mean temperature during winter was 0.14°C above normal. India’s warming was, however, significantly lower than the global average. The global mean temperature rise during 2020 (January to October, as per the World Meteorological Organisation’s State of the Global Climate) was 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels. The annual rainfall over the country was 109% of the Long Period Average (LPA) calculated for the period of 1961-2010.The IMD statement said that 12 out of the 15 warmest years were reported between 2006 and 2020, and that the past decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record. Last year, the mean monthly temperatures were warmer than the normal during all months except March and June.

The NCBS, InSTEM in Bengaluru, CDFD in Hyderabad, ILS in Bhubaneswar and NCCS in Pune have so far found no UK mutant virus, the ministry said.“A total of 38 samples have been found to be positive with the new UK variant genome,” the ministry said.It said comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others.Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on, it added.“The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG labs,” the ministry stated.The positive Covid-19 samples are being tested at 10 INSACOG labs (NIBMG Kolkata, ILS Bhubaneswar, NIV Pune, NCCS Pune, CCMB Hyderabad, CDFD Hyderabad, InSTEM Bengaluru, NIMHANS Bengaluru, IGIB Delhi and NCDC Delhi) for genome sequencing.The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.The government of India took cognizance of the reports of virus reported from the UK and put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant, it said.This strategy includes temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK with effect from the midnight of December 23 till January 7 and mandatory testing of all UK-returned air passengers through RT-PCR test. The samples of all UK returnees found positive in RT-PCR test will be genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs - INSACOG. Further, all the international passengers who have arrived in India between December 9 to 22, if symptomatic and tested positive for Covid-19, will be subjected to genome sequencing as part of the Centre’s strategy to detect the mutated UK variant in them.Others will be followed up by the respective state and district surveillance officers and will be tested as per ICMR guidelines (even if asymptomatic) between fifth and tenth day, according to the Union Health Ministry’s guidance document on genomic sequencing.Further, epidemiological surveillance of the passengers, who have arrived in India since November 23 will be conducted in the community through active follow up. Besides, standard operating protocol for states and UTs to tackle the mutant variant of SARS-CoV-2 was issued on December 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-has-38-cases-of-highly-infectious-uk-covid-19-strain-check-state-wise-list-here/story-lWgGoZP9WATPA7Iov2OgAN.html

A task force was constituted in all the districts comprising the officers of all the departments to monitor the quality of the projects in the districts, he said.In a review meeting held at his official residence on Monday, the chief minister asked the officers what the task force was doing in Ghaziabad where such an incident happened. He also pulled up the divisional commissioner, Meerut, and DM of Ghaziabad for their failure to check the quality of the construction work.“Such incidents will not be tolerated in future. Strict action will be taken against the guilty under National Security Act and seizure of property,” he said.The CM directed the divisional commissioner, Meerut and ADG, Meerut, to probe the incident and submit a report. On the basis of the report, the accountability of senior divisional and district officials will be fixed, he said. The district officers have been directed to conduct relief operations and submit a report on the incident. The state government will provide all possible help to the victims, the CM added.A state government spokesperson said those arrested include executive officer of the municipality Niharika Singh, junior engineer Chandrapal and supervisor Ashish. Contractor Ajay Tyagi, who was absconding, was arrested late last evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-warns-action-under-national-security-act-in-crematorium-case/story-zJ20ZI3N1bdW5n4VTzahmL.html

05-01-2021||India||NHRC recommends special Act against manual scavenging||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has made a series of recommendation to the Centre to eradicate manual scavenging, including bringing a new Act on “hazardous cleaning” and taking strict action against local authorities who employ people as manual scavengers. It has also asked the Centre to provide Rs10 lakh loan to manual scavengers’ family members so that they can start some business activity. Subsequently, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) should monitor the sewer deaths in its reports, it said. The NHRC said the tall claims made by states that they have no manual scavengers and zero sanitary latrines are “far from truth”. “Therefore, the Commission has recommended that accountability must be fixed in case of wrong reporting by the concerned authorities about the number of manual scavengers in any region of the country,” the NHRC said in a statement on Monday. Advocating the broadening of the definition of manual scavenging to cover other types of hazardous cleaning or enactment of a new law for it, the Commission has also recommended that a penal section may be put in law to prevent the discrimination and harassment faced by the children of manual scavengers and women manual scavengers.As part of their rehabilitation process, NHRC has recommended that manual scavengers may be linked to schemes under which they can immediately start earning like MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) and revisit to see how their families are doing. It has further asked that amount of compensation paid as one time cash assistance for rehabilitation of manual scavengers may be enhanced from Rs40,000 to Rs1 lakh. For starting some business activity, it has asked ministry of finance to designate particular nationalised bank for each state to take up the responsibility of extending loans to manual scavengers and their dependents up to Rs10 lakh as well as provide them individual or group insurances for which premium must be paid by local authorities. “The government needs to plan adequate investment facilitating the shift to the use of technology, maintenance of technology and training the workers to operate the technology,” NHRC said. “Officer in the Supervisory level or In charge of the area should submit a declaration to the respective civic body to the effect that the required safety gears are being provided before any person enters the sewer/septic tank,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-recommends-special-act-on-manual-scavenging/story-EkbYXNe4vhLw7RzTh01wkI.html

05-01-2021||India||‘Futuristic project’: PM Modi to inaugurate Kochi-Mangaluru natural gas pipeline||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Tuesday inaugurate a natural gas pipeline from Kerala’s Kochi to Mangaluru in Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district and dedicate it to the nation virtually. The event will mark an important milestone towards the creation of ‘One Nation One Gas Grid’, an official release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.“Tomorrow, 5th January is a landmark day in India’s quest for #UrjaAatmanirbharta! At 11 AM, the Kochi - Mangaluru Natural Gas Pipeline would be dedicated to the nation. This is a futuristic project that will positively impact many people,” PM Modi said in a tweet on Monday.The ‘futuristic project’, PM Modi said, will positively impact many people.The 450km pipeline has been built by GAIL (India) Ltd. It has a transportation capacity of 12 million metric standard cubic metres per day and will carry natural gas from the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Regasification Terminal at Kochi to Mangaluru while passing through Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod districts, the PMO release said.The inaugural event will see governors and chief ministers of Karnataka and Kerala, along with Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan in attendance. The total cost of the project was about Rs 3,000 crore and its construction created over 1.2 million man-days of employment. The PMO underlined that laying of the pipeline was an engineering challenge as the route of the pipeline necessitated it to cross water bodies at more than 100 locations. To overcome this hurdle, a special technique called the Horizontal Directional Drilling method was put to use.The pipeline will supply environment-friendly and affordable fuel in the form of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) to households and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to the transportation sector. It will also supply Natural Gas to commercial and industrial units across the districts along the pipeline. Consumption of cleaner fuel will help in improving air quality by curbing air pollution.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/futuristic-project-pm-modi-to-inaugurate-kochi-mangaluru-natural-gas-pipeline/story-VgbncnMNC3M87NqnJU8HnM.html
05-01-2021||India||The year that will be: The political battles of 2021||When the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept the Lok Sabha elections in 2014, its victory was primarily based on a staggering success ratio in India‘s north and west. But from the day it won, the party has been clear that this was the ripe moment for it to break out of the old stereotype of being seen as a Hindi heartland party — and it decided to expand, first in the east and then the south.Over the last six years, this strategy has paid dividends, especially in the east — where the party’s win in the Assam state elections of 2016 inaugurated a period of expansion across the North-east. The party also put up a robust performance in two states where it had limited presence historically — West Bengal and Odisha — which helped it cross the 300 mark in the 2019 elections. While Karnataka has been an older stronghold and there have been some recent successes at the local level in Telangana, it has — for the most part — been unable to translate this intent to expand and corresponding political investment into actual seats in other regions of the south. And that is why 2021 is key for the BJP — to retain and expand its hold in the east, and to be able to make a mark in the south.Read more| The Number Theory: A decade of rightward shift in Indian politicsFor the Opposition, this is precisely what makes the year a critical turning point. If it is able to keep the BJP out of power of two eastern states (West Bengal and Assam), and force it to remain a marginal player in the south, it will come as a shot in the arm of those opposed to the central government, limit the BJP’s growth, and retain the political balance in what is otherwise a hegemonic polity dominated by the BJP. Within the Opposition, the outcome of state polls in 2021 will also determine the balance of power between the Congress and regional parties — and all signs are that this tilt further towards the regional parties, for the Congress’s individual strength and prospects in at least two of the bigger states going to the polls (Tamil Nadu and West Bengal) is limited.But beyond the frame of party politics, the electoral battles of 2021 will also give a glimpse into the nature of identity-based politics in these regions, the tension between incumbency — where being in power has afforded an opportunity to expand power — and anti-incumbency — where being in power has generated a backlash and thus eroded power; the vocabulary of development and welfare, especially in the backdrop of a public health and economic crisis; and the key role of individual leaders in determining outcomes.In the eastThe big battle of 2021 is, of course, in West Bengal — where the Trinamool Congress, led by the formidable Mamata Banerjee, who fought for decades against the Left as a challenger, has to now defend its record. No other local leader in Bengal matches Banerjee’s brand value, her tenacity and grasp over the ground realities of the state. But while Brand Mamata is the Trinamool’s calling card — backed by welfare schemes initiated by the state government — it also now suffers from a set of weaknesses, which is being leveraged by the BJP.The Trinamool has been portrayed — due to Mamata Banerjee’s own, arguably excessive, emphasis on the Muslim vote to be able to win it over from the Left and Congress in the initial years — as a party too close to the minorities. This, in the BJP’s campaign on the ground, throws up the allegation of “politics of appeasement” against the rival on the one hand, and on the other, leads to a conscious effort to construct a Hindu vote through a set of cultural, political, and legislative measures. After her setback in the 2019 polls, Mamata Banerjee — advised by political consultant Prashant Kishor, whose trademark signature in recent campaigns has been to ask non-BJP forces to avoid the Hindu-Muslim binary — has made a conscious effort to be seen as sensitive to Hindu aspirations. For her, this is unnatural politics — though she has, in her personal beliefs, always remained a devotee of Kali. But the BJP believes that this messaging is too little and too late, and the ground in Bengal is ripe enough for a “polarised election”. The party believes that its push for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will help rally Hindu voters in bordering areas with links to the east. Its leaders are banking on constituencies with over 60% Hindus to be able to polarise the landscape and win.But it is not just the politics of identity. The BJP has steadily built its organisation in the state — aided, in no small measure, by the entry of former Trinamool heavyweights, the latest being Suvendu Adhikari. In Bengal’s politics, the key is having control of the local machines on the ground. Local election machines — loose grids populated by influential panchayat leaders and others quite comfortable with using violence to intimidate rivals and coerce voters — shifted from the Left to the Trinamool, and the big question is whether they will now move to the BJP. This history of violence also makes the election particularly sensitive, and has already seen a spate of political killings, with the Opposition being targeted.But beyond identity and organisation, the big battle in Bengal will be between Narendra Modi — who appears to enjoy a high degree of popularity in the state and, who will be the BJP’s key face in the absence of a pan-Bengal leader — and Mamata Banerjee. Modi will speak of double engine growth (of political alignment between the Centre and state), the Centre’s welfare schemes (which the BJP alleges is not being implemented on the ground), and perhaps a big promise of development package, while Banerjee will focus on Bengali sub-nationalism, the Centre’s assault on state rights, and her own achievements of the past decade.If in Bengal, the BJP has to be the challenger to win power, next door, in Assam, it is the incumbent which has to retain power. Under Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta Biswa Sarma, the party has deepened its organisational networks in the state, and will speak of infrastructure projects and welfare as its achievement. It is also aided, in no small measure, by the disarray in the Congress — with Tarun Gogoi’s death, the party lacks a towering leader, though the former chief minister’s son, Gaurav, is hoping to inherit his legacy.But the BJP’s biggest hope — and challenge — comes from the decades-old, vexed question of identity. Unlike Bengal, where there is a degree of support for CAA and opposition to National Register of Citizens (NRC), in Assam, there is opposition to CAA — which is seen as an effort to provide back-door entry to Hindu immigrants from Bangladesh — and ambivalence towards NRC — it is viewed as the first step to identifying citizens and outsiders, but the flawed NRC process in the state with tremendous humanitarian consequences has led to apprehensions; it has also deepened the divide between the Brahmaputra and Barak valley.How the BJP is able to reconcile these complex strands, portray itself as the party committed to indigenous interests, even as it cultivates the Bengali Hindu vote, while constructing the Muslim as the other, will be key. For the Opposition, the political task ahead will hinge on whether it is able to portray the BJP as opposed to the sentiments of the Assam Movement. The Congress has its own challenge — an understanding with Badruddin Ajmal can lead to a consolidation of the Muslim vote, but alienate the indigenous vote while the absence of an understanding can fragment the Muslim vote.The southern battlesThe stake is higher for the Opposition in the southern states, where the BJP knows its limits. As a top leader of the party said about the southern challenge: “It will take us a decade to establish ourselves firmly. We lacked a pool of leaders and were constrained by our past image of being seen as a North Indian party. The image is breaking now, and more and more leaders and workers are joining us in states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala but to build the organisation and dominate the narrative, it will take a few elections.”This does not mean that the BJP won’t unleash its shock-and-awe campaign strategies. But in Tamil Nadu, where it is still viewed with a degree of suspicion for its attachment to the Hindi language and its perceived opposition to the Dravidian movement, it is primarily relying on its understanding with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), especially with actor Rajinikanth quitting politics even before entering the electoral fray. The challenge for the AIADMK is that it is fighting its first state election without J Jayalalithaa — and it has been in power for two terms, leading to strong anti-incumbency. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), too, is fighting its first election after the death of M Karunanidhi, and undergoing a generational transition with MK Stalin as the face. And while it does face its own factional struggles, and tussle over potential seat sharing, the DMK-led alliance, which includes the Congress, starts out as the favourite.In Kerala, the contest will be fundamentally bipolar between the Left Front and the Congress-led alliance. The state has had a pattern of alternating between governments led by the two formations (much like Rajasthan in the north, which shuffles between the Congress and the BJP). But the success of the Left front in recent local elections has thrown up the possibility of this cycle breaking. This will be a high stakes election because Rahul Gandhi, as the member of Parliament from Wayanad, can be expected to invest substantially in the Congress campaign – but despite his proximity to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leadership in Delhi, he will have to face a tough incumbent in the form of Pinarayi Vijayan, who has developed a reputation for delivery. The BJP has been making efforts to crack open the Kerala political matrix — but has had limited success and can be expected to be a distant third, primarily due to the demography of the state (it has a substantial presence of both Muslims and Christians), entrenched political loyalties, and weak organisation (ironically, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s strength in the state hasn’t translated into political advantage for the BJP.)By the middle of next year, the political complexion of some of India’s most crucial political states will be clear. If the BJP wins Bengal and Assam and manages to retain influence over the Tamil Nadu government, it will be one more step towards its expansion — and, potentially, a more centralised Indian polity. If the Trinamool is able to retain Bengal, the BJP is pushed out of Assam, the DMK-led alliance wins Tamil Nadu, and irrespective of whether the victor in Kerala is the Left or the Congress, the political message will be the continued strength of regional forces in states against the BJP’s dominance — and, potentially, an assertion of states against the Centre. 2021’s message will last till 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-year-that-will-be-the-political-battles-of-2021/story-AihtUmKgmGmlUWoylpjCLK.html
05-01-2021||India||Centre may bring natural gas within the GST ambit||The Union government, which is planning a major policy push to raise the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix from the current level of 6.2% to 15% by 2030, is considering a proposal to bring natural gas within the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) -- a move that will make it cheaper for both industrial and domestic use, two officials aware of the matter said.Levies on natural gas vary from state to state, ranging as high as 24%, a major deterrent to making it a people’s fuel.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas (MoPNG) has proposed to bring natural gas under GST to have a uniform tax rate across the country. The matter is under consideration, the officials said, requesting anonymity.Petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor confirmed the development. “There is a demand from the industry [to impose GST on natural gas], which is also supported by the MoPNG. But, then it has to go to the GST Council,” he said, referring to the GST body comprising state and central representatives.The two officials mentioned above said gas transportation and state-specific value added tax (VAT) on natural gas are two major components that make natural gas costly. Gas, which is bought at the cost of $1-1.5 million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) and has a landed cost of around $3 per unit, becomes $8 per unit for customers, they said. Petroleum products such as crude, diesel, petrol, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) are awaiting the GST Council’s approval to be included under the GST net. As these products are major revenue earners for some states, they want their individual freedom to levy VAT as per their financial requirements.DK Srivastava, chief policy adviser at consultancy firm EY India, said all petroleum products should eventually be brought under the GST regime so that input taxation on these products can be neutralised. “While other products may wait, natural gas can be brought within the GST regime without any significant revenue loss for states and the central government since, currently, it is being taxed at relatively low levels, although rates differ across states and between the Centre and states,” he said. The central excise on natural gas is 14%, while VAT rates vary from 3% to 24% from state to state, the officials mentioned above said. One of the officials said, “The matter has come up during recent pre-budget discussions and a proposal to have GST on natural gas could be placed before the GST Council after stakeholders’ consultations.” The council is the apex federal body on GST matters and it is chaired by the Union finance minister. Its members are finance ministers of states and Union territories. The council’s decisions are often unanimous.Speaking at an industry event on December 17, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that India was “ushering a gas-based economy by increasing the share of natural gas” in its primary energy mix in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “one nation, one gas grid”. PM Modi on Tuesday will inaugurate the 450-km Kochi-Mangaluru natural gas pipeline that will eventually provide clean gas to industrial and domestic consumers of Kochi, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur, Kasaragod and Mangaluru districts, the officials said.“There is immense potential for PNG (piped natural gas) connections as there are 290 million liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections as against 7.5 million PNG connections. PNG is cheaper, cleaner and convenient for consumers, hence an element of policy focus that requires a uniform GST rate on natural gas,” the second official said.Sunil Kumar, chartered accountant at Taxmann -- the publisher on taxation matters -- said: “Non-inclusion of natural gas under the GST regime is adversely impacting gas producers, suppliers and industrial consumers as they are facing issue of tax cascading or tax on tax and non-availability of credits on procurements.”Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said taxes on natural gas have a cascading effect and impact both on industrial and domestic consumer rates. “This would discourage usage of gas as an energy source... Extraction of natural gas is highly capital intensive and attracting foreign investments under this sector would be critical. Hence the government should improve ease of operations for this sector to achieve its target of clean energy and development of national gas grid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-bring-natural-gas-within-the-gst-ambit/story-Kxcu7BHjhmMXbmpB5w0vPJ.html
05-01-2021||India||Supreme Court will take up an open letter on farmers as PIL||An open letter written to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) against attempts being made to paint the protesting farmers as separatists has been converted into a public interest litigation and is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court in the coming days.The letter written by 35 students of Panjab University’s Centre for Human Rights and Duties on December 2 termed the course of action initiated by the government to address the farmers’ concerns as “insensitive” and sought intervention of the court to allow them to continue with their peaceful protest.

05-01-2021||India||The number theory: Imagining India, 10 years from now||Because of the massive disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, most of 2020 was spent tracking very short-term statistics; from daily tests and new cases to monthly, even weekly indicators of economic activity. Important as they were and continue to be, the beginning of a New Year is an opportune time to take a long-term view of what India will be like 10 years from now. Here are five charts that can help give us an idea.1. India will be the most populous country in the worldAccording to the World Bank’s projections, India will overtake China to become the most populous country in 2023, when its population will reach 1.42 billion. The United States will continue to be the third most populated country in this decade. There were 1.21 billion people in India according to the 2011 census and there is still uncertainty about whether or not the 2021 census will be completed on time. China’s population will hit a peak of 1.425 billion in 2030 and start declining after that. Most countries experience this phenomenon as fertility rates fall below replacement levels. It will take at least until 2048 for India’s population to start declining after peaking at around 1.6 billion, according to estimates published by The Lancet.  2. This is the last decade to make the best use of demographic dividend in IndiaContrary to what is often believed, a large population need not be an economic liability for nations. Countries with a high share of the working-age population – this is not a permanent phenomenon – also have more earning hands. If one takes 20-59 year olds as working-age population, its share in India’s total population will almost peak by the end of this decade. India’s working-age group population is projected to increase from 55.8% this year to 58.8% by 2031. This equals a growth of nearly 97 million people in the workforce, which means the country needs to create employment opportunities for a large number of people. The population of elderly is also projected to increase by 2 million, creating the need for social security measures to support the rising elderly population. To be sure, the growth in the working-age group population will not be the same across states and Union territories. States like Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh are projected to record the highest rise in working-age group population this decade (it will increase by 23% in these three states combined). On the contrary, the three southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are projected to record the lowest growth in this population (2.5% combined). This mismatch will mean that northern states will see a very high share of people looking for jobs, compared to those in the south, which may lead to a an increase in north-to-south migration for work. 3. Structure of political representation could veer away from federalismThe uneven growth in population in the northern and southern states will also have political consequences. The current state-wise distribution of parliamentary seats is based on the 1971 census. With the growing gap in the state-wise population, this distribution puts more voters per seat in some states than others. For example, if the latest (2020) electoral roll data is used, Tamil Nadu has 1.56 million voters per Lok Sabha member. This number is 1.8 million for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. There is a constitutional freeze on the number of Lok Sabha seats from each state up to 2026. The next delimitation may not be conducted until the 2031 Census is completed. This means that the state-wise asymmetry in population will continue to increase. To be sure, there is another view to this story as well, which believes that a simple redistribution of seats by current population levels will penalise the states that have done well to bring down their population growth. Either way, the resolution will put India’s federal structure through a big test. 4. Consequences of climate crisis will make their presence feltIndia’s first climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), published in 2020. said that the climate change seen in the country since the middle of the 20th century is expected to continue in the future. For example, average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901-2018, according to the assessment. By the end of the 21st century (2070-2099), this is expected to rise by around 4.4 degrees Celsius compared to the recent past (1976-2005). The frequency of summer (April-June) heat waves is also projected to increase 3-4 times. While monsoon precipitation (rainfall) has declined, there are more frequent dry spells and more intense wet spells, according to the report. According to a paper published by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, last year (https://bit.ly/34WQLJ5) while rainfall of higher intensity will increase all over India, the degree of increase will be more in the south Indian region compared to north and central India by the end of the century. According to a 2018 World Bank report, a large part of South Asia would be climate hotspots – where changes in temperature and rainfall affect living standards adversely – by 2030. 5. How well will India’s economy grow?Thanks to the disruption caused by the pandemic, the Indian economy will witness its first contraction in 41 years in 2020-21. If the 2020-21 gross domestic product (GDP) were to contract by 7.5% (the Reserve Bank of India estimate), 2010-11 to 2020-21 will see the lowest decadal growth in India’s GDP since the 1980s. There are divergent views on the prospects of the Indian economy going forward. The government and a section of economists see a rapid revival in economic activity. Others see a long-term loss of momentum. For example, Oxford economists expect potential growth for Indian economy at 4.5% over the next five years (till 2025) which is lower than 6.5% projected before the viral outbreak. Whether or not the Indian economy can rediscover its mojo will determine how the country deals with the challenges and opportunities presented by a high share of the working-age population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-number-theory-imagining-india-10-years-from-now/story-G7aIUgKlehi1yewcG4rOOJ.html
05-01-2021||India||India’s vaccine jabs may start next week: Officials||With regulatory approvals granted to two coronavirus vaccines, the Centre has initiated the process of procurement, top government officials said on Monday, and the vaccination drive could begin by end of next week in a phased manner.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the world’s biggest inoculation drive against coronavirus is set to begin in the country, lauding scientists and technicians for the “Made in India” vaccines.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Sunday announced that it had approved both the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine being manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Bharat Biotech International Limited’s locally developed vaccine candidate, Covaxin. Covaxin has been recommended for restricted use in “emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution”, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccination. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria said Bharat Biotech’s vaccine has been given approval only as a backup.“Now that the approvals have been granted, the next step is to initiate the procurement process. The Centre is now looking at striking the purchase deals with the companies concerned. About 50-60 million doses are likely to be procured in batches considering India is looking at vaccinating about 30 million people in the initial phase,” a government official aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity.Read more| After Covishield and Covaxin, these are other Covid-19 vaccine candidates in IndiaAccording to the official, the government is in talks with both companies whose vaccines have been approved. DCGI has accepted recommendations made by a subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to grant restricted emergency approval to the two vaccines.“The paperwork tends to take some time but arrangements are being made to sign the deal as quickly as possible so that the vaccination drive can soon be kick-started. Dry runs have already been successfully conducted across the country without any major glitches. The digital platform, CoWIN, meant to be used for vaccine delivery is good to go as minor modifications that were needed have been already made,” the official added.SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla has said his firm offered a special price of ₹200 in writing to the Indian government for first 100 million doses. According to the official cited above, the first batch is likely to be taken from SII at the offered price.Addressing scientists at the National Metrology Conclave, Modi said: “World’s biggest Covid-19 vaccination programme set to begin in India. For this, the country is proud of the contributions of its scientists and technicians.” “Quality is as much important as quantity, our standards should rise with our scale in our quest for Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” he said.Read more| 68 UK returnees found Covid positive in Maharashtra but not with new strainAs per a decision taken earlier by experts in the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19, the Centre has decided to directly procure the vaccine supplies that it will distribute among states as per their requirement.Once the deals are formally signed with the companies, and vaccine doses are procured, the supplies will be deployed in 31 main hubs by the Centre that it has created in different regions across the country.“From these 31 main hubs, the supplies will eventually move to 29,000 locally created vaccination points in different states from where state governments will pick up the supplies to be given under the public vaccination initiative. These vaccination points can further be increased if there is a need to add more based on the vaccine requirement,” said another official, asking not to be named.“Everything is in the advanced stages of preparedness and the immediate phase of vaccination will begin with health care workers in the country, and the current supplies of the vaccine that are available in the country are enough to meet the country’s demand for Covid-19 vaccines,” the official added.As per government estimates, there are about 10 million health care workers who are in the priority list to be given the jab immediately as part of the first phase of the vaccination exercise, to be followed by about 20 million frontline workers who are involved in managing the pandemic in the country.Read more| ‘Big salute to doctors and frontline workers’: BMC chief after Mumbai records 3 Covid-19 deaths“These two categories are on the immediate list as these are directly involved in managing the Covid-19 crisis. The drive will start with the health care workers though. More categories could be added depending on the availability of the vaccine. For now, the categories that have been broadly defined will get priority,” the official said.Helplines are being set up at the national and state level to address any queries related to the vaccine or software in use. While the national helpline, 1075, is being upgraded, the states are also augmenting their helpline 104 for the purpose of addressing related queries.The states have already been training vaccine administrators and also preparing details of the beneficiaries. Around 150,000 vaccinators have been trained so far, covering over 700 districts.In all, the government has estimated 300 million people who are at high risk of developing severe illness because of their profession, age and co-morbidities, and will be given vaccine shots in the initial phases. The group includes health care workers, frontline workers, and population at high risk of getting severe Covid-19.Of the 300 million vulnerable population, approximately 10 million are health care workers both in government and private setups (including integrated child development services workers), and about 20 million are frontline workers. Health care workers have been divided into nine sub-categories. The first category is of frontline health and ICDS workers such as accredited social health activist (ASHA), auxiliary nurse midwife, multipurpose health worker, ASHA facilitators, anganwadi worker (AWW) and AWW sahayika.The second category is of nurses and supervisors that include staff nurse, public health nurse, lady health visitor, community health officer, child development project officer, chief medical and health officer, district women and child development officer and designated institutional official.Another category is of medical officers that consists of allopathic doctors, Ayush doctors, dentists, including those on administrative posts, and paramedical staff including lab and operation theatre technicians, pharmacists, physiotherapists radiographers, nursing orderlies, ward boys, etc. Medical, dental, nursing and paramedical students are also part of the health care staff to be given priority, apart from scientists and research staff, clerical and administrative staff, and support staff such as drivers, security workers and sanitation workers.Frontline workers comprise personnel from state and central police departments, armed forces, home guards, prison staff, disaster management volunteers and civil defence organisations, municipal workers and revenue officials engaged in Covid-19 containment, and surveillance and associated activities. About 270 million people are in the high-risk population group that includes 260 million people above the age of 50, and around 10 million people below 50 years with comorbidities such as chronic diabetes and hypertension, cancer, lung diseases, etc.The age of a beneficiary for vaccination will be considered as on January 1, 2021. Anyone born on or before January 1, 1971 will fall under this category, and the high-risk population group will be further sub-categorised into various age groups with priority to senior citizens above 60 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-vaccine-jabs-may-start-next-week-officials/story-waj4naluYtTeW0j0ONGYNL.html
05-01-2021||India||Srinagar encounter: Slain youths’ kin stage protest, demand bodies, fair probe||The families of two of three youths who were killed in an encounter with security forces on December 30 protested in Srinagar on Monday demanding their bodies and impartial investigation into the matter.While the army and police have maintained that they were militants, the youths’ families have vouched for their innocence.The police also released purported videos of the cordoned house where the trio – Zubair Ahmad of Turkawangam, Shopian; Ajaz Maqbool and Athar Mushtaq of Putrigam, Pulwama – was killed in Hokersar-Lawaypora, Srinagar. The security forced had claimed that the youths were repeatedly asked to surrender on the night of December 29 and December 30 morning.Athar and Zubair’s family members converged at Press Colony here carrying banners “Stop innocents killings” and “We want complete investigation”. The protestors, including elderly and women, shouted slogans demanding justice.“He had bullets in his chest. The mothers and sisters of soldiers congratulated them for shooting terrorists, but he was just a 16-year-old child,” wailed Mushtaq Ahmad, Athar’s father.“Are the soldiers happy snatching a piece of my heart? You (security forces) killed my son to feed your children. Shame on you,” he said.While the police and army have said the trio were killed in exchange of fire, their families have rebutted the claim saying they were civilians. Athar was a Class 11 student, Aijaz was pursuing graduation while Zubair was a skilled worker, according to their families.Mushtaq said he wanted justice. “I don’t want money. I just want the body of my son,” he said.“He lies buried there in the snow (in Ganderbal). Whom should I tell? Aren’t people of India listening? I want to tell people of the world that I want justice. I want my son, he is just 16. Either give me my son or bury me there,” he demanded.As part of the protocol, the authorities have been burying the bodies of militants far away from their homes only allowing a few family members to be part of the burial arranged by police. The trio killed on December 30 was taken to Ganderbal, some 110 km from Pulwama, for burial.Police release videos of surrender appeal The police on Monday released two videos of the surrounded house purportedly showing forces asking those inside to surrender. “On 29/12/20 evening after the cordon at Hokersar, troops are repeatedly appealing the trapped terrorists to come out and surrender with assurances that they will not be harmed,” Kashmir police said in a tweet.“At Hokersar on 30/12/2020 in the morning hours, troops are once again appealing the trapped terrorists to come out in the ground and surrender before them,” it said in another tweet with a video.Politicos seek speedy investigation Meanwhile, political parties in Kashmir have asked for probe into the encounter after families’ claims.National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah on Monday asked L-G Manoj Sinha to hand over the bodies. “The L-G has promised a fair and speedy probe in to this encounter when JKNC Lok Sabha member Hansain Masoodi spoke to him about it recently. In the interim, we hope the L-G will order the handing over of the bodies to the families,” he said in a tweet.However, police have said that as per their checks Aijaz and Athar were overground workers (OGWs) of militants.“Background checks also reveal that Aijaz and Athar, both OGWs variously provided logistic support to terrorists. Antecedents and verifications too show that both were radically inclined and had aided terrorists of LeT (now so-called TRF) outfit,” police have said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srinagar-encounter-slain-youths-kin-stage-protest-demand-bodies-fair-probe/story-vL8YsvKQUSA18sa0uxXUsN.html
05-01-2021||India||SC gives govt a week to delete provision on confiscation of livestock||Finding that a rule that empowered the magistrate to confiscate livestock even before a conviction was received under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act (1960) ran contrary to the very law itself, the Supreme Court Monday gave the Centre a week to delete the provision or be prepared for a stay order on the rules.The Centre introduced two rules in 2017 — the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Market) Rules — and notified them in May 2018. Delhi-based Buffalo Traders Welfare Association, which espouses the cause of cattle traders, farmers, butchers, and agriculturists, challenged the former rule in the apex court in May 2019.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said, “Section 29 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), 1960 is very clear. Only a person who is convicted can lose his animals. Either you amend your laws or else we will stay it. We cannot countenance rules which run contrary to the parent act.”The bench, which also comprised Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “People live on the strength of their animals. You cannot confiscate and keep the animals till they (accused) are convicted.”Both rules were challenged in July 2017 by the All India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee. At the time, the Centre informed the top court that the rules would be amended and re-notified. Thus the petition was disposed of and the Supreme Court directed the Centre to hear the stakeholders before re-notitying the amended rules. However, the new petitioners said that they were not aware of any fresh notification.In its petition, the association stated that certain groups, emboldened by the rules, took the law into their hands and looted livestock. The petition filed by advocate Rajnish Kumar Jha stated, “Transporters, cattle traders and farmers are facing threats due to anti-social elements taking law in their own hands. This resulted in looting of the animals….These incidents are acting as triggers for communal polarisation of the society, and if not halted effectively and immediately, will have disastrous consequences on the social fabric of the country.”There has been a rash of attacks on cattle traders by cow protection groups with right wing political affiliations for allegedly transporting livestock for the purposes of slaughter. It is illegal to slaughter cows across the country, and a handful of states have passed laws to protect different types of cattle from slaughter. In May 2017, the Centre imposed a ban on the sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter at animal markets across India under PCA statutes but the Supreme Court suspended the ban shortly after giving relief to beef and leather industries.The Court issued a notice on the petition and sought a response from the Centre in July 2019; in August 2020, it enquired whether the rule in question was notified. On Monday, the petition came up for hearing again and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Jayant Sud appearing for the Centre informed the court that the rules were notified in 2018.The ASG said that he was prepared to share evidence of cruelty that had been meted out to the cattle seized under the rules. Senior advocate Sanjay Hedge appearing for the petitioner pointed out that the newly notified rule empowered a magistrate to direct the confiscated animal to be housed in an infirmary, animal welfare organisation or gaushala (cow shed) during the pendency of the litigation. This was contrary to Section 29 of the 1960 act, he said.Section 29 states, “If the owner of any animal is found guilty of any offence under this Act. the court upon his conviction thereof, may, if it thinks fit, in addition to any other punishment make an order that the animal with respect to which the offence was committed shall be forfeited to Government..”However, Rule 3 of the 2017 rule in question empowered the Magistrate to direct the animal to be confiscated and housed at an infirmary, Animal Welfare Organization or Gaushala during the pendency of the litigation even before the person got convicted.Sud sought a week’s time to file a response based on the Court’s observations. The matter will be taken up again on January 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-govt-a-week-to-delete-provision-on-confiscation-of-livestock/story-u5F5nufsPHtSU78ZhuQUbO.html
05-01-2021||India||Political row erupts over TDP leader’s murder||Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader and the former sarpanch of Pedagarlapadu village, 55-year-old Puramsetti Ankulu, was killed in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district late on Sunday night, sparking a political row with the TDP accusing the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) of perpetrating political violence in the state. Ankulu is the second TDP leader to be murdered in a week; a district spokesperson, Nandam Subbaiah, was killed in Proddaturu village in Kadapa soon after posting comments on social media about alleged irregularities in the state government’s house sites distribution programme. The YRSCP has denied a role in both deaths.According to police, Ankulu’s body was found late Sunday night at an under-construction site in Dachepalli town with multiple stab wounds and a slit throat. The superintendent of police for Guntur (rural), Vishal Gunni, said that three special teams have been formed for a probe in the case. “We are inquiring into all angles in the murder, including factional violence and financial disputes between Ankulu and others,” Gunni said. He said the preliminary investigation revealed that four people may be involved in the murder. “It came to our notice that in the past, too, Ankulu escaped a murder attempt. We are yet to trace his mobile phone, which can provide vital clues,” the SP said. A case of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been filed.Ankulu’s family members said in their police complaint that he received a phone call at around 7pm on Sunday, and left home to meet someone. The callers may be involved in the murder, the family alleged.On Monday, TDP members assembled at the spot of the murder and raised slogans against the YSRCP. “It is a cold-blooded murder by YSRCP leaders,” former TDP legislator Yarapathineni Srinivasa Rao said. The party’s general secretary Nara Lokesh, who attended Ankulu’s funeral on Monday afternoon, said there was a lack of policing in the state. “It looks like there is no police system to protect the lives of the people in Andhra Pradesh. Opposition leaders are under constant threat to their lives under this faction-driven, heartless government,” he said.Condemning the murder, TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu also alleged that the YSRCP was indulging in “murder politics” against the Opposition. Naidu said that over “16 TDP leaders” have been killed in the last 19 months of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s rule. “The murder of Subbaiah in Proddaturu and Ankulu in Dachepalli holds a mirror to the criminal intolerance of the YSRCP leaders, who are not able to digest the reality when Opposition leaders question the government’s failures, corruption and negligence,” Naidu said in a statement. The YSRCP, however, dismissed the allegations. “Our party has nothing to do with the murder of Ankulu. TDP leaders are making baseless allegations only for political gains. We have asked Director General of Police Gautam Sawang to make an impartial inquiry into the murder,” the party’s Gurajala legislator Mahesh Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-row-erupts-over-tdp-leader-s-murder/story-APegT3VM5NcvqvKLEdWmfI.html

05-01-2021||India||Reliance moves HC against vandalism of telecom towers||The Punjab and Haryana high court will on Tuesday hear a petition by Reliance Jio for taking action against miscreants damaging its network infrastructure and other commercial properties in Punjab.Reliance Jio, in its petition, has maintained that its parent company, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), or any retail arm or affiliates have “no interest and does not intend in future to do corporate or contract farming” while alleging that business rivals with vested interests are taking advantage of the ongoing farmers’ protests.In its petition, the Mukesh Ambani-led RIL has also emphasised that the conglomerate and its retail arms have not purchased any agricultural land directly or indirectly for the purpose of farming.Underscoring that Jio and RIL have greatest regard for the hard work of the farmers, the petition added that RIL affiliates have never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain “unfair advantage over” farmers or their produce.Read more| Farm talks fail again, Centre says no repealReliance Jio Infocomm filed this petition on Monday, and requested for an urgent direction to the government authorities in the state and at the Centre to protect its communication infrastructure as well as ensure safety of its employees.The firm’s counsel, Ashish Chopra said that the high court agreed to list their petition for a hearing on Tuesday.The petition has stated that 1,500 telecom towers operated by Reliance Jio were vandalised and rendered inoperative, crippling the mobile network in Punjab, where the telecom company has 14 million subscribers. While the subscribers are compelled to port to other networks, the plea said, the acts of vandalism have also endangered lives of thousands of its employees. The plea claims it has been has been targeted in Punjab, as those with “vested interests” are taking advantage of the farmers’ agitation against the recently enacted contentious agricultural laws.The petition demands that state be directed to take steps to prevent further damage to its infrastructure and take action against the miscreants and vested interests, who caused destruction.Read more| ‘No ghar wapasi’: Farmer leader vows to keep protesting till farm laws are repealedJio also seeks appointment of a competent authority to assess the damages to be recovered from the miscreants in terms of a judgment by the Supreme Court, which laid down that rioters must be made to pay for destruction of public or private properties. “The destruction has been done in a well orchestrated manner, which is result of a sustained disinformation campaign being carried out by vested interests,” stated the plea, demanding that adequate security arrangements be made to stop vandalism of its infrastructure. Telecom infra owned by the company has been targeted in parts of Punjab by protesters who have alleged that the contentious new farm laws are meant to benefit certain corporate houses at the cost of ordinary farmers. The laws change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reliance-moves-hc-against-vandalism-of-telecom-towers/story-MW8XQFBr6FUhhMzvhMkD2I.html
05-01-2021||India||Media reporting on charge sheet, my lawyer is yet to get it: Umar Khalid tells court||Former JNU student Umar Khalid, arrested in connection to his alleged role in the conspiracy leading to communal riots in north-east Delhi, told a Delhi court on Monday that a “vicious media campaign” against him is affecting his right to free and fair trial, while stating that even though a supplementary charge sheet filed against him was all over the media, the police are yet to supply a copy of the same to his lawyer. Khalid, who was produced from the Tihar jail complex through video conferencing, told chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar that the supplementary charge sheet in the riots filed by the police on December 26 is all over the news reports and sought directions to the investigating officer to find out as to how the media got the charge sheet even before an accused named in it. “An obvious pattern of selected disclosures statements being leaked” is affecting his right to free trial, he said. Contradicting news reports that quoted the supplementary charge sheet, Khalid also told the court that he had not signed any statements admitting his role in the riots.Read more| One year since violence in JNU, no arrests yetKhalid’s counsel also said that the media is not sticking to its code of ethics and has been missing an important word “alleged” in the news reports. The court after hearing brief arguments posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.According to the charge sheet, Khalid has been arrested for fuelling riots at the Khajuri Khas area in February last year. Suspended AAP councilor Tahir Hussain and United Against Hate (UAH), an NGO, leader Khalid Saifi are also co-accused in this case.Hearing pleas by several others accused in riots cases, CMM Dinesh Kumar on December 24, had directed the police to supply the copy of the charge sheet to the accused before the next date of hearing. The magistrate is slated to hear the case on January 7. “It has been noticed that the IOs of various cases are not supplying the copies to the accused persons despite directions of the court within time which is resulting in delay in committal of various cases to the sessions court for further proceedings in the matter. Therefore, copy of this order be sent to DCP, north-east, to issue a direction to IOs in all the police stations to supply the copy of charge sheet to the accused persons well within time before next date of hearing,” Kumar said in the order on December 24.He had also sought a report as to why the charge sheet was not supplied on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/media-reporting-on-charge-sheet-my-lawyer-is-yet-to-get-it-umar-khalid-tells-court/story-0NKr4kwrxFh2DkAYqL4ORO.html
05-01-2021||India||One year since violence in JNU, no arrests yet||On January 5, 2020, at around 6:30 pm, Aishe Ghosh was walking towards her hostel after attending a march organised against the hike in hostel fees at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus when a mob attacked her. Her head was smashed with a rod, and her left arm was fractured. Soon, a photo of her blood-smeared face and a video of the attack went viral on the social media, sparking horror, condemnation and outrage. While the mob was running amok on campus, beating up students, teachers, targeting hostellers and breaking furniture, a contingent of police was waiting outside the main campus gate, called the North Gate. Later, senior police officers had said that they did not go in because they did not have the permission from the vice-chancellor -- a stand which attracted widespread criticism.A case was registered under sections of rioting, unlawful assembly, rioting with deadly weapons, and a section of the prevention of damage to property act against unknown persons at the Vasant Kunj North police station. The case was transferred to the crime branch later.Five days after the attack, at a press conference, the police released photographs of nine students, including Ghosh, saying they were involved in violence. However, an unidentified woman who was seen with the attackers in the video was not there in the police list. She was later identified as Komal Sharma -- apparently a student of Daulat Ram College in Delhi University. She was allegedly linked to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) but could not be traced for several months.She was eventually called to record her statement, according to police.Siddhardh Yadav, state secretary ABVP (Delhi), said, “We have an active member named Komal Sharma but she is not the one who was seen in those pictures shared on social media. ABVP has been very clear about this from the beginning. We also want the person who was there among the mob to be identified and questioned.” Read more| Media reporting on charge sheet, my lawyer is yet to get it: Umar Khalid tells courtThe police refused to share Sharma’s details. Authorities and students in Daulat Ram College also provided no details about her. The police claim to have met over 35-40 witnesses, recorded their statement and questioned more than 70 persons, including Sharma. Till date, however, not a single person has been arrested in connection with the violence on the campus.Special commissioner of police (crime) Praveer Ranjan said, “Three cases pertaining to last year’s violence in JNU are being probed by the crime branch. The investigation in all the three cases is in progress.”TENSION WAS BUILDING UPTension was mounting on campus with the Left and Right leaning student outfits sparring over the boycott of semester registration as a part of the protest against a hike in the hostel fees. While the Left outfits were demanding a boycott, the Right wing groups were demanding that the registration process must be continued. According to teachers and students, skirmishes were going on between the two groups. On January 5, a group of students and teachers had organised a march at the T-point near Sabarmati hostel when a mob, armed with hammers, sticks, and rods and wearing face masks, allegedly attacked them. The mob broke into several hostels, including Periyar and Sabarmati, and beat up the students. It also damaged several motorcycles parked outside Sabarmati Hostel. The attackers smashed the main glass door before proceeding towards different rooms and throwing stones inside. Several students said they had to put beds against their hostel-room doors to protect themselves; some jumped from the balconies to escape. In August, three JNU professors who were injured in the January 5 attack had moved the Delhi high court, claiming that the attacks were “premeditated” and “coordinated”, planning for which had been done on various WhatsApp groups.Two such groups - Friends of RSS and Unity against Left - were used to mobilise the protesters, the professors had said in their petition.The police had claimed that Aishe Ghosh was herself part of the mob that attacked “specific rooms” in Periyar hostel and released a blurred video grab of a woman whom they claimed was Ghosh, standing with some masked men and women.Ghosh, a member of Students Federation of India (SFI), refuted the allegation. “I had gone to check what was happening after I heard that there was something going on in Periyar hostel. The allegations that I led the mob are baseless. I was looking for the security guard at Periyar Hostel and no one was present, and the guard also was missing,”she said.Read more| Delhi riots: Govt sanctions sedition charges against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, othersThe incident, which took place 21 days after the police action against anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest on Jamia Millia Islamia campus, made headlines nationwide. Bollywood A-lister Deepika Padukone made a brief appearance at a press conference organised by the Left-leaning students on the campus, on January 8, where Ghosh, JNU students union president, blamed the university administration of a witch-hunt. SHODDY POLICE PROBESurya Prakash, a resident of Sabarmati Hostel and now a PhD scholar, who is visually challenged, was among those who were attacked by the mob that day. He said he had given an application to get an FIR registered but even a year later, is yet to hear from the police. Though no senior officer authorised to speak to the media on the case developments responded to HT’s queries despite repeated calls and text messages, some investigators in the crime branch said on condition of anonymity that there was little or no headway in the case. “We sent the photographs and videos to the forensic science laboratory. The result is awaited. Because of the lockdown, many such videos are pending forensic examination. The case involved students so we do not act until we have strong evidence,” said a mid-level officer.According to doctors at the AIIMS Trauma Centre, 35 injured were brought for treatment. Nearly half of them were from Sabarmati hostel. “I received no calls from the police for any investigation into the case. It has been a year and yet there has been no conclusion in the matter so far. I don’t even hope for any kind of justice,” said Surya Prakash, who alleged that the mob broke into his room and thrashed him.Another postgraduate student and a resident of Sabarmati hostel, who recorded a video of the time when the mob went on the rampage at her hostel premises, said, “We came out of the room on hearing the commotion and saw the mob charging towards the girls’ wing. We soon gathered and made a human chain. I started making a video and was attacked with stones. I have written multiple times to the police and the administration but there has been no response.”She alleged that the administration did not even repair the damage caused during the violence. “Some teachers pooled in money and got the window panes changed. Otherwise, the administration has not fixed anything as of now,” she alleged.Read more| Delhi riots: Kalita trying to create narrative to implicate Kapil Mishra, say policeJNU PANEL MADE LITTLE PROGRESSJNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar constituted a five-member committee to probe the violence. HT spoke to several students from both Left- and the Right-leaning groups, and to several teachers -- they all said they have never been contacted by the committee to record their statement.Satish Chandra Yadav, general secretary of the students’ union and a member of All India Students Association (AISA), said he was also injured in the attack. “We do not know about the existence of the internal inquiry committee,” he said. Several other students had the same response. Shivam Chaurasiya, a PhD scholar and president of ABVP’s JNU unit, said that he was attacked by the mob near Periyar hostel. “At least 20-25 ABVP members got injured in the violence. We did record our statements with the police but we do not know about any other inquiry committee. We have on Monday written to the administration asking it to tell us what it’s done so far to probe the matter,” he said. Aishe Ghosh  said, “The administration has never ever contacted me to ask if I was alright even as my images and videos were all over the news and social media. Justice has been denied to us at every stage and if this gets normalised students won’t feel comfortable coming to the JNU campus. We do not want this to get erased from the public memory before justice is delivered.”TEACHERS RECALL HORRORShukla Sawant, a professor at the School of Arts and Aesthetics, was among those who first saw the mob moving towards the gathering at Sabarmati T-point. She alleged that she was attacked with lathis and stones, suffering injuries on her back and head. “It was mayhem. I could not believe my eyes. The masked mob was smashing and breaking the vehicles, and beating students and teachers with sticks, rods and stones... It’s been very traumatic. It’s taken away everybody’s mental space. There were several WhatsApp groups clearly mentioning the names of several people but nothing has been done as of now,” she said. Sucharita Sen, a professor at the School of Social Sciences, who was attacked at the same spot, and received injuries on her head, said she felt hesitant to go to her workplace for some time after the incident. “I was hit by a stone. I was bleeding when a colleague and a student tried to take me to the hospital on a two-wheeler. But we were not allowed to pass through the main gate. We had to go back to the campus. They shifted me to the university ambulance and was taken to the hospital through another gate. The police were right there and they looked away,” she said. Sen, 58, said that the only time police had met her was when they recorded her statement, two months after the incident. “There has been no follow up after that. The administration did not even acknowledge my representations sent via emails during this period. I had even moved a Delhi court, seeking registration of an FIR but nothing happened. I have no hope for justice now,” she said. Former JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) member Bikramaditya Choudhary, whose wife was chased by the mob armed with sticks and rods, near faculty housing complex, said, “She had submitted a video to the police and had written five times to them but nobody approached us. She is still traumatised by the incident and feels wary while stepping out. The behaviour of the administration shows that it colluded with the perpetrators.” PROVIDED SUPPORT, SAYS ADMIN Despite several attempts, vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar did not respond to calls and messages for a response. JNU registrar Pramod Kumar said all possible support was provided to the students and teachers. “The university had provided ambulances and medical aid to students and teachers injured in that unfortunate incident. The representatives of the administration had also visited the injured in the hospital. We could not meet everyone personally but we have full-time counsellors at the campus for any psychological support for the students,” he said.On being asked why the internal inquiry committee constituted by the administration did not approach any victim or the eyewitnesses of the violence, he said, “We did not push the internal inquiry committee since a special team of police is investigating the matter. We regularly take the updates about the investigation from the police.”Kumar dismissed the allegations of the administration being “hand-in-glove” with the attackers. “It’s equally shocking for us all...We do not want to comment on who was responsible for the violence. Let police do their work.”INACTION INDEFENSIBLE: EXPERTS A crime branch officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “We have taken the statement of all students who were caught on tape. Even the woman whose photo went viral (allegedly Komal Sharma), was summoned and her statement recorded. The investigation could not proceed thereafter because within a month riots broke out in Delhi. Also, within weeks, the lockdown was announced and the university was closed. All students from JNU and Delhi University were on leave and returned their homes.” Retired IPS officer, Prakash Singh, who served as director general of police in Uttar Pradesh and Assam, said that the lockdown did not mean police stopped doing their job. “I do not know the progress of the case. But if it is true that police have not arrested any person, it reflects poorly on the police’s conduct. Things keep on happening. This does not mean work should stop. The world has not stopped. We have not abandoned our daily chores. If there is not a single arrest, and the progress is slow, it means Delhi police is acting under some constraints. Apart from the earth’s rotation, other things are moving, maybe slow. But if police have not acted on identifying and nabbing the attackers, then it is indefensible.” Retired IPS officer, NC Asthana, who was a director general in the Kerala police, said Delhi police’s conduct in the case has been far from being professional. “Police have not been able to find who that woman (Komal Sharma) is even after a year. It is very unfortunate, also not professional. It does not inspire confidence. You have to be impartial. Let me put it this way. The conduct of the police has been far from professional.”(With inputs from Prawesh Lama and Karn Pratap Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-since-violence-in-jnu-no-arrests-yet/story-qgaduVi78hlp47cr6L30PK.html
05-01-2021||India||Rainfall pushes up temperature, Delhi’s air quality improves||Two back-to-back days of rainfall in Delhi pushed the temperature up on Monday, giving relief from the biting cold in the city over the past few weeks, and sent pollution levels down, giving residents the cleanest air in 38 days.The minimum temperature lodged on Monday at Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered representative for Delhi, was 11.4 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal and the highest in the last 22 days, according to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The maximum temperature was 22.6 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal.Weather scientists said the cloud cover in city helped bring the temperature up as clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The inclement weather in the city is likely to persist till Wednesday, with moderate rains and thunderstorm likely on Tuesday as well, IMD scientists said.“There was a hailstorm in neighbouring areas of Delhi as per our radar images. Similar weather will continue on Tuesday,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting system.On Monday, Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 151, placing it in “moderate” category — a substantial improvement compared to the past three days. On January 1, Delhi’s AQI was in 441, placing it in the “severe” zone; while it was 443 on January 2, also in “severe” category; and it was 354 on January 3 in “very poor” category.Read more| 40mm rain in 36 hrs throws Delhi out of gear, more likely today: IMD This was the first time since December 14, 2020, that the air in the city was in the “moderate” category (AQI of 160) and the cleanest air that Delhi has breathed since November 27, when the AQI touched 137.Dense fog enveloped the city in the morning, with the visibility dropping to around 50 metres at Safdarjung. Officials at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, however, said that the morning fog had no impact on flight operations on Monday. As many as 14 flights scheduled to depart from Delhi for Srinagar were cancelled due of poor weather conditions in Srinagar, while four flights scheduled to arrive at Delhi from Srinagar had to be cancelled as the flights could not take off from Srinagar, the official added.Experts said that the rain and strong winds through Monday played a crucial role in bringing the pollution down.“The pollution has been washed away after intense rain on Sunday. Strong winds today blowing at 15 to 20 kmph hasn’t allowed accumulation of pollutants. We are expecting air quality to remain in ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category till January 9. This is because wind speed is likely to remain moderate, which will help disperse pollutants continuously,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division. Several parts of north India witnessed light to moderate rains due to a western disturbance and above-normal temperatures on Monday, the IMD said. Several parts of northwest India are continuing to receive widespread and heavy rain with thunderstorms and lightning. There is likely to be hailstorms at many places on Tuesday, IMD said.“There is western disturbance as a cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan. There is a lot of moisture incursion due to southesterlies and a confluence or interaction of southwesterly and southeasterly winds is causing extreme weather. There is also an induced cyclonic circulation over Rajasthan. Our radar images are showing a lot of rain and thunderstorm over Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, east Rajasthan and Haryana. There may have been hailstorm also. Similar weather will persist tomorrow (Tuesday) but the spatial distribution and intensity may reduce from Wednesday,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre.“The next western disturbance, which is likely to approach the region around January 7, will not bring much rain to the plains because it’s a feeble system. Its impact will be limited to the hills,” Shrivastava said.An active western disturbance lies as a middle and upper-level cyclonic circulation over Central Pakistan with its induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and neighbourhood. A north-south zone of wind confluence continues to exist from north Punjab to northeast Arabian Sea, with strong interaction between south westerly winds and and lower level moist southeasterlies. All these meteorological features favourable for rain are likely to persist over the next three days, according to the IMD bulletin on Monday.Hailstorm in isolated places is likely over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi on January 4 and 5 and over west Uttar Pradesh on January 5. Heavy rain or snowfall is also likely over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan & Muzaffarabad on January 4 and 5; over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on January 5 and isolated heavy rainfall over northern parts of Punjab on January 4 and 5.A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan Region from January 7. As a result, no significant change in minimum temperatures is likely during the next 2-3 days over northwest India, the bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rainfall-pushes-up-temperature-delhi-s-air-quality-improves/story-D73WrUhzC0WTFqF6qiKHDO.html
05-01-2021||India||States gear up for 1st phase of vaccination, await Centre nod||A day after the national drug controller cleared two coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines, state governments on Monday were awaiting the Centre’s go-ahead for a massive immunisation campaign, which could begin in the second week of January. To begin with, about 300 million people (health care staff, frontline workers, people above 50, and those with co-morbidities) will be vaccinated in a phased manner. States are already sending the data on the beneficiaries to the Centre. MaharashtraMaharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the state administration was awaiting a communication from the Centre on the availability of the Covid vaccine and had conducted drills for administering it. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman, communicable diseases prevention control and technical committee, said the state had prepared a list of 758,000 Covid warriors, who will receive vaccination in the first phase. “A detailed district-wise list of health care providers have been provided to the Centre on its Co-WIN app,” he said, referring to the app that the Centre has introduced to facilitate the vaccine drive and to monitor the progress realtime. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state vaccination task force, said the Centre was expected to procure the vaccine and distribute among states. “By when this process will start, we don’t know,” he said.RajasthanHealth minister Raghu Sharma said the state was fully prepared to execute vaccination by developing centres even as ambulance service will be available at all those facilities in case of adverse reaction, if there is any. “We have had a dry run at 19 places, including Jaipur and even private hospitals,” he said. AssamHealth officials in Assam said around 150,000 health care workers and frontline staff registered with the government would be administered the vaccine in the first phase. “We have not received any confirmation from the Centre on how many doses of the vaccine Assam would get,” said S Lakshmanan, director of the National Health Mission, Assam. He said states cannot directly purchase the shots.KarnatakaDr K Sudhakar, the state’s medical education minister, said all Corona warriors will be administered the vaccine in the first phase free of cost. “We will also use the existing infrastructure and the Centre will augment the additional infrastructure as required,” he said. The minister said the vaccine expected to be available in January itself. “We are awaiting directions from the Centre on next steps,” he said.PunjabAccording to Punjab’s Covid nodal officer, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, there is no exact information on when inoculation will begin. “The state has also not received any tentative plan either,” he said, adding the state has already submitted data of 160,000 frontline workers to the Centre. ChhattisgarhHealth minister TS Singhdeo said the state will receive vaccines from central government and the exact date has not been decided. “In the first phase, vaccines would be given to 254,000 registered health functionaries in the state,” he said.UttarakhandKuldeep Singh Martoliya, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination, said the hill state was expecting to receive vaccines from the Centre soon. “We have been assured that vaccines will be provided to us by early 2021. The Uttarakhand government has shared the data of over 94,000 health care workers with the Centre,” he said.Madhya PradeshAbout 450,000 health workers will be administered vaccines at primary health centres, community health centres and district hospitals, said Dr Santosh Shukla, the nodal officer for vaccination. “Whenever we receive the vaccines, we will start the inoculation process within the next two days,” he said, adding that all dry runs have been successful and vaccination will be done by maintaining social distancing norms. HaryanaThe Haryana health department will conduct a dry run across the state on January 7 to test preparedness for the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out. The department has already identified 19,000 vaccination sites, and about 5,145 vaccinators have been mapped for the process.“The number of vaccines available and priority groups would depend on the central government. We will expeditiously roll out vaccination, once the vaccine becomes available,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (ACS), health.Data of 190,000 health care workers have been uploaded on CoWIN portal, he said.BiharAround 439,000 health care workers will be vaccinated in Bihar and 14,724 vaccinators have been identified so far, said health minister Mangal Pandey. He said the state was in the process of giving last-minute training to its vaccinators and immunisation officers. “The picture will be clear later this week,” said a Bihar government official, requesting anonymity. JharkhandClose to 250,000 health workers will be vaccinated in the first phase. State health official said every district would have a vaccine distribution centre, from where vaccines would be sent in refrigerated vans to block community health centres.Tamil NaduHealth secretary J Radhakrishnan said 600,000 health workers will get vaccine once the Centre informs the state about when the drive would start. “The Centre has instructed to hold dry runs in the states, which is being done in five districts,” he said. Over 2,000 personnel and 100 others are participating in the dry run, he said. The secretary also said over 5,000 refrigerated facilities have been created for storing the vaccine.Andhra PradeshAn official of the health department, who refused to be quoted, said the state could get 170,000 vaccine vials in the first phase and focus was shifted to cold-chain management, a crucial part of storage and distribution. TelanganaHealth minister Eatala Rajender said the Centre might supply 500,000 doses initially. An official familiar with the development said the registration process for vaccination was expected to start in the second week of January. The government is setting up 10,000 vaccination centres across the state. Uttar PradeshAmit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary of health and family welfare, said 900,000 health care workers have been enrolled in the first phase of the Covid vaccination drive. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the vaccine was likely to be available in the state around Makar Sankranti (January 14). Officials said district magistrates have been asked to constitute district task forces, tehsil task forces and block task forces to review the drive. KeralaHealth minister KK Shailaja said the state was fully geared up to carry out the massive drive. “Our strategy was to delay the peak (of infections) and restrict casualties…we succeeded in both. Since the state’s density of population is quite high and (because of) prevalence of high incidences of lifestyle disease, we need to get more vaccines in the first stage itself. We have informed the Union health ministry about this,” said Shailaja.(with inputs from HT bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-gear-up-for-1st-phase-of-vaccination-await-centre-nod/story-wUUA0VPaNk5oIE2VP4jTvM.html
05-01-2021||India||Sparks fly over ‘water’: Covaxin hits out at critics, says trials 200% honest||Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director, Krishna Ella, on Monday hit out at comments suggesting that its anti-coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, Covaxin, was “safe like water”, and said that their Phase 3 efficacy data, likely to be out by February or March, will silence all critics.Though he did not take any names, Ella’s remarks appear to have sparked a rare war of words between vaccine-makers a day after Serum Institute of India’s (SII) CEO, Adar Poonawalla, told NDTV that only three vaccines had passed all the scientific evaluations -- Pfizer-BioNTech, Modera and Oxford-AstraZeneca -- and that while the others were safe, “safe like water”, their effectiveness had not yet been evaluated.“It is easy to target Indian scientists. I had to tell this because some other company has branded my product as ‘safe like water’. Some local company in press yesterday said that safety is like water of other companies. Only three companies have done efficacy, and other vaccine is like water. I want to deny that. It hurts us as scientists; we work 24 hours and don’t deserve this type of bashing from people,” Ella told a media briefing.Read more| ‘Give me one week’s time’: Bharat Biotech chief on questions about Covaxin efficacyHe then appeared to question the results of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured by SII.“You ask a question on the UK Astra-Zeneca clinical trial; whether 60%, 70% or 90% which one is the clinical efficacy? Nobody knows. One says high dose, high dose, low dose or high dose. If I had done that type of clinical trial in India, the drugs controller of India would have shut down the company on quality issues,” he said.SII declined to comment on the matter.It also asked for a weeks’ time to prove with evidence that his vaccine also worked against the new UK variant of Sars-Cov-2 virus as 90% of the vaccines targeted just the spike protein of the virus but Covaxin was an inactivated whole virion vaccine.The company is in the eye of a storm after Covaxin was granted “restricted use in emergency situation” approval, leading to many experts questioning the decision because of the shorter duration of human trials and relatively lower data published for the candidate, which is still in the process of its Phase 3 checks.The Oxford vaccine, called Covishield, got the Drug Control General of India nod based on the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data generated on 23,745 participants from overseas studies, as well as interim data from Phase 2/3 trials on 1,600 people in India. What boosted its case was that it was granted approval last week by the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority in the UK.Experts pointed out that the government may have acted in haste, and the sentiment was echoed by some Opposition politicians who suggested that the Union government ignored scientific protocols to give the nod to a fully indigenous vaccine because it tied in with the Atmanirbhar Bharat slogan.Read more| Bharat Biotech vaccine more likely to work against newer strains like UK variant: VardhanElla contended that the criticism his company has faced since Sunday was unwarranted.“We are not a company without a vaccine experience; we have produced 16 vaccines, and are catering to 123 countries. We are conducting clinical trials not just in India but in more than 12 countries, including UK where we have conducted two clinical trials. WHO has said for typhoid vaccine that it’s a breakthrough vaccine for typhoid control,” he said.He also said that there was a 2019 Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) notification that allowed grant of emergency use authorisation without efficacy data.Covaxin is a 2 dose Covid-19 vaccine to be given 28 days apart, and only vaccine allowed to be tested on children of 12 years and above. Ella said company currently has 20 million doses pre-produced at risk, of which five million doses are undergoing quality testing in a government lab. There are four dedicated facilities that can produce about 700 million doses in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, he added.The DCGI clearance to Covaxin also triggered a political slugfest between the Opposition and ruling party leaders. “But it is typical of a govt that prefers slogans over substance. Chest-thumping ‘vaccine nationalism’, combined with the PM’s “atmanirbhar Bharat” campaign, has trumped common sense and a generation of established scientific protocols,” Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said in a tweet on Sunday. BJP president JP Nadda and aviation minister Hardeep Puri led a counter-attack, saying the Opposition was questioning the competence of Indian scientists just as it had doubted Indian soldiers during the Balakot operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-3-covaxin-data-in-feb-or-march-bharat-biotech/story-QetWiqSy1ATBaKooOjWHsN.html
05-01-2021||India||Govt body drops ‘halal’ from meat manual||A government body on Monday removed the word “halal” from a red meat manual that it issues to lay down the contours of meat export -- a move that came in the backdrop of allegations by some Hindu groups that the use of the term gives an unfair business advantage to Muslim exporters.“Halal” is a term used for consumables permitted under Islam. Meat that is slaughtered in a certain way is also labelled as “halal-certified”. Several Islamic countries import only “halal-certified” meat.A section of the older manual by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) -- it functions under the commerce ministry -- read: “…The animals are slaughtered strictly according to ‘Halal’ method to meet the requirement of Islamic countries”. In the revised version, that section reads: “The animals are slaughtered to the requirement of importing country/importer.” Exporters pointed out that certification of meat was done in view of the requirements of the exporting country, as mentioned in the revised manual as well, and that the removal of the term “halal” had little or no implications on the ground, but admitted that it carried symbolic significance.A debate has been raging with a section of Hindu groups complaining that use of the word in the manual implied that APEDA was making it mandatory for exporters to buy and acquire only “halal-certified” meat . They argue that apart from Islamic countries in West Asia, India also exports meat to countries such as China and Sri Lanka, where “halal” certification is not needed. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) is among those vocal on the issue.Read more| SDMC makes it mandatory for meat shops, restaurants to mention halal or jhatkaThe manual is a compendium of information on issues such as quality and food safety standards to be followed, freezing, packaging and labelling requirements, edible offal and other by-products of meat. It also contains elaborate information on various government regulations for export of meat. Another reference in the previous manual to animals slaughtered by “halal” method in the presence of representatives of recognised Islamic bodies for certification to meet the requirement of Muslim countries has also been replaced with: “The animals are slaughtered to the requirement of importing country/importer.” APEDA officials did not respond to calls till the filing of this report. But on December 27, it clarified in a tweet that, as claimed by some Hindu groups, the government did not impose any condition that only “halal” meat was to be exported. “...It [halal meat] is requirement of majority of importing countries/Importers. Halal Certification agencies are accredited directly by respective importing countries. No Govt agency has any role in this,” it said.A group called Halal Niyantran Manch (Halal Regulation Forum) took credit after the APEDA move. It had been petitioning the government to do away with the word from the manual.“The Congress government had forced APEDA to come out with an order that all manufacturers or exporters of meat will have to compulsorily register with APEDA, and buy and acquire only halal-certified meat,” HNM spokesperson Harinder S Sikka said.“As a result, Hindus, Sikhs, SC and STs (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) all went out of business, which is roughly 40 million-plus people. The government‘s reasoning then was that meat is primarily exported to the Middle East, where the requirement is halal meat. However, this is not the truth. The biggest market for Indian meat is China, which not does not require or give a halal certification. There are many countries such as Sri Lanka that have banned halal certification,” he added. BJP national spokesperson RP Singh welcomed APEDA’s move. A meat exporter in Delhi, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, however, stressed that the government had no role in the certification of meat for exports. “Certification is done as per the requirements of the importing country. The removal of the term from the manual is of no significance on the ground,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-body-drops-halal-from-meat-manual/story-wqfcilHrF6OsBs7aoJBLZN.html
05-01-2021||India||‘2020 was the 8th warmest year in India’: IMD||Last year, 2020, was the eighth warmest year on record since nation-wide records commenced in 1901. Last year, the annual mean land surface air temperature averaged over the country was +0.29 degree C above normal (based on data between 1981-2010) according to the India Meteorological Department’s Statement on Climate of India in 2020. This, despite the cooling effect of La Nina, a global weather phenomenon.The highest warming was observed over India in 2016 when the mean land surface temperature was +0.71 degree C above normal. The temperature during the pre-monsoon season was below normal by -0.03 degree C. But both monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were +0.43 degree C and +0.53 degree C respectively which contributed to the warming. The mean temperature during winter was above normal +0.14 degree C.India’s warming was however significantly lower than the global average. The global mean surface temperature anomaly during 2020 (January to October as per the World Meteorological Organisation’s state of the global climate) is +1.2 degree C.The annual rainfall over the country as a whole was 109 per cent of its Long Period Average (LPA) calculated for the period of 1961-2010.Also read: Farmers adamant on repeal of farm laws demand: Agri min on why talks failedThe statement said 12 out of 15 warmest years were during the recent fifteen years (2006-2020). The past decade (2011-2020) was also the warmest decade on record.Averaged annual mean temperature during 1901-2020 showed an increasing trend of 0.62 degrees C in 100 years with an increasing trend in maximum temperature (0.99 degrees C in 100 years) and relatively lower increasing trend (0.24 degrees C in 100 years) with respect to minimum temperature.Last year, the mean monthly temperatures were warmer than the normal during all the months except March and June, the statement said. The mean temperatures exceeded the normal during September (by 0.72 degrees C, warmest since 1901), August (by 0.58 degrees C, second warmest), October (by 0.94 degrees C, third warmest), July (by 0.56 degrees C, fifth warmest), and December (by 0.39 degrees C, seventh warmest).“2020 was one of the warmest years despite La Niña with cool waters in the east Pacific. La Niñas typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is now offset by global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, La Niña years now are warmer than years with El Niño events of the past. As for India, data shows that the increasing trend in temperatures is the largest during the post-monsoon season and this is reflected in the 2020 post-monsoon temperatures over India, despite a full-fledged La Nina,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.“The fact that there was a rise of over 1 degrees C in global mean surface temperature over pre-industrial levels in a La Nina year is a sign of global warming. In El Nino years, the sea surface temperatures are higher so are land surface temperatures. But in La Nina years there is cooling particularly over the Indian region. Despite that, the average temperatures were higher than normal which is due to climate change. The northern hemisphere also recorded substantially above normal temperatures,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.Also read: ‘From Andhra to Assam’ - How states are gearing up for Covid-19 vaccinationThe statement also said India experienced some extreme climate events like extremely heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, thunderstorm, lightning, cold waves which killed hundreds of people.Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were the most adversely affected states during the year wherein more than 350 people died from each state due to thunderstorm, lightning and cold wave.Heavy rainfall and floods claimed over 600 lives in different parts of the country during pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Of these, 129 people were killed in Assam, 72 in Kerala (65 persons died in a single day in Munnar, Idukki district of Kerala on August 7 due to a landslide), 61 in Telangana (while 59 lives were reportedly claimed only during the period 1st to 20th October), 54 in Bihar, 50 in Maharashtra, 48 Uttar Pradesh and 38 in from Himachal Pradesh.Thunderstorms and lightning also claimed over 815 lives from different parts of the country - 280 in Bihar, 220 in Uttar Pradesh, rest in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. Cold wave conditions also killed 150 people mainly in central India in January.Last year, 5 cyclones formed over the North Indian Ocean. These were super cyclonic storm Amphan, very severe cyclonic storms Nivar and Gati (both over the Arabian Sea), severe cyclonic storm Nisarga and cyclonic storm Burevi.Super cyclonic storm Amphan formed in the pre-monsoon season and crossed the West Bengal coast over Sundarbans on May 20. It claimed 90 lives and about 4,000 livestock mainly in West Bengal.According to the WMO, Amphan is estimated to be the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean with economic losses to the tune of approximately US $14 billion.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon, above-average rains and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-was-the-8th-warmest-year-in-india-imd/story-IDMLx0Ib5hnJDiBkfSmbbM.html
05-01-2021||India||BJP’s Kolkata zone observer skips road show, leaves party red-faced||In what is being seen as embarrassment for the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit, former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee, who was recently appointed the party’s observer for Kolkata zone, skipped a massive road show in the city on Monday. There was also a flare up as BJP supporters came face to face with Trinamool Congress workers during the road show. Police, however, managed to prevent any clash between the two rival parties. The BJP’s Bengal unit had organized a massive road show, which Chatterjee was supposed to lead along with Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP’s national general secretary and the party’s observer for the state. Chatterjee had joined the BJP in August 2019 but had stayed away from active politics. Monday’s road show was being seen as a comeback for the former TMC heavyweight leader. He was recently appointed as the Bengal BJP’s Kolkata zone observer. His friend Baisakhi Banerjee was made the co-convener of the Kolkata zone. According to BJP leaders, aware of the development, all was set for the rally and late-night meetings were also held with Chatterjee in the latter’s residence last night. Banerjee, however, told a section of the media on Monday morning that she was not invited and hence would not be attending the rally. Later, Chatterjee also refused to attend the rally. HT could not get in touch with Chatterjee as his phone was switched off. In a damage control exercise, top BJP leaders said that it was a party rally and an individual is not important. “The party is more important than an individual. The rally was held despite the police and TMC trying to create obstacles,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP’s spokesperson for West Bengal. The TMC took the opportunity to hit back with some sarcasm. “The BJP made a mistake when they made a deal – buy one get one free,” said Kunal Ghosh, a TMC spokesperson. The rally’s route also had to be cut short and the number of vehicles in the rally had to be curtailed as Kolkata Police did not give permission.The roadshow was finally led by senior BJP leaders Kailash Vijayvargiya, party’s National vice president Mukul Roy and MP Arjun Singh. Senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said, “We are not bothered if the BJP takes out a rally as we have other important work to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-kolkata-zone-observer-skips-road-show-leaves-party-red-faced/story-sLrxrK1qOqxnWK3s22U1JP.html
05-01-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee unveils extensive plans for Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary||From setting up a national university and a monument to forming a state planning commission and publishing books, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday announced her extensive plans to celebrate the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose right from January 23 till the end of 2021. Banerjee announced that January 23 will be celebrated with a grand parade in Kolkata and the Independence Day parade in the city will be dedicated to Netaji. The monument, to be named after Azah Hind Fauj, the army Bose led against the British, will come up at Rajarhat in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata and the university, to be funded entirely by the state, will have tie-ups with foreign universities, said the chief minister. Coming months before the crucial assembly polls, Banerjee’s announcements on outreach programmes and her plans to translate Netaji’s writings into all Indian languages and languages spoken by Dalit and tribal communities appeared significant in view of the competition over nationalism that the state’s Trinamool Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party leaders often engaged in. Addressing a virtual meeting attended by members of the celebration committee who include US-based Nobel Laureate economist Abhijit Binayak Banerjee, vice-chancellors of several universities and acclaimed writers, poets and educationists, Banerjee said, “A vast majority of Indians have forgotten the great message Netaji’s life had been to his people. The young generation needs to learn from his life.” “Netaji was the first to set up a national planning commission. We don’t have a planning commission anymore. It has been replaced by Niti Ayog. Let us set up a state planning commission named after Netaji. It will have a vision for the nation and the world. Let us not bother about whether others follow it,” said Banerjee. “I request people from all sections of the society and Indian who live abroad to blow a conch shell or do something similar at 12.15 pm, the time of Netaji’s birth, on January 23. I request Indian missions across the globe to do it as well,” said Banerjee “The real evaluation of Netaji has not been done in India after Independence. This is unfortunate. Also, although we know on which day he was born, the nation does not know what happened to him at the end. I demand that his birthday be declared a national holiday and all records relating to his disappearance be made public,” said Banerjee “We assumed that the Government of India would form a committee to celebrate Netaji’s 125th birthday. We have done it. I hope the Centre will do it too,” said Banerjee. The chief minister announced that every school and college will have an Azad Hind Bahini which will be similar to the National Cadet Corps but will be run by the state government. Award-winning Dalit writer Manoranjan Byapari, who is president of the newly-formed Dalit Academy, has been entrusted with the task of translating Netaji’s writings. Banerjee also announced that January 23 will be celebrated as Desh Nayak Diwas. She demanded that the Centre should do the same.Most of the senior state BJP leaders were attending rallies and did not react till Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-unveils-extensive-plans-for-netaji-s-125th-birth-anniversary/story-iWnlYcn0rO6VKtJc2xKcxJ.html
05-01-2021||India||Farm talks fail again, Centre says no repeal||The seventh round of talks between the Centre and farm leaders demanding scrapping of three contentious farm laws ended in a stalemate on Monday, as three Union ministers part of the negotiations said it was not possible to commit to a rollback of the legislation without wider consultations with higher authorities.Both sides, however, agreed to continue the talks on January 8. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, has hardened its stand, saying on Saturday that thousands of farmers will drive into the Capital in their tractors to hold their own Republic Day parade if their demands are not met by January 26.“We requested the unions to review the laws clause by clause but the unions were steadfast in their demand for a repeal. As such, we could not arrive at any decision but both sides agreed to meet again on January 8,” farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the meet.Follow latest updates on farmers protest hereFarm union leaders said they were prepared to intensify their agitation and added that the government was not prepared to budge from its stand. “The government is saying 50% of the demands have been met. For us, 85% of the demands are left.The agitation will become more intense now,” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the agitation.The government ruled out a decision to repeal the three agricultural laws, asking farm union leaders to point out what they considered objectionable in the legislation, a farm leader said, resulting in a standoff. It also wanted to discuss the demand of a law guaranteeing assured prices for 23 farm commodities, known as minimum support prices, or MSP. “The government in multiple ways wanted us to discuss the laws. We said we want a repeal. The ministers said they need to consult within the government for any possible repeal of the laws. There was no discussion on MSP,” said farm leader Kavitha Kuruganti. The government, represented by Union ministers Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash, told participating farm leaders that it will review any clause farmers have a problem with. “The government said it wanted to go clause by clause of the three farm laws. It said laws can’t be repealed. We told them that there is only one way, which is to repeal the laws and bring a law guaranteeing minimum support prices,” farm leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan said.Unlike in the last round, the Union ministers did not share lunch brought by the farmers. The ministers, government officials and representatives of farmers observed two-minute silence for farmers who died during the ongoing protest.Since there was no headway in the first session of talks on Monday, the two sides took a lunch break. At the start of the post-lunch session, Tomar said he wanted to discuss the proposal on a law to ensure MSP. The farmers rejected the call for discussions on this demand.The sixth round of talks on December 30 made some headway in the standoff between the Union government and protesting farm unions, with the Centre agreeing to spare farmers of heavy fines for crop-residue burning, as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance, and to continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use.The two principal demands of the repeal of the three new farm laws and a legal guarantee of MSP were deferred till January 8. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws.They essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Tomar said he remains hopeful of a solution in the next meeting on January 8, but asserted that efforts need to be made from both sides for a solution to be reached. Farmer leaders, however, alleged that it was the government’s “ego problem” that was coming in the way of resolving the issues and they insisted they would not relent on their key demands for the repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have hunkered down at various Delhi border points for over a month against the three laws.They have stayed put despite heavy rains and waterlogging at protest sites over the last couple of days, besides severe cold weather conditions prevailing in and around the national capital.Yogendra Yadav, one of the leaders coordinating the protests, said the only way forward was to scale up the agitation. “After seven months of protests and seven rounds of talks, the government is still asking if farmers really wanted a repeal of the laws? Do you think the government is any serious?” he asked. The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) criticised the Haryana government for “severe repression” of protesting farmers and warned of escalation of the anger among the people and intensification of the movement if it does not stop. “Yesterday farmers who had advanced towards Delhi from Shahjahanpur in a peaceful manner were physically obstructed and later tear-gassed in Rewari along with spray of chilly,” Avik Saha, secretary of AIKSCC, said.Farm leaders said they will implement their new protest agenda, which includes picketing of Raj Bhawans, toll plazas and boycott of goods and services of the Reliance and Adani groups. “It seemed the government today was trying to assess if farmers would agree to anything other than repeal,” Kuruganti added. The AIKSCC, in a statement, said it criticised senior minister Nitin Gadkari for “speaking against the demands of farmers on the eve of talks, leaving little chance of success. Gadkari said yesterday that the core problem is surplus food and MSP higher than open markets”.RS Mani, retired economist of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said: “It appears that the government has prepared a proposal on assured prices since it was keen to discuss it. There are options like deficiency price payments, etc. However, the solution to a repeal of the laws requires a political decision.”(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-won-t-be-repealed-govt-tells-farmer-leaders-in-seventh-round-of-talks/story-xCnGxcjYq6BgTNxfSgIZHM.html

Two key demands of the farmers are expected to be on the table for consideration by the government.Upping the ante, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the platform of farm unions, has said that thousands of farmers will drive into the Capital on their tractors to hold their own Republic Day parade if their demands are not met by January 26. The Republic Day – an event of global importance – is scheduled to be attended by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Meanwhile, a 70-year-old farmer, who was part of the agitation against the farm laws at UP Gate in Ghaziabad, allegedly died by suicide in a portable toilet near the protest site on Saturday. Forty-seven people have died so far at various protest sites since the farmers began their agitation against three contentious farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year, national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait has said.Despite rains and the ongoing cold wave across North India, farmers agitating against the Centre’s farm laws stood strong at the borders of the national capital and continued their protest for the last 39 days.Why are the farmers protesting?In one of the largest strikes in decades witnessed by India, the farmers are demanding that the Centre revokes the three contentious laws. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Here are the latest updates:8:30pm: Assembly session to be convened to pass resolution against farm laws: Bengal CM West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said arrangements would soon be made to convene an assembly session to pass a resolution against the contentious legislations.7:01pm: We will not go home until the laws are withdrawn: Farmers’ union“Discussion took place on our demands -- repeal of the three laws and MSP...

Ahead of the eighth-round of talks with the Central government over the issue, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson, Rakesh Tikait said, “Many issues are to be discussed today. The government must understand, the farmer has taken this movement to his heart and won’t consider less than the repeal of these laws. The government should implement Swaminathan’s report and make law on MSP.”Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee’s Joint Secretary Sukhwinder S Sabra also threatened to hold a tractor march if the demands of the unions weren’t met.10:55 am: Reliance Jio to move Punjab and Haryana HCReliance Industries Limited (RIL), through its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, in a petition mentioned to be filed in Punjab and Haryana High Court today, has sought urgent intervention of Government authorities to bring a complete stop to illegal acts of vandalism by miscreants, said RIL.These acts of violence have endangered the lives of thousands of its employees and caused damage and disruption to the vital communications infrastructure, sales and service outlets run by its subsidiaries in the two states, RIL said in a media statement. 10:45 am: Govt likely to discuss farm laws ‘clause by clause’ with farmers’ yet againWith the eighth-round of meeting between farmers’ unions and the Central government scheduled to take place today, the ‘clause by clause’ discussion on three farm laws is expected to take place between the two if farmers remain adamant on their demand to repeal the laws.Sources in the government said that with two demands of farmers’ unions -- Repeal of the three farm laws and legalisation of Minimum Support Price (MSP) -- left unresolved, the Centre is likely to discuss farm laws clause by clause as it did initially before the MSP issue.

05-01-2021||Editorials||Eyewash by Pakistan on terror again||Pakistan’s song-and-dance routine to cover up its sponsorship of terror has begun again. Already Islamabad’s theatrics have devolved into farce. The global terror funding watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), meets this month and in February to review the degree Pakistan has adhered to a FATF action plan. The February plenary will vote to decide whether to remove or keep Pakistan on the terror financing grey list — or even move it to FATF’s blacklist. Every time FATF meetings loom on the horizon, there is a flurry of faux anti-terrorist activity by Pakistan. Symbolic arrests are routinely conducted before every FATF meeting, and 2021 is proving no different. The new year began with the Punjab state counterterrorism department suddenly remembering that Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, Lashkar-e-Taiba operations commander and mastermind of the Mumbai 26/11 carnage, has been roaming around the state on bail for the past four years and it would look better if he were behind bars. A similar show as made of Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Sayeed’s arrest just before FATF met in October last year. A total of 146 Pakistanis are on the United Nations most wanted terrorists list, including Lakhvi and Sayeed. Of those who target India, few are arrested, almost none convicted and none are ever punished. The degree to which “Pakistani anti-terrorism” is an oxymoron was underlined just last week when the Sindh high court ordered the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and three accomplices, all convicted for the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Sheikh had already been cleared of murder charges, his death sentence reduced to seven years in jail, and was only under lock and key for a three-month preventive detention. The court struck even this down and let Sheikh go free. Washington responded angrily and Islamabad put Sheikh back behind bars. The entire episode underlines that even in the most blatant cases, the Pakistani system has no interest in punishing the guilty and acts solely to appease external forces. The reasons for this lack of interest in justice are obvious: The all-powerful Pakistani military is the patron of these terror groups and has no interest in its role being outed in a court. Pakistan remains the global centre of state-sponsored terrorism with its present target being Afghanistan. It is hoped this simple fact finds reflection in the deliberations of FATF’s member-states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/eyewash-by-pakistan-on-terror-again/story-07765uxUNSS3fGtYyN49cM.html
