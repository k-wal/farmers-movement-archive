With Donald Trump out of office, hours after taking over office, newly elected United States (US) President Joe Biden has signed an order to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change. With this, the denial of this existential threat to the planet is now past. And we can move decisively to action. Or, so we must hope.The fact is the world is hurtling towards a climate catastrophe. We know today that global temperatures have risen — beyond any doubt — and that, as a result, weird weather events are intensifying. All this, already, is showing up as devastating and debilitating impacts — from forest fires to unseasonal and extreme rain events to intensification of tropical cyclones.We also know that the spiral of temperature rise is linked to greenhouse gas emissions — gases that come mainly from burning fossil fuels, the engines of economic growth. So, tackling the climate crisis requires transformation of the energy systems of the world, moving away from coal, oil and gas to other more benign sources such as solar or wind. But it’s a tough call. And in spite of all the talk and even the commitment to action, the world has been unable to do this at the scale and speed needed. It is made even tougher because the battle against the climate crisis is not only about mitigating emissions nationally. It is also about sharing a finite atmospheric space between nations. This is because greenhouse gas emissions are long-lived; carbon dioxide, for instance, has a full life in the atmosphere of over 150 years. So, the emissions of the past influence the temperatures of the future.But for now, let’s take a moment to celebrate the return of the prodigal. There is no doubt that the US re-engagement with climate negotiations will put the agenda back on track. The US is no longer the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases (China is), but it has a disproportionate contribution in terms of its past. This one country, with less than 5% of the world’s population, has added over 17% of the carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. So, its role and responsibility, is immense — to act decisively to reduce emissions at home and to provide global leadership.But this is where we must remain hopeful, but realistic about what is at stake. First, let us be clear that even as team Biden-Kamala Harris won, Trumpism did not lose. What is shocking for most of us, watching from the outside, is just how many votes Trump got; close to half of the US voted for him. He got more votes in 2020 — when the virus is out of control, when he has rejected climate crisis and when he has exacerbated race and gender conflicts — than in 2016. We need to remember this.Let’s also be clear that, more than ever before, this US election had climate crisis denial or action on the ballot. Trump was belligerent about his opposition to “fake” science. He swore by coal and, more importantly, he pushed his country to manufacture more; made in the USA was his slogan. Pushing against the climate crisis — in spite of the terrible fire and hurricane damage — was his way of putting the economy before all else. This is what Biden-Harris will have to overcome with smart policies and even smarter communication.Second, the US has always been a renegade nation on taking hard action. In 2015, bowing to US pressure, the Paris Agreement changed the terms of the agreement on climate action fundamentally. Till then, the world had set emission reduction targets based on the responsibility of countries to the stock of emissions in the atmosphere. This created a framework for action — and built the foundations for the cooperative agreement.But countries such as the US, which had been long-term historical contributors, did not want this deal — it put too much onus on them to make reductions. They wanted to erase the very idea of the past and focus on the need for all to act and for all to take actions based on what they believed they could do. The Paris Agreement succumbed to this idea and agreed that from now on, countries would determine what they would do. This was called the nationally determined contributions (NDC) and even as Paris agreement was graveled down, it was understood that the sum of these NDCs would add up to at least 3°C temperature increase by century end. The US took on the relatively small target to reduce its emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2025. But then came Trump and even weak NDCs became a desired goal. By 2019, US emissions were higher than 2016, and, currently, it is not on track to meet even these insignificant Paris goals. This is what Biden will inherit. But there is more to this that only good intentions will not fix. The fact is that the US energy sector’s emissions have declined dramatically in the past decade. This is because the US has moved the power sector away from coal to shale and natural gas. In the past decade, it has seen a 50% reduction in coal-generated electricity and roughly 30% reduction in emissions from the energy sector. This is huge.But, and there is a big but, the fact is that cheap shale gas took off where coal left — and left behind the renewable energy surge as costs of gas have fallen to a record low. As a result of this cheap fuel, other sectors of the US economy are now reversing any gains made from the shift away from coal. Transport-related emissions have overtaken the energy sector’s contribution in the country. So, even though the US is no longer addicted to coal, it is completely sold on the idea of cheap energy. It also wants to reclaim its role as the economic powerhouse and take back its position from China. This will mean burning more fuel for industrial growth, and using more energy will mean negating all the gains of cleaner fuels.This then is where Biden-Harris will need to work their magic. They need to push for transformational answers in their own backyard. But they will also need to work with other countries, such as India, to arrive at a collaborative agreement that will work for the planet and its people.The most inconvenient of truths is that at the current levels of emissions, the world will “exhaust” the carbon budget by 2030 for the 1.5°C target. This, when large parts of the world, including India, will need the right to develop — in today’s context where coal and natural gas, both fossil fuels, remain the most competitive fuels, this will mean increase in emissions. So, it is necessary to move towards this transformation in the still emerging world, but there are no enabling conditions that will make this happen. Talk is cheap. Transformation is not. This is what we need to address and fast.Sunita Narain is director-general, Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/on-climate-what-the-us-needs-to-do-101611406736451.html
24-01-2021||News||Data bill: The security vs privacy debate||William Pitt, the English statesman, during his speech in the House of Lords in 1763, stated, “The poorest man may in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of the Crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England may not enter; all his forces dare not cross the threshold of his ruined tenement.”Such a passionate call for preserving individual privacy against State intervention was rare in the 18th century, but today, it reverberates across democracies, in the backdrop of a contentious debate on individual privacy versus State security. The Supreme Court (SC) judgment, declaring privacy a fundamental right has given fillip to the relentless campaign against infringement of privacy of any kind by the State or business bodies.It is in this context that the Data Protection Bill, currently being discussed by the Joint Parliament Committee (JPC), is of great significance because it will lay down the contours of privacy of individual data from the prying eyes of the State as well as social media. The sanctity of sensitive personal data cannot be over-emphasised. Individual data has immense economic value too, waiting to be exploited commercially by the corporates through their social media platforms.Encryption is widely acknowledged as the strongest feature of data protection. Digital banking and financial transactions have increased manifold with the Reserve Bank of India prescribing the encryption standards. The telecom sector, however, is limping along on 40-bit key encryption, which is considered to be low. Both cellular voice and messaging are vulnerable to off-air interceptions, with experts pointing at the weakness of SMS being used as second factor authentication in banking, payments and Aadhaar identification. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has rightly recommended an update of regulation policy and is of the view that encryption is a reliable tool which should not be interfered with.The end-to-end encryption on chat platforms is the most secure method of keeping data safe from hackers and break-ins. The General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union strongly favours use of encryption for protecting individual data. However, security agencies around the world want decrypted data and favour legislation in this regard. The United States, United Kingdom and Australia support a legislation for decryption, while France and Germany are pro-encryption.The encryption debate has reached the SC, which will deliberate on the matter towards the end of January. The Government of India (GOI) has asked Facebook to decrypt messages, citing national security and asserting that terrorists cannot claim privacy. Tech giants argue that they are not obliged to share the user data and any leeway given to the security agencies will weaken the security architecture and render it vulnerable to hackers and cyber criminals. The government reiterates that Section 69 of the Information Technology Act allows it to issue directives for decrypting any data transmitted or stored in a computer. Earlier, it had threatened BlackBerry with closure in 2012, forcing it to share user data.The JPC, hence, has a daunting task ahead, balancing the needs of State security against individual privacy. Giving entry to security agencies will compromise the encryption grid and data of millions. The State has to collaborate with tech giants in using the meta-data more meaningfully and for meeting other requirements without breaking the encryption.The Data Protection Bill also does not touch upon State surveillance methods. Who watches over the watchers? How can an officer of the same rank give permission to another for snooping? And how can another in the same system oversee its justification? Should there be a judicial oversight? The proposed Data Protection Authority (DPA) requires more teeth. The selection committee should include a member of the Opposition and judicial and technical members. DPA also needs to be strengthened by the inclusion of judicial and technical members.India must give a clear signal to the world that it respects and cherishes individual privacy and freedom of expression, and establish a harmonious balance between the State security and individual privacy of its 740 million internet users.Yashovardhan Azad is former IPS officer and Central Information Commissioner The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/data-bill-the-security-vs-privacy-debate-101611406252249.html
24-01-2021||Chandigarh||MC polls: Development issues matter in Mohali’s ‘new’ sectors||For around 50,000 residents of sectors 76 to 80 under Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA), development issues matter the most in the upcoming Mohali municipal corporation elections.Even though these sectors came up much after other zones in the city, lack of basic amenities has been a major grouse for the residents.People have become used to the damaged roads, non-functional streetlights, badly maintained parks and stray animals on the loose. Schools, markets and community centres had been planned but no projects have been initiated. “We have decided to vote for candidates who will assure us of proper development of the area. Despite our repeated requests to carry out development works, GMADA does not take any action,” said MP Singh, president of the Residents’ Welfare and Development Committee, Sector 79.The committee’s requests for a school, dispensary, community centre and local bus service have remained unheard. Sampooran Singh, president of the Sector 78 Resident Welfare Association, said he felt he was living in a village and not in a city as roads in the area were badly damaged and parks had wild overgrowth. “Streetlights are missing too. We are requesting the party candidates to assure us that they will prioritise development and basic amenities of our area,” he said.Most of the roads in these sectors have not been recarpeted for several years. Stray cattle too were accident risks with neither GMADA nor the MC taking any initiatives to keep the animals off roads.No action has been taken against the owners of these animals that are actually domesticated but let loose to graze in parks or areas close to main roads.There is no market in Sector 80, and people have to travel a considerable distance to get regular supplies. The mini market in Sector 79 has no toilets for shopkeepers, residents complain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mcpolls-development-issues-matter-in-mohali-s-new-sectors-101611512949937.html
24-01-2021||Chandigarh||4 years on, project to treat effluents in Dera Bassi yet to take off||It has been more than four years since the foundation stone of the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) was laid at Saidpura village for scientific disposal of effluents from pharmaceutical units in the Dera Bassi area, but the project has failed to take off. Residents of 12 villages, including Bhankharpur, Issapur, Pragpur, Bakerpur, Ibrahampur, Dhanounani and Bhora had moved the Punjab and Haryana High court alleging that chemically polluted water was being discharged in the Dera Bassi drain. They blamed the state government for not taking action against the polluting units. The petitioners alleged that sewage discharge from factories was flowing into drains nearby and polluting the groundwater and, therefore, the tubewell supply.The Dera Bassi municipal council had leased out four acres of land for the project, which was to be executed by Mohali Green Environment Private Limited, an association of around 10 pharmaceutical companies.The firm had assured that the completion deadline would be March 2018, and in 2019 finalised local company Bantech Water Private Limited (formerly Bansal Envirotech) for engineering work. But even though Bantech readied the requisite documents for the project, it did not get the all-clear from the association.“We are pressuring the association to come up with a plant soon. It claims to be holding talks with two companies and hopefully they will be finalising things in the next two weeks,” said Satwinder Singh Marwaha, chairman of the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) .Nav Rattan Munjal, director of Mohali Green Environment Private Limited said they would choose a company in a week’s time and start work on the project.Commenting on the matter, Siddharth Bansal, CEO of Bantech, said, “We received a letter of award from the association, finalising us as an implementing agency for the said project. We are in the process of finalising certain terms and conditions and will be in the implementation stage very soon.”Plans for the project were drawn out in 2014 and in April 2016, Manpreet Singh, the then chairman of PPCB, laid the foundation stone of the Rs80 crore plant at Saidpura that would cater to other villages close by.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/4-years-on-project-to-treat-effluents-in-dera-bassi-yet-to-take-off-101611512948696.html
24-01-2021||Chandigarh||3 booked for attack on former Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh’s office||Three men with alleged links to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) were booked by police for attacking the Sector 79 election office of former Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh on Sunday afternoon.Mohali senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh attributed reasons for the attack to personal enmity, saying three men had been booked under relevant sections. Their names were Sukhwinder Singh Shindi, former President of a truck union in Mohali, Jagtar Singh Zinda and Baljinder Singh Golu. Kulwant Singh, who heads the Azad group that’s contesting the upcoming Mohali municipal corporation (MC) elections, alleged that 30 to 35 men armed with sticks and sharp edged weapons attacked his office, leaving two or three of his workers with minor injuries. Investigations were continuing in the case, the SSP added. Zinda’s mother is contesting the MC elections from Kharar on a SAD ticket. Giving details of the attack to the media, Kulwant Singh, flanked by former SAD councillors Parminder Singh Sohana and Sukhdev Singh Patwari, alleged that the attackers arrived at the scene saying they were supporters of farmers and would gherao (surround) his office. They were followed by other men in vehicles armed with swords and sticks.Sohana alleged that as the men started vandalising the office “I tried to pacify the attackers but they were not listening to me. I repeatedly asked them to talk and reveal the motive of their attack, but instead they manhandled and attacked me with swords.” Calling it a “political vendetta against me and my group by the opposition,” Kulwant Singh said: “They have sensed that they will lose the elections so they have stooped low and sent goons to threaten us.”He said a complaint had been made and names of the attackers given to police with CCTV footage of the incident “in which faces (of the attackers) were clearly visible.”Countering the charges, SAD’s Mohali election convener Charanjit Singh Brar said: “The allegations levelled by ex-mayor Kulwant Singh and Parvinder Sohana are a result of excessive excitement whereas the entire episode is that of kisans gheraoing the office as the former mayor used the kisan (farmer) symbol for his party, which farmers see as taking undue advantage of their agitation. So, kisans came to gherao their office and Sohana went there with his armed men, which resulted in a scuffle. Allegations against SAD are purely baseless and frivolous.” Kulwant Singh parted ways with SAD on January 11 and 26 other party leaders resigned later in his support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3-booked-for-attack-on-former-mohali-mayor-kulwant-singh-s-office-101611512889020.html

24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Vice-President’s office seeks draft schedule for Panjab University senate elections||The office of Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is also the Panjab University chancellor, has sought a draft schedule for the senate elections.“You are requested to provide us a draft schedule for the elections to the senate of the university for placing before Vice-President of India/Chancellor of PU,” reads the letter addressed to vice-chancellor Raj Kumar on January 21.The development comes after the varsity had conveyed to chancellor’s office that the process of conducting the senate elections has been initiated after receiving the nod from the Chandigarh administration. Earlier, the chancellor’s office had sought a proposal from the varsity on its further course of action with regards to the polls.On January 18, PU had written a letter to the chancellor’s office to inform that the UT administration has conveyed that it has no objection to the conduct of senate polls. The varsity had also stated the process has been initiated by seeking permission from other six state governments (Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan), where polling booths of different constituencies of the senate have to be set up.According to the letter, PU has said that the final election schedule will be proposed after the receipt of permission from the respective states. Moreover, the varsity has already requested the Punjab assembly speaker to elect two members from among themselves to the senate.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the chancellor, two are from the Punjab legislative assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected. The four-year term of the previous senate ended on October 31 last year. The term of the syndicate, PU’s executive body, also ended on December 31. Its members are elected from among the senators. Hence, the university is now functioning without a governing body.Ever since the senate elections were postponed – first in August and later in October last year – there have been a series of protests on the campus demanding immediate polls.Former senator Ashok Goyal said: “Neither the vice-chancellor nor chancellor has any role in the election schedule. Only the date of polling is to be announced. This is a tactic to delay the elections.”“The university should conduct the polls immediately, or things will come to a standstill after January 31,” said former senator Navdeep Goyal.PU registrar Vikram Nayyar said: “The university will take appropriate action as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vicepresidents-office-seeks-draft-schedule-for-panjab-university-senate-elections-101611512589032.html

Kharghar police have arrested four accused in the case. According to police, the complainant Pratik Ravindra Aher, 24, a real estate agent, told police that he had come from Pen to Vashi, Navi Mumbai on his two-wheeler, to enjoy the weekend. “Around 10pm, he was returning via the Sion-Panvel highway when he decided to take a break and smoke a cigarette near Kopra village. The four accused demanded his phone, money and bike but he refused to give them. One of the accused then took out a gun and shot Aher in the leg before fleeing the spot,” said an officer from Kharghar police station. Police arrested Vipin Thakur, 19, Gopal Singh, 23, Abhinandan Sharma, 23, and Muchan Thakur, 19. They were staying at Kopra, Sector 10, Kharghar. Local police and the crime branch started an investigation and checked CCTV footage of the area to find evidence. Footage from Kopra village showed four people moving around suspiciously. “We checked with the locals and found out that on Saturday, only four people arrived to stay in a chawl room. We laid a trap and arrested the accused. The firearm and bullets were also seized from them. The accused later confessed to the crime and told police that they needed money to set up a hotel,” said a police officer.Police said Aher had suffered bullet injuries on his left thigh. An alert passerby informed the police and the victim was taken for treatment to MGM Hospital in Kamothe.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is scheduled to attend the event in Noida on Monday at the Noida Haat in Sector 33A, located right in the heart of this industrial town.This is the first time that any Uttar Pradesh chief minister will attend an event for the state’s foundation day in Noida. The state government celebrated the day with an event in Lucknow on Sunday. The authority has been painting city walls, central verge, repairing footpaths along roads near the venue and cleaning each nook and corner of areas in and around Sector 33A. The Noida Haat that houses shops for the state’s weavers and handloom workers has been decked up.“The chief minister had inaugurated the Rs101 crore indoor stadium on January 24. During Monday’s event, some more projects will be initiated while some others which are ready will be opened for public use. We have made all arrangements for the event,” said Rajeev Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority.According to the authority, the CM will inaugurate 40 projects worth a total of ₹295.66 crore for the city.

In the case of Festival City, the developer could not finish the project and the buyers’ association is also not interested in taking it up. Therefore, the Rera has decided to hand it over to the Noida authority,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman of the UP Rera.The Festival City project is spread over 25 acres and has space for shops, offices and residential villas. It was launched in 2012 and supposed to be delivered by 2016, but the developer could only construct the civil structure of commercial space. Since March 2019, the UP Rera has been hearing a plea filed by homebuyers against the promoter without reaching to any conclusion. It had also offered the buyers’ association an opportunity to complete the project but the move failed to yield results.“The buyers’ association can take over and finish if the realty project is at an advanced stage. Since this project needs a lot of construction work to finish, the buyers’ association is not interested in it. As per rules, the buyers’ association has first right of refusal to take over such a stuck project,” said Kumar.Noida authority officer on special duty Rajesh Kumar said, “We will look into it once we receive instructions from Rera.”Buyers said that they are not in a position to finish and deliver the project due to multiple reasons.“We lack technical experience and expertise and do not have adequate finances to finish such a big project. In view of all these issues, we refused to accept the offer made by the Rera,” said a buyer.As per RERA, the promoter required Rs380 crore to finish this project which had high-end residential villas. The promoter told Rera he invested around Rs160 crore out of the Rs380 crore and constructed steel pillars to build structures for the commercial project. Bhasin Group promoter SS Bhasin, who was developing this project, is behind bars in connection with a fraud case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-rera-hands-over-stuck-realty-project-to-noida-authority-after-buyers-refuse-101611511567824.html
24-01-2021||Noida||Driving hundreds of kilometres, farmers brave odds to participate in tractor parade||Ghaziabad/Noida: Love Preet Singh, a 27-year-old farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh, drove his tractor for almost a day to cover about 435 kilometres with his group to reach UP Gate on January 23, to participate in the protesting farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day. Hundreds of farmer groups are headed to UP Gate from different parts of UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab to be a part of the proposed tractor parade.Singh said his group consisting of 70 people and 14 tractors drove through jungle areas around his village in order to reach UP Gate. Most farmer groups are using the NH 9 and the Delhi-Meerut Road to reach UP Gate in Ghaziabad.“There were restrictions in our area as officials were persuading us not to go for the tractor parade. However, we gave them the slip and drove about 20 kilometres in a nearby jungle area and then headed to UP Gate. Later, our families called us up and said that officials were surprised to know how the tractors slipped out silently. It was a bit difficult initially but there was no stopping us. The work for sugarcane crops in fields is still going on but we left everything behind,” Singh said.“Each of the tractors consumed diesel worth about ₹7,000 for one side of the journey. But we took out our savings as each of us wanted to be a part of this historic event. This is our second outing to UP Gate. Initially, we came in hired cars in December and then went back. This time our families did not come but our children were eager to join us,” he added.Hardeep Singh, an 18-year-old man from Lakhimpur Khiri who has completed his class 12 studies, is a first timer at UP Gate. He said he wants to learn agriculture techniques by meeting other farmers there and will pursue farming later on.“The farming sector is being modernised, and I wish to implement the same to my farmland, besides continuing my education. During the entire 24 hours journey, we faced harsh weather and chill, besides dense fog. But we kept on moving, covering ourselves with blankets. With the ongoing agitation, I feel that issues of farmers which had been on backburner have become talking points and this will benefit the farming sector,” he added.Hundreds of tractors along with trolleys have started lining up at the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway and the beeline has now extended up to the NIB-crossing (Noida) beyond the Khoda Colony area on the expressway.Dilbagh Singh, another farmer from Lakhimpur Kheri, said that if the demands of farmers for repeal of the three new laws are not met, they have other plans in place after the tractor rally.“After this tractor parade, we will start growing limited crops and it will only be sufficient for our families and for families of our labourers. This will mean that we will stop growing extra crops and supplies will thin out. It will be another mode of protest from farmers in coming time,” he added.Kashmir Singh, who is a farmer and member of ‘Chandra Youth Club’ from Amroha, also arrived at the UP Gate driving his tractor for ten and half hours to cover a distance of about 150 kilometres on NH-9.“Our group has come with 70 tractors while only 30 tractors stayed back in our village, Chandra, for use in fields or for any emergency use. If need be they also will be called to UP Gate. With our savings, members of our group have procured yellow-coloured t-shirts with the slogan “I love kheti” (farming). Our tractors will bear the National Flag and also the flag of our club,” he added.The farmers joining the UP Gate protesters were allotted tents by the UP Gate farmers’ committee while many have come with their trolleys attached, on which they have set up small huts covered with tarpaulin for shelter.“We have asked our farmers to come with trolleys and bring food items for about five-seven days.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||As temperatures remain low, Mumbai records very poor air quality||After a week’s respite from poor quality air, Mumbai's air quality deteriorated over the weekend. As temperatures remained relatively low, an overall air quality index (AQI) in Mumbai was measured at 310 on Sunday, which was in the 'very poor' category.On Sunday, Mumbai’s overall air quality was only slightly behind Delhi’s air quality where an AQI of 339 was measured. Last Monday, Mumbai had recorded the cleanest air this year with an AQI of 156 (moderate). However, on Saturday, the AQI dropped to 320 and continued to remain 'very poor' on Sunday.The AQI is a pollutant measuring indicator that is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded across 10 locations in the city and the suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as 'good'; 51-100 as 'satisfactory'; 101-200 as 'moderate'; 201-300 as 'poor'; 301-400 as 'very poor' and above 400 as 'severe'.Six of the 10 locations measured an AQI that was in the 'very poor' category. Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 374, closely followed by Andheri where an AQI of 340 was recorded.Also read: Covid vaccine tracker How many are inoculated in India and the world“Owing to the presence of high pressure in western India, calm winds are prevailing in Mumbai and the surrounding regions. Additionally, regional contribution of winds in Mumbai is predominantly from oceanic air which is carrying pollution and dust from north-west India. This condition is leading to very poor AQI in Mumbai. With movement of high-pressure system to the west, the condition will be relaxed slightly which is going to improve the AQI to 'poor' for Mumbai in the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Days and nights were pleasant in the city and the suburbs with temperatures remaining low. The minimum temperature at Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was 17.4 degree Celsius, which was a degree above normal. At Colaba, the minimum temperature was 20 degrees Celsius, also a degree above normal.Maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 31.3 degrees, which was a degree above normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 29.6 degrees Celsius, which was at par with normal.KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD, said, “From Monday, minimum temperatures are likely to fall in parts of north-central Maharashtra and Mumbai, Thane regions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/as-temperatures-remain-low-mumbai-records-very-poor-air-quality-101611511198252.html
24-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad officials yet to confirm route for farmers’ tractor parade||Ghaziabad: Confusion prevailed over the final route of the farmers’ tractor parade as officials of the Ghaziabad police and district administration on Sunday night said they received no communication from the Delhi Police regarding the route. The farmers’ leaders, however, said they also have plans for one route with them which was also decided upon by Ghaziabad officials. The tractor parade is scheduled for the Republic Day on Tuesday even as the Delhi Police on Sunday gave an in-principle approval to agitating farmers to carry out their tractor rallies in the national Capital from three border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur (UP-Gate) -- on Republic Day Detailing the route for Tuesday, the Delhi Police said farmers at Singhu Border will cover 63 kilometre and their rally will pass through places such as Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Kanjhawala, Bawana, and KMP Expressway before returning. The rally from Tikri will pass through Nangloi, Najafgarh, Jharoda, and KMP Expressway and cover a distance of 62.5 kms. The farmers at Ghazipur will drive their tractors through Apsara border, Hapur road, Kundli Expressway (Eastern Peripheral Expressway) while covering a total of 68 km. The protesting farmers on January 7 had also carried out a tractor march at the EPE which led to major disruption in traffic.Since a major part of the tractor parade will be led through the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh in Ghaziabad, it was expected that the Ghaziabad officials would release the route and diversion plans on Sunday. “We are not in knowledge of the route issued by the Delhi Police as they did not convey it to us till late Sunday. Once we receive any official communication from them, we will release the route plan of the tractor rally in Ghaziabad,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad, also said that there was “no official confirmation of route from the Delhi Police.” On the other hand, members of the farmers’ committee at the UP Gate protest site said they have a plan in which it is proposed that the parade will move from UP Gate/Ghazipur to Anand Vihar and further to Apsara Border, from where the rally will proceed to Mohan Nagar, Meerut tri-crossing before proceeding to Duhai interchange of the EPE. “At EPE, the rally will move towards the Dasna interchange of EPE and thereafter travel back to UP Gate. The Ghaziabad officials were also part of the meeting when the route was chalked out. We have also proposed that from UP Gate/Ghazipur, we wish to move to Akshardham and then take a U-turn to return to Anand Vihar from where the original route will be followed,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of the UP Gate farmers’ committee. The farmers’ leaders on Sunday afternoon also went to Delhi to have a look at the route. Rakesh Tikait, another farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that the tractor parade will start once the Republic Day parade at Rajpath ends.“We agreed to it as we have no competition with our soldiers and armed forces. We can happily take out our parade once they complete their parade at Rajpath. The Delhi Police also told us that both the parades cannot go on simultaneously. So, we will start our tractor parade after the Republic Day parade ends. Our parade will also march tableaus showing poor farmers. After ending our tractor parade, we have no plans to stay in Delhi and will return to our protest site,” he said. “There were allegations that the farmers were “anti-nationals”. So, we are holding our parade to give a reply to all such allegations. Our tractors will march, and we will be holding the tricolour. We had come here thinking that we will have to stay here till April/May. But now we think that we will have to stay here till October/November. Our farmers and tractors have increased in numbers in the past couple of days,” Tikait added. The farmers at UP Gate had been on protest since November 28, 2020 and have also been occupying the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway since December 3, 2020.

According to the residents, four break-ins took place over a span of four days. “There were four burglaries between January 16 and 19, three of which were in the same block. Since October last year, there have been 11 such incidents, and most of them have not been worked out by the police,” said Pradeep Kumar, chairman, residents welfare association, Jal Vayu Vihar.He said that one of the blocks where seven of the incidents have occurred has a separate gate. The police suspect insiders’ role as most of the cases have taken place when the occupants were out only for a few hours. Following the incidents, RWA has decided to shut a few gates in the area. But not all residents agree with the step.“Our house was broken into during the lockdown when most of the gates were locked. So, this is not a guaranteed solution. Several residents in the area are retired defence personnel and senior citizens. People are concerned about their safety, and some concrete actions need to be taken to ensure that the problem is resolved,” said Shyam Bajpayee, a resident of the area.The residents alleged that the break-ins are happening despite the presence of a police post inside the colony. Recently, upon requests by the residents, the police have heightened surveillance and two police personnel in civil clothes have been posted in the area.“We have a few leads and we will work out the cases soon.

24-01-2021||Noida||GB Nagar district gears up for higher turnout in Covid-19 vaccination||NOIDA: Taking note of less than 50% turnout during the second session of Covid-19 vaccination on Friday in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district administration has decided to convince the health-care workers, including the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and sanitisation workers, about the efficacy of Covishield being administered to them. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that there is a general hesitancy among health-care workers about the efficacy of the vaccine. “We are also running the information campaign launched by the Centre to clear their apprehension about the vaccine. We are also planning to share, through digital media, experiences of senior doctors of the country who have taken Covid-19 vaccine,” he said. During the second session of the first phase of the vaccination drive in the district, Covishield could be administered to only 2,059 persons against the target of 4,200 health-care workers. Similarly, during the inaugural session on January 16, 393 health-care workers were vaccinated against the target of 600 personnel.  The DM further said that the health department could not ensure 100% participation of health workers due to some network issue. “Since Co-Win app is a key component of Covid-19 vaccination, the system needs a steady internet connection to upload the details of beneficiaries and their doses. Our vaccination officials could not make any amendment in the lists made many days ago. We have decided to resolve it by adequate number of data entry operators with laptops at all the vaccination booths in the coming sessions,” he said. As many as 4,200 persons will be vaccinated each on January 28 and 29 in the district. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that after the analysis of low turnout in vaccination on Friday, it was found that while nursing and paramedics of some private medical institutes were more reluctant, the ASHA and Aanganwadi workers could not get the information on time. “While in some government hospitals, 85% health workers were inoculated, the turnout was little over 10% in some private hospitals. Also, many of the shortlisted beneficiaries, who has gone on leave after working as corona warriors for nine-odd months, could not participate in the vaccination. In the next two sessions, we’ll increase the number of booths to include them,” he said. Some doctors believe that higher officials should get the jabs themselves to inspire confidence in safety and efficacy of the vaccine. “There is a lack of administrative consensus on vaccine. To inspire confidence among the reluctant health workers, the higher officials of the district, including the DM, the commissioner of police and the CEOs of development authorities, should also take the shot,” said a doctor of a private hospital, preferring anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-district-gears-up-for-higher-turnout-in-covid-19-vaccination-101611510188454.html
24-01-2021||Noida||Noida coldest in NCR, cold wave conditions to return||Noida: With a maximum temperature of 13.8 degrees Celsius, Noida on Sunday emerged as the coldest city in the national capital region (NCR), data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) showed. On Sunday, Noida recorded the lowest maximum temperature among the NCR cities, IMD officials said. However, the minimum temperature for the city was recorded at 9.8 degrees Celsius against 8.8 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature wend down by five notches, from 18.7 degrees on Saturday to 13.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday. According to the IMD data, the average maximum and minimum temperatures for NCR, based on Safdarjung observatory on Sunday, were recorded at 15 degrees Celsius, six degrees below the season’s average, and 8.8 degrees Celsius, a degree above the season’s average, respectively.While the minimum temperature for Noida soared by a degree Celsius in the past 24 hours, weather analysts said that the minimum temperatures will too fall over the next 24 hours by 3-4 degrees Celsius.IMD has predicted extreme winter conditions for the region till January 28, with dense to very dense fog in the morning hours, moderate to dense fog during the day time, and cold wave conditions persisting throughout the day.“Extreme winter conditions are round the corner due to different meteorological conditions. Sunday saw cold day for most of the NCR, and from Monday onwards the minimum temperature will also begin to fall and may hover around 4 to 5 degrees Celsius. The region will see cold wave and cold day at the same time by January 26. The harsh conditions would persist at least till January 28,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.For a cold day, the maximum temperature should be either below 15 degrees Celsius or it should be 4.5 degrees Celsius below the season’ average. For cold wave, either the minimum temperature should be below 4 degrees Celsius, or it should be below 4.5 degrees of the season’s average.“The reason for the mercury falling is majorly the icy cold north-westerly wind, while the thick layer of fog will block the sunlight. The fog layer will be at surface during the early morning hours and elevate about 300 metres above the surface by the day time. So, there would be no sunlight and earth won’t have any heat to radiate either, all these factors would matter over the next three to four days,” Srivastava added.Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad continued being under ‘very poor’ levels. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida was 322 against 325 a day earlier.

The guidelines state, “The Government of Uttarakhand would widely publicise, as also convey to all other state governments, that devotees with negative RT-PCR test report (test done 72 hours prior to the date of visit) shall only be allowed to enter the Kumbh mela site. The devotees may carry such test reports either on their mobile phones or in hard copies.”It further mentions that all devotees who are desirous of attending the Kumbh mela shall register with the Government of Uttarakhand and obtain a compulsory medical certificate from the nearest community health centre/district hospital/medical college in their state.The Centre further asked the state government to ensure that the healthcare workers and the other frontline workers “engaged during Kumbh mela medical and public health operations are vaccinated on priority in the ongoing vaccination of this group. Only vaccinated healthcare and other frontline workers be deputed for Kumbh mela duties.”Also read: Force Taliban to reduce violence and agree to truce, Afghanistan tells PakistanAs around 10 lakh people are expected to attend the mela on a regular day and about 50 lakh on the auspicious days, the Centre has asked the state government to increase bed capacity across state hospitals.This year, the Kumbh mela would be held in Haridwar. There are six auspicious days - Magh Purnima (27th February 2021), Mahashivratri (11th March 2021), Somvati Amavasya (12th April 2021), Baisakhi (14th April 2021), Ram Navmi (21st April 2021), and Chaitra Purnima (27th April 2021). These days are expected to witness a surge in crowds, congregating at Har Ki Pauri Ghat, for the holy dip.The guidelines mention, “The existing bed capacity of government, referral and private hospitals, all combined, is about 2,800 in Haridwar, Rishikesh and Dehradun. This needs to be substantially augmented. The expected surge of the floating population and the potential outbreak of Covid-19 or other epidemic-prone diseases will overwhelm the existing facilities.”The Centre asked the state government to establish “mega-size temporary hospitals (1000 beds) that would augment bed capacity by at least 2,000 beds...” Testing facilities will also be increased with setting up of mobile testing facilities, including container-based RT-PCR mobile labs within the Mela site and/or at temporary hospitals that would be established.The Central government has said that Uttarakhand government shall widely circulate a statement to all the states well in advance, clearly specifying that vulnerable population (ageing over 65 years, pregnant women, children below the age of 10 years, those with underlying comorbid conditions) shall be discouraged to attend the Kumbh mela.The SOP further emphasises on following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour of wearing face masks and a strict adherence of six feet social distancing norm.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Consider plea to increase awareness on Constitution, laws, Bombay HC asks academicians||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently asked a social activist to approach academicians, central and state government authorities and place his plea before them to spread awareness about contents of Constitution of India, Right to Information (RTI) Act and Consumer Protection Act, among masses before them. The social activist through public interest litigation (PIL) had also sought directions to include such laws as compulsory subjects of education for undergraduate and postgraduate level courses. The bench, however, declined to state that by issuing such directions it would be indulging in judicial over-reach and stepping into the domain of the other organs of the state and disposed of the PIL.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Ravindra Ghuge, while hearing the PIL filed by agriculturist Sanjay Kale, was informed by advocate Pradnya Talekar, that her client had repeatedly written to the Governor of Maharashtra, state higher and technical education department and state universities in Maharashtra for initiating steps for awareness about laws related to public importance and also requesting to make these laws as compulsory subject of education at higher-level studies. However, as his suggestions had not been heeded, he had resorted to filing the PIL. According to the PIL, the Constitution of India, RTI Act and Consumer Protection Act laid down fundamental rights, fundamental duties and other rights including the right to information, right to inspect, right to good services, which are very much essential in day-to-day activities or transactions. Every person living in a democratic India should know about these laws or rights to achieve the goals enumerated in the preamble of the Constitution.The PIL further added that keeping citizens informed was an obligation of the government and was also the responsibility of society to adequately educate every component of it so that the social level is kept up.In light of these submissions, the PIL sought directions to the central government to enforce as a condition of license to all cinema halls to exhibit free of cost at least two slides/messages/short film on important rights and duties in each show undertaken by them and also sought such telecasts on TV and Radio channels including those run by the governments.The petitioner submitted that issuance of such directions would hold significance in the backdrop of the upcoming Republic Day as well. After hearing the submissions, the bench declined to pass any directions and asked academicians and the educational authorities to consider and decide on the activist’s demand. Justifying the stand, the chief justice, while referring to the foreword written by former Chief Justice of India Yashwant V Chandrachud in a book authored by justice KK Mathew, which read, “in our present dispensation, a judge cannot, except for honourable exceptions, lay plausible claim of legal scholarship” said, “We certainly are not exceptions and, therefore, would never dream of claiming legal or any other scholarship. Why we say so is because of the nature of concern expressed in this PIL petition.”The chief justice added, “As judges, we primarily don the hat of an adjudicator. Having regard to the manifold activities concerning administrative work that we perforce are bound to discharge, we also don other hats. An attempt is made by the petitioner by presenting this PIL to make us don the hat of an academician too and interfere in academic matters, a field of activity where we have little or no expertise.”While disposing of the PIL the bench noted, “There could be a judicial overreach and stepping into the domain of the other organs of the state, if we were to entertain the prayers in this PIL petition. We are, therefore, of the considered opinion that the matter must be left to the discretion of the experts in the educational field. The petitioner is granted leave to pursue his remedy before such authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consider-plea-to-increase-awareness-on-constitution-laws-bombay-hc-asks-academicians-101611509048324.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination: First phase in Mumbai may be completed in 1 month||With the boost in the overall turnout of healthcare workers (HCW) for vaccination over the past two days, officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said there was a possibility of completing the first phase within a month. In Mumbai, around 130,000 HCWs have registered for inoculation on the centralised application Co-WIN, of which 70,000 work at private hospitals. Owing to a technical glitch in the app at the beginning, vaccination centres achieved only 50% of its target. Due to this low turnout, the civic body had estimated that it would take almost two months to inoculate HCWs in the city. However, with the introduction of a walk-in option, the overall turnout of beneficiaries has now reached 90% at most vaccination centres like King Edward Memorial (KEM), Rajawadi and Kandivli-based Shatabdi hospitals. As HT reported on Sunday, some centres like BKC jumbo centre and Lokmanya Tilak general hospital (also known as Sion hospital) have increased their vaccination centres to 10 from the initial five. “In the beginning, the turnout was low. Also, we were asked to vaccinate four days a week which wasn’t in the plan earlier. So, we thought it would take two months to complete the first phase. But now, with the rise in the turnout, we are expecting to complete the first phase of the vaccination within a month,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. So far, on a daily basis, the Co-WIN app is regenerating 20-30% names of beneficiaries who were already shortlisted previously for vaccination. BMC officers believe once the glitch is fixed, the turnout will rise further. “We have already sought permission from the authorities to allow us to increase the vaccination centres. With this approval, we will be able to include more peripheral hospitals,” said Kakani. According to BMC, of the 19,194 shortlisted beneficiaries, 13,164 were inoculated at 10 vaccination centres in the past five days of the vaccination. This comes as an overall 68.58% turnout. With the completion of the first phase, BMC will start vaccinating frontline workers from solid waste management and insecticide departments, police personnel and health officers, among others. “We have their list ready. Once, we are almost done with the first phase, we will open the link for their registration,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-vaccination-first-phase-in-mumbai-may-be-completed-in-1-month-101611508868422.html
24-01-2021||Pune||Experts to preserve and maintain heritage Pune railway station building||In a bid to preserve and maintain the heritage site of the Pune railway station building, the Pune railway division is now going to appoint a private agency to maintain the heritage site. It will be the first time when a private expert agency will be appointed for the cleaning and maintenance work of the heritage building by the Pune railway division. “We are trying to consult an expert agency for the maintenance of the main building of the Pune railway station, as it is our important and heritage building. The cleaning and maintenance of the building needs to be done properly, if it would have been normal then our staff would only have done it, but it is a British era building built in stone and needs to be conserved and maintained properly. So, we are now looking for agencies who are working in this field of maintenance of heritage sites and soon they will be hired for the work,” said Pune divisional railway manager (DRM) Renu Sharma. According to Sharma, the main purpose of hiring the agency is for outside cleaning and maintenance of the building. “The offices and rooms on the inside are cleaned and maintained on a daily basis. As it is a heritage site, it needs to be preserved well in that way and should shine when passengers come to the railway station building. We cannot do any changes to the building as it comes under the national heritage sites, but yes we can certainly maintain it in the right manner with the help of expertise.” added Sharma. Pune railway station main building is one of the oldest structures in the city which was inaugurated on July 27, 1925. It is a one storeyed building with the main entrance porch in the middle of it. One platform lies within this heritage building and other six platforms are newly built. A total of 200 train operations are carried out from the Pune railway station (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) and around 2, 00,000 passengers travel daily. Mandar Lawate, city-based historian said, “In 1858, a small building of Pune railway station was built and a single line of railway was running which was started initially from Pune. Later on during 1925, the existing building of the Pune railway station was built and at that time railway track lines were expanded to two, earlier during the era of steam engines, only trains from Bombay to Pune were running. Later, when Pune railway station became a junction, railway lines were increased towards south Maharashtra. Since railway lines increased, platforms increased, electrification of trains was done and the Foot over Bridge (FOB) was built for crossing platforms.” BOX A brief history The train operations at the Pune railway station began way back in 1858. Initially, only one train was running from Khandala to Pune. Later on, when the railway lines were expanded, train operations started to Solapur and Miraj in 1886. The existing building of the Pune railway station which is a ‘national heritage structure’ was built on July 27, 1925.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/experts-to-preserve-and-maintain-heritage-pune-railway-station-building-101611508628807.html
24-01-2021||Pune||Central government proposes Neo, Lite and Water Metro for tier two-three cities||In a major boost to public transport in tier two and three cities, the Central government has proposed Metro Lite, Neo-Metro and Water Metro which will provide an efficient mass public transport system. The proposed metro types are eco-friendly, energy-efficient, cost-effective which are ideally suitable for the traffic needs of tier 2/ 3 cities. Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MoHUA) secretary Durga Shankar Mishra chaired a conference in Pune on the project with urban development principal secretaries of all state governments and union territories. The conference was also attended by the managing director of Maha Metro Brijesh Dixit and the managing directors of all other metro corporations of India. The secretary (Urban Development) of the state government and MDs of all metro companies participated through video conference. Mishra, Dixit, MD Maha-Metro, Alkesh Sharma, MD of Kochi Metro and Bhushan Gagrani, secretary of Maharashtra government were physically present for the meeting in Pune. Mishra said, “India is a very diverse country and cities in India have a population ranging between 10-15 lakhs to 1.5 crore. All these cities need robust, reliable, safe and an environmentally friendly public transport system which will make these cities more habitable. A robust transport is therefore of utmost importance for the growth of any city and hence an appropriate public transport system needs to be proposed, depending upon the size of commuters and the economic activities of the city.” He said, “A metro system which has been built in Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai may not be suitable for tier-2 or tier-3 cities since the commuters are lesser in these cities as compared to the tier 2 or tier-3 cities. The very high Peak Hour Per Direction Traffic (PHPDT) will only justify the rail-based standard gauge metro system. However, the tier-2 and tier-3 cities should have appropriate capacity mass rapid transport system like Metro Lite, Metro Neo and Water Metro. Metro Neo is the rubber tyre based articulated bus system which will draw power from an overhead electric conductor. It will have a dedicated elevated right of way which will ensure un-interrupted mass transit of commuters. Similarly, Metro Lite is very popular in Europe and advanced countries. The Metro Lite is a tram-like system which does not require the paraphernal of a rail-based metro system.” MD Kochi, proposed a water metro system which will be helpful to provide the mass transit system in kayals (creek) of Kerala coast, canals and waterways. Dixit said, “A meeting was also convened for the companies involved in the manufacturing of various components related to the metro, buses, Metro Lite, Metro Neo and Water Metro. In the meeting, emphasis was laid on metro companies for indigenization of coaches under Atma Nirbhar Bharat. Representatives of Alstom, Titagarh, BEML, ABB, Siemens, Electroline, Tooltech, Diamler Benz, Mitsubishi, Knorr Bremse, Secheron, Ansaldo and Faiveley participated in the conference. These companies showed a keen interest in the rolling stock requirement of Metro Lite, Metro Neo and Water Metro. The large-scale implementation of Metro Lite and Metro Neo to tier-2, tier-3 cities of India will transform the way of life of commuters in these cities and improve economic activities in these cities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/central-government-proposes-neo-lite-and-water-metro-for-tier-two-three-cities-101611508627564.html

24-01-2021||Pune||Book on slain RTI activists, murder cases released||At least three accused have been acquitted in the cases of murder of Right to Information (RTI) activists, according to a study undertaken by two journalists, Vinita Deshmukh and Prasanna Keskar. In one particular case, the death was deemed accidental.The findings were compiled in the form of a book and published through a video conference that was attended by former government officials Wajahat Habibullah and Shailesh Gandhi along with activist and founder of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) Sanjoy Hazarika and convenor of RTI Katta Vijay Kumbhar and Sandeep Shetty, brother of slain RTI activist Satish Shetty. “These slain RTI activists are martyred soldiers. This is patriotic. We have to become deserving of the freedom that this law provides us and it is not difficult to do so. We have to simply stand up and support those fighting in place of those killed,” said Habibullah, a retired Indian administrative service officer and former chief information commissioner of India. “The demeaning of RTI activists has been accepted by society without any rebuttal. Instead of right to information, it has become right to history. This needs to change,” said Shailesh Gandhi, also a former CIC and RTI activist. The history of activists who have suffered in the past decade for their work in the Right to information (RTI) was documented in the form of a book titled ‘Life and Death in the time of RTI: Case Studies from Maharashtra’. The book tracks the aftermath of 13 deaths of activists in Maharashtra. The two authors of the report and the resultant book stated in their report, “In recent years, Maharashtra has reported processing RTI applications between 7-8 lakh annually, placing it only second to the Central government’s performance in term of averages.” The 13 cases the two tracked included Satish Bhoja Shetty, killed on January 13, 2010 in Pune; Dattarey Patil killed on May 26, 2010 in Kolhapur; Ramdas-Ubale Gadegaonkar killed on August 28, 2010 in Nanded; Vitthal Gitte killed on April 22, 2013 in Beed; Premnath Jha killed on February 24, 2012 in Thane; Kapurchand Gupta killed on November 12, 2012 in Mumbai; Sunil Loharia killed on February 16, 2013 in Thane; Vasant Patil killed on July 22, 2013 in Mumbai; Abrar Ahmad Ansari killed on December 17, 2013 in Thane; Bhupendra Vire killed on October 15, 2016 in Mumbai; Mohan Waghmare killed on February 24, 2017 in Yavatmal; Suhas Haldankar killed on April 9, 2017 in Pimpri-Chinchwad; Shailesh Nimse killed on April 20, 2018 in Thane. “The son of Dhedgaonkar had burnt all documents that he had gathered through RTI applications after his death. His body was found by the side of the road and deemed as an accidental death eventually by the local police. In the case of Datta Patil, his family had shut the documents in a godown and did not wish to revisit them. It was too painful for both families to revisit the events,” said Keskar while addressing the conference. In the course of filing the report, Keskar met with family members of most of the 13 subjects. While some like Sandeep Shetty have been fighting the fight against the government organisation, some have shut the doors on the work their relatives had done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/book-on-slain-rti-activists-murder-cases-released-101611508568911.html

24-01-2021||Pune||PMC to conduct inquiry into Ramtekdi garbage processing plant fire||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to conduct an inquiry into the fire which occurred at the garbage collection and processing plant at Ramtekdi on Saturday night.A major fire broke out at the PMC garbage collection and processing plant located at Ramtekadi industrial area. The PMC fire department rushed to the spot and used 11 fire tenders and water tankers to douse the fire. The plant was set up four years ago. The capacity of the processing plant was 25 tonnes per day when it was started and now it had increased to 75 tonnes per day. It used the Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) technology to process the garbage. Additional municipal commissioner Dr Kunal Khemnar visited the spot on Sunday along with local corporators. He said, “We visited the plant and took details of the incident. There are close circuit television (CCTVs) cameras here. We have taken the CCTV footage for investigation. We will conduct an inquiry and file a detailed report of the incident. The plant processes daily garbage and produces RDF. Company supplies RDF to different companies to use in boilers. The capacity of the plant is 75 tonnes per day. We found that there was two days of RDF in the plant.”He further said, “We will get a detailed report of the incident in two days. The company had insured the plant. Company officials told us that they will clear all garbage and start planning as early as possible. Prime facie we don’t find any evidence of man-made incidents. It looked like an accidental mishap. However, we are starting an inquiry.”The first unit of RDF was initiated by PMC in 2008. The contract was given to Hanjar to process 1,000 tonnes of garbage per day. The plant was never run on full capacity and it closed down in 2014. The technology used by Hanjar was green technology to recycle mixed solid waste into valuable products (Refuse Derived fuel).At that stage, it was new technology and very few players in the market who had been using this technology and producing RDF. Due to less competition, processing companies were getting good returns. Now, companies have increased in the market and RDF is getting less value in the market.Vivek Velankar, a civic activist, said, “Corporation should conduct an inquiry about the fire incident at the Ramtekdi garbage processing plant. How and when the fire broke and what is the reason behind that. The report should be made public. At present, garbage is the most discussed topic in the PMC. We have already taken objection to appointing an agency to process garbage without bothering to do any tendering to pick a contractor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-conduct-inquiry-into-ramtekdi-garbage-processing-plant-fire-101611508507703.html

The patient was immediately rushed to the hospital’s casualty at around 11:30 on the same day. On examination, it was found that the patient had two anterior abdominal wall defects of two centimetres each above umbilicus with omentum popping out.Dr Ramesh Bhosale, professor and head, department of obstetrics and gynaecology, said, “An ultrasonography was done and was suggestive of hemoperitoneum. We immediately took the patient for exploratory laparotomy and C-section. The patient was managed jointly by obstetricians and surgeons.”“On the opening of the abdomen fundus of the uterus had two injuries of two centimetres each and hemoperitoneum of 800ml was suctioned. We could successfully deliver a live female child of 2.1 kgs. The newborn had two superficial wounds of two centimetres and five centimetres apart on the left buttock. The placenta was posterior in attachment and there were no signs of separation. We did not find any injuries to the rest of the abdominal organs. The patient needed one unit of blood transfusion during operation,” he said.Post the surgery the baby was taken care of by Dr Arati Kinikar, professor and head, department of paediatrics, and her team.“Due to vigilant, quick diagnosis and timely intervention, a live baby was delivered and major complications of hemorrhagic shock and severe blood loss could be prevented. Sassoon hospital is well equipped and ready to handle such emergencies, at any time,” said Dr Muralidhar Tambe, dean, BJ Medical College and Sassoon hospital.“The major complications in road traffic accidents include placental abruption (1.6 per cent), unspecified antepartum haemorrhage (4.7 per cent) and preterm birth (8.3 per cent),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-doctors-save-injured-pregnant-woman-baby-101611508449459.html
24-01-2021||Pune||‘I want to take science to common people through literature’||Jayant Narlikar, an eminent astrophysicist and a writer, has been elected as the president of 94th Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, a prestigious annual Marathi literary meet, which will take place in Nahsik this year. Jayant Narlikar shared his thoughts with selected media representatives. Here are excerpts...Had you ever expected to be the president of the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan? What was your reaction?Honestly, I had never thought I would receive this honour. Mukund Kirloskar, editor of Kirloskar magazine, used to tell me that I could be the president of this literary meet, but I had never thought that it would be true. I feel it is a great responsibility. I want to spread different forms of science through various tools. Literature is an important one.As president of the Sahitya Sammelan, how will you encourage the youth to write more?Even when I didn’t have this honour, I used to take part in various activities which encourage the youth to write. I have always participated in workshops, meetings and various activities. For me, it is another year full of opportunities to do this. I want to take science to the common people. There should be more scientific writing for common people. Some organisations have been working on this. But there is a lot to do.What made you keep writing in Marathi?Literature is a great medium to cultivate scientific temper. One can understand and express better in their mother tongue. Take the example of Albert Einstein, he would start talking in German when he got really excited. That’s why I emphasise on education through the mother tongue. At least primary education must be taught in their mother tongue. It helps develop an interest in Science and Mathematics.Technology has spread but do you think scientific temper in the society has been developed?I am disappointed to say that, I do not see scientific temper. People use modern technology for superstitions. For example, some people use a high tech phone to check Shubha Divas (good day). Technologically advanced tools are not being used to develop a scientific attitude. I still see superstitious thoughts even among well-educated people. It is really disappointing.Do you think this chair will attract more people towards science writing?I really hope that science writing will prevail now. Sahitya Sammelan is a great opportunity to do that. People from various backgrounds and various parts come to attend this event. Interactions take place and I am wishful for using this opportunity to spread scientific temper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/i-want-to-take-science-to-common-people-through-literature-101611508448826.html

The decision in this regard was finalised on Sunday during the meeting of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal members, which took place in Nashik.Narlikar, a well-known astrophysicist and emeritus professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Iucaa) has received many national and international awards and honorary doctorates. Narlikar is internationally known for his work in cosmology, for championing models alternative to the popularly believed big bang model. “His selection was made on the basis of majority opinion of selectors rather than an unopposed one,” said Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal president Kautik Thale Patil. His work has been on the frontiers of gravity and Mach’s Principle, quantum cosmology and action at a distance physics. He has also worked on problems related to quasars, black holes, among others. Apart from his scientific research, Narlikar has been well known as a science communicator through his books, articles, and radio/TV programmes. He is also known for his science fiction stories.Narlikar was awarded Padma bhushan in 1965, at the young age of 26. In 2004, he was awarded Padma vibhushan while in 2011 the government of the state of Maharashtra honoured him with the state’s highest civilian award of Maharashtra Bhushan. In 2014, the Sahitya Akademi, the premiere literary body in India, selected his autobiography ‘Chaar Nagaratle Majhe Vishwa’ for its highest prize in regional language (Marathi) writing.Yakshanchi Denagi, Waman parat na Ala, Antral ani Vidnyan are some of his popular books in Marathi. This is a rare occasion that a celebrated scientist has been chosen as the president of Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan.Eminent writers and former presidents of Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan expressed happiness over Dr Naralikar’s election for this year’s literary meet. Sadanand More writer and former president of the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, said, “In the 70s when his thesis came out, a demand was raised that he should get Bharat Ratna. At that time, Acharya Atre had said that he is our Vishwa Ratna. He is down to earth and he is still connected to the roots. He has not forgotten our mother tongue Marathi language. He has been writing in Marathi to spread scientific information. I congratulate Mahamandal for electing him.”Laxmikant Deshmukh, writer and former president of Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, also expressed optimism after this decision. “He is a well known scientist in the world. Through his simple writing, people started to read science fiction in Marathi. In this period, we have been drifting away from science, it is a very good decision. Scientific temper needs to be prevailed through literature. He should have been elected early.

Sanjay Madhav, state convener, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rajasthan, said the march would be led by 26 trolleys depicting cultural symbols from different states. “In the front, we will have 26 trolleys. These trolleys will include tableaux from different states since people from states such as Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Kerala, among others, are protesting here” said Madhav. He said that while most farmers would proceed ahead for the march, some will stay behind at the protest site. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, and Maharashtra have been protesting at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district since December last year. Another group of farmers is camping at Dharuhera while farmers from Mewat are agitating at Sunehra-Junehra on the Haryana-Rajasthan border. These farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Harvinder Singh Gill, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar, said that cavalcades of tractors had reached the Dharuhera protest spot and additional tractors would continue to arrive till Monday night. He said that the Haryana police had told them that they would be able to proceed for the march from the spot. “We have spoken to the police deployed here and they have given us permission for proceeding ahead. We are expecting tractors from every village in our district to reach Dharuhera by tomorrow from where we will proceed towards Delhi on January 26. Tractors are continuously arriving every hour. They will be joining throughout the night today and until tomorrow. All farmers are looking forward to the tractor march and will contribute to this historic moment,” said Gill. Nearly 4,000 police officials will be deployed at different points across the city ahead of the rally by protesting farmers on Tuesday, said Gurugram police officials. Earlier on Saturday Delhi Police gave permission to the protesting farmers to enter the national capital.“Strict security arrangements have been made as per the orders issued by Gurugram police commissioner KK Rao to maintain law and order in the city,” said Subhash Boken, public relation officer (PRO), Gurugram Police.Maulana Arshad Meel, who is spearheading the Haryana-Rajasthan Mewati Kisan Andalon (movement) protest at Sunehra-Junehra near Punhana, said that farmers had reached out to the Punhana police for permission regarding the march. “We will be proceeding towards Delhi at 9am on January 26. We are in touch with the deputy superintendent of police of Punhana and have shared our plans,” said Meel. He said that while farmers would be starting from Sunehra in Rajasthan, other farmers will be joining from Haryana. “We are expecting a significant turnout on Tuesday. The rehearsal that we conducted on Saturday alone saw the presence of some 200-300 tractors,” said Meel. Rampal Jat, Kisan Mahapanchayat president, said that farmers will be starting their march from Gurugram on tractors on Republic Day. “Farmers will be arriving at Gurugram first and will proceed towards Delhi from here. We have requested all farmers taking part in the march to wear a traditional Rajasthani turban,” said Rampal Jat. He said that the starting point for the march in Gurugram will be decided on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/tractor-rally-to-feature-tableaux-showcasing-cultures-of-states-101611508389575.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||Western disturbance to usher in another cold spell||After a brief respite, another cold spell is likely to return to the city, starting Monday, under the influence of a fresh western disturbance. Officials from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday that the temperature could dip by 3-4 degrees Celsius this week. “From January 25 onwards, very cold northwesterly winds are likely to blow over the plains in Delhi-NCR due to which we can expect a drop in temperatures. The cold spell is expected to persist for three-four days until January 28,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting centre. While the IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record either minimum or maximum temperatures on Sunday, the India Meteorological Department’s AWS, in Palam in Delhi, recorded the day’s minimum temperature at 10.5 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature at 15 degrees Celsius. The Palam observatory, according to the meteorological department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 7 and 16 degrees Celsius respectively on Monday. As per the IMD’s bulletin for the day, the current spell of dense to very dense fog in isolated pockets over Haryana is likely to persist till January 26. The city’s air quality stayed in the “poor” on Sunday with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin recording the air quality index (AQI) at 300 —a deterioration from Saturday’s AQI reading of 285 in the same category. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to deteriorate marginally and remain in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Monday and Tuesday. Subsequently, over the next five days, the air quality is largely expected to remain in the “very poor” category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/western-disturbance-to-usher-in-another-cold-spell-101611508387688.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||Four burglaries across city on Saturday night raises security concerns||Four burglaries reported from Sector 56/57, Palam Vihar and Sushant Lok-1 on Saturday night have raised concerns over security among residents. Members of the residents’ welfare associations (RWA) of the areas said that burglars were able to break in despite the presence of security guards in their areas and deployment of police personnel posted in the vicinity. The police said that only locked houses were targeted. Tushar Bhootra, a resident of Block G in Sector 57 who works in a private bank, said that he had left for Jaipur on January 10 with his family. “On Saturday, I received a CCTV notification on my mobile phone following which I asked my neighbour to visit my apartment. He told me that the doors were broken and the apartment ransacked. I left for Gururgam and reported it to the police,” he said. Two burglaries were reported from Sector 56/57, which, residents say, is one of the most unsafe residential areas. Joginder Singh, former RWA president of Sector 57, said that at least one such incident is reported almost every day. “Almost all the blocks have been targeted once despite regular police patrolling and security guards. We have installed CCTV cameras, but still, the numbers are rising,” he said. The RWA has demanded a thorough investigation by the police and requested an increase in patrolling. Acting on the complaint, two police teams along with a fingerprint expert visited the block and collected evidence from six houses where such incidents have been reported. In the incident reported from Sector 43, the house of one Ankit Goyal, who moved to the city from Dehradun and has been staying in the house with his wife for the past three years, was burgled. On Saturday, the couple left for work around 10.30am and returned around 7pm. “My wife discovered that the house was ransacked and cash and jewellery were missing. Also, other valuables were found to be missing,” he said. The police said they are trying to identify the burglars based on the CCTV footage. “The house break-ins in our area came to light around 6am when some neighbours saw padlocks broken and immediately alerted us,” Bhim Singh Yadav, president, Sector 43 RWA, said. FIRs were filed under sections 454 (house trespass) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code in four instances.The assistant commissioner of police (crime), Preet Pal Sangwan, said “We have formed a special team, comprising an inspector and four personnel, to track down the burglars. Patrolling has been intensified on all roads connecting borders. We have also decided to hold regular meetings with the residents of the area to step up vigilance in light of the incidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-burglaries-across-city-on-saturday-night-raises-security-concerns-101611508388252.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||At 55%, Sunday sees lowest turnout for Covid-19 vaccination drive||Of 1,200 private sector healthcare workers, targeted for the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday, only 660 were inoculated at the 26 sessions sites in the district. This indicates coverage of 55%, the lowest since the vaccine roll-out began on January 16.Health department officials said they are confident of a more successful drive on Monday, with 6,000 public and private sector workers slated to receive the vaccine jab at more than 101 session sites across the district.Sunday’s vaccine coverage is down from 58% the previous day, when 3,055 out of 5,230 targeted inoculations were achieved, and the average vaccination rate of around 77% in the district so far. Officials did not directly discuss reasons for the diminishing turnout, but said that steps to emphasize vaccine safety and efficacy are being discussed. “We are planning more outreach exercises so that public trust in the vaccine can be maintained. There will be a statewide awareness drive about the same on Monday. I have not directly received any queries or concerns from healthcare workers about the vaccine, so I cannot comment on whether there is hesitancy among people,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, Gurugram.However, a medical officer overseeing Covid-19 vaccinations at a session site in Sector 56, said, “Vaccine hesitancy is certainly a problem. I have had to personally reach out to many workers who come under my healthcare centre and answer their questions, about the vaccine itself as well as the differences between Covishield and Covaxin. There are some genuine concerns after the news of a healthcare worker dying after immunisation.”A 56-year-old health worker at Bhangrola primary health centre, who had received a Covid-19 vaccine shot on January 16, died due to cardiac arrest last Friday. The district health department officials said that preliminary findings showed that the death might be unrelated to vaccination as the woman had shown no adverse reaction to the vaccine in the last five days. A final report is awaited in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/at-55-sunday-sees-lowest-turnout-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101611508330216.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||Section of Atul Kataria Marg to be shut for underpass work||A sloping section of the Lt Atul Kataria Marg, where a 700-metre underpass is to come up, will be shut from Monday till February 28 for excavation work, officials said. “We’ll be starting the construction of the underpass from Monday. For this, there we will be a six-metre-deep excavation. The excavation will be done in a sloping manner. Due to the width of the road being extremely narrow, we cannot take any risk of allowing traffic movement on even one lane, as it could lead to injuries or even casualties,” said Puneet Kumar, executive engineer, construction division, Public Works Department (PWD).Between Monday and Wednesday, the closure though would be on a temporary basis to allow commuters to accustom themselves to the route diversions. “There is a high volume of traffic on the stretch. Hence, we cannot close the stretch all of a sudden. There has to be prior notice. We are giving commuters three days’ time to get used to the blockade and the route diversions. Only people with emergencies would be allowed to pass through during this period. From Thursday onwards, however, the section of the stretch would be permanently closed till February 28,” said Kumar.Once the excavation work is completed, work on shifting utilities will commence.As per PWD’s plan, commuters travelling from Atul Kataria Chowk towards Sheetla Mata Mandir will be diverted via Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road and the Bus Stand Road, in the opposite direction.The 700-metre bidirectional underpass is expected to ease congestion between Sheetla Mata Mandir and Signature Towers. Once constructed, commuters travelling from Signature Towers can access the L-shaped underpass near Huda nursery, while those travelling from Sheetla Mata Mandir can access it near Shubh Vatika Banquet hall.A flyover is also being constructed at the junction to ease traffic movement between the bus stand and Kapashera border. The underpass and flyover are expected to cumulatively cost around ₹60 crore. The two infrastructure projects are expected to benefit residents travelling towards the Dwarka Expressway, Gurgaon railway station, Gurgaon bus stand, Kapashera border, Sheetla Mata temple, Signature Towers and the Huda City Centre.The construction of the flyover and underpass was announced in July 2015 but construction was delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/section-of-atul-kataria-marg-to-be-shut-for-underpass-work-101611508329415.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body rejects BEST’s proposal to install 30,000 advertising kiosks on electric poles||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has rejected the proposal of Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) to install 30,894 advertisement kiosks on electric poles in the island city, citing the safety of the pedestrians and motorists. The BEST, on the other hand, has written back to BMC to reconsider the decision as it will cause ₹24 crore loss to the already loss-making transport body. The Congress has alleged that the BMC is helping the private contractor to exit the project by not permitting him. The BEST, before the lockdown, had appointed a private contractor for generating revenue from advertisements from electric poles in the island city. As per the agreement between the contractor and BEST, the contractor is ought to pay BEST ₹8 crore yearly between 2020 and 2023, which amounts to ₹24 crore for a period of three years. However, the contract was given on the condition that the contractor will get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the civic body and Mumbai Traffic Police.Following this, the contractor had applied for the NOC from the BMC before the lockdown. The BMC’s license department recently wrote back stating, “Electric poles are erected on the footpath having narrow access, including the divider on road. Considering the direction of the Bombay high court (HC) dated June 27, 2019, the BMC shall not grant permission for the subject kiosks. Considering the application for installation cannot be approved, it is thus rejected.”The BEST is the electricity distribution company in the island city. Subsequently, the general manager of the BEST, Surendra Kumar Bagde, wrote to BMC stating, “I would like to bring to your notice that BEST is facing huge financial loss, as we provide services in a very economical way. Under these conditions, the revenue from non-tariff and non-ticketing avenues assume the most significance. The advertising revenue through kiosks will be able around ₹8 crore annually. I assure, that our bidder shall abide by all the safety protocols suggested by the BMC. Given the above, I sincerely request you grant permission to all agencies appointed by the BEST.”However, the BMC has relied on the Bombay high court order dating back to June 2019. The BMC, while rejecting the proposal has directed its officials to frame a policy within six months, and has also said that in the larger public interest and public safety the BMC shall forego some revenue.However, Congress corporator Ravi Raja who is also BEST Committee Member and leader of Opposition in the BMC said, “I have written to the BMC that the joint municipal commissioner has rejected the proposal. This denial is a contractor driven decision and this must not be tolerated considering the BEST is already under severe financial losses. I have requested municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal to take action in the matter, failing to which, I shall approach the anti-corruption bureau.”Anand Wagaralkar, joint municipal commissioner of the BMC was unavailable for comment citing his busy schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-rejects-best-s-proposal-to-install-30-000-advertising-kiosks-on-electric-poles-101611508328347.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||Protesters voice objections to WTE plant at Bandhwari landfill||Around 90 citizens from Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi staged a protest outside the Bandhwari landfill site on Sunday, voicing their objections against a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant that is proposed to come up at the site. Residents from Bandhwari and Mangar villages, which are closest to the landfill, besides campaigners from the Aravalli Bachao citizens’ group, raised slogans and sang to mark their objections.The group, which including at least 30 children, detailed its apprehensions over the prospect of a WTE plant in the Aravallis, which would further perpetuate the environmental degradation brought about due to the landfill. Protesters also alleged that environmental clearance (EC) for the proposed WTE has been obtained in violation of the environment ministry’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) rules.Talking about the potential threat to ecology and human health, Dr Sarika Verma, an ENT specialist based in Gurugram, said, “Dioxins and furans generated by WTE plants are among the most toxic substances known to man. Inhaling these can lead to respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer.” Verma also pointed out that fly ash, a residue of incinerated waste, is extremely toxic. “When it is dumped in the open, it contaminates the soil, air, surrounding water bodies and groundwater as well,” she said.Dhir Singh, a resident of Bandhwari village, said, “Ever since this landfill came here 10 years ago, it has completely poisoned our groundwater. A WTE plant will poison the air as well.” Singh also pointed out that in March 2018, when the Haryana State Pollution Control Board held a public hearing for the project, it was not adequately publicised. “No one received any advance notice of a public hearing. Those who did go never received a copy of the minutes of the meeting. As people who will be most affected by the WTE plant, we were never offered a fair chance to voice our objections,” he said.Municipal commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, and additional commissioner, Jaspreet Kaur, did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Sunday. Dhiraj Kumar, the MCG’s joint commissioner, did not directly address allegations made by Sunday’s protesters, but clarified that the MCG is moving ahead with its plan to reclaim the landfill site and that the construction of the WTE plant will commence soon.“Our main issue is availability of land within the demarcated site. At present, there is not enough to start construction of the WTE plant because of the quantity of waste which has accumulated. The process of bioremediating legacy waste has begun and we are trying our best to clear it up soon, so that there is enough land for the WTE plant,” Kumar said.Ecogreen Energy, the MCG’s concessionaire for waste management and the executive body behind the WTE plant, could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Speaking to HT last Thursday, a spokesperson for the company had estimated a time frame of at least two years for the WTE plant to start operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/protesters-voice-objections-to-wte-plant-at-bandhwari-landfill-101611508328859.html
24-01-2021||Gurugram||Groundwater remediation unlikely before landfill is fully reclaimed: MCG officials||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is yet to take steps for remediation of groundwater in Bandhwari village, where an active and unsanitary landfill is alleged to have contaminated the underlying aquifer and the drinking water supply of the area. Officials privy to the matter said the task, despite being mandated by the National Green Tribunal, is unlikely to be taken up before the landfill site is fully reclaimed, but did not clarify when the reclamation process will be completed.In a recent report submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has stated, “Steps for decontamination of groundwater have not been taken by MCG as the dumpsite is active... Groundwater decontamination may be done after removal of contaminating sources.”As part of ongoing litigation in the matter, the NGT, last year, had asked the CPCB to “give its independent report of status (of the landfill) as on 31.12.2020, particularly with regard to ground water contamination and proper manifest system for treatment of leachate...”The ongoing dumping of nearly 2,000 tonnes of mixed municipal waste per day at Bandhwari, along with the presence of at least 3.3 million tonnes of non-bioremediated legacy waste, make groundwater remediation a challenging, if not nearly impossible, task, officials said.Residents of at least two nearby villages, meanwhile, said they are growing increasingly reliant on private tankers and packaged drinking water to meet their needs. They also warned of a possible public health crisis in the nearby settlements of Bandhwari, Mangar, Baliawas, Dera and Gwal Pahari, where groundwater continues to be used for bathing, feeding of cattle, and irrigation. Locals have also claimed a high incidence of cancer and other unusual health conditions as a result of groundwater contamination from the landfill, although this claim is yet to be proven epidemiologically.Dhiraj Kumar, joint commissioner, MCG (Swacch Bharat Mission), confirmed that there are no immediate plans to assess the extent of, or remediate groundwater contamination in the area. “There is not much that can be done about it immediately. Even if one were to try and decontaminate the water table, it wouldn’t get rid of the landfill itself, which is the alleged source of the problem. Our focus is to treat all the remaining legacy waste and process about 20,800 kilolitres of leachate which has accumulated at the site. If we can control the leachate, then there is no threat of groundwater contamination.”In this regard, the CPCB report notes that some progress has been made, with nearly 12,200 litres of accumulated leachate having been successfully treated in the last four months, using three different leachate treatment plants on site. The treated leachate (about 550 kilolitres per day) is then sent to the Behrampur sewage treatment plant for further processing. “Test reports of treated leachate are meeting the standards for treated leachates specified in Schedule II of SWM Rules 2016,” the CPCB report states.Kumar, as well as a senior official in the MCG’s sanitation department, expressed doubts over the extent of groundwater contamination in the area.“There is no evidence of it existing, or existing due to the landfill. We had carried out tests in 2018 as part of an environmental impact assessment, for the waste-to-energy plant, which is going to come up in Bandhwari. The EIA report did not find any presence of groundwater contamination,” said the sanitation inspector, seeking anonymity.However, this claim runs contrary to past assessments. A 2017 inspection by the CPCB, ordered by the NGT, found that the groundwater contained iron, manganese, boron, calcium, chlorides and nitrates in excess of the country’s drinking water standards (IS 10500:2012). An independent report from 2015, by Rekha Singh, an environment expert certified by the Quality Council of India (under the MoEFCC), found that the groundwater in Bandhwari contained calcium, cadmium, magnesium, fluoride, phenolic compounds and mercury in excess of the country’s drinking water standards.Rajender Harsana, a dairy farmer from Bandhwari, said, “There are about 2,000 households in the village. More and more are shifting to getting their drinking water privately, either in the form of tankers or bubble-top packages. I would urge authorities to have a look at the quality of water that our borewells are giving. Buying filtered water is very expensive for most of us. My children drink milk from cows that are given the polluted water. I am worried about the long-term impact this will have on their health.”In August 2019, a report by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute suggested that contamination from the landfill has likely spread downstream via the underlying aquifer, to the neighbouring villages of Mangar, Baliawas and Gwal Pahari. Groundwater samples from 14 locations within a five-kilometre radius of the landfill were found to be “highly contaminated” with pathogenic bacteria and heavy metals in excess of the country’s drinking water quality standards.MCG officials declined to comment on the findings of these reports. MCG commissioner, Vinay Pratap Singh, could not be reached for comment on Sunday despite multiple attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/groundwater-remediation-unlikely-before-landfill-is-fully-reclaimed-mcg-officials-101611508267578.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records very poor air quality as temperatures remain low||After a week’s respite from poor quality air, the city’s air quality deteriorated over the weekend. As temperatures remained relatively low, an overall air quality index (AQI) in Mumbai was measured at 310 on Sunday, which was in the very poor category.According to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), on Sunday, Mumbai’s overall air quality was slightly behind Delhi’s air quality with an AQI of 339.Last week, the city had recorded the cleanest air this year with an AQI of 156 (moderate). However, on Saturday, the AQI dropped to 320 and continued to remain very poor on Sunday.Six of the 10 locations measured an AQI that was in the very poor category. Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 374, closely followed by Andheri where an AQI of 340 was recorded.“Owing to the presence of high pressure in western India, calm winds are prevailing in Mumbai and the surrounding regions. Additionally, the regional contribution of winds at Mumbai is predominantly from oceanic air which is carrying pollution from north-west India and dust. This condition is leading to very poor AQI in Mumbai. With the movement of the high-pressure system to the west, the calm condition will be relaxed slightly, which will improve the AQI to poor for Mumbai in the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Days and nights were pleasant in the city and the suburbs with temperatures remaining low. The minimum temperature at Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) was 17.4 degree Celsius, which was a degree above normal. At Colaba, the minimum temperature was 20 degrees Celsius, also a degree above normal.The maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 31.3 degrees, which was a degree above normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature was 29.6 degrees Celsius, which was on par with normal.KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of the western region, IMD, said, “From Monday, minimum temperatures are likely to fall in parts of north-central Maharashtra and Mumbai, Thane regions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-very-poor-air-quality-as-temperatures-remain-low-101611508148273.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Husband asking wife to drop case against him does not amount to domestic violence, says Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing the pre-arrest bail application of a Pune resident, held that there was nothing wrong in a married man insisting that his wife drop a case of rape and sexual assault which she lodged against him before marriage. The court said that the man had fulfilled his promise of marriage, but the wife insisted on persecuting him even after marriage by lodging a 498A case against him, hence, he deserved to be granted pre-arrest bail in the domestic violence case.A bench of justice Sarang Kotwal was informed by advocate Shivraj Kunchge that his client was married to the woman who had lodged a complaint of rape against him in 2017. In 2018 his client was arrested and released on bail in January 2019, on the condition that he would not contact the woman. However, in September 2019 the woman acceded to his clients’ proposal and they got married. In March 2020, the woman lodged a domestic violence case against the man (her husband).According to the first information report (FIR), after marriage, the couple stayed together in a house provided by the woman’s mother till December 2019. The FIR states that during the period, the man assaulted the woman and kept insisting that she withdraw the rape case against him. Thereafter the woman went to her mother’s house where the husband visited her till March 2020, after which, he stopped visiting her, thus prompting the registration of the domestic violence case against him on November 23, 2020. While seeking pre-arrest bail, Kunchge submitted that the domestic violence FIR had no allegations attracting ingredients of section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The emphasis was on the previous case for which some proceedings are going on and the applicant is already granted bail in that case. He, therefore, submitted that the applicant’s custody in this particular case is not necessary.Additional public prosecutor SH Yadav for the state, however, opposed the application and stated that the FIR did mention instances of domestic violence against the man, hence the application should be rejected.After hearing the submissions, justice Kotwal observed, “Obviously, if both of them are married, the applicant would expect that his wife would not have any accusations against him. That by itself may not amount to the offence described under section 498A of IPC. Apart from this allegation, there are hardly any allegations attracting section 498A of the IPC. The applicant is already granted bail in an earlier case registered at Kondhwa police station. His custodial interrogation on the basis of these allegations is not necessary. The applicant deserves the protection of anticipatory bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/husband-asking-wife-to-drop-case-against-him-does-not-amount-to-domestic-violence-says-bombay-hc-101611508028406.html

She gave suggestions on three main points - safety of children and girls, checking drug usage among youngsters and stopping hill migration in the state.Goswami, on the occasion national girl child day on Sunday, made her suggestions during the child assembly session while she interacted with officials in Dehradun.Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said nominating Goswami as the chief minister of child assembly for a day and organising a session in the state legislative assembly on national girl child day is a matter of pride and respect for all the girls in the state. Rawat said such initiatives would help girls in finding their identity. “Such initiatives will also inspire them to fulfil their responsibilities towards the society. Our girls are shining in various fields and I wish Goswami all the best for her bright future,” he saidGoswami, a student of B.Sc agriculture at a Roorkee-based institution, while symbolically holding the position of the state's CM for one day, reviewed various ongoing government-run development programmes after officers made presentations before her.She was chosen for the honour after she was elected chief minister in a mock ‘Bal Vidhan Sabha’ (children’s state assembly) in a symbolic event organised by the state commission in 2018 for protection of child rights and to help the children understand the democratic system.Also read: UP govt orders no diesel for tractors as farmers gear up for Jan 26 rallyGoswami, while talking to reporters, said she has made many important suggestions, especially with regard to ensuring the safety of children and girls, checking drug usage among youngsters and stopping hill migration in the state.“As the CM, my priority was issues related to children as I know what kind of problems they face. These suggestions will be put before the State Child Rights Commission which will then be conveyed to the CM,” she said.On the episode being similar to Anil Kapoor-starrer Bollywood movie 'Nayak', Goswami said, “That is reel and this is real. I was so excited that it was happening for real. And I must thank our CM Trivendra Singh Rawat for this,” she saidWhen asked whether she would like to join politics in future, she said she is already part of the child assembly. “If an opportunity comes in future, why not, I may join politics,” she said.Goswami said she also raised the issue of safety of girls while they are commuting to colleges. “I asked the DGP to ensure girls feel safe when they go to college and come back home,” she said.The state minister for higher education Dhan Singh Rawat earlier welcomed Goswami and other members of the child assembly at the state legislative assembly.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Not sexual assault if minor is groped without 'skin to skin contact, intent': HC||Groping a minor's breast without "skin to skin contact" cannot be termed as sexual assault as defined under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the Bombay High Court has said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court, in a judgement passed on January 19, the detailed copy of which was made available now, held that there must be "skin to skin contact with sexual intent" for an act to be considered sexual assault.She said in her verdict that mere groping will not fall under the definition of sexual assault.Justice Ganediwala modified the order of a sessions court, which had sentenced a 39-year-old man to three years of imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl.As per the prosecution and the minor victim's testimony in court, in December 2016, the accused, one Satish, had taken the girl to his house in Nagpur on the pretext of giving her something to eat.Once there, he gripped her breast and attempted to remove her clothes, Justice Ganediwala recorded in her verdict.However, since he groped her without removing her clothes, the offence cannot be termed as sexual assault and, instead, constitutes the offence of outraging a woman's modesty under IPC section 354, the high court held.While section 354 entails a minimum sentence of imprisonment for one year, sexual assault under the POCSO Act entails a minimum imprisonment of three years.The sessions court had sentenced him to three years of imprisonment for the offences under the POCSO Act and under IPC section 354. The sentences were to run concurrently. The high court, however, acquitted him under the POCSO Act while upholding his conviction under IPC section 354."Considering the stringent nature of punishment provided for the offence (under POCSO), in the opinion of this court, stricter proof and serious allegations are required," HC said."The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of sexual assault," it said.Justice Ganediwala further said in her verdict that "the act of pressing breast can be a criminal force to a woman/ girl with the intention to outrage her modesty".The POCSO Act defines sexual assault as when someone "with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault".The court, in its verdict, held that this "physical contact" mentioned in the definition of sexual assault must be "skin to skin" or direct physical contact."Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration," the HC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-sexual-assault-if-minor-is-groped-without-skin-to-skin-contact-intent-hc-101611496504698.html

(Agar aap Ram bolne se chukengi to apka Jai Shri Ram ho jayega).Sharma also said he is sending a copy of Ramayana to Banerjee with the hope that she will read the religious text and say 'Jai Shree Ram' with pride."Mamata didi's objection to Lord Ram was not right. Mamata Didi, we expect you to not hate Jai Shri Ram. This country is Lord Ram's. Every person in this country is Lord Ram's. Every Chief Minister of this country is in Lord Ram. You belong to West Bengal, the state where the fight for freedom started. The priest from your state left their worshipping to sing 'Vande Matram' during the freedom struggle," he said."The way you raised objection to Ram, are you under pressure from Bangladesh? Or, would you not say Jai Shree Ram because you are under pressure from extremist Muslims? Don't be under pressure from anyone and say Jai Shree Ram. Because, if you will shy away from taking Lord Ram's name, then you will be finished," he added.Yesterday, Banerjee did not deliver her speech at an event at Victoria Memorial to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose "in protest" to 'Jai Shree Ram' slogans raised when she was invited to speak.She said "government programme should have some dignity" and it "is not fair to insult somebody whom you have invited". The event was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In her brief remarks, a visibly upset Mamata Banerjee said it was a government programme and not that of a political party.Netaji's birth anniversary is being observed as Parakram Diwas in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/aapka-jai-shri-ram-ho-jayega-mp-protem-speaker-warns-mamata-banerjee-101611494976786.html
24-01-2021||City||Tamil Nadu farmers, labour unions to join tractor rally on Republic Day||Tamil Nadu’s farmers and labour unions will also participate in the Republic Day tractor rally in various districts across the state.Farmers and trade union workers will march from their taluks or villages towards the district collector’s office or a prominent location where they will congregate. “Tractors, bullock carts and two-wheelers or whatever vehicle we get, we will carry out a parade,” said AIKSCC state coordinator K Balakrishnan. “Since the tractor is the symbol of a farmer, we want to have a minimum of one tractor in every district but farming districts like Nagapattinam will have hundreds of tractors.”Eight delta districts in Tamil Nadu, including Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Cuddalore, Tiruvarur, will see maximum strength of the rally. There won’t be a rally in Chennai as there is no agricultural land in the capital city but its adjoining district will participate.“Police have been contacting farmers associations and labour unions over the phone since Saturday to ask us about our plans,” said Balakrishnan. “District police have particularly asked owners of tractors not to participate.”Also read: In Tamil Nadu, Rahul Gandhi offers a solution to deal with ChinaCuddalore district police have issued a note that they have received information of farmers planning a tractor rally on January 26 and warned against gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly since a new variant of the virus emerged earlier this month.“Those who organise protests and gather in large numbers will be severely punished as per law as it may cause a surge in cases,” the Cuddalore police’s statement read. “Tractors without permission used in this rally will be penalised according to Motors (Vehicles) Act (1988) under sections 177, 179 and 207 and the tractors will be seized.”Senior Tamil Nadu police said that they have not issued any specific instructions regarding the rally on Republic Day. “We will be following the existing government order that’s in place due to the pandemic,” said Tamil Nadu’s director general of police, J K Tripathy. The order mandates that for any public activity to be conducted, permission must be sought from the district collectors and from the city police commissioner in Chennai. “We will make duty arrangements for whatever activity is permitted by district collectors and if it’s not permitted, law and order action will be initiated.”About 3,000 members from farmers organisations and workers from labour unions of the opposition DMK and Left parties were detained for protesting in Chennai’s Raj Bhavan on Saturday, said Balakrishnan. DMK and its allies have protested and launched hunger strikes in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi. However, the ruling AIADMK government has been in favour of the three new farm bills so the Bharat Bandh called on December 8 was subdued in Tamil Nadu.The state government said that they have not discussed this matter as yet. “The state hasn’t received any information so far we haven’t decided on any precautionary measures,” said AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaichelvan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tamil-nadu-farmers-labour-unions-to-join-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-101611495060645.html

24-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC’s Abhishek Banerjee takes dynastic politics jab at BJP national leaders||Trinamool Youth Congress president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday took jabs at top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, on the issue of dynastic politics at an election rally in his Lok Sabha constituency.“BJP leaders are regularly accusing Mamata Banerjee and me of indulging in dynastic politics. What about them? BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s son is a legislator in Madhya Pradesh. So are the sons of Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and BJP leader Mukul Roy. Suvendu Adhikari was an MLA and minister in this state, his father and elder brother are Lok Sabha members and his younger brother headed a civic body. These people have no right to talk about dynastic politics,” Banerjee said at a rally in Kultali in South 24 Parganas district.Going a step further, the young MP from Diamond Harbour said, “I challenge the BJP. If their leaders declare today that only one member from their families will remain in politics I will leave politics in 24 hours. Only Mamata Banerjee will be into politics from my family. Why doesn’t the BJP introduce a bill in the Parliament on this issue?”Reacting to Banerjee’s statement, the BJP said it was a diversionary tactic on the eve of the assembly polls due in March-April.“Abhishek Banerjee tried to divert people’s attention from raging issues, such as high unemployment rate and lack of industrial growth in Bengal. Who says Singh and Vijayvargiya’s sons cannot be legislators? As far as Roy and Adhikari are concerned, both were in the TMC when members of their families were given electoral nomination,” said Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the BJP’s Bengal unit.Also read: UP govt orders no diesel for tractors as farmers gear up for Jan 26 rallyOn Sunday, Banerjee also singled out Adhikari for calling him an “extortionist” at several rallies held after the former TMC leader joined the BJP on December 19 in presence of Union home minister Amit Shah.“I have with me today a copy of the letter that Sudipta Sen, owner of the Saradha chit fund company, wrote to the chief metropolitan magistrate in Kolkata. Sen alleged in the letter that he gave ₹6 crore to Adhikari. Sen also wrote that he gave money to Adhikari the night before he went underground. Once we come to power after the polls, I will settle the scores,” said Banerjee.“If Banerjee has any proof against Adhikari he should give it to the Central Bureau of Investigation which is probing the Saradha scam. The CBI is not a caged parrot anymore,” said Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmcs-abhishek-banerjee-takes-dynastic-politics-jab-at-bjp-national-leaders-101611491410073.html

24-01-2021||Bangalore||Illegal mining should be stopped across Karnataka, says Yediyurappa||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said that illegal mining should be stopped across the state. If anyone is running mining operations illegally, they should immediately submit an application and the department concerned will verify it, he further said.Yediyurappa's made the comment after his earlier statement asking unauthorised miners to apply for regularisation triggered a major political slugfest.The CM on Sunday said that he's statement was misquoted and mentioned that he had not said that he would legalise the illegal quarries.Pointing out the illegal mining work at the Baby Betta area in the Mandya district, he said that the mining work here is affecting the Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) dam. The Chief Minister said that he had already instructed people to stop the illegal mining in and around Baby Betta."The road and highway constructions require gravels from quarries. But, the crushers should be set up under guidelines and within the legal framework," he added.Earlier, we had faced an acute gravel shortage for construction works; it will not be repeated again, he further said.Yediyurappa said that if the shortage of gravel arises the cost of construction will be raised.The development came after the death toll in the Shivamogga stone quarry explosion increased to six on Saturday.Yediyurappa later commented on the First Division Assistant (FDA) examination of Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC), exam's paper leak incident, and said that he has suspended the officers in connection with the case. "I will order a probe into this and will take stern action," he added.Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSE) on Saturday postponed the First Division Assistant (FDA) examination, which was scheduled to be held on January 24 after six people were arrested and question paper was seized from their possession.Meanwhile, Yediyurappa also reacted on Karnataka farmers' planned protest on Republic Day under Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), a farmers' movement to show support to their counterparts protesting against the farm laws in New Delhi."I will not disturb their protest, but their protest should be peaceful. The BJP government is a pro-agrarian community," he said.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

On Sunday they started to march to Mumbai.SSKM convenor Ashok Dhawale said the agitation was an attempt to expand the two month old fight against the farm laws. “We will organise sit-in protests at Azad Maidan. On Monday, we will organise a ‘morcha’ to Raj Bhavan which will be attended by top leaders like Sharad Pawar, Aaditya Thackeray and Balasaheb Thorat,” said Dhawale.Members of labour unions and political parties such as the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Shiv Sena, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) and Communist parties will also join the farmers’ morcha.“Our main demand is repeal of these farm laws and enactment of a law guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSP) across the country along with the withdrawal of electricity amendment bill,” said Dhawale. He added that the agitation will conclude with the hoisting of the national flag on January 26, the Republic Day.Also Read: Farmers march from Nashik to Mumbai to take part in 'Kisan Gantantra Parade'Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since November 26 last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The farmer leaders decided to extend the agitation to state capitals with an aim to sensitise the urban population of the farmers’ plight.Recently, labour unions marched in South Mumbai and held a rally at Azad Maidan in favour of the farmers.

24-01-2021||Patna||RJD led Opposition plans massive human chain against farm laws on Jan 30||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led grand alliance is readying to form a massive human chain on January 30, across Bihar, in solidarity with farmers protesting against the three Central farm laws and in support of other agriculture-related demands.All the GA allies including Congress, CPI-ML( liberation), CPI and CPM, have decided to participate in the event, billed as the first major show of strength by the main opposition bloc, after its narrow loss to the National Democratic Alliance in the recently concluded assembly election despite winning 110 seats out of the 243 on offer.The event is being held to support the demand for repeal of the three farm laws, converting the minimum support price (MSP) regime into a law, withdrawal of draft energy bill, 2020, scrapping the provision of punitive action against farmers for burning stubble and re-introduction of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee Act, scrapped in 2006 by the Nitish Kumar-led government.RJD state president Jagdanand Singh has already directed party’s district presidents to mobilise workers for the event. They have been asked to finalise the spots in their respective districts for formation of the human chain.“The human chain event would be a big show with huge participation. The grand alliance supports the repeal of the farm laws as sought by the agitating farmers and wants to highlight how the farm sector in Bihar has suffered due to scrapping of APMC Act. The preparations are in full swing,” said RJD state president.CPI-ML (liberation) state president Kunal said the human chain would touch all district headquarters, state highways and national highways as well as blocks and gram panchayats and will be joined by leaders and party workers of all GA constituents. He said leaflets have been sent to the party’s district units to publicise the event for wider public participation.“The human chain’s basic aim is to create consciousness that the Central government is working against the interest of farmers by trying to give private players greater control over the agriculture sector. In Bihar, the farmers are not getting MSP on their produce and it’s because of the scrapping of the APMC Act and the mandi system,” said Kunal.Also Read: Bihar’s Congress in charge’s task cut out amid murmurs of split“We are expecting participation of a few lakhs of people in the human chains this time,” he said, adding, the final route chart would be announced on January 25 after the meeting of all GA allies in Patna. “We have a plan to form the human chain in different pockets so that the city’s adjoining areas like Bihta and Maner are also connected,” he added.The Congress, the CPI and the CPM as well as a large number of farmers’ bodies, aligned with the left parties, have also begun mobilising support for the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjd-led-opposition-plans-massive-human-chain-against-farm-laws-on-jan-30-101611464704815.html

They added that they were found to be Covid-19 negative in the RT-PCR test, conducted within two days of their positive report and were told to resume work within a week.Nath’s notice to assembly speaker, signed by five Congress MLAs, said, “Three officers either themselves or on the direction of someone hatched a conspiracy to cancel the notification issued by the assembly secretariat on November 27 regarding winter session. They hatched the conspiracy of fake Covid 19 test at assembly secretariat and MLA guest house and presented the wrong data in the all-party meeting.”“By doing this, they violated the oath of allegiance and true faith to the Constitution of India. They worked against public interest and interrupted the tradition of holding a winter session of the assembly. They have constitutionally breached the privilege of members of the assembly of attending the session and they also interfered in the autonomy and supremacy of the assembly and made contempt of the house by their deeds and false statements,” he said further in the notice.“In the all-party meet, it was said that eight people out of 271 had tested positive in the assembly secretariat while 67 out of 281 had tested positive at the MLA rest house. Out of the 67, a list has been given of 34 employees, who had tested positive.

He had people of all communities in Azad Hind Fauj. Whether you say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Shri Ram', I do not find any difference. Jai Shri Ram is not a slogan to which one should react in an allergic manner," CK Bose told ANI."I think the CM need not have reacted adversely to a slogan whether it is 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Shri Ram'. This is not the day to do any politics. It is a day to celebrate, it is a day to pay homage to the soldiers and martyrs of the Indian National Army," he added.The West Bengal chief minister did not deliver her speech "in protest" during the event at Victoria Memorial to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose after 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans were raised when she was invited to speak.The chief minister said "government programme should have some dignity" and it "is not fair to insult somebody whom you have invited".The event was presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In her brief remarks, a visibly upset Mamata Banerjee said it was a government programme and not that of a political party.The Trinamool Congress leader also said that she was grateful to the Prime Minister and cultural ministry for organising the event at Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-reacted-in-allergic-manner-to-jai-shri-ram-slogans-netaji-subhas-chandra-bose-s-grandnephew-101611456978814.html

On Friday, he was found to be having pneumonia. Considering his age, we have decided to shift him to AIIMS-Delhi on the advice of doctors for better treatment,” RIMS Director Dr Kameshwar Prasad told PTI.Lalu, 72, has tested negative for the coronavirus disease, the doctors said.“He needs specialised treatment and it was a collective decision to shift him to AIIMS, New Delhi,” the former CM’s son, and Bihar opposition leader, Tejashwi Yadav told reporters.Lalu was airlifted to Delhi through a green corridor and all the procedures, including seeking the CBI court’s permission, were completed after the recommendation of the doctors.The RJD leader has been convicted in three fodder scam cases. While he secured bail in two cases, his bail plea in connection with the third is pending with the Jharkhand high court.Tejashwi also met Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren at his residence during the day to seek cooperation of the state government in arranging an air ambulance.Earlier in the day, Lalu’s doctor Dr Umesh Prasad told reporters that the decision to shift him to AIIMS was taken to ensure better treatment. “He is a VIP patient and we don’t have adequate back up here to treat upon in case of exigencies,” Dr Prasad said, adding that there will not be any adverse impact on the leader’s health while shifting him to Delhi. “His lungs were functioning properly and the kidney condition was same,” he said.The former CM was admitted to RIMS with multiple ailments, including kidney ailments, in December 2018.On Friday, Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi, daughter Misa Bharti, sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi reached Ranchi on a special plane after being informed of the veteran leader’s deteriorating health.After meeting his father, Tejashwi told reporters that his condition was worrisome.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/lalu-prasad-yadav-airlifted-to-aiims-delhi-as-health-worsens-101611449780623.html
24-01-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee declines to speak at Netaji event after chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram'||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday refused to speak at an official event attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark the beginning of the celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 124th birth anniversary after “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised just before Banerjee was to start her address.Bose’s birthday will be observed as Parakram Divas (Bravery Day), the Centre has said, and the year leading up to his 125th birth anniversary will be marked by cultural events dedicated to him.Banerjee expressed displeasure at Bharatiya Janata Party supporters at Saturday’s event shouting slogans. She said such an “insult” was unacceptable.With political tension rising in West Bengal, where elections are due in March-April, the tussle between the BJP and Banerjee’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has intensified.On Saturday, after it was announced that Banerjee will address the programme, “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised by some in the audience at the lawn of Victoria Memorial Hall. Prime Minister Modi was present at the event.“I feel a government programme must have some dignity. This is not a political programme but a government programme and it is for the public and all political parties. I am grateful to the Prime Minister that this event is being held in Kolkata. But you have no right to invite someone to a government programme and insult that person. In protest, I am not saying anything,” Banerjee said before raising her own slogan, “Jai Hind, Jai Bangla”, meant to project Bengal’s identity.The BJP said Banerjee’s reaction reflected her mindset of appeasement politics, while the ruling TMC said no one can teach lumpens to be dignified.Speaking after the West Bengal CM, Modi said Centre’s Atmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India, project would have made Bose proud. “The nation is following the path Netaji showed. I often think how Netaji would feel seeing India surging ahead, its army getting modern weapons and planes such as Rafale guarding the nation. How proud he must have felt seeing India giving vaccines to other nations,” said Modi.The TMC’s Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said: “Modi’s speech made the purpose of his visit before the polls quite apparent. But it misfired. It will have no impact on voters.”The BJP leadership saw nothing wrong with the slogans. “None of the dignitaries said anything. Why did she lose her cool? It reflects her mindset of appeasement politics. (She) appeases a particular community before elections,” the BJP’s Bengal incharge Kailash Vijayvargiya told PTI.State Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “By raising Jai Sri Ram slogan in a government function, they have not only insulted her, but also the CM of the state, deliberately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-declines-to-speak-at-netaji-event-after-chants-of-jai-shri-ram-101611448527207.html
24-01-2021||Delhi||HC directs SPCA to take custody of hippo confined with Asiad Circus management||The Delhi High Court Friday directed the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animal (SPCA) to immediately take the 9-year-old hippopotamus who has been illegally kept by the Asiad Circus management and place it in the zoo.The high court also issued non-bailable warrants against the proprietor of Asiad Circus, whose licence had been revoked by the authorities in 2017, to ensure his presence at the next hearing on April 15.Justice Prathiba M Singh noted that despite repeated directions, the proprietor of the circus Riazuddin Khan has failed to take a stand on the issue and has not disclosed the location of the male hippopotamus.“Delhi SPCA to immediately take steps for seizure of hippopotamus from the circus or any other person. Security and assistance shall be provided by the police to the officials of SPCA team going for seizure of the animal,” the court said, asking SPCA to file a report after taking action.It also directed the high court registry to give default notice to Khan’s advocate, who vakalatnama was on record as no one appeared to represent him in the case.The court said if the hippopotamus is seized, it be temporarily placed in Delhi Zoo and if the animal is recovered from some other place and there is problem in transportation, he shall be placed in the local zoo there.It also directed that authorities shall take care of the animal till further orders of the court and listed the matter for further hearing on April 15.The high court was hearing a petition filed by the animals rights organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) in 2018, seeking immediate seizure of the male hippopotamus.It said the hippopotamus was imported by the Asiad Circus company from Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna in February 2015 and was being trained to give "performance illegally" and treated with cruelty.Advocate Aman Hingorani, representing PETA, submitted that the circus has been closed and the management is not likely to appear in the court.The plea said the hippopotamus was forced to live a solitary life by the management of the Asiad Circus for entertaining people, far away from his parents who are in a biological park in Patna.The high court had earlier issued notices to the Asiad Circus, Delhi government, Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Animals Welfare Board and Central Zoo Authority on the plea which also sought that the animal be transferred back to the biological park where its parents are.The average age of a hippopotamus is 40-50 years.The petition has also sought direction to extend the role of the MoEF to frame rules for protection of exotic wild animals, including their exchange, transfer, acquisition and use, to reduce their sufferings.It has said the animal was born in a zoo and was living with his parents and it was "cruel to separate" him from his family and forced to live a lonely life depriving the basic social life.On receiving complaints that a hippopotamus was confined, the organisation conducted an investigation of the circus in September 2017 at Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh and in October, 2017 in Delhi.It has mentioned in its investigation report that the lone hippopotamus was confined in an enclosure which did not meet the minimum space requirements and it was inhabitable, containing murky and filthy water in the tank.It has also said that hippos are aggressive and keeping such an animal at a place like a circus could be a huge risk and threat to human lives."The Asiad Circus is apparently in violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act since it continues to exhibit, train and use animals for performances despite revocation of its registration certificate...," it has claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-directs-spca-to-take-custody-of-hippo-confined-with-asiad-circus-management-101611447867061.html

24-01-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt seeks withdrawal of land scam case against ex-IAS, 2 others||The Rajasthan government has moved an application in court seeking to withdraw a case filed against a retired IAS officer and two other civil servants charged in a case related to alleged irregularities in land allotment. A charge-sheet was filed against the three in 2016, when BJP government under Vasundhara Raje was in power.The three officials are retired IAS officer GS Sandhu, former Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) officer Nishkam Diwakar and Onkar Mal Saini, a serving RAS officer. Sandhu is now an advisor to Rajasthan Cricket Association president Vaibhav Gehlot, son of CM Ashok Gehlot. The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had lodged an FIR on December 3, 2014.The case dated back to 2011, when a Congress government under Ashok Gehlot reversed a decision by the first Raje government in 2005 not to give a single deed to a private firm for three khasras of agricultural land in Jaipur’s Jagatpura area. Khasra is a local unit for measuring land. The three were arrested, but were released on bail. In July 2019, Sandhu and Diwakar submitted a representation to the Gehlot government urging it to review and withdraw the case. On January 19, 2021, an application was moved in court to withdraw the case.In the withdrawal application, the state government said that the probe hadn’t found any evidence to show that the officials had benefitted in any way or been involved in any conspiracy.The BJP criticised the decision. “The government is withdrawing cases against former officials and giving new postings to those who are still serving and facing corruptions charges, said party’s spokesperson Mukesh Pareek. A senior ACB official said the government can withdraw a case in public interest under Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sandhu said: “It was purely an administrative decision taken at the government level and in good faith.” The next hearing is on February 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-seeks-withdrawal-of-land-scam-case-against-ex-ias-2-others-101611445815969.html
24-01-2021||Delhi||AAP says DDA owes civic bodies ₹2,000 cr; BJP says pursuing matter with Centre||The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday alleged that the Delhi Development Authority( DDA), which comes under the Centre, owes more than ₹2,000 crore to the BJP-led north and south corporations.AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj questioned the BJP as to why the corporations had not initiated the process to get the funds back from the DDA.Bhardwaj said, “The DDA, which comes under the BJP-ruled Central government, owes more than ₹2,000 crores to north and south corporations. According to the data, the DDA owed around ₹857 crore to the north corporation till March 31, 2018. Based on this figure, if we calculate, the amount comes to ₹1200 crore today.”He said that the DDA owes close to ₹535 crore to the south corporation.The civic bodies in Delhi — north, east and south — have been run by the BJP for the last 14 years.Bhardwaj said, “The BJP should immediately disclose why they have not taken initiative to get this money from the DDA, despite both the agencies being under them. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta should tell what are the steps that have been taken to bring this money back from the DDA.”The BJP has been blaming the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi for not releasing funds to the corporations due to which they are unable to pay salaries to employees.But Bhardwaj said, “From the time Gupta has become the Delhi BJP chief, he has maintained only one line which is that the Kejriwal government should give some amount to the BJP-ruled corporations. We have witnessed that the corporations have stopped all their revenue garnering ways like collection of property tax, advertisements, toll tax and others. Today, the revenue from these sources is not coming to the corporations but going to the leaders of the BJP.“DDA officials did not respond to HT’s query seeking a response on the AAP’s allegations.Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said, “There is no doubt that several government bodies, including Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Transport Corporation, power Discoms and the DDA owe money to the corporations. But that doesn’t free the Delhi government from paying the funds it owes to the corporations. The corporations are pursuing with all agencies to get their dues and MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj should also ask the Delhi government to release municipal funds and to make Delhi Jal Board, DTC and power discoms pay their dues.”Malhotra added, “We want the Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to tell us when he will pay RS 13000 crore due to the corporations? Where is the ₹26,000 crore of Delhi Jal Board?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-dda-owes-civic-bodies-rs-2-000-cr-bjp-says-pursuing-matter-with-centre-101611433761656.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Indira Nagar in Turbhe 1st Covid-free area in Navi Mumbai||The Indira Nagar area of Turbhe ward has become the first in Navi Mumbai to become Covid-19 free.An area comprising a slum population of around 36,000, Indira Nagar had just seven active cases in January and all recovered on Wednesday. An intensive contract tracing, enrolling local leaders, social workers and general practitioners have helped reduce the numbers, claimed Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC).The area has had 13 deaths so far here. However, there was not a single death after June. The cases in Indira Nagar were at their peak in August and September.Medical officer Maithili Shinde, in-charge of Indira Nagar Health Centre, said that her team made sure that at least 20 contacts of every positive patient were traced and quarantined.“Be it a factory worker or an APMC worker, we made sure that the contacts were quarantined along with the neighbouring four chawls,” Shinde added.With the population largely being uneducated, the major challenge that the medical officers faced was to convince them to get tested and use masks. “We sought help from local leaders and visited the homes of people and counselled them. We had to make them understand the importance of using masks and sanitiser, and reporting to us in case of any symptoms,” Shinde said.Even before the state government had started the drive of ‘My Family, My Responsibility,’ the NMMC had conducted a survey of senior citizens in the area and made a record of those with comorbidities.“This survey was done in June and July, and also conducted a second survey after the state government’s directives. After the posting of Abhijit Bangar as the new NMMC chief, testing centres were increased and we started stressing on testing for all,” Shinde said.The medical officer had conducted an online meeting with around 20 general private practitioners in the area and asked them to alert NMMC if anyone complained of even a common flu.“In this area, normally a person visits a doctor for flu only if the case worsened or they prefer over-the-counter medicines. Already, there was a delay in meeting the doctor and hence we told the private doctors to alert us when such patients came and we sent our ambulance to get the patient to the testing centre. If found positive, the report was sent directly to the doctor,” Shinde said.She had also interacted with the citizens via a Facebook live which was initiated by a local corporator there in order to spread awareness.Till now, Indira Nagar had 228 positive cases, of which 215 were recovered and 13 died. “The health workers worked systematically here. If anyone found positive, their whole machinery came into action. There was no incident of any negligence in the area. We also conducted many drives to distribute essentials to the needy during the lockdown,” Mahesh Kotiwale, Shiv Sena Turbhe region head, said.Gajratai Inkar, a resident of Indira Nagar, said, “We were frequently attended to by the corporation officials and told about the importance of the precautions that need to be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indira-nagar-in-turbhe-1st-covid-free-area-in-navi-mumbai-101611433913386.html
24-01-2021||Delhi||AAP MLA Somnath Bharti gets two years in jail for attack on AIIMS staff||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Somnath Bharti stood disqualified on Saturday after a city court sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment in a 2016 case for assaulting All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) security staff and destroying public property.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey also imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh on Bharti, the MLA from Malviya Nagar. The judge, however, granted Bharti bail to enable him to file an appeal before the high court against the conviction and jail term.Under the Representation of the People Act, a legislator stands disqualified upon being sentenced to jail for a minimum of two years. The membership of the House is lost with immediate effect.Former ASG and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, citing a 2013 judgment by the Supreme Court, said a legislator is disqualified immediately after he has been convicted and sentenced to a minimum two years of imprisonment.“Any MP/MLA or MLC, who gets a minimum imprisonment of two years, stands immediately disqualified according to the Lily Thomas vs Union of India judgment of the apex court. The legislator will have to take a stay on the conviction to remain in the fray. Mere suspension of sentence or the jail term will not suffice,” Luthra said.Reacting to the judgment, AAP said, “We respect the judiciary and have full faith in it. However, we feel an injustice has happened to Somnath Bharti in this case. Somnath is a very popular leader and is loved by everyone in his constituency. He works 24 hours for his people. People in his constituency are quite saddened to hear the news of his conviction.”“Somnath is filing an appeal. We are confident that justice will be done to him at the appellate level,” the party added.Bharti said he believes in the judiciary and would file an appeal against the judgment in the higher court. “I have complete belief in the judiciary. I am preparing an appeal and will file it as soon as it’s ready.”Delhi assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel said Somnath Bharti has not been disqualified as yet.“I am out of Delhi and will return by Sunday evening. I will seek legal opinion for the next step... In any case, as per the tenth schedule, the Speaker gets a time of three months to decide on a disqualification petition for any MLA of the legislative assembly,” said Goel.The court, however, acquitted Bharti’s associates and co-accused Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey for want of evidence. The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint from RS Rawat, the chief security officer of AIIMS.According to the prosecution, on September 9, 2016, Bharti, along with nearly 300 others, brought down a portion of the boundary wall and fencing at AIIMS, using an earth mover.“The court is of the considered view that the prosecution has duly proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt against accused Somnath Bharti,” the magistrate said in the judgment passed on January 22.The court also said the mindset to cause damage to public property and infrastructure is an attack on the common man.“The infrastructure and public property of the country are not of any leader, party or government but these are national assets. The infrastructure is built up with the contribution of every poor, every tax payer, middle class and every section of society. While exercising the democratic rights, people must not forget about national duty to preserve the national assets and resources meant for each and every citizen,” the judge said in the sentencing order.The court convicted Bharti of various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or use of criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 147 (rioting).It also held the AAP MLA guilty under Section 3 (mischief causing damage to public property) of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. The offences carry a maximum punishment of five years in jail.In its judgment, the court said the prosecution had duly proved that the mob which had gathered on September 9, 2016, around 9.45am at the drain behind AIIMS, was intent on demolishing the wall and fencing put up by the hospital.The judge also noted the testimony of Rawat that the mob was led by Bharti where he and some of the unknown members of the unlawful assembly were instructing the earthmover operator to not stop the demolition work despite the complainant requesting them to desist.It also said no document regarding the order of demolition of the wall and fence was produced, nor was any government machinery official accompanying the MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-mla-somnath-bharti-gets-two-years-in-jail-for-attack-on-aiims-staff-101611433170062.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Only 1 Covid death in 24 days in Bhiwandi||The Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation (BNCMC) has recorded just a single Covid death in the last 24 days while the daily case count has reduced drastically.The change is owing to conducting more RT-PCR tests and eliminating antigen tests completely, claimed the BNCMC commissioner Pankaj Ashiya.Since December 30, 2020, there has been only one death in Bhiwandi due to Covid, on Saturday, raising the total deaths so far to 347.Ashiya said, “Since the last three months, we have lowered the use of antigen tests as its reports were not accurate. We decided to only depend on RT-PCR tests to trace the Covid patients on time. In the last three weeks, we have not done a single antigen test. The early identification of cases and treating on time has led to no deaths between Dec 30 and Jan 22.”The BNCMC carries out antigen tests only for pregnant women or those who have to undergo emergency surgery.The neighbouring Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), on the other hand, carries out 700 antigen tests on a daily basis and the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) carries out 4,000 antigen tests per day.The BNCMC carries out around 150-200 RT-PCR tests a day at present and it has the lowest daily case count in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which is less than 10 positive cases per day and, at times zero or one, since December. The progressive cases so far are 6,845.“Our positivity rate is less than one per cent now. Our focus is on sustaining the same and not leading to increase in cases in the future,” said Ashiya.Only one hospital, the Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Bhiwandi, is presently dedicated for Covid patients, where only 3-4 Covid patients are taking treatment while the rest are in home isolation.The Bhiwandi city recorded 170 cases on June 20, 2020, its highest number of positive Covid cases in a 24-hour span. However, it has managed to reduce the count after that.Ashiya claimed that the local community leaders were roped in while Mohalla clinics were opened.“The Mohalla clinics have shut as very few people visited the clinics. The civic body has also shut its Covid centre. There is a positive vibe throughout the city. People are aware now and also act on time,” said Arbaz Shaikh, 40, a resident of Shantinagar, Bhiwandi.Thane exceeds target in vaccination driveMeanwhile, for the first time since the vaccination drive began in Thane, the number of immunisations crossed 102 % on Saturday. With special permissions from the state, the district conducted an increased number of vaccinations within Thane Municipal Corporation, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation and Ulhasnagar civic body.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s statue unveiled in Mumbai||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday unveiled a statue of Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray on his 95th birth anniversary, in Colaba, in presence of his family members and senior political leaders cutting across party lines. For the first time, since the formation of the three-party coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state, top state politicians CM Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, former CM and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray came together to unveil the statue. No speeches were given at the function as it included the only unveiling of the statue. The nine-feet bronze statue is the first of the Sena supremo in the city, where he established his political party and shaped his political life.Chief Minister Thackeray called it an “unforgettable” moment of his life, while Aaditya Thackeray, minister and grandson of Bal Thackeray termed it an “emotional” moment.Read more:PM Modi pays tributes to Balasaheb Thackeray on his birth anniversary“There is a memorable moment in my life. Everyone knows that the Shiv Sena supremo was a great leader of the country and his thoughts will continue to guide us in future also. Throughout his career, he had close ties with many political leaders. I am happy that the senior leaders of all political parties came together today keeping aside the political differences,” said Uddhav while speaking to media persons after the function.The programme brought leaders from opposite sides from the political divide on one stage, including NCP chief Pawar, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, MNS chief and Uddhav Thackeray’s cousin Raj Thackeray, Union minister Ramdas Athawale and Maharashtra Congress president and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.

24-01-2021||Delhi||25-year-old woman kidnapped by two men in a car, strangled to death||A 25-year-old woman, who worked as an accountant at a medicine wholesale shop in Chandni Chowk, was abducted in a car allegedly by two men -- one of them was a friend of hers -- and driven around the city for nearly four hours before being strangled to death and her body dumped at an isolated spot in outer Delhi’s Alipur area on January 19, police said.On Saturday, the police claimed to have solved the kidnapping and murder case after arresting the two suspects and recovering the Santro car in which the murder allegedly took place. The entire crime was planned by the woman’s 24-year-old friend, Ankit (single name), because of a financial dispute he had with her, the police said. The police have no revealed the identity of the woman.According to the police, she wanted to avail of a loan of ₹2 lakh for some personal work and asked Ankit to help her. Around two months ago, Ankit took ₹47,000 from her for helping her get the loan. However, he neither got her the loan nor returned the money, despite her repeated demands, a senior police officer said.“As the woman was pressuring Ankit to return her money and was threatening to file a police case, he planned to kill her and included his friend, Nitesh (single name) in his plan,” the officer said, adding that the woman knew Ankit for the past four years as they worked in the same wholesale shop.Around a year ago, Ankit started working for a different firm, in Chandni Chowk itself, where Nitesh was also employed. Both men belong to Holambi Kalan near Narela in outer Delhi.On January 19, the woman left her workplace for her home in Jahangirpuri. But when she did not reach home and her cellphone remained switched off, her family members filed a missing person complaint. A kidnapping case was registered at north Delhi’s Kotwali police station, said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.While the Kotwali police team was conducting searches, her body was found on January 20 by the Alipur police after they were informed about an unidentified body by a passerby. The body was preserved at the Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospial mortuary for identification purposes.On January 22, the Kotwali police learnt about the body in the mortuary and showed it to the missing woman’s parents, who identified it as that of their daughter.“We added Indian Penal Code’s Section 302 (murder) in the case and began our probe. The call details of the woman’s cellphone were analysed. Through technical surveillance and human intelligence, we caught her friend Ankit who confessed to the crime. His interrogation led to the arrest of Nitesh,” said the officer.About the sequence of the events, the officer said Ankit urged the woman to meet him near the Peeragarhi Metro station on the pretext of resolving their dispute.“Ankit was waiting in the car with Nitesh. He asked her to get in and drove around for around four hours on the pretext of discussing their issue. Around 10pm, the duo strangled her using her phone charger wire and threw the body in Alipur. They took away her phone and purse containing her ID papers and ₹3,400 cash. All items have been recovered,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/25yearold-woman-kidnapped-by-two-men-in-a-car-strangled-to-death-101611432675222.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Placement offers withdrawn, IIT graduates look for jobs on social media||Sumit (name changed), a mechanical engineer who graduated last year with a dual degree from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), has been looking for a job on social media since August 2020. He was among the few lucky students to secure a job in the first week of the placement drive at the institute in December 2019 and was hopeful of joining soon after his graduation, but the offer was rescinded by the company that had hired him.“I’ve applied for a number of positions since then but haven’t received any positive thing yet,” said Sumit, who is among a pool of graduates from various reputed IITs now looking for jobs on social media sites.Last year, most IITs had reported a good round of placements for the batch of students graduating in 2020. However, by August, several recruiters decided to withdraw their offers as their finances had been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.While some IITs are allowing students to take part in the placement drives being held for the current batch, others are providing job leads through alumni networks. However, most of the recent graduates are left in the lurch. “Since August 2020, I have sent a number of mails to placement in-charge and dean of student affairs seeking permission to sit for this year’s placement session, but there has been no positive response. So I have started looking for jobs by highlighting my strengths on social media and job portals,” said Sumit. Despite repeated attempts, the placement cell of IIT-B did not respond to queries.At IIT-Madras, last year’s batch got a total of 1,050 offers, including 126 pre-placement offers (PPOs). Of these, 28 were withdrawn, according to professor CS Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement), IIT-Madras. The institute is now allowing graduates, who lost their jobs or could not secure a placement offer in the previous round, to appear for the ongoing placement season. The institute had also reached out to recruiters to reinstate their offers.In May 2020, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao had made a public appeal to recruiters to not withdraw offers as students, who had secured jobs, would not be allowed to appear for placements again. Over 1,100 students had received job offers at IIT-Delhi during the placement drive of 2019-20, of which 11 were withdrawn. “Students were provided support up to July 2020. Currently, openings for graduated students are available through the office of career services (OCS), alumni networks and notice boards,” said Anishya Madan, head, OCS, IIT-Delhi.However, job options through alumni networks and notice boards are few, said graduates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/placement-offers-withdrawn-iit-graduates-look-for-jobs-on-social-media-101611432893448.html

The police also seized seven weapons, 10 magazines, 97 rounds of bullets, a lorry container, a Tata Sumo sports utility vehicle and 13 mobile phones from them.“The Hudco police in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu has already booked cases against them under Section 395 and 397 of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 27 (1) of Indian Arms Act,” Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjannar told reporters on Saturday.The arrested men were identified as: Rup Singh Baghal (22), Shankar Singh Baghal (36), Pavan Kumar Vishkarma (22) (all from Madhya Pradesh), Bhupender Manji (24) and Vivek Mandal (32) (both from Jharkhand), Teak Ram (55) and Rajiv Kumar (35) from Uttar Pradesh and Lulya Pandey from Maharashtra. Another person, Amit, from Indore in Madhya Pradesh is absconding.Six of the accused wearing helmets carried out a daring robbery at the Muthoot Finance branch at Hosur at 9.30 am on Friday by threatening the office staff at gun point, besides beating up the security guard.“The accused decamped with the loot on two wheelers and reached the Bangalore-Tamil Nadu border, where they packed the ornaments in a box and kept the box in a container vehicle. They proceeded towards Nagpur via Hyderabad – some in the container and others in a Tata Sumo,” Sajjannar said.Following an alert form the Krishnagiri district police, the Cyberabad police kept a watch on the movement of the vehicles.

24-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 4°C fall in temp from Jan 26, cold wave return likely, says IMD||After a brief respite, the capital is likely to return to cold wave conditions starting on Republic Day when the minimum temperature is likely to drop by 3 to 4 degrees Celsius -- the fallout of weather factors at play in the Himalayas and in the northern plains, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.The Western Himalayas experienced widespread snowfall and rain on Friday and Saturday, and an induced cyclonic circulation was over Punjab and its neighbourhood in the plains . A western disturbance loomed over north Pakistan and its neighbourhood as a cyclonic circulation.Under the influence of such atmospheric factors, widespread rain or snowfall with moderate thunderstorms, lightning and hail are likely to lash Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh over the weekend, according to the IMD’s Saturday bulletin.Uttarakhand is also expected to experience similar weather. Light rain and thundershowers are likely in isolated places over north Punjab, north Haryana and Chandigarh until Sunday.“There has been widespread snowfall in the hills on Friday and Saturday. Rain is also likely over north Punjab and north Haryana. From January 25 onwards; very cold northwesterly winds are likely to blow over Delhi which will lead to a significant fall in minimum temperatures. On January 26, 27 and 28, minimum temperature is likely to fall to 4 degree C over Delhi,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting centre.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 20.4 degrees C, 1 degree below normal ,and minimum temperature of 8 degree C on Saturday. Delhi recorded “very poor” air quality on Saturday with an air quality index reading of 326.“Wind speed is likely to reduce on Sunday as wind direction will change from southeasterly to northwesterly tomorrow. During transition of wind direction, wind speed is low which affects dispersion of pollutants. Winds are likely to be northwesterly during next three days blowing at 10 to 12 kmph, not enough for adequate dispersal of pollutants so air quality is likely to be in poor to very poor category for the next few days.,” said VK Soni, a scientist at IMD’s air quality division.Dense to very dense fog is likely over pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the next 4-5 days; and over Bihar, north Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim and Odisha during the next 2-3 days.Cold day or severe cold day conditions are likely over some pockets of Uttar Pradesh during the next 2-3 days and over Haryana during the next 24 hours. Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over north Rajasthan during January 24 to 27 and over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh on anuary 26 and 27, according to the bulletin.According to IMD, a cold day or severe cold day is classified as such on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degrees C below normal.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches less than the season’s normal for two consecutive days.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Rise in turnout prompts Mumbai civic body to increase vaccination units||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has introduced a walk-in option to boost the turnout at vaccination centres in the city after glitches in the Covid vaccine intelligence network (CoWIN) app have lowered the turnout. CoWIN has been developed by the Central government to manage the vaccination drive and many healthcare workers (HCWs) are not receiving notifications for their inoculation appointments despite being registered on the app. BMC has been conducting the mass immunization programme in the city through 10 vaccination centres that have 31 units among them. In the first phase, the civic body’s target is to inoculate 4,000 HCWs daily. However, in the first three days (January 16, 19 and 20), the centres struggled to meet this target and instead barely reached the halfway mark. On Friday, BMC introduced “walk-ins”, which helped centres reach 93% of the daily target. BMC said that while walk-ins would receive vaccinations, priority would be given to those with appointments generated by CoWIN. “With time, technical glitches in the app are getting resolved. Soon, they [beneficiaries] will start getting appointment messages on time. So, to better channel the process, the priority will be provided to the HCWs with appointments; then the walk-in beneficiaries,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. On Friday, a few vaccination centres like King Edward Memorial (KEM) and Rajawadi Hospitals, recorded turnouts of more than 100% of the daily target. Kakani said no beneficiaries would be turned away in such event. “No one will be sent back without vaccination. On Friday, due to the rush, we also provided additional vaccinators for the inoculation. Also, all centres have enough vaccines to immunize more than their targets,” said Kakani. BMC also plans to increase the number of vaccination centres. “We have over a dozen peripheral hospitals who are well equipped to run the mass vaccination process. With the further rise in the turnout, we will start including them among vaccination centres,” Kakani said. As of now, CoWIN has been regenerating 20-30% names of beneficiaries who have already been shortlisted for vaccination daily. “The Central government has been informed about it and they are working on it. Hopefully, it will be resolved within two to three days,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. On Thursday, the Association of Hospitals, a trust comprising private hospitals, had approached BMC, seeking permission to inoculate in-house HCWs in their hospitals under the supervision of BMC auditors. Kakani said no decision has been taken on this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rise-in-turnout-prompts-mumbai-civic-body-to-increase-vaccination-units-101611432292418.html

They will be joined by other farmers on the way. The march will halt at Ghatandevi near Igatpuri on Saturday night and will resume from Sunday morning.“The three farm laws are anti-farmer, anti-people and pro-corporate and we want them to be repealed. We also want a central law guaranteeing remunerative MSP and procurement to be enacted by the central government among other demands,” said Ashok Dhawale, convenor SKM and president All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS).The farmers will gather in Mumbai on January 24, and a massive dharna will be organised at Azad Maidan on January 25, after which a morcha to Raj Bhavan will be held.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||11,500 offenders in Mumbai pledge to not commit crimes||Mumbai Police took stern preventive action against more than 11,500 criminals in the city last year, with a hope that the extensive action on anti-social elements would prevent future crimes and make the city safer. The police are making the criminals sign legal bonds under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), pledging that they would not indulge in any criminal activity. On violating the bond terms, the accused would attract heavy fines or imprisonment. Chaitanya Siriprolu, deputy commissioner of police (operations) and Mumbai Police spokesperson, said the city police made 8,549 habitual and 3,045 hardened criminals sign the bonds under sections 107 and 110 of CrPC till December 18, 2020. “The police have forfeited the deposit/surety of 46 criminals for breach of bond under 110 CrPC and five of them were sent to jail. The deposit/surety of 43 criminals were forfeited under 107 CrPC and seven of them were sent to jail for breach of the bond. The amount of forfeited bond is as high as Rs15 lakh in some cases,” said Siriprolu. The bond amount is fixed roughly equal to the approximate annual income of the offender or his family. “We want to send a strong message to these anti-social elements that the police department would come heavily on them if they do not refrain from indulging in criminal activities. They will now think twice before committing any crime,” the senior officer added. To collate the information of criminals, all the 95 police stations across Mumbai are also preparing a list of the top 25 criminals in their records, such as regular trouble makers, hard core criminals or local goons. After through assessment of their criminal activities, the police officers decide the names of those criminals against whom preventive action is to be taken. The initiative was started by commissioner of police Param Bir Singh and is being implemented by Vishwas Nangre Patil, joint commissioner of police (law and order) last year. The drive was intensified from mid-November 2020. “These preventive actions are not the ordinary ones that the police used to take in the past. To make the action more effective, we have increased the security amount as high as Rs25 lakh,” said Nangre Patil. Earlier, the offender could get away by executing bonds for petty amounts ranging between Rs10,000 and Rs15,000 and would continue with the activities unabated. The bond amount is now increased to bring in a deferent effect in the preventive actions, he added. “The offender has to either deposit the said amount or provide a surety in the same amount through a guarantor who must have assets worth the bond amount. If the offender violates the bond terms and indulge in any criminal act then the bond amount is forfeited or the surety. This has become an effective deterrent,” said an ACP from the central region. The city police are also preparing to take on dreaded criminals by invoking provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act against them. The police chief has the power to send a criminal behind bars for two years under MPDA. Officers said the personnel are being trained on how to prepare watertight cases with strong documentation to ensure that MPDA charges are not legally challenged. “The preventive actions tighten the police’s grip over criminals and they act as a deterrent to keep criminals under control and surely help prevent future crimes,” said Nangre Patil. “Strong preventive actions will be the key factor for effective policing in the city in coming times. Special preventive action drives such as Operation All Over (city-wide raids) would also be regularly done,” said Siriprolu. The 11pm task Every night, all the 95 police stations get an order at 11pm from joint commissioner of police (law & order) directing them to take surprise action on criminals in their areas from 12am to 3am. Nangre Patil has asked all the police stations to carry out surprise raids to nab criminals committing a particular type of crime. “If for one night, the officers are asked to nab burglars, they are given the task of catching chain snatchers the next day. The officers are not privy to the task prior to the 11pm order. Every police station has to then send a daily report of the action taken the previous night to the police headquarters the next morning,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/11500-offenders-in-mumbai-pledge-to-not-commit-crimes-101611431392273.html
24-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil to hold statewide tour to expand party||Two days after expressing his desire to become the chief minister and necessity to expand the party, Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) Maharashtra chief and senior minister Jayant Patil is all set to carry out a statewide tour — ‘NCP Parivar Samwad Yatra’ from January 28. Patil would be travelling to every assembly constituency and all the districts in phases during the tour starting Maoist infested Gadchiroli district.His objective is to strengthen the organisation by having a dialogue with party cadres, discuss what they are dealing with and resolve them. The tour will also help in creating an atmosphere for better coordination with Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners — Shiv Sena and Congress — at the local level, Patil said.In the first phase, he will be covering 82 assembly constituencies situated in 14 districts covering Vidarbha region and parts of north Maharashtra and by travelling around 3,000-km in 17 days. During the tour, he would be attending 135 meetings and 10 public rallies.“It is an attempt to understand issues being faced by the party cadres and resolve them. We have already received around 761,000 suggestions from the party workers through a statewide feedback digital initiative called ‘Abhipray Abhiyan’. The tour will allow us to discuss the suggestions with them in person for implementation. The exercise will help in strengthening and expansion of the party in the coming future,” he told reporters at NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier on Saturday.“As head of the party, I must meet and connect with cadres, review the local situation, encourage them and also revive the organisation where it is not strong,” he added.A few days ago, the state NCP president expressed his aspiration to become the chief minister (CM) of Maharashtra. He said anyone who has been in politics for a long period would desire to become the CM but his party does not have numbers. He also said that party supremo Sharad Pawar’s word would be the final one on the issue.“It is obvious. Everyone in politics would like to become the CM one day, but the decision of Pawar saheb is final for us. We have only 54 MLAs and going by the situation, I don’t believe it is possible to get the CM’s position. We need to improve the number of MLAs, and expand the party,” Patil has said in response to a question in an interview at Sangli.Patil is considered as one of the most trusted aides of the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar. In the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections, he was appointed as head of the state NCP unit in April 2018.During the tour, he will cover Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal, Washim Nagpur, Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon district, where the first phase is going to culminate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ncp-chief-jayant-patil-to-hold-statewide-tour-to-expand-party-101611431212269.html
24-01-2021||Other||PMC fraud: ED arrests top men of Viva Group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday morning arrested the managing director Mehul Thakur aka Monti of Viva Group and the firm’s chartered accountant (CA) Madangopal Chaturvedi in connection with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case. A local court has remanded them to police custody till January 27.Thakur is nephew of legislator Hirendra Thakur. His family promotes the Viva Group. The arrests come after raids at five locations, including at Hirendra Thakur’s Virar office. Hitendra Thakur said they were cooperating with ED, as they had nothing to hide. He has claimed that all their dealings were through cheques and were in black and white. “We are prepared to answer all their queries and are even willing to visit the ED’s office. We have nothing to hide,” he has said. On Friday, ED searched several premises belonging to Viva Group and its associates, including an office and residence of Thakur in Virar, an office in Andheri, and two residential premises of two financial consultants of the group at Juhu and Chembur. The agency claimed it recovered Rs73 lakh and some incriminating documents during the searches. ED suspects that Thakur and Chaturvedi had complete information of the alleged irregularities linked to Pravin Raut, former director of Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, a subsidiary of Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL). HDIL is accused of defrauding PMC Bank of over Rs6,670 crore by fraudulently obtaining nearly 70% of the bank’s overall loans. ED officers suspect that the money routed by the accused was eventually parked in Viva Group. Officers said Chaturvedi was instrumental in carrying out the alleged irregularities and would prepare the balance sheets. He had allegedly also deleted some WhatsApp conversations and sold off his laptop to destroy evidences. ED had launched a money laundering probe in PMC Bank case after Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) registered a criminal case in September 2019 against HDIL, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and son Sarang, former bank chairman Waryam Singh, managing director Joy Thomas, and others for allegedly causing a loss of thousands of crores to the bank to benefit themselves. The prosecution complaint has been filed against Wadhawan and others under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). The investigation also revealed that the Wadhawans, allegedly in connivance with Viva Group, diverted more than Rs160 crore from HDIL to many companies belonging to Thakur’s firm in the garb of commissions. These funds were apparently diverted illegally from PMC Bank, the ED said on Friday. The agency has also initiated investigation in another case against Wadhawan, Sarang and others for allegedly diverting Rs200 crore sanctioned by Yes Bank to a firm, Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd. This loan was allegedly siphoned off by the Wadhawans by showing a fictitious purpose. During the investigation under PMLA, it was revealed that the Wadhawans illegally transferred two commercial properties, of Mack Star, valued at Rs34.36 crore, in Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), to Viva Holding, a company of Viva Group. For the transfer of the said two properties, separate sale agreements dated June 26, 2017, were prepared, in which the sale value for both the properties was shown Rs34.36 crore in total. In the sale agreement, the purchase amount was shown to be paid via 37 cheques by Viva Holding to Mack Star Marketing Pvt. Investigation has revealed that these cheques were never encashed to the account of Mack Star, and Viva Holding never made payments for the purchase of the said property. The Wadhawans had illegally transferred these properties to Viva Group in violation to the article of association of Mack Star. Further, Viva Holding never showed these properties in its balance sheets. ED had earlier stated that the investigation under PMLA had revealed that Rs95 crore had been siphoned off by Raut through HDIL, in active conspiracy and connivance with various persons. The sources of the funds were illegally availed loans or advances by HDIL from the PMC Bank. There was no document or agreement in support of these payments made to Raut. Further, as per the ledger of HDIL, the funds were given to Raut for acquiring land in Palghar area. ED’s investigation also revealed that Raut paid Rs1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri from the proceeds of crime. Of this, Madhuri transferred Rs55 lakh as interest-free loan to Varsha Raut, wife of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut. The amount was further utilised for purchase of flat in Dadar (East), ED said. The agency claimed Varsha Raut and Madhuri are partners in Avani Construction. Varsha Raut has allegedly received Rs12 lakh from this entity as overdrawn capital converted to loan, on a contribution of mere Rs5,625. The loan amount still remains outstanding, ED stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-fraud-ed-arrests-top-men-of-viva-group-101611430972472.html

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Nottingham university graduate contests Maharashtra gram panchayat polls, wins||It was almost a ‘Swades’ moment for 30-year-old Sushant Pawar when he spent time at his native village in Gadadewadi in the Beed district of Aurangabad. A health post sanctioned for the village almost 15 years ago was yet to be constructed and electricity and water-supply was still a huge concern for the entire village. Pawar, a computer engineer from the University of Nottingham and a Mumbai-based restaurateur then constituted the ‘Yuva Gram Vikas’ with six others which won the recently held gram panchayat polls in the state. “I was born in the village but when I saw that nothing has changed in the last three decades, I decided to take it up. Our panel’s agenda was also simple - we will concentrate on water supply, electricity, building a hospital and constructing houses for the poor in the next five years,” said Pawar.The restaurateur also belongs to a family with a bureaucratic background. While his father retired as the municipal commissioner of Vasai-Virar corporation, his uncle still works with the state government. “Even if my family works for the government, I will never understand the system, unless I am a part of it. I am sure I will get to learn a lot if I start at the grassroots level,” he said.Maharashtra’s 12,711-gram panchayats went to polls on January 15. For gram panchayat elections, the candidates usually form local-level panels that fight the elections. HT had earlier reported that this year, a large number of young men and women with no political affiliations, contested and won the elections. While many of the young guns are from the village, there are also candidates like Pawar, who moved out of their village to work in the cities.

24-01-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Highest 1-day turnout in Delhi as 86% beneficiaries get jabs||Delhi on Saturday recorded its highest single-day turnout in the Covid-19 vaccination drive, with 6,967 health care workers out of a target of 8,100 receiving the shot, as two districts recorded 100% turnout.With Delhi’s vaccination rate jumping to 86% on Saturday – one week since the national roll-out – the government is set to take a call on increasing the number of sites where the shots will be administered in the coming week, according to people with knowledge of the matter.The number of sites may be increased in hospitals where the vaccination rate has risen to 90% or above, and more in addition to the current 81 will begin their counters on Thursday.“Now that there has been an increase in the vaccination rate, the government will take a decision on whether more sites will be started in hospitals that have increased their vaccination rate to 90% or more. In addition, some of the hospitals that had been removed from the initial shortlist where the drive was to be rolled out will also open up their sites. A decision will be taken on Wednesday,” a senior official from Delhi’s health department said.The jump of 17 percentage points when compared to Thursday’s vaccination number was largely due to the government’s Co-WIN platform being tweaked to allow out-of-turn jabs for registered beneficiaries.Cumulative vaccination data for Delhi since January 16 shows that the Capital has so far inoculated 10.75% of 240,000 health care workers identified and registered with the government.Northeast Delhi topped the list as the number of beneficiaries it vaccinated on Saturday exceeded its target. The district vaccinated 206 people instead of 200, a trend not seen in any other district in Delhi so far.This was followed by the Shahdara district, which completed its target of administering the jabs to 600 health care workers. Shahdara had vaccinated the least people on Thursday.“Delhi has had five days of Covid-19 vaccination till now and after the first 2-3 days of low turnout, things have started looking up since Thursday. We have inoculated a total of 25,762 (61%) health care workers so far in the Capital, out of the target of 42,578,” a senior health official said, asking not to be named.Also Read| Only 35% health care workers in Delhi's Shahdara district have got jab so farOn Saturday, three districts reported over 100% coverage for centres giving Serum Institute of India’s Covishield – Shahdara, South, and North-East Delhi.At the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences in South district, 110 people were vaccinated on Saturday. A senior doctor said, “Initially, there were a lot of negative reports about the vaccines in the media and people were concerned. However, when they saw senior doctors and staff take it, they were convinced.”At South district’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), where Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is being administered, 67 people received the shot on Saturday. “Health care workers wanted to wait and watch to see whether there were any adverse events and when they saw that the vaccine was safe, others came forward,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.Delhi on Saturday reported 24 cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), of which one in South-West district may be categorised as “severe”.The beneficiary, a 35-year-old woman, had initially complained of a pain in the arm, which was categorised as a “mild” AEFI. However, she later developed chest pain, nausea, and low blood pressure and was given adrenaline. “Whether it will be categorised as mild or severe will be discussed tomorrow,” said a senior district official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-highest-1-day-turnout-in-delhi-as-86-beneficiaries-get-jabs-101611429514775.html

24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Only 35% turn up for Covid vaccine in Chandigarh||Even though two more vaccination sites were operationalised in Chandigarh, the pace of inoculating healthcare workers against Covid-19, which was gradually picking up during the week, witnessed a dip on Saturday. Only 345 of the targeted 1,000 beneficiaries turned up at the eight vaccination sites during the day, accounting for the lowest achievement rate of 34.5% since the nationwide drive began last Saturday. The city had reported a sudden jump to 66% on Friday from Thursday’s 55%, prompting the health department to operationalise more vaccination sites. The idea was to increase the number of eligible beneficiaries and bring down the number of healthcare workers yet to be covered. Chandigarh’s overall achievement rate stands at 52.5% so far.Tepid response continued to be witnessed at the two sites at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, as only 28% beneficiaries got the jab on Saturday. At the two sites at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, 21% turned up. The old site at Government Multi Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, recorded 65% achievement rate, while the civil hospital in Sector 45 saw 100%. At the new sites — one at GMSH and the other at the Manimajra civil hospital — only 18.5% of the 200 targeted beneficiaries came forward to receive the shot.“We are spreading awareness among health workers to remove doubts and misinformation about the vaccine. Most doctors have been administered Covishield shots, and we are trying to reach out to other healthcare workers as well,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department.In order to make the process more convenient, if any employee misses the jab on the designated day, they can come on any day of their choice to get vaccinated, said Dr Nagpal, adding that till now only seven cases of minor adverse effects have been reported among the beneficiaries in the city. 2,712 inoculated in Mohali so farDr KK Talwar, adviser, health and medical education, Punjab, was among 392 healthcare workers who took the Covid-19 vaccination in Mohali on Saturday. “Go for the vaccination. There is no need to fear,” said Dr Talwar, while motivating others. He also stressed upon the need to educate people and allay apprehensions about the vaccine. Aashika Jain, additional deputy commissioner, said 2,712 healthcare workers have been vaccinated in the district so far. She said 924 were vaccinated at nine session sites on Friday, while 392 turned up on Saturday despite a holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/only-35-turn-up-for-covid-vaccine-in-chandigarh-101611429292285.html
24-01-2021||Delhi||Police give ‘in principle’ nod for Republic Day tractor rally in Delhi||The police on Saturday gave an ‘in principle’ nod to farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders to carry out their proposed “tractor march” on Republic Day, covering a distance of around 100km within the national capital.Delhi Police did not officially share details of conditions that were laid down for granting permission for the rally.A police officer, privy to the meeting between police and farmers, said, “The approval was given in principle for now. The farmers will have to give a signed undertaking that they will not enter the New Delhi and central Delhi areas on Republic Day. The proposed routes will be in the vicinity of places where farmers are already protesting, but within the national capital. They will also have to give an undertaking that the rally will not disrupt Republic Day arrangements. We will speak to them again tomorrow.”Police teams will escort the tractors on the day of the rally to maintain law and order.In the undertaking, the farmers will have to share details of the number of tractors, timing of their rally, number of protesters and their day’s plan, among other details. Police will then verify the undertaking and issue a “written permission.”According to farmer leaders, police have allowed them to enter the national capital from five different routes that will be decided by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — a group of several farmer organisations protesting against the three new farm laws across the country— by Sunday.Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan said farmers will enter Delhi from all the existing protesting sites — Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, Shahjahanpur, and Palwal. “The farmers will enter the national capital on January 26 and take out a parade on Republic Day for the first time. It will be historic… There won’t be any fixed duration for the parade since all tractors coming from different parts of the country will participate in it,” he said.Yadav said the farmers will cover a distance of over 100km in Delhi during the parade. “All farmers will return to their protest sites afterwards. There is no plan to stay in Delhi. We will take out a peaceful march. It will not have any effect on the Republic Day parade or security arrangements,” he said, adding that the Sanyunk Kisan Morcha will finalise the route and make it public on Sunday.Another farmer leader, Rajinder Singh Bir Singh Wala, said there won’t be any cap on the number of tractors entering Delhi on Tuesday. “We have asked the farmers to prepare tableaux on their tractors and trolleys but their height should not be too much, for safety purposes. All tractors, including those already there at the borders and those coming from different parts of the country, will participate,” he said.But president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Darshan Pal, said the march may continue for two days. “The number of tractors participating in the march is huge. It will take time to finish the march. It might take two days to complete it,” he said.Police officers who attended the meeting said they reached a consensus with the farmers following several rounds of meetings since January 18. “ In principle, we have agreed that the tractor rally will only be in areas around the borders where farmers are on sit-in protests. They won’t come to central Delhi via Ring Road. For example, the tractor rally from Singhu border will enter Delhi and will move around areas such as Alipur, Bawana, Narela, and other adjoining areas. The rally starting from Tikri border will cut through Nangloi, Mundka, Sultanpuri. Similarly, farmers at the Ghazipur border will be allowed to take their rally out in Ghazipur, Anand Vihar, and towards Apsara and Bhopra borders,” a second police officer said.On Saturday, the protesting farmers said they had increased security at protest sites, a day after a man, after being caught by farmers at Singhu border, alleged that efforts were being made to incite violence.Also Read| 'Our march will have no effect on R-Day Parade,' says Yogendra YadavAt the Singhu border, volunteers were seen checking bags and packets of visitors near the main gate area. “Our leaders have asked us to remain vigilant. We are checking the handbags of women visitors also because the man who was caught yesterday told us that there are two women in his group, who are at the protest site in an effort to incite violence,” said a farmer volunteer.On Saturday, volunteers at Tikri border were also seen asking protesters to remain vigilant. Harinder Bindu, head of the women wing of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said, “Efforts are being made to disrupt our protest. All the volunteers have been asked to remain extra careful and keep an eye on visitors. The protesters living in trollies and tents have also been asked to keep a check on their surroundings. Volunteers are also checking bags and frisking people.”Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said that the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has decided to form a team of 2,000 volunteers to keep a vigil during their Republic Day tractor rally. “These volunteers will also be provided uniforms and they will keep an eye out to prevent any untoward incident during the march,” he said.Security up at bordersDelhi police on Saturday increased security at the interstate borders, where farmers are camped. Senior police officers claimed that the security was increased in the backdrop of the full dress rehearsal for the Republic Day.“Unlike previous years, the security is more this year because of the protests. There are chances that criminal elements may try to disrupt Republic Day preparations by posing as protesting farmers. The idea was to ensure that such groups do not get to mobilise and disrupt the dress rehearsal or the preparations in Delhi. The extra security will stay until the completion of the Republic Day celebrations,” one senior office said.The increased reinforcements is also significant because on Friday night, the farmers had held a press conference to allege that the Haryana Police had planted some men among the protesters to fuel violence during the tractor rally on January 26.Also, on Friday afternoon, a farmer who had come to Vigyan Bhawan, got violent and vandalised his own vehicle when police refused to allow him entry since his name was not mentioned in the list of farmer representatives. There was no complaint filed or action taken against anyone in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-give-in-principle-nod-for-republic-day-tractor-rally-indelhi-101611428683598.html

The lab also confirmed the presence of H5N8 virus in samples from four other poultry farms.It was on January 7 that the Bhopal lab first confirmed bird flu (H5N8) at two poultry farms in the area. The following day, the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NRDDL), Jalandhar, sent more suspected samples from four farms to Bhopal for confirmation. The Panchkula administration, too, collected samples from more farms where mortality was high and sent them to Bhopal.“Four samples positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus,” states the report released by the Bhopal institute on Saturday evening, a copy of which is with HT. Confirming the development, Dr Mohinder Pal Singh, director, NRDDL, Jalandhar, said: “Apart from our lab, samples were collected by a team of experts from the central government as well. They have found presence of H5N1, which is the most dangerous. Unlike H5N8 strain, its transmission to humans is more, and hence it must be controlled.” “The fear remains about mutation of this virus (H5N1) inside human beings. No one can tell how it will react after mutation. To avoid a pandemic among humans, this must be controlled at the animal level only,” said another expert, who did not wish to be named.The report further mentions that samples from four farms – Maharaja in Khatauli, Tara-1 and Tara-2 in Batour and Single in Mauli – have tested positive for H5N8 avian influenza virusThe report is addressed to the secretary, department of animal husbandry and dairying, at the Centre and director, animal husbandry, Haryana.Earlier, 81,000 birds were culled at two poultry farms where bird flu was confirmed on January 7 besides another one in the infected zone. The culling operations went on for over a week and concluded on January 17.Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, and director general, animal husbandry and dairying, Haryana, Dr BS Laura did not revert to queries. Darshan Kumar, president, Haryana Poultry Farmers’ Association, insisted that “no new farm has been found infected”.All about H5N1 and H5N8 influenza virusAccording do WHO, H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza.Human cases occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. However, in humans, it can cause severe diseases and a high mortality rate.If the H5N1 virus were to change and become easily transmissible from person to person while retaining its capacity to cause severe diseases, the consequences for public health could be very serious.Avian influenza A (H5N8) viruses have been rapidly spreading, most likely via wild migratory birds in Asia and Europe, in recent months and causing deaths in wild birds and outbreaks in domestic poultry.Human infection with the H5N8 virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low. In fact, to date, no human case of such infection has been detected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-highly-infectious-h5n1-virus-found-in-samples-sent-from-panchkula-101611429053673.html

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will inaugurate the facility on Republic Day. Subsequently, other prisons will be taken up for jail tourism, the minister added.Spread on over 500 acres, Yerawada jail is historic, as several freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose, have been jailed there, Deshmukh said. Terrorist Ajmal Kasab, who was captured and tried for his role in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, was hanged in the jail in November 2012.“In the first phase, we will start jail tourism with Yerawada jail. It has historic importance. Cells where Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Motilal Nehru were lodged will be opened to visitors. Information will be given to visitors about their time in prison. Besides that, the place where the Pune Pact was singed between Gandhiji and Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, will also be made open,” the minister said.The visitors will be charged nominal fees, the minister added. School students will be charged ₹5, while college students will have to pay Rs10. For the general public, the fare will be Rs50. Deshmukh added that the state has ensured that there is no contact between visitors and current inmates during the visits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-open-pune-s-yerawada-prison-for-jail-tourism-101611428812331.html

Indian aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) seems to be taking time before finally allowing 737 Max to operate in the country to fly the planes again.Budget carrier SpiceJet is the only airline having this fleet. It has 13 such aircraft which currently continue to be grounded.Though the country’s civil aviation regulator had taken part in Boeing’s proposal for training pilots to fly the revamped 737 Max in September last year. It is yet to take a call on allowing these planes to fly again.A Delhi-based senior DGCA official said, “We are in no hurry for recommencement of 737Max operations. We will allow the aircraft type in Indian skies only if its safety aspect is assured.”The United States’ aviation regulator- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved the B737Max to fly in November 2020. The Airworthiness Directive (AD) issued by the FAA mentioned the requirements that must be met by airlines operating Boeing 737Max planes. These included; installing software enhancements, completing wire separation modifications, conducting pilot training, amongst others, ensuring that the airplanes are ready for service.American Airlines became the latest carrier to resume flights using the B737 Max, a year and ten months after the aircraft was globally grounded. It operated B737 Max service between Miami International airport and New York’s LaGuardia on December 31, 2020.Shortly, Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) too followed suit. Canada’s transport ministry too announced its approval for 737 MAX to fly again in their country starting January 20, 2021. Reports said that Europe’s civil aviation agency European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) too is expected to approve the aircraft type in the coming week.Boeing’s 737 Max was involved in an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash on March 10, 2019, killing over 180 passengers and crew members. A flight of Lion Air, an Indonesian low-cost carrier, had also crashed in October 2018, leading to suspicion over design faults in the aircraft model. It was after these accidents that the DGCA had stated in March 2019. The statement had stated that no 737 Max would be allowed to enter or transit Indian airspace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/boeing-737-max-unlikely-to-resume-flights-soon-in-india-101611428392555.html
24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Striking waste collectors resume work in Chandigarh, RWAs want charge of garbage collection||A large section of the striking garbage collectors returned to work on Saturday, resuming waste collection in the southern sectors. Taking note of the harassment caused to residents due to the strike running into multiple days, the Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) also called an emergency meeting, where it was sought that waste collection be left to the Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs).The municipal corporation last month took over door-to-door garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30, which did not go down well with the informal cart-based collectors. To lodge their dissent against the move, they stopped picking up garbage from houses in areas beyond Sector 30, causing refuse to pile up at homes and on streets. After MC officials yielded to some of their demands after a meeting on Friday, the garbage collectors decided to return to work.“After detailed talks with MC and realising the inconvenience caused to residents, the garbage collectors decided to get back to work,” said Om Prakash Saini, chairman, Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society that claims to represent 80% of the informal sector.However, Shamsher Lohatiya, president of the local unit of Akhil Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangathan (ABMS), which represents another section of garbage collectors, said they may again go on strike next week if MC didn’t rollback the takeover. A meeting regarding this is scheduled with MC commissioner KK Yadav next week.‘Residents always at receiving end’“Garbage collection and segregation has become a Herculean task for the municipal corporation. Worse, due to their impractical decisions, residents end up suffering time and again, despite paying taxes,” said Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman, FOSWAC. The body’s general secretary JS Gogia narrated how some RWAs had to hire private trolleys during the deadlock between MC and waste collectors.President of the Sector 46-D RWA, Kedarnath Sharma said, “A similar situation should not arise again. RWAs must seek legal recourse against MC for creating disorder in garbage collection. The older system must be fine-tuned rather than introducing a new one.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/striking-waste-collectors-resume-work-in-chandigarh-rwas-want-charge-of-garbage-collection-101611428211415.html

The Chinese-made vaccine is 86% effective, she added.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a dead virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to polio immunizations.The vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration.Egypt has also negotiated for two other vaccines — one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and another from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said last month that the government has contracted to purchase 20 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous country with over 100 million people, has reported more than 161,140 confirmed cases, including 8,902 deaths. However, the actual numbers of Covid-19 cases, like elsewhere in the world, are thought to be far higher, in part due to limited testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-says-it-has-launched-vaccination-against-coronavirus-101611499639465.html

24-01-2021||World||EU will vow to work against fossil-fuel investments globally||The European Union plans to use its diplomatic and economic muscle to accelerate global energy transition away from fossil fuels, as the bloc aligns its foreign and security policy with its ambitious climate objectives.“EU energy diplomacy will discourage all further investments into fossil fuel based energy infrastructure projects in third countries, unless they are fully consistent with an ambitious, clearly defined pathway towards climate neutrality,” foreign ministers are poised to say in a joint communique on Monday. “The EU will ensure that its trade policy and its trade agreements are consistent with its climate ambition,” ministers will declare, according to a draft of their statement obtained by Bloomberg.EU leaders committed last month to cut the bloc’s 2030 greenhouse emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, and affirmed their pledge to turn Europe into the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Alarmed that the bloc’s ever stricter environmental regulations will simply force polluting activities to relocate elsewhere in the world, they are eager to eliminate “carbon leakage” by forcing the rest of the globe to fall in line with the Paris Agreement against climate change.Taxing PollutionThe EU’s executive arm is drafting a law, to be unveiled by June, that would start penalizing imports of certain goods from countries with weak pollution rules, thereby helping to protect the competitiveness of local producers abiding by stricter standards. This push to export climate standards got a boost last week when President Joe Biden moved to restore the U.S. as a member of the Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius through steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.The Biden administration is planning to host world leaders in a climate summit on Earth Day in April, a sign of the new president’s commitment to strengthen the Paris agreements. Biden, who has signaled he wants the U.S. to encourage stronger climate action globally, will likely find the EU as a major ally in his initiatives.“EU and member states’ foreign and security policy will systematically consider climate and environmental factors and risks,” the bloc’s foreign ministers will promise, according to the draft of their statement, which is still subject to changes when they meet in Brussels to discuss the wording on Monday. The transition to clean energy is highlighted as a security consideration, as it will reduce the EU’s “strategic dependencies” on imports from other countries.The pledges are the latest in a series of policy initiatives comprising the so-called European Green Deal, a comprehensive package of measures that will push every sector of the region’s economy toward low and eventually zero greenhouse emissions. Officials in Brussels hope the sweeping overhauls will also help the bloc assert its “strategic autonomy,” which is constrained by the dollar’s dominance in international finance.The European Commission is already on course to become the world’s largest issuer of green and social debt, which will be jointly backed by all EU member states. Brussels expects the issuance will turn the EU into a “global ‘green finance’ hub, bolstering the euro as the default currency for the denomination of sustainable financial products,” according to a policy document unveiled last week.Adding to signs that weaning off dollar dependence has turned into a central policy objective, ministers on Monday will pledge to promote “the use of the euro in energy trading,” according to the draft of their statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-will-vow-to-work-against-fossil-fuel-investments-globally-101611508204887.html

We are fully supporting the authorities," an Airbus spokesman said.On Saturday, health authorities put Berlin's Humboldt hospital under quarantine after 20 patients and staff tested positive for the more infectious variant.The quarantine covered about 1,500 doctors, nurses and technicians working at the hospital as well as more than 400 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-500-airbus-staff-under-quarantine-after-hamburg-covid-19-outbreak-101611507754507.html
24-01-2021||World||US to boost surveillance of Covid-19 virus variant: CDC chief Rochelle Walensky||The US government, including the Pentagon, is stepping up surveillance of coronavirus variants to monitor their impact on Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics, the new head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.“We are now scaling up both our surveillance of these and our study of these,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on “Fox News Sunday.” The agency is working with others, including the Defense Department and the Food and Drug Administration, to monitor the variants, she said.Vivek Murthy, President Joe Biden’s nominee for surgeon general, said achieving broad immunity against the coronavirus by the start of the school year in September is “an ambitious goal,” and that new strains of the disease will require continued masking, social distancing and better government tracking.“It is going to take a lot of work,” Murthy said on ABC’s “This Week.” Many schools don’t have resources to reopen just now, he said. “I do think we can get on a path toward opening schools more safely.”In Chicago, teachers due to return to the classroom were voting this weekend on a resolution to work only remotely, setting the stage for a possible strike in the third-largest U.S. school district.Murthy said reopening schools will also require that the numbers of Covid cases fall, which in turn depends on focusing on the Biden’s administration’s goal of 100 million vaccines delivered in the first 100 days in the office.“That is a floor, it is not a ceiling,” he said. “It is also a goal that reflects the realities of what we face.”Murthy said variant strains of the virus that are starting to show up “are likely to be more transmissible.”“We still need more data” on deaths, he said, adding the larger lesson is that “the virus is basically telling us it is going to continue to change and we got to be ready for it.”That plan requires better genomic surveillance, he said, and doubling down on masking and social distancing.“We’ve got to invest a lot more in testing and in contact tracing,” he said. “We are in a race against these variants, the virus is going to change, and it is up to us to adapt and make sure that we are staying ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-boost-surveillance-of-covid-19-virus-variant-cdc-chief-rochelle-walensky-101611507412206.html
24-01-2021||World||US passes 25 million Covid-19 cases: Johns Hopkins University||More than 25 million Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the United States since the pandemic began, Johns Hopkins University said Sunday, just days after President Joe Biden's inauguration.The milestone was reached only five days after the US, the world's wealthiest and hardest-hit nation, recorded 400,000 deaths from the disease.Biden has made fighting the coronavirus a priority and is pushing for Congress to approve a $1.9-trillion relief package that would include billions of dollars to boost vaccination rates.Biden has said he wants 100 million people vaccinated within his first 100 days in office, and he has called for Americans to wear masks for 100 days.Countries around the world are in a race against time to get their populations inoculated before the coronavirus mutates into a strain that could resist newly approved vaccinations.Vivek Murthy, Biden's nominee for surgeon-general, told ABC News on Sunday that 100 million doses in 100 days was "a floor, not a ceiling" and cautioned about new strains."The variants are very concerning," Murthy told the network."It's up to us to adapt and stay ahead," he added.White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said Biden's administration would "take responsibility" for the trajectory. Former president Donald Trump came under frequent criticism for perceived federal inaction in combating the virus."We're going to set up these federal vaccination centers to make sure that in states that don't have enough ... we fill those gaps," Klain told the NBC News show "Meet the Press.""We need more vaccine, we need more vaccinators and we need more vaccine sites."The US caseload remains by far the world's highest in absolute terms.India, where the population is about four times larger than in the US, has the second-highest caseload with about 10.6 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins.After the first Covid-19 case was reported in the US in January 2020 it took until late April for the figure to pass one million. The overall number of cases has followed an almost exponential curve upwards since then.Xavier Becerra, Biden's secretary of health and human services nominee, likened the Covid-19 trajectory under Trump to a plane about to crash."We've got to pull it up and you aren't going to do that overnight, but we'll pull it up -- we have to pull it up," he told CNN."Failure is not an option here."Last week, Johns Hopkins announced more than 400,000 people in the US had died from Covid-19, a grim marker that came one day before Biden's inauguration.The US has now recorded 25,003,695 million cases, according to the Baltimore-based university's coronavirus tracking website -- though with testing shaky at the start of the pandemic, the real toll is believed to be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-passes-25-million-covid-19-cases-johns-hopkins-university-101611506508275.html

The EU should therefore cut financial transactions from Putin's inner circle, he added.In addition, a threat to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is meant to double natural gas deliveries from Russia to Germany, must remain on the table, Weber added.A German government spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether Berlin was willing to support new sanctions against Russia following Navalny's arrest.EU lawmakers passed a resolution on Thursday calling for the bloc to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline as a response to Navalny's arrest.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has continued to back the project despite criticism elsewhere in the EU, said on Thursday her view of the project had not changed despite the Navalny case.The United States, EU and Britain have all condemned the Russian security forces' handling of Saturday's protests, and the foreign ministers of France and Italy on Sunday both expressed support for sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-should-punish-putin-for-navalny-arrest-by-cutting-money-flows-german-leader-101611503560234.html

In an interview aired on CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’, Dr Deborah Birx told moderator Margaret Brennan that someone was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the former president.“I saw the president presenting graphs that I never made...I know that someone out there or someone inside was creating a parallel set of data and graphics that were shown to the president,” she said.Birx admitted that she could have been more outspoken publicly, adding that she didn’t know “all the consequences of all of these issues.” The American physician said that every time a political leader made a statement that wasn’t consistent with the needs of public health, it impacted the Covid-19 response. She opined that communication is “absolute key” in containing a pandemic, especially when the administration is relying on Americans to change their behaviour.“When you are put into a new situation, you only know one person in the White House and you don't understand the culture of the White House...I didn't know how far I could push the envelope," said Birx, adding that she wished she had pushed harder on testing.Read | Trump virus coordinator Deborah Birx seeks role in Biden governmentAccording to a recently updated US department of state website, Birx retired last Wednesday. Notably, Birx was present during a press conference in April 2020 when Trump had wondered whether injecting disinfectant inside people could be a treatment against Covid-19. “I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it (the virus) out in a minute, and is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside, or almost a cleaning. It gets in the lungs,” Trump had suggested.The news briefing was followed by a surge in hotline calls in the state of Maryland, seeking guidance on Trump’s comments. Trump later asserted that it was a sarcastic comment and should not have been taken seriously by anyone. “It was asking a sarcastic and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parallel-set-of-data-dr-birx-says-trump-presented-graphs-that-she-never-made-101611502564137.html

Kaja Kallas took the reins at the Reform Party in 2018 as its first female chair.The government formation marks the second such attempt for Kallas in less than two years as she failed to bring about a Reform Party-led government after the 2019 election. That paved the way for the archrival Center Party and its leader, Juri Ratas, to form a three-party coalition without the Reform Party.Ratas and his Cabinet resigned on Jan. 13 over a scandal involving a key official at his Center Party suspected of accepting a private donation for the party in exchange for a political favor on a real estate development at the harbor district of the capital, Tallinn.Estonia’s prime minister since November 2016, Ratas won't be part of the new Cabinet. Local media reported earlier that he could become the parliamentary speaker in March.Estonia has been a member of the European Union and NATO since 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kaja-kallas-to-become-first-woman-prime-minister-of-estonia-101611503008108.html

Peskov, however, dismissed the turnout as insignificant.“Now many will say that many people came out for the illegal actions. No, few people came out; many people vote for Putin,” he said.The 44-year-old Navalny, Putin's most prominent and persistent foe, was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where had been recovering from severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin and that Russian authorities deny.Authorities said his five-month stay in Germany violated terms of a suspended sentence that was imposed in a 2014 fraud and money-laundering conviction, which he says is fraudulent and politically motivated.He is to appear in court on February 2 for a hearing on whether the suspended sentence will be converted to 3 1/2 years in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-us-comments-supporting-pro-navalny-protests-encourages-lawbreaking-101611502722021.html

Neither Perry nor Clark, who served as head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division before becoming the acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division in September, could immediately be reached for comment.In a statement to the New York Times, Clark declined comment on his relationship with Perry, and denied trying to oust Rosen, saying he had participated in "a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president."On Saturday, the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Acting Attorney General Monty Wilkinson saying it was launching a congressional probe into Trump and Clark's actions, and asked for the department to turn over documents and communications to help assist their inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-congressman-played-a-role-in-trump-s-campaign-to-fight-election-loss-101611498859662.html

24-01-2021||World||US reaffirms Taiwan support after China sends warplanes||The US has reaffirmed its support for Taiwan following China’s dispatch of warplanes near the island in an apparent attempt to intimidate its democratic government and test the resolve of the new American presidential administration.The US State Department on Saturday said it was concerned by China's "pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbors, including Taiwan.”“We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives," Ned Price, a spokesman for the department, said in the statement.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said China on Saturday sent eight bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons and four fighter jets into its air defense identification zone just southwest of the island. The ministry said China on Sunday sent another 16 military aircraft of various types into the same area.The ministry said Taiwan responded by scrambling fighters, broadcasting warnings by radio and “deploying air defense missile systems to monitor the activity.”There was no immediate Chinese comment on Sunday.The overflights were part of a long-standing pattern of incursions aimed at pressuring the government of President Tsai Ing-wen into caving to Beijing’s demand that she recognize Taiwan as a part of Chinese territory.They come on the heels of President Joe Biden’s inauguration, emphasizing the island's enduring position in the panoply of divisive issues between the sides that also include human rights, trade disputes and, most recently, questions about China's initial response to the coronavirus pandemic.Biden's administration has shown little sign of reducing pressure on China over such issues, although it is seen as favoring a return to more civil dialogue.The State Department statement on Saturday said Washington will continue to deepen ties with Taiwan and ensure its defense from Chinese threats, while supporting a peaceful resolution of issues between the sides.In another sign of support for Taiwan, the island's de-facto ambassador to Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, was an invited guest at Biden's inauguration.And in a final swipe at China, the Trump administration’s outgoing UN ambassador tweeted that it’s time for the world to oppose China’s efforts to exclude and isolate Taiwan, drawing sharp criticism from Beijing.Ambassador Kelly Craft accompanied the tweet with a photo of herself in the UN General Assembly Hall where the island is banned. She carried a handbag with a stuffed Taiwan bear sticking out of the top, a gift from Taiwan’s representative in New York, Ambassador James Lee.Taiwan and China separated amid civil war in 1949 and China says it is determined to bring the island under its control by force if necessary. The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, but is legally required to ensure Taiwan can defend itself and the self-governing democratic island enjoys strong bipartisan support in Washington.Tsai has sought to bolster the island’s defenses with the purchase of billions of dollars in US weapons, including upgraded F-16 fighter jets, armed drones, rocket systems and Harpoon missiles capable of hitting both ships and land targets. She has also boosted support for Taiwan's indigenous arms industry, including launching a program to build new submarines to counter China’s ever-growing naval capabilities.China’s increased threats come as economic and political enticements bear little fruit, leading it to stage war games and dispatch fighter jets and reconnaissance planes on an almost daily basis toward the island of 24 million people, which lies 160 kilometers (100 miles) off China’s southeast coast across the Taiwan Strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reaffirms-taiwan-support-after-china-sends-warplanes-101611497505182.html

During the struggle, one crew member aboard died. It identified the victim as engineer Farman Ismayilov of Azerbaijan, the only non-Turkish crew member.After kidnapping most of the crew, the pirates left the ship in the Gulf of Guinea with three sailors aboard, state-run Anadolu news agency said. According to reports, the pirates disabled most of the ship’s systems, leaving only the navigation system for the remaining crew to find their way to Gabon's Port-Gentil.The Gulf of Guinea, off the coasts of Nigeria, Guinea, Togo, Benin and Cameroon, is the most dangerous sea in the world for piracy, according to the International Maritime Bureau.Maritime security consultancy Dryad Global described the attack as “an exceptional incident for both its severity and distance from shore.” Last year, boardings in the waters off West Africa rose to 18 from 13 in 2019, the London-based firm added.Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said he had spoken to the senior officer remaining on the Mozart, Furkan Yaren, and that the morale and physical condition of the sailors aboard was good.“We are continuing coordinated negotiations for the release” of the abducted sailors, he said. “The pirates have yet to make any response.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has twice spoken to Yaren, his office said in a tweet. It added that Erdogan issued orders for the recovery of the kidnapped crew.“The owners and operators of the M/V Mozart, which was hijacked at gunpoint in the Gulf of Guinea, have regretfully confirmed that one of its crew has been killed and others abducted,” Istanbul-based Boden Maritime said.Among the captives is the ship’s captain, Mustafa Kaya, 41. His brother Seyit, of Istanbul, said the sailors’ families had been called by Erdogan.“We hope we see them free, unharmed soon,” he said. “Everybody is trying. We pray for our brothers.”In July 2019, 10 Turkish seamen were kidnapped off the coast of Nigeria. They were released less than a month later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-pirates-attack-turkish-ship-off-west-africa-kill-1-kidnap-15-101611495329234.html

But he appeared in the Apostolic Palace library to give his blessing and offer remarks about the Gospel and about the plight of those with no home.Edwin's case “gets added to those of so many other homeless people, recently deceased in Rome in the same dramatic circumstances,” Francis said. “Let's pray for Edwin.”Francis often uses his papacy to try to draw attention to the problems of those living on life's margins, including newly arrived migrants and homeless persons. His official alms-giver at times has distributed sleeping bags to those living in the streets near Vatican City.It is the second time in recent weeks that Francis has been hobbled by what the Vatican has said is sciatica pain, forcing him to skip events. The latest bout is causing him to postpone his annual start-of-the year speech to diplomats accredited to the Holy See, which had been set for Monday. Later that same day, Francis was to be driven to a Rome basilica to pray with other Christian leaders, but the event will go forward without him.The same painful condition saw him skip New Year's Day Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.So far, still on tap is a six-day pilgrimage to Iraq in early March, travel that Francis is hoping to carry out despite the pandemic and violence plaguing that country, including a suicide attack last week that killed 32 people in Baghdad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ailing-pope-reducing-appearances-prays-for-homeless-dead-101611496097696.html

It is one of the largest covered green areas in Pakistan.Citing reports, Dawn highlighted that this decision has been taken due to the financial issues being faced by the government.This comes amid declining relations of Pakistan with its two biggest sources of foreign remittances and foreign exchange -- Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Last August, Saudi Arabia asked Pakistan to repay early a USD 3 billion soft loan, Islamabad tried to defuse the tensions by quickly dispatching its current army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.However, Saudi Arabia did not budge from its demand.The UAE, which is Pakistan's second-largest source of foreign remittances, has recently banned issuing work visas for Pakistani workers.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's recent visit to the UAE failed to lift the ban, to Islamabad's severe disappointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-ailing-economy-imran-khan-to-mortgage-islamabad-s-biggest-park-to-get-loan-101611494190729.html
24-01-2021||World||US police weigh officer discipline after rally, Capitol riot||For two Virginia police officers who posed for a photo during the deadly US Capitol insurrection, the reckoning has been swift and public: They were identified, charged with crimes and arrested.But for five Seattle officers the outcome is less clear. Their identities still secret, two are on leave and three continue to work while a police watchdog investigates whether their actions in the nation's capital on Jan. 6 crossed the line from protected political speech to lawbreaking.cOfficials and experts agree that officers who were involved in the melee should be fired and charged for their role.But what about those officers who attended only the Trump rally before the riot? How does a department balance an officer's free speech rights with the blow to public trust that comes from the attendance of law enforcement at an event with far-right militants and white nationalists who went on to assault the seat of American democracy?An Associated Press survey of law enforcement agencies nationwide found that at least 31 officers in 12 states are being scrutinized by their supervisors for their behavior in the District of Columbia or face criminal charges for participating in the riot. Officials are looking into whether the officers violated any laws or policies or participated in the violence while in Washington. A Capitol Police officer died after he was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher as rioters descended on the building and many other officers were injured. A woman was shot to death by Capitol Police and three other people died after medical emergencies during the chaos.Most of the officers have not been publicly identified; only a few have been charged. Some were identified by online sleuths. Others were reported by their colleagues or turned themselves in.They come from some of the country’s largest cities — three Los Angeles officers and a sheriff’s deputy, for instance — as well as state agencies and a Pennsylvania police department with nine officers. Among them are an Oklahoma sheriff and New Hampshire police chief who have acknowledged being at the rally, but denied entering the Capitol or breaking the law.“If they were off-duty, it’s totally free speech,” said Will Aitchison, a lawyer in Portland, Oregon, who represents law enforcement officers. “People have the right to express their political views regardless of who’s standing next to them. You just don’t get guilt by association.”But Ayesha Bell Hardaway, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, said an officer’s presence at the rally creates a credibility issue as law enforcement agencies work to repair community trust, especially after last summer's of protests against police brutality sparked by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.Communities will question the integrity of officers who attended the rally along with “individuals who proudly profess racist and divisive viewpoints,” she said. “It calls into question whether those officers are interested in engaging in policing in a way that builds trust and legitimacy in all communities, including communities of color.”In Rocky Mount, a Virginia town of about 1,000, Sgt. Thomas Robertson and Officer Jacob Fracker were suspended without pay and face criminal charges after posting a photo of themselves inside the Capitol during the riot. According to court records, Robertson wrote on social media that the “Left are just mad because we actually attacked the government who is the problem … The right IN ONE DAY took the f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us.”Attempts to contact the pair were unsuccessful and court records do not list lawyers. Leaders in Rocky Mount declined to be interviewed. In a statement, they said the events at the Capitol were tragic.“We stand with and add our support to those who have denounced the violence and illegal activity that took place that day,” said Police Chief Ken Criner, Capt. Mark Lovern and Town Manager James Ervin. “Our town and our police department absolutely does not condone illegal or unethical behavior by anyone, including our officers and staff.”On the other side of the county, five Seattle officers are under investigation by the city’s Office of Police Accountability. Two officers posted photos of themselves on social media while in the district and officials are investigating to determine where they were and what they were doing. Three others told supervisors that they went to Washington for the events and are being investigated for what they did while there.Seattle Police Chief Adrian Diaz said his department supports officers’ freedom of speech and that those who were in the nation's capital will be fired if they “were directly involved in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.”But police leaders need to evaluate more than just clear criminal behavior, according to Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a policing research and policy group. They must also consider how their actions affect the department credibility, he said.Officers' First Amendment rights “don’t extend to expressing words that may be violent or maybe express some prejudice,” Wexler said, “because that’s going to reflect on what they do when they’re working, when they’re testifying in court.”Through the summer and fall, Seattle police — along with officers elsewhere — came under criticism for their handling of mass protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd. The city received more than 19,000 complaints against officers, most for excessive use of force and improper use of pepper spray.Andrew Myerberg, director of the Seattle Office of Police Accountability, said none of the officers now under investigation were involved in those cases.But Sakara Remmu, cofounder of Black Lives Matter Seattle/King County, said the officers should be fired regardless. Their public declarations of solidarity with Trump fosters not just community distrust, but terror of the entire department, she said.“It absolutely does matter when the decorum of racial peace cracks and racial hatred comes through, because we already have a documented history and legacy of what that means in this country,” Remmu said.In Houston, the police chief decried an officer who resigned and was later charged in the riot. A lawyer for Officer Tam Pham said the 18-year veteran of the force "very much regrets” being at the rally and was “deeply remorseful.”But many chiefs have said their officers committed no crimes.“The Arkansas State Police respects the rights and freedom of an employee to use their leave time as the employee may choose,” department spokesman Bill Sadler said of two officers who attended the Trump rally.Malik Aziz, the former chair and executive director of the National Black Police Association, compared condemning all officers who were in Washington to tarring all the protesters who took to streets after the killing of George Floyd with the violent and destructive acts of some.A major with the Dallas Police Department, Aziz said police acting privately have the same rights as other Americans, but that knowingly going to a bigoted event should be disqualifying for an officer.“There’s no place in law enforcement for that individual,” Aziz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-weigh-officer-discipline-after-rally-capitol-riot-101611494465920.html
24-01-2021||World||Why Joe Biden's immigration plan may be risky for Democrats||President Joe Biden is confronting the political risk that comes with grand ambition.As one of his first acts, Biden offered a sweeping immigration overhaul last week that would provide a path to US citizenship for the estimated 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. It would also codify provisions wiping out some of President Donald Trump's signature hard-line policies, including trying to end existing, protected legal status for many immigrants brought to the US as children and crackdowns on asylum rules.It's precisely the type of measure that many Latino activists have longed for, particularly after the tough approach of the Trump era. But it must compete with Biden's other marquee legislative goals, including a $1.9 trillion plan to combat the coronavirus, an infrastructure package that promotes green energy initiatives and a “public option” to expand health insurance.In the best of circumstances, enacting such a broad range of legislation would be difficult. But in a narrowly divided Congress, it could be impossible. And that has Latinos, the nation's fastest growing voting bloc, worried that Biden and congressional leaders could cut deals that weaken the finished product too much — or fail to pass anything at all.“This cannot be a situation where simply a visionary bill — a message bill — gets sent to Congress and nothing happens with it,” said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for low-income immigrants. “There’s an expectation that they will deliver and that there is a mandate now for Biden to be unapologetically pro-immigrant and have a political imperative to do so, and the Democrats do as well.”If Latinos ultimately feel betrayed, the political consequences for Democrats could be long-lasting. The 2020 election provided several warning signs that, despite Democratic efforts to build a multiracial coalition, Latino support could be at risk.Biden already was viewed skeptically by some Latino activists for his association with former President Barack Obama, who was called the “deporter in chief” for the record number of immigrants who were removed from the country during his administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont defeated Biden in last year's Nevada caucuses and California primary, which served as early barometers of the Latino vote.In his race against Trump, Biden won the support of 63% of Latino voters compared with Trump's 35%, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters nationwide. But Trump narrowed the margin somewhat in some swing states such as Nevada and also got a bump from Latino men, 39% of whom backed him compared with 33% of Latino women.Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1996 to carry Arizona, in part because of strong grassroots backing from Mexican American groups opposed to strict GOP immigration policies going back decades. But he lost Florida by underperforming in its largest Hispanic county, Miami-Dade, where the Trump campaign's anti-socialism message resonated with Cuban- and some Venezuelan Americans.Biden also fell short in Texas even though running mate Kamala Harris devoted valuable, late campaign time there. The ticket lost some sparsely populated but heavily Mexican American counties along the Mexican border, where law enforcement agencies are major employers and the GOP's zero-tolerance immigration policy resonated.There were more warning signs for House Democrats, who lost four California seats and two in South Florida while failing to pick up any in Texas. Booming Hispanic populations reflected in new US census figures may see Texas and Florida gain congressional districts before 2022's midterm elections, which could make correcting the problem all the more pressing for Democrats.The urgency isn't lost on Biden. He privately spent months telling immigration advocates that major overhauls would be at the top of his to-do list. As vice president, he watched while the Obama administration used larger congressional majorities to speed passage of a financial crisis stimulus bill and its signature health care law while letting an immigration overhaul languish.“It means so much to us to have a new president propose bold, visionary immigration reform on Day 1. Not Day 2. Not Day 3. Not a year later,” said New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, his chamber's lead sponsor of the Biden package.Menendez was part of a bipartisan immigration plan championed by the “Gang of Eight” senators that collapsed in 2013. Obama then resorted to executive action to offer legal status to millions of young immigrants. President George W. Bush also pushed an immigration package — with an eye toward boosting Latino support for Republicans before the 2008 election — only to see it fail in Congress.Menendez acknowledged that the latest bill will have to find at least 10 Republican senators' support to clear the 60-vote hurdle to reach the floor, and that he's “under no illusions" how difficult that will be.Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a moderate Republican from Florida, said Biden may find some GOP support but probably will have to settle for far less than what’s in his original proposal.“Many Republicans are worried about primary challenges,” Curbelo said, adding that Trump and his supporters’ championing of immigration crackdowns means there's “political peril there for Republicans.”But he also said Democrats could alienate some of their own base by appearing to prioritize the needs of people in the country illegally over those of struggling US citizens and thus “appearing to overreach from the perspective of swing and independent voters.”Indeed, Democrats haven't always universally lined up behind an immigration overhaul, arguing that it could lead to an influx of cheap labor that hurts US workers. Some of the party's senators joined Republicans in sinking Bush's bill.Still, Latinos haven't forgotten past immigration failures and have often to blamed Democrats more than Republicans.Chuck Roca, head of Nuestro PAC, which spent $4 million on ads boosting Biden ads in Arizona, said that while Hispanics have traditionally tended to support Democrats, he has begun to see trends in the past decade where more are registering as independent or without party affiliation. Those voters can still be won back, he said, but only if Latinos see real change on major issues such as immigration “even if it's piecemeal.”“They have to get something done if they want to start to turn around the loss of Latino voters,” said Rocha, who headed Latino voter outreach for Sanders’ presidential campaign. “They have to do everything in their power now to get Latinos back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-joe-biden-s-immigration-plan-may-be-risky-for-democrats-101611492419271.html

But at the same time, a dialogue is a possibility to find some rational kernels, the little parts where our relations are getting closer," he said."And if the current US administration is ready for such an approach, I have no doubts that our president will respond in kind."Putin was one of the last global leaders to congratulate Joe Biden on his victory in the US presidential election after the Nov. 3 vote.One of the burning issues to be resolved by the two nuclear powers is the arms control treaty, known as New START, which is due to expire on Feb. 5.The White House said last week that Biden would seek a five-year extension to the deal, while the Kremlin requested concrete proposals from Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ready-for-talks-with-new-joe-biden-administration-if-us-is-willing-101611492788030.html

The United Kingdom has been witnessing a surge in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after different imported variants of coronavirus were detected in the country. Hancock said that Britain has detected 77 cases of the South African variant and nine cases of a Brazilian variant.“There is early evidence that the lockdown is starting to bring cases down. But we're a long, long, long way from that from being low enough because the case rate was incredibly high and you can see the pressure on the NHS. You can see it every day,” the health minister told Sky News.The virus variants have triggered concerns among the health experts and scientific community at a time when the government is trying to contain the pandemic through vaccination. The UK has been reporting over 1,000 Covid-19 related deaths for the last five days. The country has recorded the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe with more than 97,000 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center.Watch | 'New UK variant of coronavirus may be more deadly': Boris JohnsonOxford professor Anthony Harnden, who serves as deputy chair of a scientific committee on vaccination, told Sky News that the new variants are a “real worry” because Covid-19 vaccines may not be effective against them. “The South African and the Brazilian Amazonian ones, there are hints that there will be vaccine escape," he warned.Though there have been speculations around a possible blanket ban on inbound travellers amid fears of new virus variants, Hancock said that the government will stick to a “precautionary principle”. The health secretary stressed that pre-departure testing has been strictly implemented to prevent the spread of a new variant."But it is absolutely vital that we protect this country from a new variant that may not be as well dealt with by the vaccine. We cannot risk the progress that we have made,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-long-way-from-easing-virus-lockdown-as-vaccine-escape-concerns-grow-101611492375679.html
24-01-2021||World||Explained: Asia's 'most-wanted' drug boss Tse Chi Lop||Dutch authorities have arrested 57-year old Canadian national Tse Chi Lop at the request of the Australia Federal Police after a long probe into drug trafficking in the Asia-Pacific.Tse had been on a global most-wanted list and was of "significant interest" to law enforcement agencies in multiple countries, said Dutch and Australian police.Who is Tse Chi Lop?Tse - known by his nickname "Sam Gor", Brother Number Three in Cantonese - is the alleged senior leader of a sprawling transnational drug trafficking syndicate known as "The Company" to its members or, to some police, the "Sam Gor syndicate."Born in China's southern Guangdong province, he became a member of the Big Circle Gang, a Triad-like organisation founded by disillusioned Red Guards at the end of the Cultural Revolution, police sources have told Reuters.He moved to Hong Kong, then Canada, and was arraigned by United States authorities for heroin trafficking in 1998. After release from an Ohio prison in 2006, he found his way back to Asia, where police allege he led the transformation of the region's $70 billion annual drug trade. Described as immensely wealthy and a prodigious gambler, Tse lost $66 million in one night at a casino and travelled with a guard of Thai kickboxers, investigators told Reuters.Read | Drug Kingpin El Chapo’s daughter, Mexican cartels hand out coronavirus aidWhat is 'The Company"?The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that Tse's drug syndicate earned as much as $17 billion from trafficking drugs in 2018.Police and analysts said the syndicate drove a rapid expansion of crystal-methamphetamine trafficking in the region, which increased fourfold in the five years to 2019. The syndicate also manufactured heroin and has been a major player in the global market for MDMA, a euphoric party drug also known as ecstasy, police say.The UNODC's Jeremy Douglas has said Tse was "in the league of" the Latin American narco-bosses Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and Pablo Escobar.Police allege Tse's crime syndicate was formed after a peace pact among five Asian criminal groups - the Big Circle Gang (also called the Big Circle Boys); the 14k, Wo Shing Wo and Sun Yee On triads from Hong Kong and Macau; and the Bamboo Union, based in Taiwan.The collaboration ended the blood-soaked rivalries of some of the crime groups and paved the way for gargantuan profits.As well as pioneering industrial-scale meth production in super-labs in Myanmar, Tse's syndicate built its customer base among smaller, nation-based crime groups by offering to replace any drugs that were seized by law enforcement at no extra cost, police say.What next?Tse bunkered down in Taiwan in 2019 after he became aware of a major multinational investigation into him and the syndicate, four police sources say. China and Australia issued arrest warrants for Tse, but neither has extradition agreements with the self-governing territory that is claimed by Beijing.Following his arrest at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Saturday, Australian police said they can seek Tse's extradition to Australia to face court. No charges have been revealed. But the Australian police believe Tse has been involved in at least 13 drug importations to Australia, according to a document viewed by Reuters.Whether Tse's arrest dents the Asia-Pacific drug trade remains unclear. While he has kept a low profile in the past year, the syndicate's activities have been largely unaffected, two police sources told Reuters. The UNODC and police sources have told Reuters that, with the exception of a few countries, the trafficking of illicit substances has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Asia-Pacific, unlike other regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-arrest-of-asia-s-most-wanted-drug-boss-tse-chi-lop-101611490757090.html
24-01-2021||World||Scottish leader says Boris Johnson fears democracy over independence issue||Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday of fearing democracy when it comes to letting the Scottish people express their will on independence from the United Kingdom.Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a 2014 referendum. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the European Union in the subsequent 2016 Brexit vote, stoking demands by Scottish nationalists for a new independence vote after the UK as a whole voted to leave.Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP), which runs the semi-autonomous Edinburgh executive, laid out plans on Saturday for a new referendum if, as expected, it wins Scottish elections in May.Johnson said earlier this month he thought there should be a gap of about 40 years before any new referendum."He's frightened of democracy," Sturgeon said during a BBC television interview on Sunday."If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months' time on a proposition of giving the people that choice, what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?" she said.Johnson says the SNP presented the 2014 referendum as a "once in a generation" event and cannot now insist on another.The SNP counters that the situation has changed because of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. Scots' votes against Brexit in 2016 were outweighed by a majority voting in favour in more populous England.Sturgeon's party says EU membership was presented in 2014 as a key argument for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom, only for Scots to be dragged out of the bloc against their will.NORTHERN IRELANDBrexit has led to similar discussions in Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in the EU. Republicans there want a so-called "border poll" on unification with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, while Unionists want to remain part of the United Kingdom."There is an unstoppable conversation underway on our constitutional future," Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein, a Republican party, said on Twitter on Sunday."It is time for the Irish government to step up preparations. We can overcome the barriers of partition and build a new Ireland."First Minister Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party criticised O'Neill for raising constitutional issues in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic."We all know how divisive a border poll would be, and for us in Northern Ireland what we have to do at the moment is all come together to fight against COVID," she said on Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scottish-leader-says-boris-johnson-fears-democracy-over-independence-issue-101611491270991.html
24-01-2021||World||Dutch police arrest alleged Asian drug syndicate kingpin Tse Chi Lop||Dutch police have arrested the alleged leader of a large Asian drug syndicate who is listed as one of the world's most-wanted fugitives and has been compared to Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.Tse Chi Lop, a Chinese-born Canadian national, was detained on Friday at the request of Australian police, who led an investigation that found his organisation dominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade, Dutch police spokesman Thomas Aling said on Saturday.Tse is expected to be extradited after appearing before a judge, Aling said, adding that his arrest by national police took place without incident at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport."He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received," Aling said.Dutch police were unable to provide details about the legal proceedings and it was not clear if Tse had a lawyer.Tse's crime syndicate allegedly dominates the Asia-Pacific crystal methamphetamine trade, which increased fourfold in the five years to 2019, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Regional law enforcers say the syndicate has imported highly potent meth into more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as trafficking heroin and MDMA.Tse, 57, an ex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto, has moved between Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according to counter-narcotics officers from four countries and documents reviewed by Reuters.The group has "been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases" of drug trafficking since January 2015, the documents showed.Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the UNODC, told Reuters in 2019 that "Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar," referring to Latin America's most notorious drug lords.The UNODC estimated that Tse's drug syndicate earned as much as $17 billion in 2018.The syndicate he is suspected of running is known to its members as "The Company". Law enforcers also refer to it as "Sam Gor" - or Brother Number Three in Cantonese - after one of Tse's nicknames, Reuters reported at the time. Reuters was unable to contact Tse for comment on the report at that time.'They got their man'The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said on Sunday it issued an arrest warrant for Tse in 2019, "in connection with AFP-led Operation Volante, which dismantled a global crime syndicate operating in five countries."The AFP also led an international investigation, dubbed Operation Kungur, into Tse and his syndicate that included about 20 agencies from more than a dozen countries."The syndicate targeted Australia over a number of years, importing and distributing large amounts of illicit narcotics, laundering the profits overseas and living off the wealth obtained from crime," the AFP added.Documents reviewed by Reuters allege the syndicate's money laundering operation spans the globe, with casino junkets and property investments both used as vehicles to launder earnings.The UNODC's Douglas hailed the arrest as a "great result" but cautioned that it may not have a big impact on drug trafficking in the region."They got their man. Kudos to the Australian Federal Police. But the organisation remains, the demand for synthetic drugs has been built, and someone will step in to replace Tse," said Douglas."It is hard to see his arrest having much of an impact on drug trafficking beyond the near-term if the poor governance, corruption and easily available drug precursors in the region remain unaddressed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-police-arrest-alleged-asian-drug-syndicate-kingpin-tse-chi-lop-101611490698422.html
24-01-2021||World||Israel includes teens in vaccination drive, eyeing exams||Israel expanded its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Sunday to include 16- to 18-year-olds in what the government described as an effort to enable their attendance at school exams.Israel, which has the world's fastest vaccine distribution rate, is hoping to begin reopening its economy next month.With regular imports of Pfizer Inc. vaccines, Israel has administered at least one dose to more than 25% of its 9 million population since Dec. 19, the Health Ministry says.The vaccines were initially limited to the elderly and other high-risk categories, but are now available to anyone over 40 or - with parental permission - those between 16 and 18.The inclusion of late-teens is meant "to enable their return (to school) and the orderly holding of exams," the Education Ministry spokeswoman said.Israel awards a matriculation certificate to high school students in grades 10-12 who pass exams, administered by the Education Ministry, that play a major role in acceptance to universities. They can also affect placement in the military, where many Israelis do compulsory service after high school.The country has been under a third national lockdown since Dec. 27, which it plans to lift at the end of January.Education Minister Yoav Galant said it was too early to know if schools would reopen next month. Among factors deciding this was how much Israel, which is struggling against a surge of infections, was affected by the contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain, he told Ynet TV.Hezi Levy, director-general of Israel's Health Ministry, was asked in an Army Radio interview whether vaccinating teens might pose unforeseen risks - perhaps to their own yet-unborn children."I don't know," Levy said. "This vaccine is no different to vaccines against other viral diseases ... and was successfully tested for side effects." He added that he had no doubt that - weighing the relative risks from the coronavirus - it was preferable to get the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-includes-teens-in-vaccination-drive-eyeing-exams-101611484455852.html
24-01-2021||World||US President Joe Biden, UK PM Boris Johnson discuss transatlantic ties, Covid-19, climate change in phone call||Joe Biden conveyed his intention to strengthen the "special relationship" with the UK in his first call as the US President with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, during which the two leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and agreed to cooperate on combating climate change and containing the Covid-19 pandemic.The conversation with Johnson over phone on Saturday was Biden’s third involving a foreign leader since his inauguration on Wednesday, after he spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday."Great to speak to President Joe Biden this evening. I look forward to deepening the longstanding alliance between our two countries as we drive a green and sustainable recovery from Covid-19," Johnson said in a tweet.It seem that a new trade agreement was not on the list of priorities for both sides. While the Downing Street readout of the phone call referred to Johnson reiterating his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible, the White House communique of the call only referred to "strengthening the special relationship"."The president conveyed his intention to strengthen the special relationship between our countries and revitalise transatlantic ties, underscoring the critical role of NATO to our collective defense and shared values," the White House said."Building on the UK and US’ long history of cooperation in security and defence, the leaders re-committed to the NATO alliance and our shared values in promoting human rights and protecting democracy. They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible," a Downing Street spokesperson said.The UK is keen to conclude a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the US, but the new American administration has been less vocal over this amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic crisis.The global health crisis and vaccination programme in both countries and around the world as well as climate change were areas of more mutual agreement, with security and defence through strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) also high on the agenda – in contrast with former President Donald Trump’s hard ball with the alliance.During the call, President Biden noted the importance of cooperation, including through multilateral organisations, on shared challenges such as combatting climate change, containing Covid-19, and ensuring global health security, the White House said.The leaders also discussed the need for coordination on shared foreign policy priorities, including China, Iran, and Russia, it said."The Prime Minister warmly welcomed the President’s decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organisation and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,” the Downing Street spokesperson said.On climate change, Johnson is said to have also praised President Biden’s early action on tackling climate change and commitment to reach Net Zero by 2050."The leaders looked forward to meeting in person as soon as the circumstances allow, and to working together through the G7, G20 and COP26 this year,” the spokesperson added.The UK will be hosting the G7 summit in Cornwall in June, which is expected to be Biden’s first visit to the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also due to join the summit for its guest country sessions.The new White House incumbent is famously anti-Brexit but all early indications are that his views on the UK's exit from the European Union (EU) are unlikely to overshadow US-UK relations in future.In his call with Mexico’s President, Biden and Obrador agreed to work closely to stem the flow of irregular migration to Mexico and the US, as well as to promote development in the Northern Triangle of Central America."The president outlined his plan to reduce migration by addressing its root causes, increasing resettlement capacity and lawful alternative immigration pathways, improving processing at the border to adjudicate requests for asylum, and reversing the previous administration’s draconian immigration policies,” the White House said.They also recognised the importance of coordination to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-talks-transatlantic-ties-covid-19-climate-change-with-boris-johnson-101611484560593.html
24-01-2021||World||Arab Spring exiles look back 10 years after Egypt uprising||The Egyptians who took to the streets on January 25, 2011, knew what they were doing. They knew they risked arrest and worse. But as their numbers swelled in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, they tasted success.Police forces backed off, and within days, former President Hosni Mubarak agreed to demands to step down.But events didn't turn out the way many of the protesters envisioned. A decade later, thousands are estimated to have fled abroad to escape the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi that is considered even more oppressive. The significant loss of academics, artists, journalists and other intellectuals has, along with a climate of fear, hobbled any political opposition.Dr. Mohamed Aboelgheit was among those jailed in the southern city of Assiut in 2011 after joining calls for revolt against police brutality and Mubarak. He spent part of the uprising in a cramped cell.Released amid the chaos, he reveled in the atmosphere of political freedom in the Arab world’s most populous country — protesting, working as a journalist and joining a campaign for a moderate presidential candidate. But it did not last.Interim military rulers followed Mubarak. In 2012, Mohamed Morsi, a member of Egypt’s most powerful Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was elected as the first civilian president in the country’s history. But his tenure proved divisive. Amid massive protests, the military — led by then-Defense Minister el-Sissi — removed Morsi in 2013, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a “terrorist group.” A crackdown on dissent ensued, and el-Sissi won two terms in elections that human rights groups criticized as undemocratic.“I began to feel, by degree, more fear and threats,” Aboelgheit said. Friends were jailed, his writings critical of the government drew attention, and “I wasn’t going to wait until it happened to me,” he added.After el-Sissi came to power, Aboelgheit left for London, where he's published investigative reports on other parts of the Arab world.At his former home in Egypt, national security agents asked about him. When Aboelgheit’s wife last returned to visit relatives, she was summoned for questioning about his activities. The message was clear.No one knows exactly how many Egyptians like Aboelgheit have fled political persecution.Data from the World Bank shows an increase in emigres from Egypt since 2011. A total of 3,444,832 left in 2017 — nearly 60,000 more than in 2013, the years for which figures are available. But it’s impossible to tell economic migrants from political exiles.They relocated to Berlin, Paris and London. Egyptians also have settled in Turkey, Qatar, Sudan and even Asian countries like Malaysia and South Korea.Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that there were 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt third, behind China and Turkey, in detaining journalists.El-Sissi maintains Egypt has no political prisoners. The arrest of a journalist or a rights worker makes news roughly every month. Many people have been imprisoned on terrorism charges, for breaking a ban on protests or for disseminating false news. Others remain in indefinite pretrial detentions.El-Sissi maintains Egypt is holding back Islamic extremism so it doesn't descend into chaos like its neighbors.“Sissi wants not only to abrogate the rights of the opposition and to prevent any critical voice from being uttered, Sissi doesn’t actually believe, not only in the opposition, but he doesn’t believe in politics," said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian professor of modern Middle Eastern History at Cambridge UniversityFahmy believes this is the worst period in Egypt’s modern history for personal rights.“It’s much more serious, it’s much deeper and much darker, what Sissi has in mind,” he said.Those abroad who could challenge el-Sissi have chosen to not return.Taqadum al-Khatib, an academic who also worked in the nascent political scene after 2011, was researching Egypt’s former Jewish community in Germany when he learned that returning to his homeland was no longer an option.The Egyptian cultural attaché in Berlin summoned al-Khatib for a meeting, and an official questioned him about his articles, social media posts and research. He was asked to hand over his passport but refused. Shortly thereafter, he was fired from his job at an Egyptian university. He feels lucky to be able to work toward his doctorate in Germany but misses Cairo’s bustle.“It’s a very difficult situation. I couldn’t go back to my home,” al-Khatib said.Fahmy said he’s seen outspoken expatriates have their Egyptian citizenship revoked.A government press officer did not respond to a request for comment on targeting and intimidating Egyptians — either abroad or at home — based on their work as journalists, activists or academics, or for expressing political opinions.Journalist Asma Khatib, 29, remembers the heady days of 2011, when young people thought they could bring change.A reporter for a pro-Muslim Brotherhood news agency, Khatib covered Morsi’s short presidency amid criticism the group was using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power to make Egypt an Islamic state. After Morsi's ouster, his supporters held sit-ins for his reinstatement at a square in Cairo. A month later, the new military leaders forcibly cleared them out, and more than 600 people were killed.Khatib documented the violence. Soon, colleagues started being arrested, and she fled Egypt — first to Malaysia, then to Indonesia and Turkey.She was tried in absentia on espionage charges in 2015, convicted and sentenced to death. Now, she and her husband Ahmed Saad, also a journalist, and their two children are seeking asylum in South Korea.They expect they’ll never return, but also realize they’re lucky to be free. On the day the ruling was announced, the journalist remembers telling herself: “You don’t have a country anymore.”“I know that there are lots of others like me. I’m not any different from those who are in prison,” she said.The exiles have had ample time to think about where Egypt's uprising failed. The broad alliance of protesters — from Islamists to secular activists — fractured without a common enemy like Mubarak, and the most extreme voices became the loudest. The role of religion in society remained largely unanswered, and liberal secular initiatives never gained traction. No one accounted for how many people would embrace former regime figures, especially in a crisis.Most Egyptians abroad have not been politically active, fearing for family and friends back home. But some have continued on the path begun on Jan. 25, 2011.Tamim Heikal, working in the corporate world when the protests erupted, had doubted the government could ever reform. But he soon became a communications manager for an emerging political party. Later, he watched others being locked up, and knew his turn had come when he got an invitation from intelligence officers in 2017 to “come have coffee.”He booked a ticket to Paris and hasn’t gone back.Now, at age 42, he wants to educate himself and others for when a popular movement re-emerges in Egypt. He makes ends meet by editing, translating and doing consulting work for rights groups, and tries to network among the diaspora.“It’s as if I was infected with a virus, after the revolution,” he said. “I don’t know how to go back. I won’t be able to relax until change happens.”Others try to cope in strange lands. Asma Khatib and her husband aren’t sure what to say to their young children when they ask where they’re from.Abouelgheit, the doctor-turned-journalist, worries his son won’t speak Arabic after so much time in the United Kingdom.He hopes to go home one day, but in the meantime, he’s considering returning to the medical profession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arab-spring-exiles-look-back-10-years-after-egypt-uprising-101611483585994.html
24-01-2021||World||'No WhatsApp, FB messenger': Terror groups in Pak switch to new messaging apps||Amid a raging debate over privacy offered by messaging platforms like WhatsApp, terrorist groups and their handlers from Pakistan are switching to new applications which include one developed by a Turkish company, officials here said.The three new applications came to light after evidence was collected following encounters with terrorists or those who surrendered before the Army gave details about their mode of radicalisation by Pakistan-based terrorist groups, they said.The names of the messaging apps have been withheld for security reasons.While one of the applications is owned by a company based in the United States, the second is from Europe. The latest is an application developed by a Turkish company that has been frequently used by terrorist group handlers and their prospective recruits in the Kashmir valley.The new applications have the ability to work with the slowest internet connections where Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE), used in the late 2000s, or 2G is in operation.The government had suspended the internet across Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state in August 2019. Early last year, 2G internet services were restored.Terror groups had virtually stopped using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Later, it was found that they have switched over to new applications available free of cost on the world wide web, a security official said.All encryption and decryption happen directly on the devices, therefore, reducing third party intervention at any point and these apps use the encryption algorithm RSA-2048 which was adopted as the most secure encrypted platform.RSA is an American Network Security and Authentication company that was founded in 1982 by US-born Ron Rivest, Israeli-born Adi Shamir, and US-born Leonard Adleman. The acronym RSA is used worldwide as the foundation key in the cryptosystem.One of the new messaging apps used by terrorists to radicalise the youth in the Valley does not even ask for phone numbers or emails for enabling complete user anonymity, the officials said.Efforts are on to block such applications in Jammu and Kashmir, they said.This comes at a time when the security agencies in the Valley are fighting the menace of virtual SIM cards. Terror groups have been increasingly using these to connect with their handlers in Pakistan.The penetration of this technology came to light in 2019 when a request was sent to the United States to seek details from a service provider of virtual SIMs used by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber in the attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama that left 40 personnel dead.However, a detailed investigation done by the National Investigation Agency and other security agencies indicated that over 40 virtual SIM cards were used in the Pulwama attack alone, and there are probably more of them floating in the Valley's cyberspace, the officials said.It is a fairly new modus operandi wherein terrorists from across the border are using virtual SIM cards generated by a service provider based in a foreign country. In this technology, the computer generates a telephone number and the user needs to download an application of the service provider on his or her smartphone to use it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-groups-in-pakistan-switch-to-new-messaging-apps-101611483886148.html
24-01-2021||World||Explained: How Trump’s 2nd impeachment trial could be different from 1st||Former US President Donald Trump is set to face a historic second impeachment trial in Senate next month after Democrats and Republicans agreed to delay the schedule by two weeks. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced on Friday that the article of impeachment will be delivered and read out to the Upper chamber on January 25. The 100 members of Senate will be sworn in as jurors the next day and impeachment managers, as well as Trump’s defence team, will be given time to draft their legal briefs.How the second impeachment trial could be different from the first?When the Senate trial for Trump’s impeachment was held for the first time, the Republican leader was still in the White House. However, he now holds the dubious record of getting impeached twice and being the first president in the history of the United States to face trial after leaving the office. This also means that the Senate will enter into uncharted constitutional territory when the trial begins on February 9.In December 2019, the House impeached Trump after several weeks of hearings on charges of "Abuse of Power" and "Obstruction of Congress" but the votes were almost entirely along partisan lines. In the aftermath of Capitol riots, however, the proceedings panned out a little bit differently as 10 Republicans joined Democrats to impeach Trump on the charge of “Incitement of Insurrection” within a week of the violence that left five dead.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that this impeachment trial will be different from last time since the whole world witnessed “president's incitement and the violence that was used”. In the previous case, Trump administration was accused of withholding $400 million in military aid, approved by Congress and the Pentagon, to Ukraine and pressurising President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into the then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump had defended the call to Zelensky as “perfect”."I do see a big difference between something that we all witnessed versus what information you might need to substantiate an Article of Impeachment based on, large part, on a call that the president made and described as 'perfect’," said Pelosi.On February 5, 2020, Trump was acquitted from the charges and Senator Mitt Romney was the only Republican member who voted to convict the president on one charge. Though the Democrats now control the Senate with 50 seats, at least two-thirds of the Senate have to vote in favour of removal.It is highly unlikely that Democrats could muster support from 17 Republicans to convict Trump, especially when he no longer holds the office. Republican senator Ron Johnson from the state of Wisconsin has termed the trial unconstitutional and warned that it would set a very dangerous precedent.“I believe an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional and would set a very dangerous precedent. There is no provision in the Constitution for holding such a trial over a former president who is now a private citizen. Where would we get the authority to do so?” he tweeted.I believe an impeachment trial of a former president is unconstitutional and would set a very dangerous precedent. There is no provision in the Constitution for holding such a trial over a former president who is now a private citizen. Where would we get the authority to do so?Vermont senator Bernie Sanders of the progressive caucus had argued in the favour of Trump’s removal, saying a precedent should be set for future presidents. The septuagenarian leader had said that it must be made clear that no president can lead an insurrection against the US government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-trump-s-2nd-impeachment-trial-could-be-different-from-1st-101611483400229.html

Hancock said the government is conducting a vaccine trial on the South African variant to study its response to the inoculation. Hancock also said he’s worried about new variants developing elsewhere in the world.“The new variant I really worry about is the one that’s out there but hasn’t been spotted,” he said, adding that the UK is offering its genome-sequencing capability to other countries to help them identify new strains.In the UK’s vaccination effort, the supply of vaccines is the rate-limiting factor and not distribution by the National Health Service, Hancock said. He also couldn’t confirm that schools would be open again by Easter, saying that the government would have to look at the data around the pandemic at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccines-may-work-less-well-on-covid-19-variants-uk-s-heath-minister-warns-101611481835380.html

While the vaccine can prevent severe disease, we do not know if it stops you from passing on the virus to others, and it takes time to develop immunity after a jab, so for now everyone must continue to stay at home to help bring down infections and protect the NHS,” he said.The NHS said the new vaccine centres will each be capable of delivering thousands of jabs each week, scaling up and down according to vaccine supplies and demand.People eligible in the priority criteria of over-80s, followed by over-70s, care home workers and staff as well as frontline workers, are being invited when it is their turn and people are being urged not to just turn up.“These new centres provide another option for people invited for their jabs, alongside the fantastic work of local GPs,” said Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director.Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi added: “As of next week there will be almost 50 vaccination centres, more than 250 hospitals hubs and over 1,000 local vaccination service sites, run by GPs and pharmacies right across the country.“This will enable us to vaccinate as many people as possible in the weeks and months to come and I encourage anyone who has been invited for a free vaccine to come forward and get a jab.”The NHS said its new Vaccination Centres will kick off by jabbing mainly health and social care staff from Monday before opening their doors to more patients on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-people-may-still-transmit-covid-19-warns-england-s-chief-medic-101611483167250.html

24-01-2021||World||11 Chinese miners saved as rescuers race to find remaining 10||Rescuers in east China on Sunday pulled 11 miners from hundreds of metres underground where they had been trapped for two weeks, state media reported, as the race to locate the remaining 10 intensified.The miners were brought to the surface starting from around 11 am Sunday, state broadcaster CCTV reported -- a major breakthrough for a rescue operation that has captivated the nation.One miner was in "extremely weak physical condition" and rushed to hospital, CCTV said.The 11 miners were rescued after the air ventilator shaft was cleared, the official state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the operation's command centre.A further ten remain unaccounted for.Specialist teams have been battling difficult conditions since an explosion at the Hushan mine in Shandong province trapped the miners underground amid rising waters on January 10.The explosion occurred in a ventilator shaft, causing a blockage that damaged the cable car.On Sunday morning the huge obstacles suddenly fell to the bottom of the shaft, allowing the operation to take a big step forward, rescue expert Du Bingjian said."After the obstacles fell to the bottom of the shaft, the rescue team started to bring up the miners and suspended the drilling work," Du told the Global Times."It is currently unclear when the rescuers will reach the Sixth Central Section where the missing miners are believed to be."Lifeline shafts State broadcaster footage on Sunday showed a small elevator carriage lifted to the surface, accompanied by rescue workers. A masked man, who appeared unable to stand, was carried out.Later footage showed emergency workers lifting out other miners, who wore black shades to protect their eyes from the light. One appeared to be holding his hands as if praying.Contact was first established a week ago with a group of 11 miners trapped in a section of the mine around 580 metres (1,900 feet) below the surface.One of them was seriously injured in the initial explosion and died after falling into a coma.Another miner was found alive by rescuers as they attempted to reach the group.Rescue teams have been lowering food, medicine and other supplies to the group through several lifeline shafts drilled into the rock.State media reported Friday that the health of the miners had been gradually returning to a "normal state" after regular deliveries of food.Life detectors and nutrient solutions have been lowered to other parts of the mine in the hope of reaching those still missing.In December, 23 workers died after becoming stuck underground in the southwestern city of Chongqing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-chinese-miners-saved-as-rescuers-race-to-find-remaining-10-101611482099118.html
24-01-2021||World||Taiwan reports large incursion by Chinese air force||Eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Saturday, and Taiwan's air force deployed missiles to "monitor" the incursion, the island's defence ministry said.China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has conducted almost daily flights over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months.However, they have generally consisted of just one or two reconnaissance aircraft.The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on this mission - Taiwan said it was made up of eight nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and four J-16 fighter jets - was unusual.A map provided by Taiwan's defence ministry showed that the Chinese aircraft, including a Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, flew over the same waters where the most recent Chinese missions have been taking place near the Pratas Islands, though still well away from mainland Taiwan.Taiwan's air force warned away the Chinese aircraft and deployed missiles to monitor them, the ministry said, using standard wording for how it responds to such activities."Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity," it said in a brief statement.The US State Department urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan and reaffirmed its commitment to the island and desire to deepen ties."We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives," State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement."We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability."There was no immediate comment from China. In the past, China has said it has been carrying out exercises to defend its sovereignty and security.Taiwan's foreign ministry expressed its thanks for the show of US support, adding they would work closely with the Biden administration to strengthen their close partnership.Lo Chih-Cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party who sits on parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, told Reuters China was trying to deter the new US government from backing the island."It's sending a message to the Biden administration," he said.Beijing has watched with growing concern increasing US support for democratic Taiwan, especially during Donald Trump's administration, which left office on Wednesday.Last year, during visits by senior US officials to Taipei, Chinese aircraft briefly crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.The flight by the Chinese bombers and fighters on Saturday came just days after Joe Biden assumed the US presidency.Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the US commitment to Taiwan was "rock-solid" after the island's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's swearing-in on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reports-large-incursion-by-chinese-air-force-101611480291412.html

No casualties or damage were immediately reported.The quake in the South Shetland Islands had a magnitude of 6.9 with a depth of 9.6 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, while the earthquake in Chile had a magnitude of 5.8.Chile’s Interior Ministry said on Twitter the South Shetland Islands quake was 216 kilometers northeast of the country's O’Higgins scientific base, and called for coastal regions in the Antarctica to be evacuated because of a tsunami risk.Almost simultaneously a 5.8 magnitude quake swayed buildings in central Chile, including in the capital of Santiago. The quake had a depth of 110 kilometers.“As of this moment, there are no reports of damages to people or infrastructure or of alterations to basic services because of this earthquake," said Chile's national emergency center Onemi.Some people in Chile received the evacuation message on their cellphones by mistake, which authorities attributed to a technical error. The mistake led to confusion and local media showed hundreds of people starting to evacuate in the coastal region of La Serena in the country's north. They were later told it was a false alarm.More than 160 people evacuated the four Chilean bases in Antarctica, Onemi reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quakes-of-6-9-5-8-magnitude-hit-south-shetland-islands-chile-no-major-damage-101611480935652.html

24-01-2021||World||South African Hindu priests accused of overcharging for Covid victims' funerals||Some Hindu priests in South Africa have come under fire for allegedly charging high rates to conduct funerals of Covid-19 victims.Pradeep Ramlall, Manager of the Clare Estate Crematorium in Durban, slammed priests who are doing this.Ramlall, who is also a member of the Hindu Dharma Association of South Africa, said the organisation had received a number of complaints about this from families of people who had succumbed to the virus.In recent weeks, amid a second wave and a new variant of the Covid-19 virus, the crematorium has had to introduce double shifts amid daily deaths in the city which is home to more than a third of South Africa’s Indian-origin population of about 1.4 million.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Priests are charging between R1,200 and R2,000 to conduct a funeral. This is not right. As per our scriptures, this is our seva (service) to the community. If a family wants to give a priest a donation, then that is acceptable but priests should not be charging people,” Ramlall told the Weekly Post.“I was in my vehicle. The priest had conducted a Covid-19 victim's funeral. While he was in the parking lot, he removed R100 notes from his pocket and counted it before sanitising each note and putting the money back into his pocket,” he said recounting an incident that he had personally witnessed.Ramlall called on the community to avoid being exploited under the current trying circumstances which was bringing grief to so many families and asked them to conduct the cremation themselves.“We have pre-recorded videos that they can use. If they insist on having a priest, then the priest can conduct the funeral through Zoom or through a WhatsApp video call. We need to embrace technology,” Ramlall said.South African Hindu Maha Sabha President Ashwin Trikamjee said they had a list of accredited priests on the Sabha's Facebook page that families could contact to conduct the last rites at no charge.Citing the massive increase in the number of Covid-19-related deaths, Trikamjee said there were funerals being done at odd hours by priests who use their own transport and personal protective equipment (PPE) which they might expect reimbursement for, although families would not be obliged to pay.Earlier, Lucy Sigaban, a Hindu priestess in the sprawling Indian suburb of Lenasia near Johannesburg, had urged the government to assist priests who are conducting funerals of Covid-19 victims free of charge by providing them with PPE at no cost, but this has not happened yet.For the last two months, Covid-19 infections and deaths have been rising exponentially in South Africa.On Thursday alone, there were 647 deaths and over 11,000 more infections reported, bringing the total deaths to 39,501 and infections to 1.38 million since the first case was reported in March last year.The government is awaiting a shipment of over 15 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from India within the next month to prioritise health care workers and other essential services staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-african-hindu-priests-accused-of-overcharging-for-covid-victims-funerals-101611480137339.html
24-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Germany to begin experimental antibodies treatment used in treating former US President Donald Trump||Germany will become the first European Union country to start using the same experimental antibodies treatment credited with helping Donald Trump recover from Covid-19, health minister Jens Spahn said Sunday."The government has bought 200,000 doses for 400 million euros ($486 million)," Spahn told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, working out at 2,000 euros per dose.The so-called monoclonal antibody cocktails will be deployed to university hospitals in the coming week, he said, adding that Germany was "the first country in the EU" to use them in the fight against the pandemic.Spahn did not name the manufacturer that will be supplying the drugs but confirmed it was the same medicine given to then-US president Trump when he fell ill with Covid last October."They work like a passive vaccination. Administering these antibodies in the early stages can help high-risk patients avoid a more serious progression," Spahn said.Trump, who was briefly hospitalised with the coronavirus, was given the antibody therapy developed by US firm Regeneron, known as REGN-COV2, even before the treatment had won regulatory approval.He later said the medicine did "a fantastic job".US company Eli Lilly has developed a similar therapy.The novel treatment is a combination or "cocktail" of two lab-made antibodies: infection-fighting proteins that were developed to bind to the part of the new coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells.The antibodies attach themselves to different parts of the virus's spike protein, distorting its structure -- similar in a way to knocking a key out of shape so it no longer fits its lock.Germany's order comes at a time of growing frustration in the EU over a slower-than-expected rollout of vaccines.Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca have both said they would be delivering fewer doses to Europe than anticipated in the short term because of production problems.The German government has said it nonetheless expects to be able to offer all Germans a jab by the end of August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-begin-using-covid-19-medications-that-helped-donald-trump-s-recovery-101611480378687.html

Reuters could not independently confirm its authenticity.A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.On Friday, the Saudi-led coalition had said it foiled two Houthi attacks using an armed drone launched towards Saudi Arabia and an explosive-laden boat in the southern Red Sea.The alliance intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.The movement was designated by the Trump administration this month as a foreign terrorist organisation. New US President Joe Biden has initiated a review of the designation, which UN officials have warned could push Yemen into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudiled-forces-thwart-air-attack-on-riyadh-saudi-state-television-101611479069800.html

Trump’s government sold arms to Taiwan and his Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar traveled to Taipei in August, becoming the highest-level US visitor in decades.“The United States will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan,” the State Department said, adding that the commitment to Taiwan is “rock solid” and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability in Asia.At the same time, the US pledged to stand by communiques agreed with China, and its use of the phrase “people on Taiwan” could indicate that the Biden administration is keen to avoid any direct confrontation with China by elevating the status of Taiwan.US allies around the world have been eagerly awaiting indications of Joe Biden’s approach to China. Concerns about how to handle ties with Asia’s largest economy came second only to the coronavirus in a list of problems Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin discussed with his UK counterpart Ben Wallace in a call Saturday, according to an email from the US Department of Defence.US, Japan Defence chiefs agree to strengthen alliance in callAustin also agreed with Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi in a call early on Sunday to oppose any attempts to change the status quo in the East or South China Seas with force in the background, according to a Japanese Defence Ministry statement.China is using its growing military muscle to aggressively assert its territorial claims in neighboring seas, and its military aircraft frequently enter Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone, while Japanese and Chinese government ships frequently chase one another around disputed islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pushes-china-to-cease-pressure-on-taiwan-101611479195704.html

That's what we are focusing on. Some buildings have no management at all. We have to improve this urban redevelopment. Urban renewal is needed," Cheung said, SCMP quoted.He further said that officials have been visiting households in the restricted zone to send the occupants to mobile screening stations.Amid the rising number of cases in Hong Kong, more than 700 people are currently hospitalised and 38 are in critical condition. So far, Hong Kong has registered more than 10,000 cases and 168 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-plans-to-lift-lockdown-placed-on-densely-populated-area-on-monday-101611479679396.html

24-01-2021||World||Leaders of Covid019 vaccine rollout deliver some of world’s top gains||The race to deliver the jab to the world’s populations has so far been led by a handful of smaller nations, and now they’re outpacing some of the wealthiest countries in the eyes of traders too.The fastest Covid-19 vaccination rollouts globally, in Israel and the United Arab Emirates, are propelling their stocks to some of the world’s top gains. Israel’s benchmark index has advanced 7.6% this year, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Euro Stoxx Index. It ranks 12th among major equity gauges. Meantime, the Dubai Financial Market General Index has climbed 9%, all but reversing its 10% slump in 2020 and handing investors the sixth-best returns year to date. The Abu Dhabi Securities Market General Index is the world’s third-best performer.Traders are rushing to price the global vaccine rollout and betting nations at the forefront will be the fastest to recover from the crisis, lifting their stocks, currencies and bond yields. The share of a country’s population that has been inoculated might be “the most important statistic to track over the next year,” according to strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co.So far, Israel has vaccinated about 30% of its population and the UAE about 20%. If sustained, they could reach the threshold for herd immunity by mid-year, JPMorgan says.“Will enough divergence open up with respect to herd immunity across countries to render this issue tradeable across markets? Probably,” strategists led by John Normand wrote in a Jan. 8 note. “Those countries that return to pre-crisis levels of activity most quickly due to some combination of stimulus and vaccine distribution should witness the most upward pressure on their interest rates and currencies.”While Israel and Dubai are tantalizing examples, the case for growth fueled by vaccinations in larger economies is murky, according to Michael Herzum, who runs macro strategies at Union Investment in Frankfurt.“It is difficult to isolate these effects from other market drivers and therefore makes it difficult to play it on a country-by-country level,” Herzum said. Even so, he’s building vaccination rates into his cross-asset allocation decisions.In Britain, where the first citizen outside of a trial received the coronavirus vaccination on Dec. 8, the FTSE 100 benchmark has outperformed peers in Europe even as its population suffers through a third national lockdown to quell a resurgence of the virus and a new fast-spreading variant. Vaccinations could pave the economy’s path to recovery and further lift the nation’s stocks, according to Herzum.“U.K. equities could be in a good position very soon as the U.K. probably reaches herd immunity much faster than the continent due to much better progress on vaccinations,” he said. “This could result in a big swing in economic activity once Covid-19 related restrictions are lifted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-covid019-vaccine-rollout-deliver-some-of-world-s-top-gains-101611478572288.html
24-01-2021||World||Portugal votes to elect president amid severe Covid-19 pandemic surge||Portugal held a presidential election Sunday, with the moderate incumbent candidate strongly favored to earn a second five-year term as a devastating Covid-19 surge grips the European Union nation.The head of state in Portugal has no legislative powers, which lie with parliament and the government, but is an influential voice in the running of the country.Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, 72, is regarded as the clear front-runner among seven candidates. He is an affable, approachable law professor and former television personality who as president has consistently had an approval rating of 60% or more.To win, a candidate must capture more than 50% of the vote. But a severe surge in coronavirus infections in recent days could keep turnout low and perhaps lead to a runoff between the two top candidates, which would take place on Feb. 14. Portugal has increased polling stations and allowed for early voting to reduce crowding on election day.Portugal has the world’s highest rates of new daily infections and deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, and the public health system is under huge strain.With the country in lockdown, the election campaign featured none of the usual flag-waving rallies or other large public events, though restrictions on movement were lifted for polling day. Voters were asked to take their own pen and disinfectant to polling stations.Among the incumbent’s six challengers, right-wing populist André Ventura has attracted curiosity as the first extremist to break into Portuguese mainstream politics. Ventura, 37, could conceivably place second, likely far behind Rebelo de Sousa but drawing a level of support that until recently was unthinkable. That development has unsettled national politics.Rebelo de Sousa, a former leader of the center-right Social Democratic Party, has worked closely with the center-left minority Socialist government, supporting its pandemic efforts. He also has endeared himself to the Portuguese with his easygoing style. Photographs taken by passers-by of him in public places, such as one last year of him standing in line at a supermarket wearing sneakers and shorts, routinely go viral.Portugal has 10.8 million registered voters, some 1.5 million of them living abroad. Exit polls were to be published Sunday night, with most results expected by midnight.Every Portuguese president since 1976, when universal suffrage was introduced following the departure of a dictatorship, has been returned for a second term. No woman or member of an ethnic minority has ever held the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-votes-to-elect-president-amid-severe-covid-19-pandemic-surge-101611477900095.html

NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal amply proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targetting the corrupt, it was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.Hussain said that foreign governments don't believe in the "lies" told on Pakistani media about Nawaz and his family.Moreover, he claimed Prime Minister Imran Khan's ministers and friends were involved in corruption for which proof is available, adding that there was no accountability for them. Hussain gave the example of Faisal Vawda owning 19 undeclared properties in London, reported Geo News."Mark Bezant and Yasir Dajani of the FTI Consulting were appointed by the anti-graft watchdog (NAB) to comment on the Stroz Friedberg (SF) forensic report on the Sharif family and matters arising out of the report of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT)," explained Hussain.Mark Bezant of the FTI consulting and Yasir Dajani of the same firm was appointed by the NAB to comment on the SF forensic report which is essentially related to the Sharif family and matters arising out of the report of the JIT."Bezant's evidence was confined to the identification and valuation of relevant assets owned by the Sharif family," he added.Bezant was instructed by the NAB to consider and comment on the SF report, so his evidence was confined to matters relating to the Sharif family, specifically the identification and valuation of the relevant assets. The SF report resulted in identifying 76 items from the JIT report that was considered potentially recoverable assets of the Sharif family.Hussain said the report led to the identification of 76 items from the JIT report that were considered potentially recoverable assets and NAB representative contended that there were four items of double-counting totalling USD 41 million had not taken into account, further contending that liabilities of property-owning companies including mortgages were not taken into account, reported Geo News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-s-son-challenges-imran-khan-govt-to-show-proof-of-corruption-101611478169617.html

A short time later the UAE also announced the same decision making it 12th country outside of Russia which have authorised its use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-approves-emergency-use-of-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-101611475488258.html

The vast majority of them fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators said was executed with "genocidal intent" - assertions that Myanmar denies.Bangladesh will import white rice in a government-to-government deal at $485 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF) liner out basis, said Mosammat Nazmanara Khanum, the secretary at the country's food ministry."Our main priority is to bring down the prices of rice," Khanum told Reuters on Sunday, adding the government could buy as much as 10 million tonnes while private traders are allowed to buy another 10 million tonnes in the year to June.The deal will be signed soon and the rice will be delivered by April in phases, she said.Bangladesh is also buying 150,000 tonnes of rice from India's state-run firm NAFED in a government-to-government deal while it has issued a series of tender to buy the grain."We could buy more rice from India in state-to-state deals," Khanum said, adding that the Food Ministry was holding talks with several other Indian state agencies.Bangladesh, traditionally the world's third-biggest rice producer with around 35 million tonnes annually, uses almost all its production to feed its people. It still often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by floods or droughts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-buy-myanmar-rice-putting-aside-rohingya-crisis-101611470299921.html

Doug Verissimo, commander of the strike group, was quoted as saying."With two-thirds of the world's trade travelling through this very important region, it is vital that we maintain our presence and continue to promote the rules-based order which has allowed us all to prosper," Verissimo said in the statement.The announcement comes just days after Joe Biden was sworn in as US president.Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday there was "no doubt" China posed the most significant challenge to the United States of any nation.China has repeatedly complained about US Navy ships getting close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims.The Theodore Roosevelt is being accompanied by the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill, and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Russell and USS John Finn, the US statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aircraft-carrier-group-enters-south-china-sea-amid-taiwan-tensions-101611475141332.html
24-01-2021||World||Spain's virus surge hits mental health of front-line workers: Study||The unrelenting increase in Covid-19 infections in Spain following the holiday season is again straining hospitals, threatening the mental health of doctors and nurses who have been at the forefront of the pandemic for nearly a year.In Barcelona’s Hospital del Mar, the critical care capacity has more than doubled and is nearly full, with 80% of ICU beds occupied by coronavirus patients.“There are young people of 20-something-years-old and older people of 80-years-old, all the age groups,” said Dr. Joan Ramon Masclans, who heads the ICU. “This is very difficult, and it is one patient after another.”Even though authorities allowed gatherings of up to 10 people for Christmas and New Year celebrations, Masclans chose not to join his family and spent the holidays at home with his partner.“We did it to preserve our health and the health of others. And when you see that this isn’t being done (by others) it causes significant anger, added to the fatigue,” he said.A study released this month by Hospital del Mar looking at the impact of the spring's Covid-19 surge on more than 9,000 health workers across Spain found that at least 28% suffered major depression. That is six times higher than the rate in the general population before the pandemic, said Dr. Jordi Alonso, one of the chief researchers.In addition, the study found that nearly half of participants had a high risk of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks or substance- and alcohol-abuse problems.Spanish health care workers are far from the only ones to have suffered psychologically from the pandemic. In China, the levels of mental disorders among doctors and nurses were even higher, with 50% reporting depression, 45% reporting anxiety and 34% reporting insomnia, according to the World Health Organization.In the UK, a survey released last week by the Royal College of Physicians found that 64% of doctors reported feeling tired or exhausted. One in four sought out mental health support.“It is pretty awful at the moment in the world of medicine," Dr. Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said in a statement accompanying the study. “Hospital admissions are at the highest-ever level, staff are exhausted, and although there is light at the end of the tunnel, that light seems a long way away.”Dr. Aleix Carmona, a third-year anesthesiology resident in Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia, didn’t have much ICU experience before the pandemic hit. But as surgeries were cancelled, Carmona was summoned to the ICU at the Moisès Broggi hospital outside Barcelona to fight a virus the world knew very little about.“In the beginning, we had a lot of adrenaline. We were very frightened but we had a lot of energy,” Carmona recalled. He plowed through the first weeks of the pandemic without having much time to process the unprecedented battle that was unfolding.It wasn’t until after the second month that he began feeling the toll of seeing first-hand how people were slowly dying as they ran out of breath. He pondered what to tell patients before intubating them. His initial reaction had always been to reassure them, tell them it would be alright. But in some cases he knew that wasn’t true.“I started having difficulty sleeping and a feeling of anxiety before each shift,” Carmona said, adding that he would return home after 12 hours feeling like he had been beaten up.For a while he could only sleep with the help of medication. Some colleagues started taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs. What really helped Carmona, though, was a support group at his hospital, where his co-workers unloaded the experiences they had bottled up inside.But not everyone joined the group. For many, asking for help would make them seem unfit for the job.“In our profession, we can handle a lot,” said David Oliver, a spokesman for the Catalonia chapter of the SATSE union of nurses. “We don’t want to take time off because we know we will add to the workload of our colleagues.”The most affected group of health care workers, according to the study, were nurse's aides and nurses, who are overwhelmingly women and often immigrants. They spent more time with dying Covid-19 patients, faced poor working conditions and salaries and feared infecting family members.Desirée Ruiz is the nurse supervisor at Hospital del Mar’s critical care unit. Some nurses on her team have asked to take time off work, unable to cope with the constant stress and all the deaths.To prevent infections, patients are rarely allowed family visits, adding to their dependency on nurses. Delivering a patient’s last wishes or words to relatives on the phone is especially challenging, Ruiz said.“This is very hard for ... people who are holding the hand of these patients, even though they know they will end up dying,” she said.Ruiz, who organizes the nurses’ shifts and makes sure the ICU is always staffed adequately, is finding it harder and harder to do so.Unlike in the summer, when the number of cases fell and health workers were encouraged to take holidays, doctors and nurses have been working incessantly since the fall, when virus cases picked up again.The latest resurgence has nearly doubled the number of daily cases seen in November, and Spain now has the third-highest Covid-19 infection rate in Europe and the fourth-highest death toll, with more than 55,400 confirmed fatalities.But unlike many European countries, including neighboring Portugal, the Spanish health minister has for now ruled out the possibility of a new lockdown, relying instead on less drastic restrictions that aren’t as damaging to the economy but take longer to decrease the rate of infections.Alonso fears the latest surge of virus patients could be as detrimental to the mental health of medical staff as the shock of the pandemic's first months.“If we want to be cared for adequately, we also need to take care of the health care workers, who have suffered and are still suffering," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spains-virus-surge-hits-mental-health-of-front-line-workers-study-101611474354079.html
24-01-2021||World||Imran Khan delays notification on formation of Broadsheet inquiry committee||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has delayed the issuance of notification regarding the formation of the inquiry committee on the Broadsheet issue, said a senior cabinet member to The Express Tribune on Sunday.Earlier this week, the federal cabinet had ordered the inquiry, headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court or a high court, to examine the circumstances relating to the Broadsheet agreement and subsequent arbitration proceedings and present its report and recommendation in 45 days, reported The Express Tribune.The cabinet had decided that the inquiry committee would include a senior officer from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), a senior lawyer appointed by Prime Minister Imran Khan and an official of the office of the Advocate General for Pakistan, reported The Express Tribune.Later the government announced that the inquiry would be led by former Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed Sheikh. However, it has yet to issue the notification, which is creating doubts in people's minds.The Broadsheet LLC, based in the Isle of Man, was hired by the NAB during Musharraf's regime to trace out hidden assets of Pakistanis in foreign countries. The NAB signed an agreement with the Broadsheet but terminated it in 2003.The scandal amply proved that Pakistan has been plagued by corruption. Instead of targetting the corrupt, the Broadsheet was used for political gains and safe passage was given to the corrupt people to escape accountability through National Reconciliation Ordinance.In March 2019, the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) gave a $20 million final award in the Broadsheet case. However, the NAB/Imran-led government did not pay that amount and due to interest, the award amount rose to $28.7 million by December 2020.The opposition as well as some lawyers have said that the government should give an explanation on $8 to $10 million interest which had been added to the award payment. The country faced $5,000 interest daily in the Broadsheet case, reported The Express Tribune.Moreover, the appointment of former Supreme Court judge Azmat Saeed created widespread criticism from the opposition parties as well as some sections of the media.Saeed was employed as the deputy prosecutor general of NAB in the year 2000 for a period of one year. He was appointed as special prosecutor of NAB in 2001 to pursue cases before the accountability courts at Attock Fort and Rawalpindi.Legal experts have indicated that the appointment of Justice (retd) Sheikh could be challenged in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the basis of conflict of interest because the former judge had worked as deputy/special prosecutor general of the NAB.They suggested that government must review its decision on his nomination. Similarly, they also suggest that Term of References (ToRs) - also approved by the cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday - should be reviewed, reported The Express Tribune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-delays-notification-on-formation-of-broadsheet-inquiry-committee-101611473932608.html
24-01-2021||World||Australia says ‘inevitable’ Google, others have to pay for news||Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it’s “inevitable” that Google and other tech behemoths will have to eventually pay for using media content, responding to the internet giant’s threat to disable its search engine in the country if it’s forced to pay local publishers for news.Google said Friday that a proposed law, intended to compensate publishers for the value their stories generate for the company, is “unworkable,” opposing the requirement it pay media companies for displaying snippets of articles in search results.As Google escalates a months-long standoff with the government, Frydenberg said Australia could either be a “world leader” in pushing for the code or wait to follow others in passing similar legislation.“It seems that digital giants did themselves a big disservice last week when they very openly and publicly threatened the Australian public with pulling out of Australia effectively with search if the legislation proceeds as it currently stands,” Frydenberg said.The threat is Google’s most potent yet as the digital giant tries to stem a flow of regulatory action worldwide, but such a radical step would hand an entire developed market to rivals. At least 94% of online searches in Australia go through the Alphabet Inc. unit, according to the local competition regulator.Facebook Inc., the only other company targeted by the legislation, also opposes the law in Australia. The social media platform reiterated at Friday’s hearing it’s considering blocking Australians from sharing news on Facebook if the law is pushed through.Frydenberg also accused the tech giants of shifting the goalposts when it came to expressing their resistance to the code, after they first rejected a final arbitration model, to now opposing the idea of paying for any clicks displayed under the search results.“If the clicks for media content is such a small proportion of their overall clicks on their search, then ultimately, the independent arbiters will find that it should reflect that payment for content -- reflecting the benefit to Google, to Facebook from having that media content on their sites,” he said.The legislation is designed to support a local media industry, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., that has struggled to adapt to the digital economy. Google’s tougher stance drew rebukes from lawmakers at the hearing, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying Friday that “we don’t respond to threats.”“It’s about control and power,” said Johan Lidberg, an associate professor at Melbourne’s Monash University who specializes in media and journalism. “They’re signaling to other regulators they’ll have a fight on their hands if they do this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-says-inevitable-google-others-have-to-pay-for-news-101611474098898.html
24-01-2021||World||Pakistan to launch 5G internet network in 2022-23: Report||Pakistan is planning to roll out the most advanced 5G internet in 2022-23 which will accelerate the download speed 10 times to one gigabit per second (Gbps) and widen economic activities in the country, a media report said on Sunday.Pakistan is developing a comprehensive roadmap for 5G technology readiness in the country. It is aimed at auctioning “spectrum for…5G services in the fiscal year 2023,” the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in its annual report 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic proved a blessing in disguise as the digital economy widened multi-fold during these testing times in Pakistan. The crisis has prompted regulators and stakeholders to improve digital infrastructure.Pakistan has kick-started its journey to make the most advanced 5G internet commercially available to consumers in 2022-23, The Express Tribune reported.The tested speed stands 10 times higher compared to 100 megabits per second (Mbps) on 4G internet in the world, it said.Earlier, mobile phone service providing firms successfully conducted a test trial of 5G services under a limited environment and on non-commercial basis in 2019 and 2020.Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Aminul Haque said the government had planned to launch 5G technology by December 2022, but experts are still sceptical, believing the country will take a much longer time (5-7 years) to roll out the next-generation technology.Haque made a test video call through 5G to China and said it was a wonderful experience. The voice was loud and clear, and the video quality was also wonderful, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-launch-5g-internet-network-in-2022-23-report-101611473841931.html

Rescue workers wrapped the barely responsive man in a blanket before taking him to hospital by ambulance.Later, the broadcaster said another three miners were brought out from a different section of the mine, including one who was injured. No further details were given.Twenty-two workers were trapped in the Hushan mine by the Jan. 10 blast in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in coastal Shandong province.One miner has died and 11 have not been in contact with rescue teams, according to a Xinhua report from last week.Officials said on Thursday it could take another two weeks to clear "severe blockages" before they could drill shafts to reach a group of 10 men who had been receiving supplies of food from the rescue team.State media said earlier however that rescuers were hoping to reach the 10 men in the mine's 5th section on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rescues-four-miners-after-14-days-trapped-underground-101611468709961.html
24-01-2021||World||Covid shot scarcity weighs on hopes for Biden’s global push||With a new president in the White House, the U.S. is re-engaging with the rest of the world to combat Covid-19. But for now, the Biden administration may hold back the one thing poorer countries desperately need: vaccines.One day after Joe Biden’s inauguration last week, his chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, pledged support for the World Health Organization, including participation in the Covax program to deploy vaccines globally. Even with the U.S. playing an active role, tough challenges remain in the effort to aid low- and middle-income nations.The U.S. has long been the WHO’s leading partner in battling diseases, including smallpox, polio and Ebola. And the superpower could still have a big impact in the bid to slow Covid-19 and tackle other threats after former President Donald Trump’s pullback. Lawrence Gostin, a global health law professor at Georgetown University, said he believes it’s imperative for wealthy countries to start sharing vaccines before it’s too late. But doing so, he said, presents a challenge as the virus continues to spread in the U.S.“When the U.S. is in an emergency, we start looking inward,” Gostin said in an interview. “Even if the rest of the world is on fire, we start looking inward.”The administration plans to fulfill U.S. financial obligations to the WHO and looks forward to working with Covax and its partners to maximize the program’s efforts, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. support may “not necessarily” include vaccines, Fauci told reporters Thursday at the White House.Helping others isn’t just a moral imperative. Containing the spread of the virus in other countries could help limit mutations that might make vaccines less effective. Meanwhile, U.S. rivals for global influence, China and Russia, are busy offering their own vaccines in the developing world, winning friends and influence with traditional American allies.As the pandemic extends into a second year and more contagious variants of the virus emerge, governments worldwide -- though mainly wealthy ones -- are rolling out vaccines to protect their populations. That’s triggered concern that by prioritizing their own interests, they’re ignoring the needs of less-fortunate countries while allowing the pathogen to advance.Vaccine advocates have urged wealthy nations to share some of the supplies they’ve snapped up in recent months and to follow the lead of Norway, which pledged to donate extra doses through Covax.While that may be a tough call, major economies could move in that direction when vaccines begin to curb severe illnesses and deaths at home, said David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and former WHO official.“It’s going to be very difficult for all countries with money and pre-purchased supplies to provide that to Covax and to countries that need it at this time,” Heymann said. “Once the political leaders who have made these promises to their countries do see an impact from the vaccines, they may be able to reconsider national allocations and contribute more to Covax.”49 CountriesAs of Jan. 18, vaccines had been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries, compared with just one of the world’s lowest-income countries, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general.But as Western countries have corralled supplies to protect their own populations, others are seeking to fill the void. Russia, for instance, has signed deals with a number of low- and middle-income countries for the Sputnik V vaccine that was approved last year. China too has extended vaccine financing and supplies to a number of countries.Meanwhile, the U.S. spent billions of dollars to develop and secure for its own use more than 1 billion doses from manufacturers, including Moderna Inc., AstraZeneca Plc, and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership. Yet only 20 million doses have been administered, according to Bloomberg’s tracker, covering about 6% of the population.That leaves a huge part of the U.S. still vulnerable to Covid-19, and increases the chance that the next three months of the pandemic, and the start of Biden’s term, could be the worst, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.Diplomatic ReasonsEven so, he said, the U.S. should also be more involved in the global program for both diplomatic and public-health reasons.“We want to reduce the burden on the entire world because it will help ourselves,” said Osterholm, who has been advising Biden on Covid. “Assisting the world is a diplomatic activity and a strategic activity.”The question is how. Biden is already restoring channels of funding and personnel that the previous administration withdrew, or threatened to withdraw. At the same time, the U.S. has earmarked more than $4 billion in additional funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a Covax partner that distributes immunizations to children in low-income nations.Many countries are now counting on Covax.The program, led by the WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said it is on track to deliver at least 2 billion doses -- about two-thirds of which will go to lower-income economies -- and to vaccinate at least a fifth of each participating country’s population by year’s end.Yet several leaders have questioned whether the program will get the vaccines it needs as governments prioritize their own supply deals through direct talks with manufacturers, the head of the WHO said last week. This is driving up prices and may lead to hoarding, chaos and social and economic disruption, he warned.Fully FundedEven if the U.S. can’t donate doses immediately, it could help ensure that Covax is fully funded, Gostin said. To achieve that goal, Covax estimates it needs to raise an added $2.8 billion this year.Perhaps one of the most important contributions the U.S. could make would be in the form of high-level diplomacy, said Stephen Morrison, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Global Health Policy Center. The country was absent from a virtual global fund-raising event supported by the European Union in May that secured pledges of about $8 billion.The U.S., which will soon hold the presidency of the United Nations Security Council, could facilitate a meeting of global leaders to coordinate efforts against a threat to the entire world, Morrison said. Key issues to discuss could include more financing of vaccine purchases, use of vaccine surpluses, debt relief and emergency humanitarian relief.“I think it’s inevitable that there will be some kind of summitry dedicated to these issues,” he said. “U.S. leadership has been the missing element and now it’s essential.”Affordable CostsThe Biden administration could be a help roll out immunizations worldwide by pushing manufacturers to provide vaccines at affordable costs, said Robert Yates, executive director of the Centre for Universal Health at Chatham House, a London-based think tank. Just days after Biden took office, Pfizer and BioNTech agreed to provide as many as 40 million vaccine doses to Covax after months of talks.Whatever form U.S. involvement takes, its re-emergence as partners and its highly regarded Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will strengthen the global effort and is a “good sign” for everyone, according to Heymann, a former CDC staffer.“It’s what America really wants,” Heymann said. “It’s been a terrible time to see the U.S. ignore the CDC and, in general, the global health community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-shot-scarcity-weighs-on-hopes-for-biden-s-global-push-101611467209626.html
24-01-2021||World||Year after lockdown, Wuhan dissident more isolated than ever||One year after lockdown, Wuhan has long since sprung back to life — but Zhu Tao remains bunkered in his 14th-floor apartment, spending his days doomscrolling through news, playing virtual soccer on his PlayStation and feeling China is teetering on the brink of collapse.He has blown thousands of dollars, his life savings, stockpiling beef jerky and chocolate bars, bottles of water and sacks of rice, masks, alcohol and disinfecting wipes, and a $900 solar panel.Haunting Zhu is the fear that the virus might return — that once again, the government will conceal the truth, and once again, Wuhan will fall under lockdown.“I’m in a state of eating and waiting for death, eating and waiting for death,” Zhu said, with a buzzcut he trimmed himself, since he does not dare to venture out to the barber. “People like me might be the minority, but I take it very seriously.”Zhu, a 44-year-old smelter at the city’s state-run iron and steel works, is well outside the mainstream in China. He is a hardboiled government critic, an on-and-off demonstrator, a supporter of the Hong Kong democracy movement.He and others willing to publicly air such views are ridiculed, dismissed or silenced. They are a minority in an increasingly authoritarian and prosperous China, where there is less tolerance for protest and less appetite to do so.Early in the Wuhan outbreak, which would later spread around the globe and kill over 2 million people, Zhu ignored state media reports that downplayed the virus and stayed home, a move that may have saved him, his wife and his son from infection.For a few fleeting months, as public anger erupted at authorities who hid critical information on the coronavirus, Zhu felt his early caution warranted, his deep suspicion of officials vindicated.But as winter mellowed into spring and Wuhan’s lockdown was lifted, the mood shifted. Now, the rich kids of Wuhan down pricey bottles of whiskey and bop to crashing electronica at the city’s swank nightclubs. Thousands throng Jianghan road, the city’s premier shopping street.Once seen as prophetic, Zhu has now become a pariah, his anti-state sentiment more and more at odds with government orthodoxy. He has alienated his in-laws and neighbors and has been detained, subjected to surveillance and censored.Bracing for another wave of infection, he wonders how it’s possible that everyone around him is carrying on with life as usual.“This is the biggest historical event in the past century,” Zhu said. “But everyone has gone back to their lives, just like before the epidemic. ... How can they be so numb, so indifferent, as though they barely experienced anything at all?”Zhu grew up in the 1980s, a politically open era in China, when teachers at times touched on concepts like democracy and freedom of speech after the disastrous tumult of Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution.It suited Zhu, given his self-described “very naughty, very rebellious” nature and his intellectual instincts, reflected in the way he peppers his language with literary references despite never having gone to college.He was just a kid during the 1989 Tiananmen protests, when hundreds of thousands took to Beijing’s central square to demand democratic rights. But in the years after the bloody military crackdown on the protesters, he read more about it, growing sympathetic even as others grew cynical, indifferent or even supportive of Communist Party rule, won over by China’s growing prosperity.When Zhu first went online over a decade ago, he discovered others shared his way of thinking. China hadn’t yet developed the sophisticated internet police force that patrols the web today, and uncensored news about the government constantly exploded online.The first controversy to catch Zhu’s eye was a scandal over tainted milk powder that killed six babies and sickened tens of thousands more. He joined chat groups and get-togethers and slowly slipped into dissident circles.After President Xi Jinping — China’s most authoritarian leader in decades — came to power, Zhu’s views brought him more and more trouble. In 2014, he was detained for a month after donning a black shirt and a white flower at a Wuhan plaza in remembrance of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, estranging him from his teenage son.But when a mysterious respiratory illness began spreading through Wuhan early last year, Zhu's deep-seated skepticism toward the government suddenly proved prescient. After seeing rumors of the disease in late December 2019, Zhu began warning friends and family. Many brushed him off as an obstinate gadfly, but his wife and son stayed home, saving them from outings that would soon sicken relatives.The first to fall ill was his wife’s aunt, who started coughing after an appointment with an eye doctor at a hospital where the virus was spreading. Next was his wife’s cousin, who had accompanied her to the same hospital. Then it was his neighbor’s mother.Then came the lockdown, proclaimed with no warning on Jan. 23 at 2 in the morning. Wuhan stumbled into the history books, the epicenter of the biggest quarantine in history. The virus ravaged the city of 11 million, flooding hospitals and killing thousands, including his wife's aunt on Jan. 24.Zhu took grim satisfaction in being proved correct. He watched on social media as public anger exploded, reaching a fever pitch in February with the death of Li Wenliang, a Wuhan doctor who was punished for warning others of the very disease that would claim his life.That night, Zhu was glued to his phone, scrolling through hundreds of posts decrying censorship. There were hashtags demanding freedom of speech. There was a quote from Li to a Chinese magazine shortly before his death: “A healthy society shouldn’t just have one voice”.By early next morning, many of the posts had been purged by censors. On his wife's cousin death certificate, doctors wrote she died of an ordinary lung infection, though she had tested positive for the coronavirus. That deepened Zhu’s suspicions that cases were being grossly undercounted.“I was so angry it hurt,” he said. “I had nowhere to vent my emotions. You want to kill someone, you’re so angry, you know?"The outbreak strained Zhu’s relationships. His neighbor, a childhood friend, quarreled with Zhu after doctors told the neighbor’s mother that she had just a regular lung infection.“I questioned him. `How can you be sure that what the hospital told you was the truth?'” Zhu recalled. “I said you should still be careful.”A week later, his friend’s mother passed away. On her death certificate, coronavirus was given as the cause. They argued the day she died, with Zhu’s friend accusing him of cursing his mother. The two haven’t spoken since.In April, the lockdown was lifted after 76 days. But as others crept back to work, Zhu asked for a year’s medical leave and shut himself in. His quarantine has lasted nearly 400 days and counting.He refused to go to his cousin's and aunt’s funerals that summer, even though there were no longer any new cases in Wuhan. His angry in-laws cut off contact.Pockets of like-minded people still dot China, from renegade intellectuals in Beijing to a punk cafe in Inner Mongolia where posters and stickers read “preventable and controllable” –- quietly jeering the boilerplate phrase officials used to downplay the virus.In Wuhan, circles of dissidents gather on encrypted chats to swap intelligence. At small gatherings over tea, they grouse about inconsistencies in the party line with a hint of pride, saying they saved themselves from the virus by not trusting the government.But under the watchful gaze of state cameras and censors, there is little room to organize or connect. Ahead of the lockdown anniversary this year, police spirited at least one dissenter out of Wuhan. He was bei luyou, or “touristed,” the playful phrase used by activists to describe how police take troublemakers on involuntary vacations at sensitive moments.In his self-quarantine, Zhu has found solace in literature. He is drawn to Soviet writers who poked fun at Moscow’s vast propaganda apparatus. He is also convinced the virus could be spreading widely, even though China’s official case count is now far lower than that of most other countries.“They’ve been lying for such a long time,” Zhu said, “so long that even if they started telling me the truth, I won’t believe it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/year-after-lockdown-wuhan-dissident-more-isolated-than-ever-101611464966435.html
24-01-2021||World||Citizenship data is latest rollback of Trump census efforts||The US Census Bureau is suspending efforts to create neighborhood-level statistics on the citizenship and age of residents, using 2020 census data, in the latest rollback of Trump administration census-related initiatives that critics feared would be used to favor Republicans and whites during the drawing of state and local districts.As part of an order President Joe Biden signed Wednesday on the 2020 census, the Census Bureau said Friday that it would discontinue efforts to create citizenship tabulations at the city-block level using 2020 census data combined with administrative records.Among his first acts as president, Biden's order revoked two Trump directives related to the 2020 census. The first attempted to discern the citizenship status of every US resident through administrative records, and the second sought to exclude people in the US illegally from the numbers used for apportioning congressional seats among the states.Trump's commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, had ordered the production of the block-level citizenship data in 2018.After Wednesday's order by Biden, the Census Bureau said none of the data from the 2020 census would include information on citizenship or immigration status, at any geographic level.Citizen Voting Age by Race and Ethnicity (CVAP) data were created almost two decades ago to help assess whether minority communities were getting equal opportunities to elect candidates of their choice. The data currently comes from American Community Survey estimates.But in the mid-2010s, an influential GOP adviser noted in a report that using adult-age citizen figures as the basis for redrawing state and local districts, instead of the total population, would be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.The Trump administration made several attempts to gather citizenship data through the 2020 census, including adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaire, which was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2019.The efforts at gathering the citizenship data were challenged by civil rights groups in federal court in Maryland. A spokeswoman for one of the plaintiffs, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said the group needed to assess where the Census Bureau was in the process before dismissing the Maryland lawsuit.Jeffrey Wice, a Democratic redistricting expert, hailed the revocations of the Trump administration's census directives.“This is a major step towards an honest and fair redistricting process, helping ensure that everyone is represented in new districts,” Wice said.But Adam Kincaid, a leader of Republican redistricting efforts, said in a statement that the Biden administration was merely “concealing critical information” about the citizen population in the U.S.“For an administration that claims to be guided by facts, it is concerning that they are so selective of which facts they release," Kincaid said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizenship-data-is-latest-rollback-of-trump-census-efforts-101611455002011.html
24-01-2021||World||Indonesia sees risks to growth on virus curbs, natural disasters||Indonesia sees downside risks for economic growth in the first quarter as the government imposed more restrictions to curb a worsening coronavirus outbreak, said the finance minister.The first quarter is “very tough,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on Saturday. “We hope in February and March we can still catch up despite the January which is going to be very tough because of Covid and natural disasters.”She expects the full-year 5% growth target to still be achievable as the mass vaccination program gives “hope and optimism.”President Joko Widodo expected the economy to rebound as soon as the start of this year, calling 2021 as the year when the country can see a turnaround after last year plunging into its first recession in two decades. But surging numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths prompted the government to limit people’s movement in key economic centers of Java and Bali.The government also had to contend with a string of natural disasters, including recent floods in Kalimantan, earthquakes in Sulawesi and erupting volcanoes in Java, though the impact on the budget so far is still manageable, Indrawati said.The country is grappling with the largest coronavirus outbreak in Southeast Asia and is still reporting record-high numbers every few days. It’s banking on a mass inoculation program that’s been slow to pick up. Since Jokowi kicked off the campaign on Jan. 13, more than 132,000 people have received their first doses as of Friday, about 22% of the government’s target for January. Indonesia aims to vaccinate more than 180 million people by the end of the year.Government’s HomeworkIndonesia had to boost its budget deficit to 6.09% of gross domestic product last year, double the regulated ceiling of 3%, to afford stimulus packages including cash handouts, free electricity and credit guarantees to buffer the impact of the pandemic. This year, the government expects to be able to narrow the gap to 5.7% as it can draw on unspent money from last year to buy vaccines and reallocate spending toward more urgent needs, Indrawati said.After approving a massive overhaul of investment rules through the so-called omnibus law in 2020, the government now seeks to reform the financial sector. Many existing rules for banks and capital markets are outdated as they were set up in the early 2000s, after the Asian financial crisis, the finance minister said.She is also focused on raising tax ratios, while improving the way capital flows toward actual investments in the country, such as through the new wealth fund.Indonesia has a lot of potential to offer, “at the same time we also recognize we have a lot of homework to do to improve our investment climate,” Indrawati said. “In this very extraordinary situation we also communicate very clearly in the most credible way how we respond to that extraordinary situation with extraordinary policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-sees-risks-to-growth-on-virus-curbs-natural-disasters-101611452350849.html

On January 14, India had called for an immediate stop to the targeted attacks in Afghanistan and sought a comprehensive ceasefire to take forward efforts to usher in peace.Sullivan “underscored that the US will support the peace process with a robust and regional diplomatic effort”, said a readout from the US national security council.

The disease has claimed over 2.1 million lives around the world.In Hong Kong, authorities said an area comprising 16 buildings in the city’s Yau Tsim Mong district would be locked down until all residents were tested. Residents would not be allowed to leave their homes until they received their test results to prevent cross-infection.Hong Kong has been grappling to contain a fresh wave of the coronavirus since November. Over 4,300 cases have been recorded in the last two months, making up nearly 40% of the city’s total.In the US, President Joe Biden said on Friday the Covid-19 death toll in the country is feared to top 600,000. “The virus is surging. We’re 400,000 dead, expected to reach well over 600,000,” he told a news conference, giving his highest estimate yet for the US outbreak’s eventual death toll.Biden has signed a slew of executive orders, including a one to fix the country’s economy that has been battered by the pandemic that has also left some 18 million Americans unemployed.On day three of his presidency, Biden announced “The American Rescue Plan” that includes economic relief for most Americans who are in need and to boost economic relief for the people struggling during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-infections-near-100-million-mark-101611450433747.html

Among those detained were Navalny’s wife Yulia Navalnaya, who was later released, and his prominent aide Lyubov Sobol.“What a joy that you are here!” Navalnaya wrote before being detained and posting a picture of herself from inside a police van. The protests in Moscow were estimated to be the largest demonstrators since 2019 when Navalny supporters rallied to demand free local elections.Navalny had called on Russians to protest this week after surviving a near-fatal suspected poisoning with Novichok and returning to Moscow following months of treatment in Germany, only to be arrested immediately on arrival.Some protesters marched towards the Kremlin, while others blocked Tverskaya Street, the Russian capital’s main thoroughfare. Police clashed with the demonstrators in the city centre and hit them with truncheons.Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Fund said on Twitter said that “an incredible number” of people had gathered in the capital. Moscow police, which are accused of downplaying turnout at rallies, said 4,000 turned up.Thousands took to the streets in the Far East, Siberia and the Urals including Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg.Russia says US diplomats published rally routesRussia on Saturday accused the US embassy in Moscow of publishing routes of planned demonstrations in support of Navalny and demanded an explanation from US diplomats.“Yesterday, the US embassy in Moscow published ‘protest routes’ in Russian cities and tossed around information about a ‘march on the Kremlin,’” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-2-000-held-at-anti-putin-rallies-101611450307712.html

He denies wrongdoing, but the protesters say he cannot run the country properly while under indictment.The protests have taken place each week since last summer, primarily at a Jerusalem square near Netanyahu’s official residence, and continued despite lower turnout in the cold winter nights.In March, Israel will hold its fourth national election in less than two years, and Netanyahu is facing further challenges from defectors within his Likud party.The government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis has also fueled the protests. With the country's third lockdown still in place, Israel's economy has been hit hard by virus restrictions amid surging infection rates.By Saturday, more than 2.5 million of Israel’s 9 million population had received at least the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine amid Israel’s world-leading inoculation drive, which Netanyahu has placed at the center of his reelection campaign.

24-01-2021||World||Texan man charged in Capitol riot tweeted 'Assassinate AOC': FBI||A 34-year-old Texas man has been arrested for allegedly taking part in the storming of the US Capitol this month and posting violent threats, including a call to assassinate Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.Garret Miller, who is from the Dallas suburb of Richardson, was arrested Friday after being named in a five-count federal complaint.Authorities allege that Miller posted photos and videos on his social media accounts that show him inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6 storming of the building by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. They also say he called for violence in online posts, including a tweet that simply read “Assassinate AOC,” a reference to the liberal Ocasio-Cortez.In another tweet, Miller posted: “They are right next time we bring the guns," an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit.Miller also threatened a US Capitol police officer during an exchange on Instagram, writing that he planned to “hug his neck with a nice rope," the affidavit states.After posting a photo on Facebook showing him inside the Capitol, Miller responded to a comment on the picture with: “just want to incriminate myself a little lol," according to an FBI affidavit.Ocasio-Cortez on Friday posted Miller's charging documents on Twitter and then tweeted: “On one hand you have to laugh, and on the other know that the reason they were this brazen is because they thought they were going to succeed."Miller's attorney, Clint Broden, said in an email to The Associated Press that Miller regrets the actions he took “in a misguided effort to show his support for former President Trump."“His social media comments reflect very ill-considered political hyperbole in very divided times and will certainly not be repeated in the future," Broden said. “He looks forward to putting all of this behind him."Miller is scheduled for a detention hearing on Monday.“We are hopeful that, given his family support and regret for his actions, he will be released so that he can resolve the charges against him in a timely fashion," Broden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texan-man-charged-in-capitol-riot-tweeted-assassinate-aoc-fbi-101611449058175.html

Rittenhouse has been charged with multiple counts, including reckless and intentional homicide, endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm.Prosecutors allege Rittenhouse, who is white, left his home in Antioch, Illinois, and traveled to Kenosha to answer a call for militia to protect businesses. Kenosha was in the throes of several nights of chaotic street demonstrations after a white officer shot Blake in the back during a domestic disturbance, leaving Blake paralyzed.Rittenhouse opened fire with an assault-style rifle during the protest, killing Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, authorities said. Rittenhouse has pleaded not guilty to all counts and argued he fired in self-defense. Conservatives have rallied around him, generating enough money to make his $2 million cash bail.According to online court records, a Wisconsin judge modified Rittenhouse's conditions of release on Friday to note Rittenhouse “shall not knowingly have conduct with any person or group of persons known to harm, threaten, harass or menace others on the basis of their race, beliefs on the subject of religion, color, national origin, or gender."He is also barred from possessing and consuming alcohol and from having firearms.Prosecutors had requested the modifications after Rittenhouse was seen drinking at a bar in the southeastern Wisconsin city of Mount Pleasant, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Milwaukee, earlier this month. The legal drinking age is 21, but in Wisconsin, Rittenhouse could legally drink alcohol because he was with his mother.According to WMTV, prosecutors wrote in their request that Rittenhouse also posed for a photo outside Pudgy's Pub with two men as they made the “OK” sign with their hands, a symbol used by white supremacists. Prosecutors also alleged five men at the tavern serenaded Rittenhouse with a song that has become the anthem of the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenosha-shooter-can-t-associate-with-supremacists-judge-101611448066287.html

First, the PIA pilots were humiliated around the world and now the airline has fallen to such a point. Pakistan never saw such days ever," Maryam said.Senior PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday said that it was a decision that destroyed Pakistan's reputation just because of the "incompetence and ego worship" of the prime minister and aviation minister.The News International reported that an advisory has been issued by the UN Security Management System (UNSMS) which states: "Due to an ongoing investigation of the CAA [Civil Aviation Authority] Pakistan...due to dubious licences, caution is advised on the use of Pakistan-registered air operators."According to the Pakistan daily, the UN advisory has been recommended to agencies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN High Commission for Refugees, UN Development Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and many others.In the light of this development, that UN officials working in the country can not travel by any Pakistan-registered airline, even within Pakistan.According to The News International, UN advisory said that the air operator information is the result of a new automated system, which is linked with the revised global air travel safety policy.Back in December last year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had extended a ban on Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) for three months, despite the Pakistani officials' expectations that the ban would be lifted.The EASA had informed that the PIA that the ban would only be lifted after a safety audit of the Civil Aviation Authority, Dawn reported. The EASA had in July 2019 suspended the authorisation for PIA to operate flights in the EU member states due to safety concerns.The suspension had come after it was revealed that the credentials of hundreds of Pakistani pilots were "dubious". Meanwhile, PIA has suffered a loss of billions of rupees since the suspension of flight operations to and from the European Union and the United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-lambasts-pm-imran-khan-after-un-restricts-staff-from-flying-by-pakistani-airlines-101611447707976.html

Both of those moves reversed former President Donald Trump's climate policies.John Kerry, a former US secretary of state who is Biden's special climate envoy, told the mayors' meeting that tackling climate change did not mean a diminishment of lifestyle, such as driving less or not being able to eat meat.But the Biden administration and mayors and other local leaders will have to persuade Americans that curbing climate change "can be the greatest economic transformation in global history," Kerry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-administration-to-unveil-climate-change-policies-adviser-says-101611446551115.html

24-01-2021||World||11 Iraqi fighters killed in IS attack: Report||At least 11 fighters from Iraq's state-sponsored Hashed al-Shaabi force were killed in an ambush by the Islamic State group north of the capital on Saturday, Hashed security sources said.The jihadists used light weapons and the cover of darkness to target the Hashed east of Tikrit, the capital of Iraq's Salahaddin province, two days after a twin suicide attack claimed by the group killed 32 people in Baghdad."IS launched an attack on the Hashed's Brigade 22," said one of the unit's officers Abu Ali al-Maliki.Maliki told AFP the brigade commander was among those killed before reinforcements from the federal police came to the unit's aid.Hashed security sources said the total toll was 11 dead and 10 wounded.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but security sources interviewed by AFP blamed IS.Iraq declared the group territorially defeated in late 2017, but has continued to battle extremist sleeper cells, mostly in the country's mountainous and desert areas.Local troops have been aided by a US-led coalition, which first intervened to help fight IS in 2014 and continues to provide training, surveillance and air strikes in support of anti-jihadist operations.The coalition has significantly drawn down its troop numbers over the past year, with the US shrinking its force from 5,200 to 2,500.A worn-down militaryLocal and Western sources have expressed concern over the readiness of Iraq's security forces, who have been worn down by the spread of Covid-19, political infighting and corruption.This week's attacks may be more illustrative of those accumulated shortfalls than any significant IS comeback, experts have said.Following the US-led invasion in 2003, Iraq's security forces had to be effectively rebuilt from the ground up, relying heavily on training by foreign armies.But with Covid-19 spreading fast through Iraq's bases, coalition troops put a halt to all training operations.Military sources and observers also cited political divisions within local security forces between units trained by the US and those -- like the Hashed -- who have received support from Iraq's powerful neighbour Iran.Navigating those tensions has been a major challenge for Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi, seen as being friendly with the US.Kadhemi has relied heavily on the US-trained Counter-Terrorism Service for a range of missions, from hunting down IS cells to reigning in groups launching rockets at the US embassy in Baghdad.In an effort to bring in more names and faces he trusts, Kadhemi ordered an overhaul of Iraq's security leadership late Thursday, including a new federal police commander and chief of the elite Falcons Unit.But he had to walk back some of those decisions within a day following political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-iraqi-fighters-killed-in-is-attack-report-101611434448936.html

Later, the authorities gathered about 150 more stray cows to shift the bovines in a shelter in Papora village on Friday night.“In the absence of any space for extra cows at the shelter, the officers of district administration broke the lock of the main gate of Government Primary School, Madanpur and shifted the cows in the school. We tried to stop them, but they didn't listen to us,” said Jitendra Lodhi, a villager of Madanpur village.More than 200 cows destroyed the kitchen garden and at least 100 plants of flowers, fruits and medicinal plants in the school premises, which won many awards for the infrastructure and beautification at district and state level said Asharam Kushwaha, a school teacher.“The school was in a very poor condition a few years ago. We have developed the school premises to attract the students and to enhance the knowledge of students about flowers and plants. Even in the lockdown, I used to take care of the garden but the cows destroyed everything,” said the school teacher.However, Tikamgarh district collector Subhash Dwivedi said, “The cows had been shifted to school premises for the safety of both bovine and people. It is true that cows destroyed the plants but now, we will do plantation of at least 100 plants with horticulture department officials in the school premises.”“We have also made an arrangement of six trucks to shift the cows at different shelters of the district,” he added.Madhya Pradesh’s cow cabinet and animal husbandry department minister Prem Singh Patel, said, “I have sought a report from the district. Further action will be taken on the basis of the report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-tikamgarh-district-of-mp-primary-school-converted-into-cow-shelter-101611508475309.html

24-01-2021||India||Nitish Kumar wishes speedy recovery to Lalu, but won't call. Here's why||Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday wished a speedy recovery to his political rival and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was shifted to Delhi by air ambulance on Saturday from Ranchi where he is being treated for multiple ailments.Kumar, however, said he gets to know about Lalu's health from newspapers since he hasn't spoken to him on phone.When asked why there has been no telephonic conversation between the two leaders, the chief minister said, "I used to frequently call up his personal attendants and enquire about his well being when he had similarly fallen ill in 2018. So many things were said about me because of that."In 2017, Kumar had walked out of the coalition he had formed with the RJD and the Congress and formed a new government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Later, the phone calls Kumar made to Lalu during his illness in 2018, triggered speculations that he was feeling uneasy in the BJP-led coalition and seeking a rapprochement with the RJD chief.Lalu had undergone a fistula operation then. But his son and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had dismissed it as "last courtesy call". Kumar had then said the he called up Lalu keeping aside his political differences, but Tejashwi had said the door is closed for his (Nitish's) return.Nothing but a late courtesy call to enquire abt his health as he underwent fistula operation on Sunday.Surprisingly NitishJi got to knw abt his ill health after 4months of hospitalisation.I hope he realises he is last politician to enquire following BJP/NDA Ministers visiting him https://t.co/lw7cNmXhDLOn Sunday, Kumar said, "I want him (Lalu) to recover well soon. You know that when we were in different camps earlier then also I used to enquire about his health. In 2017-18, his family members had said that I do not enquire about his health but I want him to recover soon." He was speaking outside the Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) state headquarters in Patna, where he had gone to pay tributes to former chief minister and OBC stalwart Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary. Both Kumar and Lalu consider Thakur to be their political guru.Recently, the Kumar had admonished Yadav for impudence. Speaking in the state Assembly in November last year, the Bihar chief minister had underscored that he has been too charitable with the 31-year-old, who was also his former deputy, because he was "mere bhai samaan dost ka beta (the son of a friend, dear to me like a brother)".Yadav had made serious allegations against Kumar in connection with a murder case.In the Assembly election held last year, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) comprising Kumar's JD(U) and BJP defeated the RJD-led grand alliance. The NDA, riding on the back of BJP's best ever performance in Bihar, won the election after a close fight, scraping past the majority mark with 124 seats as grand alliance’s 111 seats. The majority mark in the 243-seat Assembly was 122.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-wishes-speedy-recovery-to-lalu-but-won-t-call-here-s-why-101611505414510.html
24-01-2021||India||Eight CAs among 258 arrested since mid-November in GST fraud||Government agencies have arrested 258 people, including eight Chartered Accountants (CAs) in its nationwide drive against Goods and Services Tax (GST) fraud launched in mid-November to nab unscrupulous elements using fake invoices to fraudulently claim input tax credit, two officials familiar with the developments said Sunday.“One CA was arrested on Saturday along with four businessmen in Jaipur for operating 25 fake firms to fraudulently avail and pass on ITC (input tax credit) through bogus invoices without actual supplies of goods and services,” one of the officials working in the Union finance ministry said requesting anonymity.Out of the 258 arrested so far, at least two have been booked under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), a second official, working for the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI), said.The drive by various GST authorities is still on and so far more than 2,500 case have been booked against 8,000 fake GST-registered entities, he said. “Authorities have recovered more than ₹820 crore from these fraudsters,” he added.The chartered accountants’ regulatory body -- Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) have been informed about these arrests and have been asked to take appropriate actions as per their own rules,” the first official said. Arrested CAs are from Jaipur, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Ludhiana. “They were operating multiple non-existent firms and fake entities to dupe the exchequer with fraudulent ITC utilisation in connivance with fraudsters and fly-by-night operators,” he said.Enforcement agencies have used data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to process data exchanged among GST authorities, customs department and income-tax offices and pin-pointedly identify unscrupulous elements, he said.“It is through such systemic changes, the department has now been able to take targeted actions against fraudsters and tax evaders. It is with these measures that the DGGI has not only been able to unearth the fake firms but also the final beneficiaries of ITC frauds,” he said.“Action has been initiated against big companies such as a popular online food ordering and delivery platform and a subsidiary of an e-commerce giant,” he said.The concerted nationwide drive against bogus GST invoice fraud has ensured better GST compliance to identify tax evaders and those availing input tax credits fraudulently, and thus, has resulted in record GST collection to the tune of more than ₹1.15 lakh crore for the month of December, 2020, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-cas-among-258-arrested-since-mid-november-in-gst-fraud-101611504836185.html
24-01-2021||India||Congress slams Center over petrol, diesel price hike||Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Central government over the rise of petrol and diesel price, the Congress party on Sunday alleged that excise duty on diesel has been hiked by 820 per cent and 258 per cent on petrol in the last six years.The party has demanded an explanation of how exactly has the government spent ₹20 lakh crore that it "collected by multiple hikes in excise duty on both petrol and diesel" in last six years.Excise duty is a form of tax imposed on goods for their production, licensing and sale.While addressing a press conference here, Congress General Secretary Ajay Maken said, "Today, in Delhi, the petrol prices have reached an all-time high of ₹85.70 a litre. Diesel has reached ₹75.88 litre and what is more shocking is the fact that during the Congress' regime, when UPA left power in May 2014, the international crude oil prices were 108 dollars per barrel. It has come down to all most half, which is 55.52 dollar per barrel and despite the crude oil prices have fallen to almost half, the petrol and diesel prices have surprisingly gone up.""The sole reason for an increase in petrol and diesel prices is that the central government has increased the excise duty on diesel by 8 times and on petrol by 2-1/2 times. The additional excise burden to the common man, to the consumer, is ₹23.78 per litre on petrol and ₹28.37 per litre on diesel, which is 820 per cent to be precise on diesel and 258 per cent to be precise on petrol. This is the increase in excise duty on diesel and petrol because of which the burden has fallen on the common consumer," he said.Maken alleged that the central government has earned more than ₹20 lakh crore from this "additional" excise tax and if the "Central government reduces the additional excise, withdraws the additional excise, which it has changed in the last six years, the petrol prices will fall down to ₹61.92 and diesel price will fall down to ₹47.51.""The Central Government has collected through petrol and diesel excise more than 20 lakh crore rupees in the last 6 years. So, where this huge amount has gone? Our Jawans, our government employees, their DA is being cut. Our small entrepreneurs, our MSMEs, they are continuously under pressure from the bank to repay the loans and they are continuously under the pressure of the taxation authorities. There is huge unemployment across the country. The farmers are committing suicide, so where has this amount of more than ₹20 lakh crore has gone?" he asked."First of all, it should reduce the increase in excise on petrol and diesel, secondly, the Congress Party wants to know where the ₹20 lakh crore, which the central government has collected from the excise duty hike of diesel and petrol, where that money has gone?" he asked.Commenting upon the price in LPG, he said, "As far as the LPG is concerned, I would like to remind you that during our time we used to give 12 cylinders as subsidized for LPG that almost stands withdrawn. At the moment, the LPG in the open market is around ₹700 per cylinder, whereas LPG in the open market without subsidy during our time again as I have said 12 cylinders per year, the subsidized rate were much lower, the subsidized LPG cylinder has gone up from ₹414 per cylinder to ₹700."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-slams-center-over-petrol-diesel-price-hike-101611503856104.html

Along with her two other sisters, one of whom is pursuing her B Tech, Behera has been hard at work making a road in her village."Though I completed my diploma in civil engineering from a private engineering college in Khurda district in 2019, I had pending dues of ₹44,000. My father could raise around ₹20,000 but I could not manage the rest. After sitting idle for over a year and a half, I decided to work as a NREGS labourer for at least 3 months so that I can earn something," said Behera.In Odisha, NREGS workers get ₹207 for a day's work. However, Behera said she and her sister have not been paid any wage since they started working.Behera refused to identify the private engineering college worried that it may hamper her chances of getting her certificate as well as college leaving certificate for further studies. Officials of the Directorate of Technical Education and Training said she could have met the officials of the State Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training for the certificate. "However, there may be some other pending dues which she has to clear before she gets her certificate," said an official.Behara said she wants to clear her dues first. "My father is a landless, poor farmer. The house tin which we are staying is on the land of another person. For me getting admission to a B Tech course is priority. I am willing to slog as a labourer for next few months to get my certificate," she said.The young girl said that after being turned away by the chairman of the private college, she did not meet any local officials for help.Delang block development officer Khirod Pradhan said he would enquire into the issue on Monday and would help her in whatever way possible.In October last year, a civil engineering graduate of Odisha who had lost his job in a road construction company in Chennai during lockdown had to work as a labourer in NREGS till the district collector intervened to save him. Anant Beria, who did his civil engineering Tech graduate of Bolangir district in Odisha had lost his ₹15,000 a month job in Chennai during lockdown. With his savings wiped out, Beria was forced to come back to his home in Jurlakani village in Deogaon block of Bolangir district and work in NREGS till Bolangir district collector Chanchal Rana saw him and gave him a job as data entry operator in NREGA cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-dalit-girl-works-as-labourer-to-clear-pending-dues-of-engineering-college-101611502772988.html

During a recent visit to Pakistan, top Taliban negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar said all decisions regarding the peace process are made after consulting the leadership based in Pakistan.Qureshi, in an interview with Al Jazeera last week, had called on new US President Joe Biden to follow up on the Afghan peace process and US troop withdrawal. “I think they should realise there is an opportunity in Afghanistan and they should persevere with what was initiated and not reverse things,” he said.He contended Pakistan had “done a lot” to create an environment to facilitate the peace process, and blamed “spoilers” – internal Afghan players and “elements from outside” – for the violence.The new US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, told his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib during a phone call on Saturday that the Biden administration intends to review the US-Taliban agreement that was finalised in February 2020. The aim of the review is to assess whether the Taliban is living up to its “commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders”.Over the past few weeks, Afghan government officials, civil society activists and journalists have been targeted in bombings and attacks in Kabul and other cities across Afghanistan. On January 14, India had called for an immediate stop to the targeted attacks and sought a comprehensive ceasefire to take forward efforts to usher in peace.Among the terror groups active in Afghanistan and having links with the Taliban are al-Qaeda and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). According to a UN report, there are some 6,500 Pakistani fighters active in Afghanistan.The Afghan foreign ministry said regional and international consensus is needed to achieve lasting peace in Afghanistan. “We appreciate the efforts of all parties who sincerely support the Afghan peace process. We expect the parties involved in the peace process to fulfil their commitments towards achieving peace,” it said.The Afghan government has taken the “most important steps” to build trust and pave the way for a comprehensive political agreement by releasing more than 6,000 Taliban prisoners, declaring its readiness for an immediate and nationwide ceasefire, and participating in peace talks, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/force-taliban-to-reduce-violence-and-agree-to-truce-afghanistan-tells-pakistan-101611500417250.html
24-01-2021||India||Two women die in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana days after taking Covid-19 vaccines||A woman in Andhra Pradesh and another in Telangana died on Sunday, days after both of them had taken the Covid-19 vaccination a few days ago, officials said.A 42-year-old woman, working as an accredited social health activist (Asha) worker in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district, died of brain stem stroke on Sunday four days after she received Covid-19 vaccination, officials said.Authorities at Guntur General Hospital (GGH) said Bokka Vijaya Lakshmi of Penumaka village, who was admitted to hospital with symptoms of severe headache, giddiness, seizures and vomiting on Friday evening, succumbed in the early hours of Sunday.According to Guntur district immunisation officer Dr Chukka Ratna Manmohan, Vijayalakshmi took the vaccine along with 10 others on January 20. “She was absolutely fine on the day of vaccination and even the next day. According to her family members, she developed mild symptoms on the midnight of January 21, when her condition turned serious the following day, she was brought to Guntur General Hospital,” he said.GGH Guntur Superintendent Dr G Prabhavati said the hospital authorities had carried out all radiographic and laboratory investigations immediately after she was brought to the hospital. “She suffered a brain stroke and was treated in the stroke unit of the neurology department," she said.Dr Manmohan said investigations revealed that Vijayalakshmi had developed a blood clot in the brain that led to the brain stem stroke. “We do not know exactly whether she already had the blood clot in her brain before vaccination or whether it was induced by vaccination. We are hoping to find some reason after conducting the autopsy,” he said.The immunisation officer, however, said Vijayalakshmi was absolutely healthy and had no history of any comorbidities at all. “She was one of the very active Asha workers in the district, having attended thousands of Covid-19 patients at Tadepalli primary health centre. We are surprised how she got the brain stroke,” he said.He said there was no way it could be established that it was vaccine-induced death. “First of all, Covid-19 itself is one-year old in the country. And the vaccination for Covid-19 is still in its nascent stage. We have not come across any such incidents of brain stroke due to vaccination in any part of the country so far. It is a rare case witnessed, maybe one in one lakh people who get vaccinated,” Dr Manmohan said.District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) Dr Jonnalagadda Yasmin, in a statement, said out of 11 people including a medical officer who got vaccinated at Tadepalli PHC on January 20, only Vijayalakshmi and another auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) Gottimukkala Lakshmi (38) showed symptoms of giddiness and seizures in the next two days.“They were shifted to GGH by the AEFI (After Effects Following Immunisation) committee. While Vijayalakshmi’s condition turned critical due to brain stroke, the other woman is stable and recovering,” she said.Vijayalakshmi’s husband Sambasiva Rao, a village revenue assistant (VRA) at Penumaka, told reporters that she had no other health complications and had fallen victim to the Coronavirus vaccine. “She developed symptoms only after receiving the vaccination,” he said.Rao, along with other family members, hundreds of activists of CPI (M), staged dharna at the Guntur Government Hospital, demanding that the government pay compensation of ₹50 lakh to the family of Vijayalakshmi, besides a government job to one of her two sons and a house site.Guntur district collector I Samuel Anand Kumar, who came to the hospital and consoled the family members of the victim. “He assured us to take up our issue with the government and ensure justice for the family,” Rao said.Also on Sunday, a 45-year-old Anganwadi worker in Telangana’s Warangal (urban) district, five days after she got the vaccination shot for Covid-19.The deceased was identified as Vanitha, a widow, who has been living along with her 13-year-old daughter in Shayampet town.State health director G Srinivasa Rao said the woman was vaccinated at about noon on January 19 at Urban primary health centre, New Shayampet and she expired in the early hours of Sunday.“The district AEFI committee is examining the matter and will submit its report to the state AEFI committee. The state AEFI committee will in turn furnish its report to the central AEFI committee for taking a view,” Rao said.According to Naveen, a local resident, quoting her relatives said she had no other health complications but had been complaining about burning sensation in the chest since the next day of taking the vaccine.“She brought it to the notice of the higher authorities about her problem, but they told her that it was quite common in the people who take vaccines. She suffered cardiac arrest this morning,” Naveen said, adding that her relatives alleged that she died of reaction due to vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-women-die-in-andhra-pradesh-telangana-days-after-taking-covid-19-vaccines-101611499294905.html

The parade would commence after the Republic Day parade, but there is no clarity regarding when it would conclude. The police has also estimated that about 15,000 tractors were present at the three border points, Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, and more would trickle in later.The police has suggested three short routes for the farmers with respect to the border points. Those at Singhu border have been asked to follow the Kanjhwala-Bawana route, while the protesters at Ghazipur border must take the Apsara border-Duhai route. The protesters at Tikri have been asked to take the Nangaloi-Najafgarh-Badli route.The tractor parade will feature a number of tableaux from across states depicting village life, the protest against the farm laws, and hailing the courage of the farmers as per organisers. Arrangements for 'langar' have been made along the national highway for the journey to the national capital's borders, as per farm leaders.Each protest site has had a war room set up to ensure smooth and effective coordination during the parade. There will be 40 members, including doctors, security personnel and social media managers, in each of these rooms.Thousands of farmers have been protesting the Centre's three contentious farm laws, that were passed in September, around the national capital for several weeks, braving the bitter cold.The agitators demand a complete rollback of the laws and have refused to accept anything less, while the Centre has remained adamant that it would not withdraw the laws.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-mlas-will-move-towards-delhi-on-tractors-to-support-farmers-punjab-aap-101611495289746.html

While India took only six days to roll out one million vaccine doses, the United States took 10 days to reach the mark and the United Kingdom took 18 days to achieve the one million-mark, the ministry said. Both the countries began vaccination drives before India, but India managed to cover a huge number of population at a shorter span.The drive in India began on January 16 and till January 24, India inoculated 15,82,201 people. All of them are healthcare workers as in the first phase, the country is providing vaccines to only healthcare workers.Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishield after concerns over Chinese vaccineAmong the states, Karnataka has vaccinated the highest number of people. The number of beneficiaries in Karnataka stands at 1,88,971. Next is Odisha with 1,52,371 beneficiaries. State which have vaccinated over 1 lakh people are Andhra Pradesh (1,47,030), Telangana (1,10,031), Uttar Pradesh (1,23,761. Maharashtra has vaccinated 99,885 people so far.The vaccination process has been running smooth, health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said, though there were reports of minor glitches in the Co-WIN app delaying the process at the initial stage. New features have been added to the app so that if a beneficiary does not turn up for vaccination, the slot can be allocated to another one etc.A survey conducted in 28 countries by Edelman PR's Trust Barometer 2021 has revealed that India's are most willing to get vaccinated while both the UK and the US reported some kind of vaccine hesitancy. The survey said 80% Indians were willing to get vaccinated as against 66% in the UK and 59% in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-us-uk-here-s-what-india-s-covid-19-vaccination-rate-tells-101611497720866.html
24-01-2021||India||Kerala asks CBI to probe sexual harassment case in solar scam, Cong cries foul||The Marxist government in Kerala on Sunday decided to hand over a sexual harassment case in the solar scam which virtually led to the fall of Oommen Chandy regime five years ago, to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), ahead of the assembly elections in the state and after Chandy was named chief of the Congress election management committee.The opposition Congress decried the move and said it was a politically-motivated decision eying the assembly elections. It and the party will deal with it legally and politically.“At least three senior police officers investigated the case and found there was no evidence to prove her claims. Almost five years the government sat over the case and explored many ways to make it alive. Neck-deep in corruption, gold smuggling and drug trafficking charges it dusted out an old case as a face-saver,” said senior Congress leader K C Joseph.The government claimed it was justified in handing over the case to the CBI.“It is a natural process. The government ordered the central agency probe after the woman in question approached it,” said state law minister A K Balan justifying the move.Nair had petitioned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last week complaining that she was yet to get justice in sexual assault cases she filed against many Congress leaders and she wanted a central agency probe. The government moved quickly apparently to checkmate the opposition that has been accusing it of collusion in the gold smuggling case.The solar scam involves Saritha Nair and her second husband Biju Radhakrishnan, who was later convicted in a murder case. In 2013, the couple floated a fictitious company called ‘Team Solar’ and cheated many people by promising them stakes in the firm and high returns after selling imported solar panels. They allegedly cultivated influential sources in corridors of power and flaunted them to attract gullible investors.The cheating case came to light in 2014 and 60 cases were registered against the two accused. Oomen Chandy who was then the chief minister, had sacked two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names allegedly cropped up in the case. Later the main accused Nair had raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders including Chandy, K C Venugopal, Adoor Prakash MP, A P Anil Kumar, Hibi Eden MP and others. The government had also constituted a judicial commission.Nair was sentenced in at last six cases and is currently out on bail. In the 2019 parliamentary election, she had filed her nomination against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad but her papers were rejected on grounds of her conviction. Last year the Supreme Court had dismissed her plea questioning Gandhi’s election and imposed a fine of ₹10,000 on her.The Marxist government had earlier sought legal opinion in the sexual harassment case and was reportedly advised that “her allegations were weak and would not stand legal scrutiny.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-asks-cbi-to-probe-sexual-harassment-case-in-solar-scam-cong-cries-foul-101611497296711.html

They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15000-tractors-170-km-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-farmers-tractor-rally-101611493581603.html

24-01-2021||India||308 Twitter handles from Pakistan creating confusion over tractor march: Police||The Delhi Police on Sunday said 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding a threat to create disturbance in the tractor rally. 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to create confusion," Dependra Pathak, Special CP, Intelligence, Delhi Police said.Giving details of these Twitter handles, the special commissioner said all these handles have been generated in Pakistan between January 13 and January 18.The proposed Republic Day tractor march which got formal permission on Sunday from Delhi Police has been the eye of controversy for the past few days as Centre had already reported 'Khalistani infiltration' in the protests and moved the Supreme Court, which in turn asked Delhi Police to take the final call on allowing the tractor march. Initially, the Delhi Police didn't allow farmers to enter the Capital. Instead, it offered an alternative route at the Kundli border. But after several rounds of discussions held between farmers' representatives and Delhi Police officials, it has now been agreed that farmers will be allowed to enter the Capital under certain terms and conditions.Formal permission received from police for Jan 26 tractor rally: Yogendra YadavNow it has been decided that the tractor rally will enter Delhi from Tiri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders. From Singhu, the march will pass through Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi border, KMP Expressway and then return to Singhu, police said.The protesting farmers have been planning this tractor march for a long time and several tractors from Punjab have joined the protest sites in the past few days for their Republic Day parade where they plan to showcase tractors from different states as it happens in Republic Day parade. Farmers' union leaders have promised that the march will be peaceful and the Delhi Police have also placed trust on them that the tractors will go back to the protest sites after their march, without proceeding further into the Capital.While several Union ministers in past claimed that farmers are being instigated from outside, early this month, the Centre told the Supreme Court that it was informed about Khalistani infiltration in the protests. It also mentioned the name of the banned organisation 'Sikhs for Justice' as being part of this ongoing protest.This is the first time, Delhi Police officially talked about outside links, specifically, Twitter handles having roots in Pakistan attempting to create disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/308-twitter-handles-from-pakistan-creating-confusion-over-tractor-march-police-101611492703767.html
24-01-2021||India||Hardeep Puri Interview: On Central Vista, Adani airports row, vaccine exports||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri is clearly a man of the moment: perhaps, among Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s chosen few, given that he is handling crucial portfolios namely Urban Housing and Civil Aviation.As Housing Minister, he is in the eye of a storm thanks to the controversial Central Vista project; in Civil Aviation, he is firefighting because the sector is badly hit, thanks to the pandemic. Outspoken and forthright that he is, Puri makes it clear that doling out cash is not the Government’s model. As for the Central Vista, he defends it as vociferously as the critics decry it.In HT’s series The Interview, Puri talks at length on several issues: controversial and informative. If he defends industrialist Gautam Adani bagging the contract for six airports, he also talks about expanding the aviation sector, and the phased roll-out of transporting the vaccine.More importantly, he clears the misconception that the old Parliament building will be functional along with the new: “Only the usage will change and it will not be converted into a museum”, Puri asserts.For the uninitiated, the Central Vista project which includes a new Parliament complex there are misgivings about the iconic Parliament building being converted into a museum, once the new complex comes up.On taking safety precautions against the new Covid strain with the UK virus variant, Puri said that suspending flights between UK and India is not the answer: “However flights were reduced to fifty percent : from sixty plus, flights a week we were down to 30. But look at the other side: if we close flights from the UK are you suggesting that we close flights from everywhere else? Flights from Dubai are operational as are flights from European countries. The easiest thing to do is to listen to people who are saying you should not do this and clamp down. By doing that we would be causing more damage than the virus itself. So, I am clear that it was a sensible decision as was the decision by the Prime Minister to lock down in March and then opening up in a calibrated manner. Decisions relating to life and livelihood are equally important and if you don’t open up economic activity you would have inflicted a hard blow”.The hope, Puri said, is in the vaccine: “We should celebrate the fact that we have been able to manage the difficult part of the challenge and now we are looking towards recovery. With the kind of stocks of vaccine we have from the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, we would soon have more than we need. Today we are among the five countries in the world which is vaccinating people with indigenously produced vaccine. India under Prime Minister Modi is resonating with self-reliance”.On the road map for the aviation sector, Puri said: “We have already opened up 80 percent and most of the airlines are operating; we have rationalized air space. We are going to look at cargo in a big way. Two airports, Bengaluru and Chennai, have shown positive growth in air cargo. I am keen that Indian carriers regain the GDP when it comes to international aviation.“Going forward let me tell you that airlines expansion will take place; the number of aircrafts in the sky will further increase; Delhi Indira Gandhi International airport will get the fourth runway; with Jewar airport coming up in 2023, we will ensure that the traffic Delhi and Jewar airports will carry, will exceed the combined traffic of London, Heathrow, Gatwic and Stanstead. With Mumbai and Navi Mumbai airports coming up, we can look at an increase in traffic there too.“We are opening a hundred new airports in the coming years. That apart we will step on the gas on aircraft leasing; engine manufacturers are being brought here obviating the need to take aircrafts from here to Singapore and other places for servicing. With all this civil aviation will provide a big boost to the economy ”.Simply put, Puri said that the target is to reach pre-Covid levels before March end this year; take it to 40 percent beyond pre Covid levels by next year: “I predict that there will be robust growth by April 2022”, he claimed.On the much-awaited roll-out of the vaccination, Puri said: “Vaccine Maitri is for the foreign countries; the first phase of vaccination transportation was from January 12 when eleven million doses from Serum Institute and 2.40 lakh doses from Bharat Biotech were distributed to all states and Union Territories; Phase two was from January 19 which also is over. Now so far as the next phases are concerned, we will make an assessment in a day or so when to roll out. The first phase was tough but now the infrastructure is in place and people know how to go about it”. However, he said that the next roll out should be “within two days” adding that the states have a surplus.On a lighter note, one took Puri down memory lane: back to school in Germany when he was bullied because as a Sikh he kept long hair. Had it not been for his teacher, he probably would never have stood up to bullies: “Don’t get bullied; bully them instead” she had then told him.Politics was not Puri’s calling: it was the Foreign Service. He says as a diplomat “he lived dangerously” including flying in LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran from Jaffna: “When we were flying him from Jaffna to New Delhi, he was nervous and told me that someday his deeds will catch up with him”. Ominous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hardeep-puri-interview-on-central-vista-adani-airports-row-vaccine-exports-101611492457928.html

But, till the BJP's Hanumans are there, we will move ahead with Ram's ideals," Sarma said.The Congress has formed the Grand Alliance with AIUDF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML) and the Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) to fight the upcoming assembly elections, likely to be held in March-April.A new regional political party, the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), was formed jointly by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad (AJYCP).Jailed anti-CAA leader Akhil Gogoi's Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and 70 other groups have formed another party -- Raijor Dal.Training guns at the AIUDF chief, the Assam health and family welfare minister said, "Ajmal told Muslims won't be able to go to mosques if BJP wins. I want to ask today whether Hindus can visit temples if Congress and AIUDF form the government in the state."He asserted that till the "BJP is alive", Ajmal will not be able to enter within 100 km of Dispur, the locality of the Assam secretariat.Sarma also alleged that followers of Ajmal attacked 'Satras', the Vaishnavite places of worship, at Batadrava and other areas.Attacking the AASU, which has been protesting against the visit of the prime minister and home minister, Sarma said, "Today you are taking out a torchlight procession against Amit Shah.

24-01-2021||India||Congress and AIUDF will open doors for illegal immigrants in Assam: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday lashed out at the newly formed alliance of Congress and All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam saying it would aid the entry of illegal immigrants into the state.“Can Congress and AIUDF keep Assam free from illegal immigrants? They will open doors to infiltrators as it suits their vote bank politics. Can Assam be safe in their hands? For Assam to be secure, we need BJP governments in Centre and Assam” said Shah.The home minister accused Congress of using a policy of ‘divide and rule’ among various groups in Assam in the past decades which led to violence and killings in the state.The Congress, which has 20 seats in the 126-member state assembly, had recently sealed a pre-poll alliance with AIUDF, which has 14 seats. The newly formed Anchalik Gana Morch and three Left parties - CPI, CPI-M and CPI-ML-are also part of the alliance.In his speech, Shah also targeted the newly formed regional parties in the state (which were the outcome of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in December 2019) and accused them of indirectly aiding the Congress.“Congress was responsible for firing on the state’s youths (during the anti-foreigner agitation in 1979-85) and now those agitating forces have taken a different shape to help Congress by hoping to divide BJP’s votes,” Shah said.“People in Assam should know that these parties which have changed their clothes and are trying to aid Congress are not concerned about the state’s well-being. People of Assam want peace and development and only BJP can provide that,” he added.Shah appealed to the voters to help the BJP to retain power in the state so that Assam can be free of violence, agitations and there is control on the devastating floods that wreak havoc each year. He made no mention of the Citizenship Amendment Act which seeks to fast track Indian citizenship of non-Muslim refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and which has sparked another round of protests in Assam.Earlier in the day, Shah addressed a rally in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR), to mark one year of signing of the third Bodo peace accord.“Peace has returned to Bodo areas due to the accord. There used to be killings and abductions here but I can assure that in a few years this region will become the most developed part of Assam,” he said.“Several steps have already been taken to implement clauses of the accord. I have come to reiterate the commitments made last year and assure that the Centre and state governments would fulfill all the promises made in the accord,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-and-aiudf-will-open-doors-for-illegal-immigrants-in-assam-amit-shah-101611490357959.html

This year is also the 400th Prakash Parv of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji. In the same year we are also making 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose," PM Modi said.Urging people to make the nation stronger, PM Modi said, "We did not get an opportunity to sacrifice our everything for the independence of the country.

Those at Singhu border have been asked to follow the Kanjhwala-Bawana route, while the protesters at Ghazipur border must take the Apsara border-Duhai route, according to Livehindustan. The protesters at Tikri have been asked to take the Nangaloi-Najafgarh-Badli route, it further reported.Christened 'Kisan Ganatantra Parade', the tractor rally will mark the two months of farmers' protest against the three central farm laws passed in September last year.The farmers have promised that their rally will remain peaceful. They plan to deploy 2,500 volunteers to facilitate the movement of the vehicles on that day.The farmers are protesting against three laws passed by Parliament in September last year - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protest has been going on since November 26; the farmers say these laws will benefit big corporate houses and put them at their mercy. The government has, however, rejected these allegations and have said that they are ready to discuss amendments to the laws and even said that they will be put on hold for 18 months.The protesters, however, are adamant that these laws should be repealed. At the 11th round of talks on Friday, the Centre has asked farmers to reconsider the 18-month option. The Supreme Court has already stayed the implementation of these laws and formed a committee to resolve the deadlock between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-permission-received-from-police-for-jan-26-tractor-rally-yogendra-yadav-101611490665672.html

No demon can love Lord Ram. Mamata Banerjee is a dishonest and evil (shaitan) person. Her hatred for Lord Ram is natural," he told reporters.Singh added that the violence and murder unleashed allegedly by members of Banerjee's party TMC in West Bengal provide proof of their "evil" act.Banerjee had on Saturday declined to speak at an official programme at the lawn of Victoria Memorial Hall to celebrate Bose's birth anniversary after "Jai Shri Ram" slogans were raised by a section of the audience in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The party also attached an RTI document which proves that the Punjab CM was one of the 10 members of a high-powered committee of chief ministers for 'Transformation of Indian Agriculture'.The order for setting up of the committee, as seen in the RTI document, was passed in August 2019. Then Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Kamal Nath, former CM of Madhya Pradesh, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh were part of the committee, apart from agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand.Protesting farmers assure 'Kisan Gantantra Parade' will be peaceful"When you had the document in 2019, why didn't you tell the farmers that the Modi government was set to bring such anti-farmer laws," AAP leader Raghav Chadha said.RTI Exposes @capt_amarinder's lies.Punjab CM was a member of the committee that approved the 3 Anti-Farmer Farm bills.#DhokhebaazCaptain pic.twitter.com/Ne6r3U1P6bSince the beginning of farmers' 'Dilli Chalo' protest, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh locked horns over farmers' issues.

The RTI documents have now been added to AAP's attack.Singh had earlier answered to the accusation without denying that he was part of the committee but he had said that these farm laws were not discussed at any of the meetings of that committee.These farm laws were NOT discussed at any meeting & your repeated lies will not change that Mr @ArvindKejriwal.

There used to be killings and abductions here, but I can assure that in a few years, this region will become the most developed part of Assam,” he said, while addressing a rally in Kokrajhar, the BTR headquarters, to mark one year of the signing of the accord.“Several steps have already been taken to implement clauses of the accord. I have come to reiterate the commitments made last year and assure that the Centre and state governments would fulfil all the promises made in the accord,” he added.Shah mentioned how the Bodo accord was crucial in ensuring a peaceful election to the Bodo Territorial Council (BTC) held last month. He lambasted the opposition Congress for failing to fulfil promises and implement accords.The event was attended by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, BJP in-charge for Assam, Baijayant Jay Panda, and several other dignitaries.After the event in Kokrajhar, Shah will address an election rally in Nalbari before departing to New Delhi.The Bodo Accord, the third peace deal with Bodo rebel groups, was signed in New Delhi on January 27 last year by the Centre with all four factions of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), the All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) and United Bodo Peoples’ Organisation (UBPO).It was expected to end decades old violent demand for a separate Bodoland state and bring peace to areas dominated by Bodos, the largest tribe in Assam. Soon after signing of the accord, 1,615 cadres of NDFB laid down arms and in March, the outfit disbanded itself.The deal renamed Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD), which included four districts, as Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). Redrawing of BTR boundaries, grant of ₹5000 crore, rehabilitation of NDFB rebels and naming Bodo as associate official language of the state were also part of the deal.Also Read: Only Modi-led BJP can rid Assam of terrorism and intruders: Amit ShahSoon after signing of the accord, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a meeting in Kokrajhar in February last year and stated that the deal has put a full-stop to all Bodo demands and ushered lasting peace.In the past year, the BJP-led ruling coalition in Assam has set up a commission to redraw BTR boundaries as per the accord, named Bodo as associate official language and gave ₹4 lakh each to 1,279 surrendered cadres of NDFB.Last month, BJP emerged as the second largest party in the BTC polls and become a part of the executive council headed by United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL), its new partner in BTR, after parting ways with Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF), which headed the council for 17 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodo-accord-has-brought-peace-to-btr-says-amit-shah-in-kokrajhar-assam-101611482460591.html

24-01-2021||India||Ageing dams in India, US, other nations pose growing threat: UN report||Over a thousand large dams in India will be roughly 50 years old in 2025 and such aging structures across the world pose a growing threat, according to a UN report which notes that by 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of dams built in the 20th century.The report, titled 'Ageing water infrastructure: An emerging global risk' and compiled by United Nations University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, says most of the 58,700 large dams worldwide were constructed between 1930 and 1970 with a design life of 50 to 100 years.It said at 50 years, a large concrete dam "would most probably begin to express signs of ageing."Ageing signs include increasing cases of dam failures, progressively increasing costs of dam repair and maintenance, increasing reservoir sedimentation, and loss of a dam's functionality and effectiveness, "strongly interconnected" manifestations, the report said."By 2050, most people on Earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of large dams built in the 20th century, many of them already operating at or beyond their design life," according to the UN University analysis.The analysis includes dam decommissioning or ageing case studies from the USA, France, Canada, India, Japan, and Zambia and Zimbabwe.According to the report, the world is unlikely to witness another large dam-building revolution as in the mid-20th century, but dams constructed then will inevitably be showing their age.The report said that 32,716 large dams (55% of the world's total) are found in just four Asian countries: China, India, Japan, and South Korea - a majority of which will reach the 50-year threshold relatively soon.The same is true of many large dams in Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe, it said.In India, there are over 1,115 large dams that will be roughly 50 years old in 2025, more than 4,250 large dams in the country will be over 50 years old in 2050 and 64 large dams will be more than 150 years old in 2050, it said.The report said that approximately 3.5 million people are at risk if India's Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, built over 100 years ago, "were to fail"."The dam, in a seismically active area, shows significant structural flaws and its management is a contentious issue between Kerala and Tamil Nadu States,” it said.The report added that dams that are well designed, constructed and maintained can "easily" reach 100 years of service but predicts an increase in "decommissioning" - a phenomenon gaining pace in the USA and Europe - as economic and practical limitations prevent ageing dams from being upgraded or if their original use is now obsolete.In the US, the average age of 90,580 dams is 56 years. More than 85% of US dams in 2020 were operating at or beyond their life expectancy and 75% of US dam failures occurred after 50 years of age. The estimated cost to refurbish US dams is about USD 64 billion. Nearly 1,275 dams were removed in 21 US states in the last 30 years; 80 removed in 2017 alone, it said.Worldwide, the huge volume of water stored behind large dams is estimated at 7,000 to 8,300 cubic kilometres - enough to cover about 80 per cent of Canada's landmass under a meter of water.The report’s co-author Vladimir Smakhtin, Director of UNU-INWEH, said the report aims to attract global attention to the creeping issue of ageing water storage infrastructure and stimulate international efforts to deal with this emerging, rising water risk."Underlined is the fact that the rising frequency and severity of flooding and other extreme environmental events can overwhelm a dam's design limits and accelerate a dam's ageing process. Decisions about decommissioning, therefore, need to be taken in the context of a changing climate," Smakhtin said.Lead author and UNU-INWEH Senior Researcher Duminda Perera said the problem of ageing large dams today confronts a relatively small number of countries - 93% of all the world's large dams are located in just 25 nations."Large dam construction surged in the mid-20th century and peaked in the 1960s - 70s especially in Asia, Europe and North America, while in Africa the peak occurred in the 1980s. The number of newly-constructed large dams after that continuously and progressively declined,” he siad.The pace of large dam construction has dropped dramatically in the last four decades and continues to decline in part because "the best locations for such dams globally have been progressively diminishing as nearly 50% of global river volume is already fragmented or regulated by dams," the report says.There are also strong concerns regarding the environmental and social impacts of dams, and large dams in particular, as well as emerging ideas and practices on the alternative types of water storage, nature-based solutions, and types of energy production beyond hydropower, it said.Public safety, escalating maintenance costs, reservoir sedimentation, and restoration of a natural river ecosystem are among the reasons driving dam decommissioning, the report said, adding that overall, dam decommissioning should be seen as equally important as dam building in the overall planning process on water storage infrastructure developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ageing-dams-in-india-us-other-nations-pose-growing-threat-un-report-101611480903512.html

With the help of the district administration, the factory has signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED), National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), paramilitary forces along with brands from Bangalore and Hyderabad.These organisations will place orders for tailoring services and also purchase readymade DANNEX products, officials said.“The project aims to make Dantewada a garment hub in the region. Initially, four new garment factories will be established which will provide employment opportunities to 1000 households. This will be done on a cluster approach. Clusters have been identified based on the availability of skilled and unskilled human resources in the district. The next step is the installation of machines—up to 100 per unit-- at the nearest available infrastructure. Nawa Dantewada Garment factory (NDGF) is the first such cluster established in the Geedam block,” said Dantewada collector Deepak Soni, while talking to HT.The tribal women working in the factory are happy with the earnings from the factory and hope that their brand becomes the cultural identity of the region.“The women are engaged in tailoring while some men are working in marketing of the products,” said Shushila Netam.Also Read: Chhattisgarh: BJP demands judicial probe into shelter home sexual abuse caseThe NDGF has not been officially inaugurated till now but the women and men from nearby gram panchayats have started working.

The expenditure on the development of the entire 70 acre land there will exceed ₹1100 crore," said Swami Govind Dev Giri Maharaj, treasurer of Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Nyas.He said he arrived at these figures after consulting experts involved in the Ram temple construction project.The Nyas (trust) has not come out with an official statement so far on the expenditure involved in the project, he said while talking to ABP Majha Marathi TV channel."It was possible for us to raise funds (for the temple construction) from some corporate people. Some (corporate) families had approached us, requesting us to hand over the (temple) designs and assuring us they will complete the temple project, but I humbly declined that request," he said.To a query on criticism from some quarters that the Ram temple funds collection drive is a BJP campaign keeping in view the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, he said, "People see this depending on the colour of spectacles they wear. We don't wear any spectacles and our eyes are pointing at the path of devotion.""Our target is to reach 6.5 lakh villages and 15 crore homes (for collecting funds for the temple work)," he said.Asked if he is willing to go to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's residence Matoshree in suburban Mumbai to collect funds for the Ram temple construction, he said, "I am willing to go there if he is ready to contribute.""Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Legislative Council Deputy Chairperson Neelam Gorhe has given us a one kg silver brick," he said.The Swami was at the Rashtrapati Bhavan last week when President Ram Nath Kovind contributed ₹500,100 for the Ram temple construction at Ayodhya.Asked if he would visit the residence of Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to seek contribution for the temple, he quipped, "I am ready to do that if someone were to guarantee that I wont's be disrespected there."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-in-3-years-to-cost-rs-1100-cr-says-trust-treasurer-101611474406529.html

24-01-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: BJP demands judicial probe into shelter home sexual abuse case||The BJP on Sunday demanded a judicial inquiry into allegations of physical and sexual abuse of women inmates of a shelter home in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district.The manager of the shelter home, run by an NGO and aided by government, was arrested on January 21 for allegedly raping an inmate, while three other staffers were held on Saturday on charges of physically assaulting women living at the facility."An impartial investigation into the allegations is possible only when a judicial panel will be set up to conduct a probe into it as the role of police is already in question in the case," Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Dharamlal Kaushik told PTI.Hitting out at the ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh, the BJP leader said it is a "very shameful situation" that sexual and physical exploitation of women is taking place in a shelter home monitored by the state government."The inmates have made revelations before a magistrate that the women who were staying there were not only subjected to sexual harassment, but were also sent out for prostitution. They were also brutally thrashed and stripped and locked in a room there," Kaushik claimed.He demanded that the state government constitute a judicial commission for a probe into the case.Kaushik said the role of police in the case should also be investigated as the victims have alleged that when they went to a police station for registering complaint of sexual abuse, the police did not take cognisance of it.The case against Ujjawala Home, operated by NGO Shri Shivmangal Shikshan Samiti, came to light on January 17 when some of its staff members allegedly did not allow a 20-year- old woman to leave the facility when her husband came to take her back home.The man then forcibly took his wife and reached Sarkanda police station where they lodged a case of wrongful confinement, voluntarily causing hurt and obscene acts against the shelter home staff.Two other women inmates also went the police station and alleged physical and mental abuse of women at the shelter. They were also made complainants in the case, a police official earlier said.On January 19, the women complainants approached the media, alleging that one of them was sexually assaulted by the shelter home's manager and other inmates were physically tortured by the staff.The complainants recorded their statement before a magistrate on January 21 following which the shelter home's manager was arrested, the police said.Later, another woman also alleged that she and other inmates were physically assaulted by the shelter home staff.The police subsequently apprehended three women staff members on Saturday, a police official said.A government official said the shelter home has been closed and seven of its inmates have been shifted to their homes and other government facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-bjp-demands-judicial-probe-into-shelter-home-sexual-abuse-case-101611472171445.html

24-01-2021||India||Tremendous growth of ‘GDP’: Rahul Gandhi jabs PM Modi over fuel price hike||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the rising fuel prices in the country. “Modi ji has shown tremendous growth in 'GDP' i.e. gas-diesel-petrol prices! The public is plagued by inflation, Modi government is busy in tax collection,” he tweeted in Hindi.Though fuel prices remained unchanged on Sunday, they are at their all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week on Saturday. The record-high fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, have prompted cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers. On Sunday, petrol was priced at ₹85.70 and diesel was selling at ₹75.88 per litre in Delhi. In Mumbai, the petrol rate was ₹92.28 per litre and diesel was ₹82.66. In Kolkata, petrol was priced at ₹87.11 per litre and diesel at ₹79.48 per litre.मोदी जी ने ‘GDP’ यानी गैस-डीज़ल-पेट्रोल के दामों में ज़बरदस्त विकास कर दिखाया है!जनता महँगाई से त्रस्त, मोदी सरकार टैक्स वसूली में मस्त। pic.twitter.com/FsiG8ECajkState-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus. Since then, rates have gone up by ₹1.99 a litre on petrol and ₹2.01 in case of diesel.Though the price of commercial use cylinders was raised, that of non-subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was left unchanged at existing levels on January 1, 2021, following two hikes of a cumulative ₹100 per cylinder in each of the four metros. Commercial customers will now have to pay an additional ₹17 per cylinder. Consumers of the commercial cylinders will pay ₹1349 in Delhi, ₹1410 in Kolkata, ₹1297.50 in Kolkata and ₹1463.50 in Chennai per cylinder.Earlier this week, Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan attributed the rise in prices to lower production in oil-producing nations due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "Our main challenge is, we have to import 80 per cent of crude oil of our requirement. Due to coronavirus, many oil-producing countries stopped production or reduced it. There is a pressure on fuel price due to imbalance in demand and supply," he had said.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. The government had then cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremendous-growth-of-gdp-rahul-gandhi-jabs-pm-modi-over-fuel-price-hike-101611471461183.html

The Indian gift to Dhaka was a fulfilment of the assurance given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the December 17, 2020, virtual summit. Both the countries have been cooperating in the field of Covid-19 vaccine, including Phase III testing, distribution, co-production and delivery in Bangladesh.Also read | Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishiled after concerns over Chinese vaccineThe leadership of Sri Lanka and Nepal also expressed their apprehension about the Chinese vaccine to their Indian interlocutors. The demand of Indian vaccine has come from small countries far and away like Barbados, whose Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley wrote to PM Modi on January 22 for the supply of 200,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with the proviso of purchasing half of the doses. The request has been approved.Also read | Will India send vaccines to Pak if there is a request? MEA respondsAccording to diplomats based in Dhaka and Delhi, around October 2020, the Chinese wanted to sign a contract with the Sheikh Hasina government to supply CoronaVac vaccines. One of the terms of the contract was that Dhaka had to share the cost of the clinical trials. While Dhaka refused to share the cost of the trials, the Chinese company said that Bangladesh could not be an exception to not sharing costs as Sinovac was putting the same conditions for countries in which clinical trials were conducted and as a precursor to jab supplies.Also read | Global Covid-19 infections near 100 million markIt was only then that Dhaka moved swiftly and tied up with SII with the Modi government doing the facilitation for commercial supply of 30 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Three million doses of commercial supplies have already landed in Dhaka.India has already rolled out five million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to seven countries in the neighbourhood, the first being Bhutan on January 20 and the latest being Mauritius on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-dhaka-got-vaccines-from-india-after-china-asked-it-to-share-trial-costs-101611459036601.html

Even in this case, the accused was a relative of the unsuspecting and innocent girl. Other instances of use of malwares to tap the webcam of unsuspecting victims for either taking pictures or stealing information were also found, said police officials.There seems to be no end to the menace of child pornography. Last January, a US-based NGO, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, handed over a list of 25,000 Tipline reports on suspected child pornography material uploaded on social media in India, triggered a heated discussion in the Parliament.Kerala seems to have made considerable progress in tackling the menace, statistics show. Kerala Police Cyberdome—formed to meet the long term security challenges and to combat emerging cyber threats-- launched a special operation named P Hunt, which resulted in cracking 525 cases and arrest of 428 accused in two years, said the police.Experts working in the area say active monitoring and action creates a deterrent effect.“Our cyber monitoring cell patrols the dark net through geo-fencing (a real world geographic area) and we have some of the best software networks to help us with this. It is a strenuous job, once we identify an offender, we procure his IP address with the help of the service provider and his activities are monitored. Once the location is identified we make local inquiries discreetly and collect all digital evidence before booking the person,” says Manoj Abraham, additional director general of police, Cyberdome.Around 100 well-trained officers are working in his team.“We have different tools and software to go after individuals and groups catering to child pornography in social media. Since we are deeply invested in the programme, agencies like the Interpol, US-based International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, India Child Protection Fund, and others help us profusely,” he said, adding the situation worsened during the lockdown. He said some of the arrested were IT professionals and doctors among others. Some of them were repeated offenders and they need treatment, he added.Watching or sharing child pornography images, videos and literature is a crime in India and can invite up to five-year jail and maximum fine of ₹10 lakh.“The scourge is on the rise. Safety of children is everyone’s responsibility. People need to guard against the exploitation of the innocent,” said the decorated officer. In 2019, he received the Champion of Child Protection award.Also Read: No clear definition, computer-aided offence a cybercrime: MHA reportInterpol secretary general Jurgen Stock recently said that the visible part of the problem was just the tip of the iceberg. He added that the issue aggravated during the pandemic.“Many cases go unreported as parents fear stigma and taboo. Internet penetration is quite high these days. This offense can’t be prevented by police alone and parents and family members need extra care,” said a child rights activist.She said in 60% of the cases, offenders are either family acquaintances or relatives and in 50% cases, pornographic materials were filmed or shot without the knowledge of the abused child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharp-rise-in-child-pornography-cases-worry-experts-101611457879318.html

This year's parade will be unique as many things have been curtailed due to the pandemic while it will also witness many firsts, including the participation of country's first woman fighter pilot and a flypast with Rafale jets.Here is the list of key highlights of this year's Republic Day parade:Woman fighter pilotFlight lieutenant Bhawana Kanth will be a part of the Republic Day parade this year to become the first woman fighter pilot to take part in India's biggest ceremonial event on January 26.

A Rafale aircraft will fly with two Jaguars and two MiG-29 fighter jets in one of the formations at the flypast, which will wrap up with the Rafale carrying out another manoeuvre.Soldiers in masksFollowing the new norms of Covid-19, soldiers marching down the Rajpath will also be seen wearing masks along with spectators. The number of officials participating in the parade has also been reduced to 96. Earlier, there was a 12x12 contingent system which had 144 soldiers.Bangladesh Armed ForcesAt least 122 soldiers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces will be taking part in the parade. According to a press statement issued by the high commission of India in Dhaka, this is only the third time since Independence that a foreign military contingent has been invited to participate in the national parade.CRPF tableauIn another first, a tableau of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is also set to wow spectators during the Republic Day parade. "This year we will be having our own tableau and its theme will be combat skills of CRPF in conflict zones," RK Yadav, inspector general (training) has said, according to ANI.Schilika weapon system with woman commanderThe upgraded Schilika weapon system will roll down in Rajpath for the first time this year in the Republic Day parade, led by the only woman contingent commander from the army.Ram Mandir tableauUttar Pradesh's tableau will feature a replica of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, which is currently under construction. It will also display the culture, tradition and art related to the temple town.Things that will be missing this year:No chief guestIn more than five decades, this year's parade will be the first Republic Day parade to be organised without a chief guest. Before this, there were no chief guests during the Republic Day parade in 1952, 1953 and 1966.No motorcycle stuntsOne prominent event that that always draw cheers during the parade - stunts on motorcycles by the army and the personnel of the paramilitary forces – will also be missing this year.No veterans’ paradeThe veterans’ parade by ex-servicemen and women, too, has been knocked off the programme chart due to the pandemic, and so is the parade by recipients of the national bravery awards.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-fighter-pilot-rafale-jets-and-soldiers-in-masks-key-things-to-watch-for-this-year-s-republic-day-parade-101611456767485.html
24-01-2021||India||India, China to hold ninth round of talks to resolve Ladakh border standoff||Indian and Chinese military commanders will meet for the ninth time on Sunday to discuss and defuse tensions in the eastern Ladakh sector along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The corps commander-level talks will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, said officials familiar with the development.Like the previous rounds, the meeting may not yield a positive outcome in the short-term, officials said, adding that, the dialogue, however, has to go on. Experts too are not expecting any major breakthrough through the military talks.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said it is a good thing that talks are going on and communication is being maintained between the two sides. “However, it is unlikely that any breakthrough will take place as there does not seem to be any common ground on the basis of which an agreement can take place. This common ground has to be established in political or diplomatic level engagements. Since this has not happened, we should not expect much from the military talks,” he added.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) had said during the eighth round of talks on November 6 that they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said earlier this month that India was committed to resolving the situation along the contested LAC through talks but no one should test India’s patience. “We are committed to resolving disputes through talks and political efforts. However, no one should make the mistake of testing India’s patience,” he had said.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. The PLA has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged.India has been pushing for a comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks. China, however, wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.On Saturday, in a warning to China, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said, "If they (China) can get aggressive, we will also get aggressive.

The notice has been issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT after reviewing replies of blocked apps, according to a source who did not wish to be identified. When contacted, Tiktok confirmed to have received a reply from the government. "We are evaluating the notice and will respond to it as appropriate. TikTok was among the first companies to comply with the Government of India directive issued on June 29, 2020. We continually strive to comply with local laws and regulations and do our best to address any concerns the government may have. Ensuring the privacy and security of all our users remains to be our topmost priority," a TikTok spokesperson said. The government had blocked 59 Chinese apps in June and 118 more apps, including PUBG mobile game, in September. The Ministry of Information Technology had blocked the apps under section 69A of the Information Technology Act after learning that the apps are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-continue-ban-on-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-101611449871189.html
24-01-2021||India||BSF unearths tunnel used by Pak to send in terrorists to India||The Border Security Force (BSF) on Saturday found a 150-metre-long underground tunnel in Jammu and Kashmir that had been used by Pakistani intelligence to infiltrate terrorists into India. It is the second tunnel to be discovered in 10 days by the force that last year went on a campaign mode to detect and destroy a web of tunnels believed to have been built by Pakistan’s deep state, a senior BSF official said on Saturday.The 39-metre-deep tunnel was detected between Border Post number 14 and 15 near BSF’s outpost at Pansar, Kathua district. On the other side of the fence are Pakistani border outposts of Abhiyal Dogra and Kingre-de-Kothe in Shakargarh district.Shakargarh, the area across the fence, is home to a terror training facility overseen by one of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s operational commanders, Kasim Jan, who, Indian intelligence believes, was involved in the November 19 Nagrota encounter in Jammu and is the principal accused in the 2016 Pathankot airbase attack. Jan is also one of the main launch commanders of the Jaish terrorists into India.“This is huge,” said the senior BSF official cited above, who requested anonymity. Because the tunnel appears to be at least six to eight years old, it would have been used for infiltration for a long time. Also, it is located in a place that has seen action in the past, right from 2012 when Pakistan mounted an assault on the forward duty point and constructed a new bunker on the zero line in the vicinity.Not far from where the tunnel was found, BSF assistant commandant Vinay Prasad, who was leading a border domination patrol, was killed by sniper fire from across the border in January 2019. A group of terrorists was noticed in the same area in November 2019.It is very important to detect all the tunnels built by the Pakistani military and its terrorists because the infiltration of terrorists through them practically nullifies the utility of deployment of soldiers along the Line of Control (LoC). When it becomes too difficult to cross the LoC, Pakistani terrorists use these tunnels, a senior counterterror official said in Delhi.Border Security Force director general Rakesh Asthana had ordered the force to step up efforts to detect tunnels after the Nagrota encounter in November when security forces were able to trace the route taken by the terrorists who had crossed over using one of the many tunnels the Pakistani military built for the terrorists to sneak into India.Security officials underscore that proper engineering efforts had gone into the construction of the tunnels that have been detected in recent times, pointing to the involvement of the Pakistani military along the heavily guarded border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-unearths-tunnel-used-by-pak-to-send-in-terrorists-to-india-101611449366277.html
24-01-2021||India||Republic Day tableau to honour Indian worker||The Rafale fighter jets won’t be the only stars of the Republic Day parade this year. The humble Indian worker, who bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, will be part of the show, too, in the labour ministry’s first tableau at the parade, both in a salute to his resilience and a bit of political messaging.The ministry is still wrapping up some of the initiatives it introduced in 2020 for the benefit of migrant workers, millions of whom fled the cities and headed back home to the countryside in an exodus that followed the lockdown enforced on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)The theme of the tableau, which features workers in hard hats and safety gear, is encapsulated in the slogan: “Mehnat ko samman, Adhikar ek samaan’’ (Respect for hard work, Equal rights for all).Also Read | No chief guest this Republic DayA spokesperson for the labour ministry pointed out that the occasion precedes the imminent implementation of the new labour codes, which aim to bring the unorganised section of the workforce under the social security net. The government this week held its final round of consultations with stakeholders to sew up the rules for the code.“The design {of the tableau} is a celebration of workers’ well- being and security,’’ minister for labour and employment Santosh Gangwar said.The three labour code bills — the Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020; the Industrial Relations Code, 2020; and the Code on Social Security, 2020 — merged 24 central labour laws and were passed by Parliament in September as part of National Democratic Alliance government’s reform agenda. The Code on Social Security, 2020 promised universal social security for the first time, for both organised and informal workers as well as gig and platform workers.Labour unions haven’t been enthusiastic about the new labour codes. Tapan Sen, a leader of the Centre for Trade Unions, said labour groups had met the minister on January 20 and rejected the changes, calling them exploitative because they allowed hiring and firing of workers by management teams.“ We want this to be scrapped and fresh discussions to be initiated. This R-day initiative is just to hide the governmenr’s misdeeds,’’ said Sen.The tableau will also have gig workers, platform workers and artistes performing as delivery agents and cargo carriers.Also Read | Ayodhya, upcoming Ram Temple in Uttar Pradesh’s tableau for Republic Day“With the tableau, we want to showcase how the new labour code will give a new direction to the lives of labourers,’’ said Gangwar. The front of the tableau will have a “confident and empowered worker holding a tool and leading the way. A yellow safety cap suggests social security, wage security and health security under labour reforms.’’Anindita Adhikari, who works with the Stranded Workers Action Network that has done several studies on the impact the lockdown had on the informal workforce, said the government was “valourising the workers after crushing them’’ — a reference to the impact of the lockdown that cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.She also mocked the image of the tableau. “Which worker looks like this? Certainly not the informal workers who make up the bulk of the workers in the country,’’ Adhikari said.A labour ministry spokesperson responded by saying the government had set up 24x7 helplines, helped release wages and cleared emergency provident fund withdrawals in record time. According to the government’s own report, prepared by a group of ministers, 95 million urban workers felt the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-tableau-to-honour-indian-worker-101611448943408.html
24-01-2021||India||1.5 million Indians receive Covid -19 vaccine in 8 days: Govt data||Eight days after the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the total number of people vaccinated against the coronavirus disease across the country crossed 1.5 million, with 146,598 health care workers receiving the first shot on Saturday.The daily number of shots administered had risen to 230,000 on Thursday after changes were made to the Co-WIN platform to allow walk-ins on Tuesday. The app now allows registered beneficiaries to get the shot out-of-turn even if their name does not figure on the list for a particular day.University of Oxford’s Our World in Data showed on Thursday that India is now the fastest country to breach the million-mark in immunisation, taking only six days compared to nine by the US. The country has set a target of vaccinating 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase.The data showed a vaccination rate of 55.3% on Saturday, down from 57% on Thursday. However, some parts of the country reported a jump in the vaccination rate, including Delhi, where the vaccination centres saw over 86% of the target achieved.“The number of people getting vaccinated is gradually going up. This is largely due to the health care workers seeing their seniors and peers receiving the shots without any adverse events. Slowly, the hesitancy is going down,” said a senior doctor from one of the central government-run hospitals in Delhi on condition of anonymity.The pace of the vaccination drive so far has worried authorities as well as experts who have raised concerns about the wastage of doses since vaccinators at some locations could not find enough recipients to finish doses from the vials that they had opened.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said that many health workers were hesitant of receiving the vaccine.Meanwhile, seven states — Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal — will start using Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the coming week. Initially, 12 states were administering the indigenously produced vaccine to the health workers.On Saturday, 123 adverse reactions were reported across the country, according to the provisional data provided by the Union health ministry. So far, only 11 people have had to be hospitalised after receiving the shot.The death of a 56-year-old health worker was reported on Friday, days after she was given the first vaccine dose. The postmortem exam, however, said that death was caused due to an underlying heart disease and was not linked to the vaccine. Since the start of the immunisation programme on January 16, six deaths have been reported across the country but none of them have been caused by the vaccine, the Union health ministry has said.The Union health ministry is also training immunisation programme managers of 13 countries — Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brazil, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Seychelles and Sri Lanka — using Indian vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-million-indians-receive-covid-19-vaccine-in-8-days-govt-data-101611448220800.html

24-01-2021||India||Countries seek doses of SII’s Covishield after concerns over Chinese vaccine||Several countries that have been offered or purchased Chinese Covid-19 vaccines, including Brazil and Cambodia, have turned to India for supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine amid questions about the efficacy of some of the Chinese jabs.India is receiving numerous requests for vaccines, both as grant assistance and commercial supplies, and these have increased since New Delhi rolled out nearly five million doses of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, for seven countries in the neighbourhood.On Friday, India rolled out two million doses as commercial supplies to Brazil, where the question of opting between the AstraZeneca vaccine and Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine is at the heart of differences between President Jair Bolsonaro and several governors, including Sao Paulo governor João Doria, widely seen as Bolsonaro’s main rival for the 2022 presidential race.Bolsonaro had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 8 to expedite the shipping of two million doses of Covishield as he hoped to launch the vaccination drive from the presidential palace this week. At the time, however, India was yet to launch its own vaccination drive and officials were working out the timeframe for rolling out vaccine grants and commercial supplies.Doria subsequently launched the vaccination drive with CoronaVac, and Brazil plans to cover 230 million people with its vaccination drive. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Brazil intends to acquire more of the AstraZeneca jab and also manufacture it.Indonesia, which has received three million doses of CoronaVac for its free vaccination drive, too is looking to acquire the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Indonesia’s Indofarma company is in talks with the Serum Institute to procure Covishield. “Hopefully, this will be realised soon,” said a person aware of the discussions.On Monday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen made a request for vaccine assistance from India during a meeting with Indian envoy Devyani Khobragade. Officials in Phnom Penh said the country is interested in both Covishield and Covaxin, which is made by Bharat Biotech, as they can be stored at temperatures suitable for Cambodia.China, one of the biggest supporters of Cambodia that has provided soft loans worth billions of dollars, has donated one million doses of Sinovac vaccine to vaccinate 500,000 people. However, the people cited above said Cambodia will need many more doses to cover a majority of its population of nearly 17 million.At the same time, questions have been raised about the efficacy of CoronaVac after trials in Brazil demonstrated an efficacy rate of around 50% – significantly lower than the vaccines from AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer. A trial in Indonesia also showed an efficacy of 65.3%.Though Sinovac is conducting trials in several countries, experts have questioned its lack of openness and noted the company has not released much data. John Moore, a vaccine researcher with Weill Cornell Medicine, told NPR: “It's science by press release. The Chinese are being, well, characteristically less than transparent.”Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “If you look at it from the viewpoint of beneficiary countries, no single supplier can provide their entire need for vaccines and they are looking for more options. They cannot say no to China and some vaccines may not be up to the mark though they want to exercise other options.“There is a clear preference for multiple options, and India is preferred option for potential beneficiary countries because of its global reputation as a vaccine manufacturer. Besides, the Serum Institute has the Oxford-AstraZeneca connection. This is good for Indian diplomacy in both South Asia and the extended neighbourhood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countries-seek-doses-of-sii-s-covishiled-after-concerns-over-chinese-vaccine-101611446715420.html
24-01-2021||India||Mollem project: Board passed clearances in haste||Three members of the Goa State Wildlife Board have submitted a memorandum to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC), constituted by the Supreme Court, stating that the clearances granted by the Board were passed in haste, without recording their objections, and without clearly explaining the potential damage to the eco-sensitive zones, and the mitigation measures planned.Rajendra Kerkar, who called on the CEC, which is currently on a site visit to Goa, said that the members were surprised after the meeting to note the minutes mentioned that the projects were ‘recommended by the Board’. “The matter was not on the agenda for the day’s meeting but was mentioned nonetheless, with the nature and scale of the projects, including the harmful effects and possible mitigation measures not fully explained. Our objections were not recorded. We have explained this to the CEC,” Kerkar told HT.“We also explained to them that these are tiger habitats, thick forests and biodiversity hotspots and that they should be preserved and cared for. We are opposed to all the three projects because it will be damaging to the ecosystem,” Kerkar said.Kerkar was present in the meeting held in December 2019 when the three projects were allegedly cleared. Environmental NGO, the Goa Foundation, had petitioned the CEC challenging the decision of the standing committee of the National Board of Wildlife to grant clearances to three infrastructure projects.After an initial hearing via videoconference, the CEC decided to hold site visits to examine veracity of allegations.Besides environmental groups, leading members of the opposition, including Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat called on the CEC to explain their reservations against the government’s plans to push ahead with the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mollem-project-board-passed-clearances-in-haste-101611445034468.html
24-01-2021||India||Adjudicating during Covid pandemic: Judges weigh in||Decades after the 1975 Emergency, four judges of the Supreme Court on Saturday recalled how the Covid-19 pandemic presented a somewhat similar situation before the courts which had to adopt a much finer line of judicial review to scrutinise state actions that curbed fundamental freedoms of individuals without resorting to emergency powers.Recalling these times when the country saw frequent lockdowns, restriction on movement of citizens and enhanced power of the executive, Justice DY Chandrachud said, “Even as emergency in the constitutional sense was not declared in India, several executive and legislative actions were initiated to meet the extraordinary challenge of our times. It became incumbent upon courts that state action is a rational means to secure a legitimate aim with least infringement of fundamental rights of individuals.”The judge was speaking at an online event organised to release a book “The Law on Emergency Powers: Comparative Common Law Perspectives” written by senior lawyer and Member of Parliament Abhishek Manu Singhvi along with Khagesh Gautam, a professor of law at Jindal Global Law School. The book was originally the doctoral thesis submitted by Singhvi during his studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, almost four decades ago. It was reviewed by Gautam and reproduced in the contemporary context.Releasing the book, Justice NV Ramana, the most senior judge of the Supreme Court after the CJI, said, “Emergency had a long-lasting impact on generations,” recalling how those years shaped him personally to be part of the civil liberty movement. The book analysed the concept and need of emergency powers, martial laws, military action in aid of civil authority by making a comparative analysis of the law existing in common law jurisdictions in India, the US and the United Kingdom.Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul recalled the ADM Jabalpur case of 1976 where a majority bench refused to act against the executive action to suspend fundamental rights during the Emergency. This decision was overruled by a majority ruling of a nine-judge Supreme Court bench in the KS Puttaswamy case on August 24, 2017 by which the right to privacy was declared a fundamental right.In his address, Justice Kaul spoke of the global threat where a de facto emergency-like situation could occur without resorting to emergency provisions. As many as 13 countries imposed an emergency on account of the extraordinary situation due to Covid-19. However, in the Indian context, he said the balance between public health and rule of law was maintained.Justice Surya Kant, the fourth judge to speak on the occasion, noted that no formal emergency was declared during the Covid-19 pandemic. He felt that the real issues facing countries in the contemporary context were terrorism and domestic unrest and to deal with them, nations were using ordinary laws and delegated powers instead of emergency provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adjudicating-during-covid-pandemic-judges-weigh-in-101611444166632.html
24-01-2021||India||India is ready to match China’s aggression, says Air Force chief||On the eve of military talks with China, Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said on Saturday that India was ready to match China’s aggression in the eastern Ladakh theatre, where the two countries have been locked in a border row since May 2020."If they (China) can get aggressive, we will also get aggressive. We have full preparations (to meet any eventuality),” the IAF chief said during a media interaction in Jodhpur, where India and France are carrying out joint air force drills.Bhadauria’s comments came a day ahead of the ninth round of military talks with China to defuse border tensions in Ladakh.The corps commander-level talks between the Indian army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will be held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on Sunday, said officials familiar with the development. Last month, the IAF chief said the likely reasons for Chinese actions could include a planned escalation and an attempt to establish border claim lines and start border talks on the new positions, military signalling, domination efforts with escalation control and deployment and training of their Western Theatre forces in real war-like scenarios wherein the Galwan Valley incident was an overreach.On June 15 in the Galwan Valley, a violent clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers left at least 20 Indian troops dead and caused an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.Senior Indian and Chinese commanders last met on November 6. The situation in the Ladakh sector remains tense and the ongoing military dialogue has not led to any breakthrough. “Talks may not yield a positive outcome in the short-term but the dialogue has to go on,” said one of the officials cited above.Experts are also not expecting much from the military talks. It is a good thing that talks are going on and communication is being maintained between the two sides, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“However, it is unlikely that any breakthrough will take place as there does not seem to be any common ground on the basis of which an agreement can take place. This common ground has to be established in political or diplomatic level engagements. Since this has not happened, we should not expect much from the military talks,” Hooda said.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China are prolonged.During the eighth round of talks on November 6, the Indian army and the PLA said they will ensure their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC.Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and firm about holding forward positions along the LAC through the harsh winter months. The PLA has moved back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions but its frontline deployments remain unchanged, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.Earlier, Naravane said India should not read too much into the withdrawal of Chinese troops from depth areas on the Tibetan plateau as there has been absolutely no reduction of troops by either side at friction points in the Ladakh sector where the border standoff between the two nuclear powers is in its ninth month.He said India hoped to reach an agreement with China based on the principles of “mutual and equal security” that would result in disengagement of border troops at friction points and subsequent de-escalation of conflict in the Ladakh theatre.India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks whereas the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-ready-to-match-china-s-aggression-says-air-force-chief-101611443870528.html
24-01-2021||India||Discontent at CWC meet over polls for Congress election panel||As more details of Friday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting emerged, it is now clear that the new bone of contention between party leaders who in August called for an overhaul of the organisation and staunch loyalists of the leadership is a demand that members of the Central Election Committee (CEC) be elected, not nominated.Hindustan Times has spoken to several delegates who attended the meeting, including signatories to the letter written in August to chief Sonia Gandhi in which they demanded a “full-time and effective” leadership that is “visible” and “active”. The people, who requested anonymity, confirmed that the schedule for elections to the post of president and CWC members was accepted, but a spat ensued when the demand was voiced for CEC members to be elected.The demand was articulated by Ghulam Nabi Azad, leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, his deputy Anand Sharma, and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who wasn’t a signatory to the original letter, but supported elections to the CEC, the people said. They said CEC members should be chosen by the same electoral college that takes part in the election of the president.The CEC, headed by Sonia Gandhi, selects the party’s candidates to all elections. At present, its members include Rahul Gandhi, former PM Manmohan Singh, senior leaders AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal, Mohsina Kidwai, Girija Vyas, Janardan Dwivedi, M Veerappa Moily and Oscar Fernandes.The opposition to the proposal was initially in the form of a healthy debate. Antony opposed the proposal in what one letter writer described as a “sober manner”. Soni asked if election to the CEC would require an amendment to the Congress’s constitution and Sharma clarified that it didn’t.It was around that point of time that Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot used “harsh words” against the letter writers. Since the December 19 meeting with Gandhi, there had been a feeling that a reproachment was in the works, especially with Venugopal and Soni reaching out to the letter writers to understand their concerns and implement reforms within the party.Gehlot is learnt o have questioned the need for the 23 leaders to send such a letter in the first place. “Nobody even knows your names, nobody recognises you,’’ Gehlot is learnt to have said. To which Sharma responded: “That may well be true. I don’t have any identity but that of Indian National Congress. And it’s because of that our faces and names are known. And that’s why you are also known. This is not the way to talk. Nobody has given you the authority to insult your colleagues.’’Rahul Gandhi then intervened. “I can understand the emotion that Ashok Gehlot had expressed (his views with) and what he was feeling, but at the same time I agree with Anand Sharma ji and feel that harsh words should never have been spoken,” people who attended the meeting quoted him as saying.A letter writer said the delegates were taken aback by the Rajasthan CM’s words. “Just because he is a chief minister, it doesn’t give him authority over us. There are six former chief ministers among the letter writers,’’ said this person.HT reached out to Gehlot’s office, but received no response. A spokesperson for Congress denied that there had been any harsh exchange of words at the meeting.While the letter writers want elections at all levels and the CEC is one such forum, a former CWC member told HT that the CEC’s membership carried the kind of prestige that even the CWC, the party’s top decision making body, didn’t have. “It’s the only one where a member can feel important and seems to influence who gets a party ticket,’’ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discontent-at-cwc-meet-over-polls-for-congress-election-panel-101611443465055.html

This plan will prove to be effective in preventing migration and making rural areas self-sufficient through tourism,” Maharaj said.He further said that homestays developed in these villages will be constructed following local traditional architectural style.The tourism department has selected villages in districts like Uttarkashi, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh and Chamoli.Under the Trekking Traction Homestay Scheme, villages near important and popular trekking routes are being developed by the tourism department as trekking clusters. This will give a lodging facility to the tourists and they will be able to enjoy the place by staying there. Under this scheme, financial assistance of ₹60,000 per room is given to locals for building new rooms in their houses for the purpose of home-stay and ₹25,000 for constructing new toilets with the rooms. The financial assistance is provided for a maximum of up to six rooms.Dilip Jawalkar, secretary for tourism in the state said that the beneficiaries of the scheme will be selected through a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate.He further said that the committee will conduct an evaluation after which the amount of grant will be transferred directly to the beneficiary's bank account through Direct Bank Transfer under the recommendation of the district magistrate.The state government has already selected eight beneficiaries from Agora and Dasna villages in Uttarkashi district which fall on the Dodital trek route.The state tourism department started the scheme from Chopta village near Tungnath shrine, the world's highest temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.To increase lodging facilities in such areas, the secretary for tourism has also instructed district officials to renovate the old bungalows of Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam after permission is obtained from the state forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-tourism-dept-selects-29-hill-villages-to-promote-trekking-clusters-101611433321986.html

They also vandalized barricades and police vehicles. Police resorted to baton charge, used water cannons and fired tear gas to control the mob, said the ADG.A case has been registered against 1000 unidentified people under Section 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), he added.However, Congress leaders accused the police of using force to create a nuisance during a peaceful protest of farmers and Congress. Former minister and Congress MLA Brijendra Singh Rathore said, “Police used force to create a nuisance during the peaceful protest. Many leaders were injured seriously in the baton charge of the police.”Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath also attacked the BJP-led state government and said, “Police used force against the farmers and Congress workers during the peaceful protest. This barbaric act of the BJP-led state government is unacceptable. But this will not stop us. We will continue our struggle against the anti-farmers laws of the Centre,” said Kamal Nath.However, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “The protest is not for farmers but for retaining the posts in MPCC. Congress leaders are more concerned about their posts than farmers. We had already seen during the regime of the Congress government that how sensitive they were for farmers. They cheated farmers in the name of a farm loan waiver scheme. The protest was just a drama and nothing else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1000-plus-congress-leaders-held-for-rioting-at-bhopal-rally-against-farm-laws-101611431207777.html
24-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand to give ₹15 lakh to kin of martyrs, says CM Trivendra Singh Rawat||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Saturday announced that the state government would now provide a sum of ₹15 lakh to the families of martyred soldiers hailing from the state.Rawat made the announcement while laying the foundation of Sainya Dham-- a memorial dedicated to soldiers-- in Dehradun’s Purkul village on Saturday in the presence of other cabinet ministers and retired army officers.Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling Uttarakhand the Sainya Dham - fifth dham after the traditional Char Dhams -- Rawat in 2019 had announced that the state government will set up a Sainya Dham in Dehradun.Making the announcement, Rawat said, “Till now the amount provided by the state government to the families of martyred soldiers was ₹10 lakh which has now been increased to ₹15 lakh. It is a small gesture to assure that the government is always there for the family members of our brave soldiers.”Informing about the details of the Sainya Dham to be built in an area of five hectares, the CM said that the administration will bring soil from the house of every martyr in the state while building the structure.“We want the visitors to know that the dham comprises the soil in which the martyrs spent their childhood and grew up to serve the nation. We will also try to bring at least one item belonging to the martyr from his house to be kept in a museum in the Sainya Dham. It would motivate the youths, sisters and mothers visiting the site,” said Rawat adding that water from the major rivers of the state would also be used in building the dham.Hailing the initiative, he also said that the government wants the Sainya Dham to be a “lively” one.“We want that every pebble in it should narrate the stories of our martyrs so as to bring enthusiasm in visitors. It would be such that the future CMs would take their oath here and every visitor coming to Dehradun would come here to pay tribute to the martyred soldiers,” said Rawat.He also informed that there would also be a centre in the dham to train those children who want to join the army.“We have formed a special committee which will contemplate all these features and decide its structure to set it up as a major landmark in the state as well as country,” he said.The initiative of setting up the Sainya Dham was taken after Prime Minister Modi, during an election rally in Rudrapur in March 2019, said: “Devbhumi Uttarakhand has char dhams, but today I add a fifth -Sainya Dham- as every second house in this state is of an army man.”Following that, Rawat last year made the announcement of setting it up while addressing a gathering of ex-servicemen at Sainya Sammelan organised in Dehradun as part of the government’s week-long state foundation day celebrations for which the theme was ‘Mere Sainik Mera Abhiman’ (my soldiers, my pride).Once built, it will have details of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the nation. It will also house details of the rich legacy of soldiers from Uttarakhand and their contribution over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-give-rs-15-lakh-to-kin-of-martyrs-says-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-101611429910166.html

24-01-2021||Today's||How I erred on Biden and Blinken||I have to admit sometimes I am my own worst enemy. I turn my silly nose up at opportunities that others would grab with both hands. Well, as Joe Biden settles into the White House, I can’t but regret two that I foolishly threw away. Or, to be more honest, failed to capitalise on. Had I done so this might have been a very different column.I met Biden in July 2013, but didn’t take sufficient interest in the man. At the time, he was Obama’s vice-president and visiting India. Hamid Ansari, our vice-president, hosted a dinner at Hyderabad House to which I was invited. For most people, this would have been an opportunity to get to know someone who was, at the time, just a heartbeat away from the American presidency. Foolishly, I had different ideas.Shortly after I arrived, Ansari offered to introduce me to the American vice-president. But Biden was surrounded by people and I was hesitant largely because I wasn’t sure what to say. I had also spotted someone else among the guests and was keen to talk to him. Bizarrely, that took precedence. So, today, instead of being able to claim Joe and I are buddies, I’m the guy who wouldn’t go up and shake his hand. Everyone else did, but I stuck to the other end of the room chatting with another fool like me.Unfortunately, this is not the end of my collection of sorry stories. In December 2015, I was offered an interview with Antony Blinken. At the time, he was Barack Obama’s deputy secretary of state. Today he’s Biden’s secretary of state. Fortunately, I didn’t say no. But, once again, I didn’t take Blinken as seriously as I should have.It was a 30-minute interview and Blinken was truly engaging. Alas, I only realised that when I saw it again last week. Five years ago, it felt like another interview with an American official I would never meet again and probably never hear of as well.Well, the conclusion I’m hinting at is obvious and I’m pretty certain you’ve already worked it out for yourself. Journalists often lack judgement. We aren’t talent-spotters — at least I’m not — and we often fail to sniff out who’s likely to rise to the top. Here were two occasions when good fortune was in my grasp but it slipped through my fingers. Worst of all, I wasn’t even aware that was happening.Actually, my error with Blinken was even worse. He was in a tearing rush and I had stretched the interview way beyond the 20 minutes his minders had stipulated. I could see they were displeased. Blinken, on the other hand, seemed to have enjoyed it. I don’t remember his precise words but he was fairly emphatic in saying I should stay in touch. It sounded as if he meant it. But I never found out because I didn’t bother to make the effort.So, once again, I can’t claim I know the new secretary of state. Our meeting was more like ships passing in the night. We went our different ways. As Longfellow, who coined the phrase in 1863, put it: “On the ocean of life, we pass and speak one another, only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.”Never have I regretted my silence more. For a man who makes a career out of talking, can go on interminably and interrupt others frequently, isn’t it odd that on two occasions, which I should have known would not repeat themselves, I missed out on God-given opportunities because I felt I had nothing to say? I guess that could be an appropriate sentiment to inscribe on my tombstone: “He was never short of a word except when it mattered. Then he was tongue-tied.” Ah well, if I get to meet Joe Biden and Antony Blinken again I’ll have a lot to say!Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold Story The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-i-erred-on-biden-and-blinken-101611406011549.html
24-01-2021||Today's||Focusing on women with disabilities||The Covid-19 pandemic has sharpened the focus on the vulnerabilities faced by many sections of the population, especially women. But among these groups, women living with disabilities — there are 11.8 million in India — face a particularly challenging situation. Two civil society organisations, Rising Flame and Sightsavers, undertook a study of women with disabilities during the pandemic and found that those with sight and hearing impairments faced serious obstacles to accessing information, education, food and other basic amenities not to mention psychological support.Many with sight disabilities were not able to access the Aarogya Setu app as it does not factor in their requirements. Those with locomotor disabilities were not able to visit stores to access food and the virus acted as an impediment to getting delivery of essential services. Many payment apps are not accessible to the visually challenged and many online courses too are not tailored to their needs.While work from home could be to the advantage of women with disabilities, there are several challenges in being able to access video calls and voice calls and, of course, there is lack of connectivity in many areas. The pandemic has also curtailed the possibilities of many disabled women being able to get physical and psychological support. Social distancing and fear of the virus has led to many of them losing whatever little physical support they had in the form of attendants.Government schemes, which have been a lifeline for so many women in these trying times, must be responsive to the needs of women with disabilities. For a start, the government could use its robust grassroots systems with its health workers to create awareness in families about the need to not compromise on health and education for women with disabilities.Skill development, one of the flagship programmes of the government, should include courses and training specifically for women who are disabled in consultation with them. Some of these women should be inducted into local decision-making bodies so that they can participate in processes, which build their skills.In India, many women in general and those with disabilities in particular have to face poverty, poor health conditions, little or no income, lower education levels and isolation. With resources being scarce, women usually get the short end of the stick, more so if they suffer from some form of disability. Trapped at home, they are also vulnerable to abuse and face barriers in being able to register a complaint with the police or bring this to the notice of a civil society organisation. In many cases, fearing abandonment or further isolation, they chose to keep quiet.The government and non-governmental organisations can intervene to help. One, set up a functioning telephone network, accessible to women with disabilities so that they can convey their needs to a relevant person in the local governance system. Two, create a database of those with disabilities and their medical needs. A noteworthy effort is a video made with relevant information by the office of the Commissioner for Disabilities.Women with disabilities have been on the margins for far too long. The pandemic has been particularly cruel to them but also offers an opportunity to enable them to become more independent and productive if the government makes a concerted effort.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/focusing-on-women-with-disabilities-101611405410818.html
24-01-2021||Editorials||The political battle over Netaji | HT Editorial||To mark Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary, both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government and the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government pulled out all the stops. Netaji was a remarkable patriot, an iconic freedom fighter who charted his own path after differences with Mahatma Gandhi, and despite his questionable understanding with Axis powers, a courageous nationalist.But there is also little doubt that the intensification of the battle over Bose’s memory stems from the contemporary political divide in Bengal. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s annoyed intervention at the Victoria Memorial event to mark Bose’s birth anniversary on Saturday, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was just the latest evidence of this political battle. But at the root of it is both the BJP and Trinamool’s belief that they have the first right to claim Bose.For the BJP, Bose was a target of a Nehruvian conspiracy to undermine the legacy of a political figure who would have become a symbol of an alternative political matrix. This, therefore, fits into the party’s overall political rhetoric of how a set of rulers in Delhi have been unfair to other icons — and only the BJP can make it right. For the Trinamool, Bose was a victim of a conspiracy to undermine the contribution of Bengal to the national movement and marginalise its icons. This fits into the regional party’s tactic of tapping into Bengali sub-nationalism against an insensitive Centre. In the process, Bose’s own convictions — on secularism and nationalism — and his relationship with Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru have been simplistically portrayed. To be true to the present, both sides must be truthful about the past, instead of making one of India’s icons a subject of political wrangling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-political-battle-over-netaji-hteditorial-101611493628044.html
