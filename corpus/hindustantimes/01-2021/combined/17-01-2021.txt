17-01-2021||Mumbai||Bad air days are back for Mumbai after two days of respite||After two days of relatively cleaner air, the city saw air quality worsen significantly on Sunday. Pollution levels were in the very poor category in many parts as wind speeds, and temperatures remained low.The air quality index (AQI) has soared to 252 and fallen in the poor category as temperatures remained low, causing pollutants to be trapped in the air.The city breathed its cleanest air this year on Saturday with an AQI of 162 as westerly winds blowing from the northwest of India cleared up pollutants in the air. On Friday, the AQI was 190, which was in the moderate category for the first time in 2021.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.“Due to low wind speed, low dispersion, and influence of oceanic air mass, Mumbai AQI is likely to remain in moderate to poor category for the next two days,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.The air quality was the worst of all 10 locations at Navi Mumbai, with an AQI of 366 (very poor). Malad recorded an AQI of 331, BKC was at 308 and Andheri recorded AQI of 306, all in the very poor category.Day and night were pleasant as temperatures remained low on Sunday. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature dropped to 18.2 degrees Celsius, 1 degree above normal. The Colaba observatory of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 20.6 degrees Celsius, 1 degree above normal.Santacruz reported a maximum temperature of 31.3 degrees Celsius, which was at par with normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature dropped a degree below 29 degrees Celsius and was one degree below normal.“Winter returns for the state. Dry weather is expected over the region during the next five days as a gradual fall in temperatures by 2-4 degrees Celsius is expected from January 19,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bad-air-days-are-back-for-mumbai-after-two-days-of-respite-101610907785677.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Night curfew in Mumbai impacted liquor sale in December||The night curfew imposed by the state government in December-January impacted the sale of liquor in Mumbai in December, which normally records high sales annually.December sees the highest consumption of liquor in the year due to Christmas and the New Year. However, this year due to restrictions and night curfew owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the establishments were shut by 11pm.According to the state excise department data, December 2020 witnessed a decrease in consumption of liquor to 38 lakh litres compared to 41 lakh litres in December 2019.The worst-affected was the sale of beer, which struggled at 50 lakh litres in December 2020, compared to 70 lakh litres during the same month in 2019.“The decrease in the consumption in Mumbai was due to the night curfew,” said state excise commissioner Kantilal Umap. “In case of beer, people are still not drinking it as a precautionary measure as they want to avoid chilled drinks, due to the pandemic,” he added.The state government imposed a 15-day night curfew between December 22 and January 5 in line with the Maharashtra government’s decision amid concerns over the outbreak of a new strain of the coronavirus in the United Kingdom. The hoteliers said it was natural that consumption of alcohol would take a hit. “People tend to celebrate throughout the night, but since all celebrations were cancelled, it directly affected the intake of alcohol,” said Pankaj Saxena, general manager, Radisson Blu, Mumbai International Airport hotel. He added that many have now switched from chilled beer to liquors and wines at room temperature.The hotels and restaurants have lost approximately ₹150 crore in revenue due to restrictions on the December 31 celebrations.Savio D’sa, who is a consultant in the hospitality sector, said the curfew was unwarranted. “Many travelled to Goa to bring in the New Year and it was a loss for the state’s exchequer. People tend to start celebrations only after 10pm and it was not possible to wind up within an hour. Hance, many had to cancel their plans,” said D’sa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/night-curfew-in-mumbai-impacted-liquor-sale-in-december-101610907725689.html

However, there were reports of minor side-effects faced by some beneficiaries, who complained of fever, chills, body ache and weakness. Among the other complaints received by the state health department include minor swelling after the jab, uneasiness, etc.On Saturday, the first day of the vaccination drive in Mumbai, concluded at 5pm, with 1,926 health workers vaccinated, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A total of 200 staffers, including 80 vaccinators, were working on Saturday.Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “There are a few reports of minor complaints like swelling after being pricked, some experienced uneasiness or pain, but there was nothing serious. There have been no major adverse effects following the vaccination. Many of the doctors and healthcare workers, who were inoculated, have given interviews sharing their experience.”The BMC said there was no hospitalisation on Saturday or Sunday post-vaccination or any beneficiary reporting major adverse effects.A senior doctor from Mumbai, who did not wish to be named, said, “Post-vaccination, I did not experience any major issue throughout the day. I could do my work comfortably.

17-01-2021||Mumbai||Presence at crime scene not liable for punishment: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC) in a recent order held that merely being present at the place of a crime which falls under the purview of the Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurants and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working Therein) Act, 2016 cannot be considered a crime, and quashed a first information report (FIR) against two applicants who were arrested by Santacruz police in a raid at a dance bar in 2017. The court held that as the two had not indulged in obscene acts, nor had they abetted the same, mere presence in the place could not be considered a crime. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by the two men, was informed by advocates Rajesh Khobragade and Gayatri Nayak that there were no specific allegations, and nor any role was attributed to their clients which would attract the charges levelled in the FIR and the charge sheet submitted by the police. The two men were booked by Santacruz police on January 21, 2017, along with other accused persons under section 294 (punishment for obscene acts or words in public) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the allegation that obscene dances were being performed by women in a bar owned by the other accused persons. The two men were booked for allegedly being present at the time. The advocates submitted that when the ingredients of the alleged offences were not made out, there was no question of the petitioners being made to face the trial and sought the complaint against them to be set aside. Given this, in December last year, the court had granted a stay of the trial on the two men. However, additional public prosecutor VB Konde-Deshmukh for the police submitted that the names of the two men were clearly stated in the FIR, and material collected in the charge-sheet indicated their presence at the spot of incident, and therefore, the petition deserved to be dismissed. After hearing both sides, the bench observed, “A perusal of the material on record shows that no allegations as per section 294 of the IPC are made against the petitioners at all. Similarly, as per section 114 of the IPC, a person is liable when he is an abettor present when the alleged offence is committed. The material on record does not indicate any specific action on the part of the petitioners to qualify as abettors.” The HC added, “Similarly, as regards the provisions of the Act of 2016, mere mentioning names of the petitioners in the FIR and the charge-sheet would not suffice and there is lack of material to indicate that the ingredients of the offences alleged under the said Act could be said to be present against the petitioners.” The bench then allowed the FIR to be quashed against the two men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/presence-at-crime-scene-not-liable-for-punishment-bombay-hc-101610907125971.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Bitter rivalry between estranged cousins Uddhav, Raj Thackeray set to revive ahead of 2022 Mumbai civic polls||The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is all geared to attack the Shiv Sena-led state government after it reduced the security of its chief Raj Thackeray.Ahead of the crucial Mumbai civic elections, Raj, who is a bitter rival of Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has already instructed his leaders to go on an attack spree against the Sena.Following the government decision to downsize his security, MNS spokesperson Sandeep Deshpande described it as a case of personal bias. “Uddhav Thackeray is jealous of Raj Thackeray, considering the crowds coming to him at Krishna Kunj (Raj Thackeray’s residence) seeking justice,” said Deshpande. “Uddhav Thackeray is giving security to nobody like Varun Sardesai while purging the security of the tallest leader in this state like Raj Thackeray. This is pure vengeance,” he added. Varun Sardesai, the nephew of Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi, is the secretary of the Yuva Sena led by Uddhav’s son Aaditya Thackeray.The MNS has now formed the MNS Rakshak Pathak which will consist of party men assigned to protect Raj. The other attack came from lone MNS legislator Raju Patil, who tweeted his complaint to Uddhav in Gujarati. “The Marathi number plates on vehicles are being targeted in Maharashtra. Please look into this matter. The Marathi manoos is looking towards you with hope,” tweeted Patil. Patil said that considering how the Shiv Sena is wooing the Gujarati community with its campaign — “Mumbai ma jalebi fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda”, he hoped his plea would be heard in Gujarati. “Since Uddhav Thackeray has left the Marathi agenda, and [we are] witnessing his newfound love for Gujaratis, I felt it’s better to address him in that language,” said Patil. The Shiv Sena has defended itself saying it was the decision of the home ministry. “MNS is just making an issue of a non-issue. It is the home ministry’s recommendation after they had analysed the threat perception. Even Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi’s security was pruned but they accepted it gracefully. Even Sharad Pawar offered to voluntarily reduce his security,” said Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande.The MNS did not spare Uddhav’s son Aaditya, who is the state tourism minister. MNS spokesperson Deshpande took a jibe at Aaditya by reposting the latter’s tweet in which he invited Tesla, an electric vehicle company to set base in Maharashtra. However, Tesla has chosen Karnataka. Deshpande tweeted, “Tesla company has fled to Karnataka. It is a setback to Page 3 ministers.” The jibe aimed at Aaditya used to be seen in parties earlier.The friction between Raj and Uddhav aggravated in 2005 when Raj, who was once seen as Sena founder Bal Thackeray’s heir, deserted the saffron outfit following a cold war between them and formed his own party the next year. He squarely blamed Uddhav and his coterie for this desertion, saying he was being marginalised from the party and was being utilised just for campaigning.MNS faced a setback in his debut elections — the 2007 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) where MNS secured seven seats. However, this all changed when Raj played up the Marathi Manoos card to the hilt in 2008 with North Indian bashing, blaming them for depriving jobs of the locals. This paid rich dividends in 2009 parliamentary and Assembly polls — severely damaging the Sena. His 2012 BMC poll tally was impressive with 28 seats in his kitty. However, MNS then faded into oblivion as it was almost wiped out in the 2014 and 2018 Assembly polls when Raj was able to secure just one seat in both the elections.Political analysts point that Raj is bound to be aggressive in the coming days. “Raj has no alternative but to get aggressive for political survival. He will also get indirect support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in his mission. The BJP will use him against the Sena,” said political commentator Hemant Desai. The coming Mumbai civic polls will be an opportunity for the MNS and Raj to regain some lost ground. As such, the MNS has now begun getting aggressive on its “sons of the soil agenda”.The BJP, which is determined to win the Mumbai civic body that the Sena has been ruling for over two decades, would prefer if the MNS eats into the Sena’s Marathi vote bank and damage its chances to retain power in one of Asia’s richest civic bodies, the BMC.How the Shiv Sena and its chief Uddhav Thackeray’s counter to Raj remains to be seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bitter-rivalry-between-estranged-cousins-uddhav-raj-thackeray-set-to-revive-ahead-of-2022-mumbai-civic-polls-101610906766993.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu outbreak: 836 more birds dead; over 25,000 poultry birds culled across Maharashtra||The count of bird flu deaths in the state has soared to 5,987 in the last 10 days. Additionally, over 10,000 poultry birds in eight districts have been culled after bird flu deaths were confirmed by the ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing bird flu cases.This is in addition to nearly 15,000 poultry culled in one village each in Parbhani and Latur after ICAR-NIHSAD recently confirmed bird flu in poultry birds.On Sunday, 836 bird deaths were reported, whereas on Saturday around 1,200 birds died across the state, officials from the state animal husbandry department said.The ICAR-NIHSAD has confirmed bird flu in poultry chickens at 11 places covering eight districts — Parbhani, Latur, Nanded, Pune, Solapur, Beed, Ahmednagar and Raigad — on Friday.“Following confirmation from the central laboratory, the culling of poultry birds started within a one-km radius of infected areas from Saturday and culled 10,433 poultry birds till Sunday. This is apart from destroying eggs and pigeons in infected areas,” said Sachindra Pratap Singh, state animal husbandry commissioner on Sunday.The local administration has culled 707 poultry birds at two villages in Parbhani district, 781 at two villages in Latur, 1,263 poultry birds at two villages in Nanded, 5,557 at two villages in Pune, 600 at a village in Solapur district, 1,244 at a village in Beed and 281 poultry were culled at a village in Raigad district, stated a release issued by the animal husbandry department.“We have decided to continue our surveillance in Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Yavatmal and Beed where bird flu has caused deaths in other birds such as crows, parrots, pond egrets, peacocks etc,” said the commissioner.The state government already empowered all district collectors for immediate implementation of a containment plan, if they suspect deaths are due to bird flu. It, however, has not banned the supply and sale of poultry birds in the state except the one-km area of the poultry farms where bird flu was confirmed. According to the containment plan prepared by the Central government, the local administration will have to cull poultry birds within a one-km radius of that particular poultry farm where bird deaths were found due to avian influenza or bird flu. A surveillance zone within a periphery of 10km will have to be created, which means no birds will be allowed to sell or purchase in that area. The particular village, where that poultry farm is situated, will have to be declared as a prohibited area, which means no one can enter inside and no one can come out. A medical team has to be set up for the examination of local people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-outbreak-836-more-birds-dead-over-25-000-poultry-birds-culled-across-maharashtra-101610906465626.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP leaders want ban on Tandav web series||State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have accused the latest web series Tandav of hurting the sentiments of Hindus, and want it to be banned. They have filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police, saying that this is not going to be tolerated. They have urged the ministry of information and broadcasting to set up a regulating authority to govern all the over-the-top (OTT) platforms.BJP leader Ram Kadam said that he has filed a complaint with the Mumbai Police against the web series. “Filed complaint against Tandav Web Series at Ghatkopar police station. Police has assured quick investigation, FIR under Sec 295A of IPC, Section 67A of IT Act & Atrocities Act. Producer, Director, Writer, Actors & Amazon to be summoned soon,” Kadam said on Twitter.Kadam also said that he has decided to write a letter to Union minister Prakash Javadekar regarding this issue and will request to bring all OTT platforms under censorship.BJP member of Parliament (MP) Manoj Kotak, in a letter to information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar on January 16, urged him to immediately ban the Tandav web series and also constitute a regulatory authority to govern the content on OTT platforms.“It seems that the makers of Tandav have deliberately mocked Hindu gods and disrespected Hindus religious sentiments,” the letter states.Kotak said that the programmes telecast on OTT platforms are full of sex, violence, drugs, abuse, hate and vulgarity. “I urge the Ministry of I&B to immediately constitute a regulatory authority on OTT platform, and in the meantime ban the controversial web series Tandav,” it further adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-leaders-want-ban-on-tandav-web-series-101610906224883.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Acting in golden hours, Mumbai cyber police saved ₹15 crore from criminals in 2020||Promptly responding in the first two hours, called the golden hours, after the occurrence of any cyber fraud, the Mumbai Police’s cyber wing prevented around ₹15 crore from being siphoned off by cybercriminals in 2020. Police managed to save the money as the victims approached the police timely with all banking details.According to an officer of the cyber wing, city cyber police has strengthened and enhanced their cyber fraud money prevention mechanism, under the guidance of joint commissioner of police (crime) Milind Bharambhe, wherein victims’ money can be saved before fraudsters can withdraw it or misuse it.“The enhanced mechanism ensures timely contacting banks concerned and tracing the disputed money and freezing it right there. As a result of this, last year the cyber police managed to prevent around ₹15 crore of victims of cybercrimes who approached us,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber).These matters range from email phishing, online job frauds, online classified frauds, KYC update frauds, online loan fraud, matrimonial frauds, other OTP frauds, etc. In many cases, the stopped money has been returned to the victims.“Like there is golden hour in road accidents, for cybercrimes or online frauds the first two hours are golden hours. The sooner the victims approach the police, the chances of saving or recovering the lost money becomes higher,” Karandikar added.Kurla resident Fahad Shaikh had received a fraud call for KYC update and had shared the OTPs with fraudsters in a hurry as he was attending a funeral. “Moments later, ₹8 lakh were transferred from my bank account by fraudsters. I immediately approached cyber police and they managed to trace the entire amount and froze the account in which it was transferred to, before the fraudsters could withdraw or misuse it. I had saved this money for my daughter’s marriage and the cyber police’s timely action saved it. I got all my money back. I am very grateful to them,” Shaikh said.Similarly, Sushil Sethia, a jeweller from Andheri, was made to click on a link by cyber fraudsters and all his banking details were compromised. “After I approached the cyber police, they immediately responded and my ₹92,000 were timely stopped and saved,” Sethia said.The police said that people approach them late, provide them with incomplete information, incomplete or wrong email ids or account details; because of this, important time is wasted.“When a cybercrime occurs, the victims are generally in shock and start making inquiries with friends and relatives to understand what exactly hit him/her and how to proceed further. The victims approache local police with a written application and the police tell them to get in touch with the bank and get the details about the disputed transactions and then a case gets registered. This whole process takes four to five days, but by that time, fraudsters withdraw the money from the account or use it,” said assistant commissioner of police (cyber) Nitin Jadhav.Whenever a cyber fraud is committed, multiple bank accounts and e-wallets are used. So the cyber police have to first trace the disputed money and then freeze the said account. The entire process requires constant follow up and a team of cyber police personnel do it on a regularly basis.Police sources said an internal system is devised by the department that generates a token or reference number of a fraud reported to cyber police and then the same is shared with the concerned bank or e-wallet service provider for freezing the disputed money. Once that’s done, the complainant is asked to approach the local police station and lodge a complaint for further legal pursuit of the matter, ACP Jadhav said.The police further added that fraudsters have become smart. They target individuals on weekends or holiday or in the night hours when banking channels are closed. “Therefore to make the mechanism more productive and effective, the city cyber police have also written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requesting them to issue directives to all the banks and e-wallet service providers to compulsorily make their nodal officers available 24×7 (for co-ordination with the police) so that the police’s timely intervention can save cyber fraud victim’s money. Non availability of bank’s nodal officer makes it a tough task for the police,” said a police source.“We urge citizens to understand the importance of golden hours and report cybercrimes to police within the first two hours so that the suspicious transactions can be stopped in the bank and the money can saved,” the ACP said.He further added that cyber police are prepared and well-equipped to take more such applications and save people’s money.Cyber expert advocate Vicky Shah also said, “Approaching police in the first two hours is very important. And if the RBI wants to curb cybercrime, then the present ‘settlement cycle’ must be delayed by at least 24 hours. Delayed settlement cycle will prevent misuse of disputed funds. Also, the Telecom Regulatory authority of India (TRAI) should make the process of issuance of mobile numbers more rigorous like the passport to prevent cybercrimes by 100% as mobile numbers are directly liked to bank accounts and is key to all KYC details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/acting-in-golden-hours-mumbai-cyber-police-saved-15-crore-from-criminals-in-2020-101610906105356.html

17-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Foreign national arrested with MD and charas worth ₹25 lakh||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has arrested a foreign national as part of its drive against the drug supply chain in the city. On Saturday, NCB officers arrested a Nigerian national, Paul Chigbata Onuoroh, from Navi Mumbai after a half-kilometre chase and seized 475 grams of mephedrone and 38 grams of charas worth ₹25 lakh from his possession. This is the second arrest of foreign nationals involved in the drugs supply chain, in two days.Onuoroh is illegally staying in India and is allegedly a big supplier of drugs like cocaine, MD and charas. He recently came out from jail after spending two years sentence in a drug case.The agency claims that the accused, Onuoroh is a part of a drug distribution racket which supplies cocaine, charas and mephedrone in the city and outskirts. He came to Mumbai four years ago on a business visa for garment business, but he continued to live in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai even after his visa expired. Two years ago, NCB arrested him for allegedly supplying cocaine and he recently came out from jail after serving a two-year sentence, said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede.According to NCB officers, Onuoroh pushed the officer who was approaching him and tried to run away, but another team chased him for almost half kilometre and nabbed him. “During search, we found 475 grams of Mephedrone and 38 grams of charas worth ₹25 lakh from his possession. During further search at his residence, we also recovered a small quantity of drugs. He was arrested under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,” said an officer. The accused was produced in the court on Sunday and has been remanded in custody till January 21.Earlier on Friday, NCB arrested a Nigerian national from outside a five-star hotel in Juhu and allegedly recovered 10 to 12 cocaine-filled capsules from his mouth. The accused is currently in Sir JJ Hospital and his X-ray and CT scan reports suggested that he was allegedly carrying more drugs. Doctors are trying to eject the drug-filled capsules from his body through purging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiforeign-national-arrested-with-md-and-charas-worth-25-lakh-101610905685362.html
17-01-2021||Pune||Pandemic slowdown “concerns” ruling BJP with polls scheduled early next year||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is in power in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is staring at poll-bound difficulties with elections fast approaching early next year. Most of the planned development work was hampered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Recently, mayor Murlidhar Mohol chaired a meeting of all department heads to take a review of the development works and plan an inauguration according to projects. The civic polls are scheduled during the month of February next year with all political parties including the BJP, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena beginning preparations and gathering information of development work which was carried out in the last four years by the elected representatives of respective organisations. A ruling party with 98 seats in the PMC, the BJP has started collecting information of development works in the last four years in PMC so that they can mention the completed work in the party’s manifesto. It will also help BJP corporators to make ward wise report cards of the development work. The code of conduct may be imposed in December 2021. So, there are roughly 10 months for preparation. Due to Covid-19, the PMC has taken decisions to cut down on the budget as per state government directives. So, there will be only a 40 per cent budget available to corporators in their ward development funds. In the last four years, Bhama-Askhed water project and Atal Bihari Vajpayee medical college are two major city level projects on which BJP can take political advantage in the upcoming civic polls. The Bhama-Askhed project has already been completed and inaugurated by BJP leaders. Now, the BJP is pursuing the Atal Bihari Vajpayee medical college to start in the coming days. In the meeting with the mayor, all head of departments reported the progress, completion of projects, the status of works, starting new development work and projects to Mohol. Members of private agencies were present in the meeting to note information related to development. Mohol said, “The purpose of the meeting was to take a review of the development work and projects in the BJP tenure, we are going to contest civic polls next year. So, we are gathering progress of works which we can tell people in the civic polls. The Bhama-Askhed water project, improving of public transport by adding new buses, the opening of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee medical college, the progress on the Chandani chowk project, metro project, 24x7 water projects are some of the achievements.” He added, “Covid-19 affected development work. Most of the project and development work was on halt during the pandemic. This year’s budget is also going to be hit due to the financial crunch. Overall, two years – the Covid-19 year which was 2020 and the post-Covid year which is 2021 has been shattered in terms of the development of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pandemic-slowdown-concerns-ruling-bjp-with-polls-scheduled-early-next-year-101610905264503.html
17-01-2021||Pune||Two samples from Pune found positive for bird flu, central team to visit district||Two samples of poultry birds from Pune district were found positive for the bird flu virus of the 11 bird samples that were sent to the Bhopal laboratory. The district administration still awaits reports of 22 bird samples that were sent to the national lab and has now declared two villages in Mulshi and Daund infected zones and culled over 5,500 poultry birds. A central team will now be visiting the district on Monday to check the arrangements put in place to contain the spread of the virus. The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal (NIHSAD) has confirmed the presence of H5N1, more commonly called as bird flu virus or the Avian influenza. It is reported that migratory birds that fly from the northern hemisphere infect poultry or domestic birds through droppings when they fly to the southern hemisphere during harsh winters. According to the World Health organization (WHO), there have been only 608 confirmed human cases of avian influenza since 2003-2012. Although birds to human transmission is very rare, the district administration in Pune has culled over 5,500 poultry birds from farms within one kilometre radius where the infected birds were found. Dr Shitalkumar Mukane, district deputy commissioner animal husbandry said, “We have got the test reports for all the samples that we sent before 14th December of which two tested positive. Till date we had sent about 33 bird samples to NIHSAD. We have culled 5,139 birds from Mulshi and 418 from Daund where positive cases were reported. These birds were from the farms reported within the one kilometre area from where the infected birds were found. The central team will now visit the rural areas in Pune to check if all proper arrangements are in place to prevent the spread.” The samples that were sent consisted of bats, wild pigeons, crows and various backyard birds. Some of the symptoms displayed by the birds include diarrhoea, dullness and depression. Pune zilla parishad chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “Our team will also try to catch all the possible wild birds that could be trapped to prevent the spread. I am on spot at various rural locations to ensure that all the containment zone measures are in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/two-samples-from-pune-found-positive-for-bird-flu-central-team-to-visit-district-101610905264921.html

We also want to examine students graduating from our schools and see what their thoughts are on caste, creed, religion, gender biases, corruption, honest governance and environmental issues. After working on foundation, the question is on how to work on the mindset of students,” the education minister said.While referring to the issue of students dropping out, Sisodia said, “Struggling children who leave the system to pick up jobs outside is where we need to figure out how skill training can come into play, and how we can provide support to them.”The week-long conference saw 22 education experts from India and other countries including the United Kingdom, USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Singapore, and Canada. The final day of the conference also saw Andhra Pradesh education minister Audimulapu Suresh highlighting reforms initiated by their government and extending an invitation to the Delhi education team to visit Andhra Pradesh.“In Andhra Pradesh, in the past 19 months, we allocated 16%-18% out of our total budget to the education department to show our commitment,” Suresh said, while talking about the key reforms in the southern state, including bilingual textbooks from classes 1-6, improved monitoring and regulatory mechanisms, and incentivisation of SMC participation through ‘parent committees’.Sisodia said, “Education ministers from all states should work together to create better systems for India. I would like to learn from Andhra Pradesh on how regulation and autonomy manifest on the ground through state-level legislation, especially the reformed structure of Anganwadi workers.”Some of the key takeaways across panel discussions during the week included the link between political will and educational reforms, building inclusive administrative tools to support teacher training, and moving away from ‘heavy content-based syllabi’ to a reduced interactive curriculum.During the course of the conference, setting up cadre of specialist teachers, collaborative professional development, shared lesson-planning, and providing teachers with agency and autonomy along with increased interaction with parents were suggested as key measures for improvement of school education and teacher training.“Our focus will now be on further bridging the gap between SMCs and parents by increasing parent participation. The ownership parents have showcased in the past few years has been a positive change for us,” Sisodia said.The Directorate of Education officials also presented their findings on the low class 9 pass percentage. “Though there was progressive decline in the pass percentage (55.96%) from 2013-14 onwards, the results have been improving from 2016-17 and went up to 64.49% in 2019-2020,” the government said in a statement.Rajesh Prasad, principal secretary (education), said the national capital was “a fertile ground” to implement the National Education Policy 2020. “Lots of aspects from NEP are already covered in Delhi’s education reforms. It is now time to focus on interactive teaching rather than carrying on examination-oriented teaching and rote-learning to transform the educational landscape of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-to-work-on-enhance-teacher-training-and-cutting-dropout-rates-sisodia-101610905025860.html

It is even better now that the vaccine has arrived. However, I still urge people to continue wearing masks and take all necessary precautions against Covid-19,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press conference on Sunday.The city, on Sunday, also recorded a positivity rate of 0.36% which, health officials said, is also the lowest so far. Sunday’s health bulletin recorded 67,463 tests, of which 40,102 were conducted using the RT-PCR method believed to be more accurate in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The other tests were done through rapid antigen kits, which dish out quicker results, but are known to be far less accurate than RT-PCR tests.So far, 632,429 people in Delhi have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since the first case was recorded on March 2. Of these, 10,746 have died.On Saturday, 4,319 people in Delhi were vaccinated across 81 centres in the city, as India began the world’s largest Covid-19 immunisation programme. As many as 8,100 healthcare workers – the top priority group for vaccination – were supposed to take the vaccination on the first day in Delhi. The drive in the city will resume on Monday.“It is a good thing that the vaccine has arrived at a time when Delhi is witnessing a low number of cases. However, people must not let their guards down at this juncture, even after vaccination which acts as an additional shield against potential infection but does not negate all chances. People must continue to wear masks, adhere to social distancing norms and take other precautions,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/246-new-covid-19-cases-in-capital-positivity-rate-hits-another-low-101610905025418.html
17-01-2021||Other||‘No Car Sunday’ organised in Connaught Place||New Delhi: Scores of Delhiites, including youngsters, gathered in Connaught Place on Sunday morning, cycling and walking, with a message for people to ditch their private vehicles for a day. The campaign called, ‘No Car Sunday’, which was first started by a group of teenage environment activists as a local initiative to discourage neighbours from using their cars for one day of the week to help reduce vehicular emissions in the national capital, has now become a multi-city campaign that was organised on Sunday in Mumbai, Bangalore and Lucknow. The initiative is now being backed by Fridays for Future (India chapter), Let Me Breathe, Vrikshit Foundation, My Right to Breathe and Extinction Rebellion (India). Sixteen-year-old Aditya Dubey, who was among the youngsters who started this campaign, said that this was initiated to encourage public participation to send out the message that every citizen of the country can contribute to making the environment cleaner for the coming generations. “I am an asthmatic myself and I know how difficult it is hundreds like me in Delhi to just exercise our basic right to breathe. Things only get worse for us during the winters. We all know the contribution that vehicular emissions make to the rising pollution in the country and our small contribution can go a long way in reducing that,” said Dubey. Many youngsters like Dubey came out to the streets of Delhi with the same message, coaxing the adults to start using more sustainable modes of transportations such as cycles, public transportation or walking as much as possible. Participants stood with posters reading, “clean air everyday’, ‘this is my space to walk’, and ‘reclaiming my right to breathe’. The participants cycled and used the Yulu bikes from central Delhi’s Shivaji Stadium metro station as a symbolic gesture to reclaim the streets for cyclists and walkers. The Delhi government has also introduced a similar concept in 2015, calling it ‘car free day’ where in some roads of the city private vehicles were not allowed to ply for selected days. The concept, however, was not sustained. Bhavreen Kandhari, environmental activist, who is also backing this campaign, said that this initiative by children and young adults is a wake-up call for adults to start doing their bit for the environment. “We are planning to increase the ambit of this campaign and want that the government should also take interest and get involved in this initiative that has been taken up by children of this city. Today (Sunday) when we took the campaign to the streets we saw that there was a great appreciation and acceptance to this concept,” Kandhari said. She also said that while the ‘No Car Sunday’ was being encouraged because it is easier for people to avoid using the vehicles on a weekend, people can choose any convenient day when they would not take their cars out. “We are privileged and many in the city own multiple cars, but there are the less privileged ones who are the direct victims of air pollution that is aggravated by our vehicular emissions. We need to do this for them, and for all of us,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-car-sunday-organised-in-connaught-place-101610905024531.html

There is too much corruption in the BJP.”The AAP’s MLA Atishi said, “Aarti Yadav, along with former councillor from the same ward, Anil Yadav, have joined the AAP. We welcome them. Several leaders of the BJP are fed up with the corruption of the BJP-ruled MCDs. To contribute towards development-centric politics, they are joining the AAP.”The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless”.BJP-Delhi spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. Her (Yadav’s) switching allegiance at regular intervals reflects that she is not interested in public service but she is on a lookout for some sort of political power. Moreover, such political switching of loyalty ahead of municipal elections by power seekers is nothing new. The BJP is not worried about this.” Delhi will go to the municipal polls in 2022. While the AAP is in charge of the city government, the BJP rules all three municipal corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-mcd-councillor-aarti-yadav-joins-aap-101610904965111.html
17-01-2021||Other||Schools to open classes, labs with masks, sanitisers; private schools to reopen later||New Delhi: From masks, sanitisers, and physical distancing markers to thermal scanners and sensor taps, schools in the national capital have taken several measures to ensure that the return of class 10 and 12 students to the campus after 10 months is smooth and safe. Schools in the national capital had been closed since March last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While most government schools in the capital are reopening for board students on Monday, several private schools said they would reopen later once the online pre-board exams are over and parental consent for return of students has been acquired.Madhulika Sen, education advisor at Tagore International School, said, “The notice was issued with only five days in hand. Our online pre-board exams are currently underway and will only be completed by next week. So we will use this time to implement all protocols, speak to parents for their consent before reopening in February. The syllabus has already been covered and we will have time for revision and practicals. Students are likely to be called three days a week initially with no more than 15 students per room which is one-third of the original capacity of our classrooms.”Last week, the Delhi government allowed all public and private schools in the national capital to call students of classes 10 and 12 back to the campus from January 18 for pre-board preparations and practical work. The schools have been asked only to call students with the consent of the parents and follow all the Covid-19 precautions.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday held a review meeting with officials from the education department on the matter. “Everyone is excited and a little nervous at having Class 10 and 12 students back in schools from tomorrow for practical/counselling. All preparations – sanitizers, masks, and social distancing measures – are in place,” he tweeted.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School which has over 300 students appearing for class 10 and 12 boards this year, said, “We will reopen sometime later this week as are waiting for parental consent slips to form the batches. Thermal scanners and oximeters are present in the school along with sanitisers and emergency masks for those students who need it. Sanitising machines have also been installed on every floor. Class hours have been reduced from six hours to two hours and initially, we will only be calling 50 students to school from both classes to ensure parents and students both feel comfortable. Only 10 students will be allowed per laboratory with at least three staff members to ensure supervision.”Teachers and principals in the national capital have been concerned about practical classes and offline doubt-clearing sessions for students since the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced dates for class 10 and 12 board exams last month. Board practical exams will begin from March 1 and written exams will be conducted between May 3 and June 10.BP Dhyani, principal of a Delhi government school in Trilokpuri, said they are all set to reopen Monday with masks, sanitisers, and physical distancing markers in place. “Through existing WhatsApp groups, we had asked children to bring a signed copy of consent form to school on Monday. We have also made arrangements to keep printed copies of the form ready in case any parent wants to sign it tomorrow after coming to school. The students who could not arrange school uniforms this year will be allowed to come in their home clothes. The idea is to facilitate their learning for upcoming board exams. With teachers deployed for Covid-19 duty, that too might be a challenge,” he said.Schools will also hold orientation programmes and put up posters and notices detailing the Covid-19 guidelines. “We will hold orientation sessions reminding students of little things like opening doors using elbows, keeping their masks on at all times and carrying pocket sanitisers. Parents have also been asked to pick and drop their children as per the specified schedule. Teachers have also designed and put up posters on Covid-19 safety guidelines as well. We have installed web-cams in our classrooms to ensure that classes can be live-streamed for those who choose not to attend offline classes,” said Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, which has over 400 students appearing for their class 10 and 12 boards this year.Geeta Gangwani, principal of Bal Bharati School in Rohini, which will reopen later this month once their pre-board examinations are over, said they will have daily orientation for students. “We have also prepared a presentation for parents which focuses on how children should behave before entering school, while being in school, and after they leave school. Exhaustive training of support staff will also be undertaken in the coming week,” she said.The school has installed sanitisers, fogging machines, thermal scanners, and disinfectants which will be sprayed in-between batches. “The students will be here only for three hours and we will have to disinfect the area before the other batch comes in. We have also installed taps that can be operated by feet in washrooms. Physical distancing markers have been put up between classrooms and washrooms. Teachers will ensure that children are not gathering anywhere, including washrooms and will be checking the queues in the corridors before excusing the child,” she said.Richa Sharma, principal of The Sanskriti School, which is reopening Tuesday, said they will have seven students per laboratory, which has a capacity of 30 students. The school also sent consent forms to parents of those students who were being called to school as per their roster. “Each batch will have a teacher and attendant to ensure that physical distancing is followed at all times. A task force has also been formed which is supervising entry-exit protocols, cleaning, managing consent forms among other things.”Trisha Kakkar, a class 12 student at The Indian School, said, “My parents have allowed me to return to school and I am really excited about it. Along with practical lessons, we will be able to see our teachers and interact with them one last time as this is our last year of school. Though we won’t be able to do much because of Covid-19 protocols, returning to school will have a positive impact on us and will only motivate us to study harder.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/schools-to-open-classes-labs-with-masks-sanitisers-private-schools-to-reopen-later-101610904964532.html

The move comes months after the DDA and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has been roped in by the DDA to prepare the MPD-2041, held a two-month-long public consultation last year.A senior DDA official said that this is being done to ensure maximum participation from the public before the draft of MPD-2041 is prepared. “People can give their suggestions and share their ideas about what kind of the city they want Delhi to be. The idea behind this exercise is to get maximum participation,” said the official.DDA on January 6 also tweeted along with a link of the form for suggestions from the public, “Be a part of RE-INVENTING DELHI! DDA is preparing Delhi’s next Master Plan for 2041. Being a resident of Delhi, click on the link below & aid in creating a vision for your city that will steer the next master plan. 5 statements! 10 minutes of your time!”In the form, DDA has asked people about the issues they face currently which they want to be addressed in the next vision document. The land-owning agency has also asked people to list five important things they must address to ensure planned and sustainable development of the city. DDA officials say that no deadline has been set for the exercise so far.From rampant commercialisation due to mixed land use to poor implementation of MPD-2021 to frequent amendments in the plan to regularise “illegal” developments, Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) say that the next master plan should take into account “ground realities” and provide solutions to local problems.In the last 14 years, when mixed land use was allowed in Delhi, RWAs say it has led to commercialisation of residential areas.Rajiv Kakria, convener, Save Our City campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-I, said, “It has destroyed the residential character of neighbourhoods. Today, safety and security has become our utmost concern due to rampant commercialisation of residential areas. We don’t know who is entering our areas. It has destroyed the social fabric. Our top priority is that residential, industrial and commercial areas should have dedicated space. Safety and security of residential areas should be maintained.”BS Vohra, president of East Delhi RWA joint front, said, “Apart from mixed land use, the new Master Plan should also focus on making the city roads more pedestrian friendly. There is an urgent need to find a solution to the problem of traffic congestion.”While RWAs want the problem of rampant commercialisation to be addressed, traders’ associations in the capital want planned commercial spaces and a permanent solution to the problem of sealing. Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said, “Development of commercial space has not kept pace with the city’s growth. DDA should assess the requirement for commercial space and plan accordingly. There is a need to provide planned commercial spaces in the city and also protect present businesses from sealing and demolition action.”NGOs and experts working for the welfare of under-privileged people in turn want the DDA to reach out to these people also so that they can have a say in the plan.Shalaka, coordinator of ‘Main Bhi Dilli’ campaign (a collective of individuals and organisations working on creating awareness about the MPD-2041), and member of Indo-Global Social Service Society (IGSSS), a voluntary organisation, said, “It is good that the DDA is reaching out to people. But there is a need to organise mass outreach programme so that people living in unauthorised colonies and slum clusters also get a chance to give their inputs. They will not be able to fill-up the form online.”While the DDA is asking people to give a broad vision for the city, citizens want an issue-based discussion on various aspects of MPD-2041.Atul Goyal, president of URJA, a collective of RWAs in the city, said, “There are several components of MPD which require detailed discussion. The DDA should have issue-based discussion with people on mixed land use, transportation, redevelopment, development of unauthorised colonies impact on plotted developments. There should be a provision to audit. We should know what all has been achieved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-asks-residents-for-input-on-delhi-s-master-plan-2041-101610904906017.html

Anaphylaxis causes skin rash, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and shock, if not treated promptly. The hospital had been administering Covaxin that is developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. According to doctors at AIIMS, the security guard had complained of uneasiness, palpitation, headache, and developed rash after 10-15 minutes of having been given a shot. He was moved to the icu, and remained under observation of specialists for a day before being discharged on Sunday evening. In all, Delhi reported 51 minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection, or fever on day one of the Covid-19 vaccination drive. A senior NDMC official, who asked not to be named, had said that two cases of mild AEFI (adverse effects following immunisation) symptoms were reported at Charak Palika Hospital. Two of the hospital’s health care workers who took the Covid-19 vaccine in the afternoon, had reported slight tightness in the chest during the observation period. “They were immediately attended to by the AEFI team and kept under observation. They felt normal within half-an-hour and were discharged. There is nothing to be worried about AEFI cases, as such symptoms are normal to occur after any vaccination,” the official had said. As per the Covid-19 vaccination operational guidelines, a recipient of the vaccine would need to be kept under observation in a separate waiting area at the vaccination site for at least 30 minutes, to monitor their health condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aiims-guard-who-showed-severe-allergic-reaction-to-vaccine-released-from-hospital-101610904904995.html

Those who do not turn up at vaccine centres in the first phase despite being registered will get another slot. However, we are yet to decide whether that window for healthcare workers should be accommodated before vaccination starts for frontline workers or after that,” said a senior official in the Delhi government who did not wish to be identified.The official, who asked not to be named, said a health care worker’s name would be removed from the priority list, if they miss the second slot.With the vaccination drive launched on Saturday, around 8,100 healthcare workers in Delhi were slotted for the first day of the jabs. However, of these, just 4,319 (around 53%) turned up at the 81 vaccine centres in the Capital. Around 240,000 healthcare workers in Delhi have been registered for the first phase of the drive, which will resume from Monday.“The turnout figure in Delhi for the first day is at par with the rest of India. But the number is likely to increase in the days to come. The government is making its best efforts to ensure that,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said in a press conference on Sunday.According to data compiled from states by HT, 200,297 people across the country were vaccinated on Saturday, against an estimated 300,000 who were slated to receive their first dose of either the Covishield or Covaxin jab.After healthcare workers, the vaccine will be given to front line workers, which include police officers, fire officials, home guards, sanitation employees, school teachers and employees of several agencies and departments that were engaged in Covid-19 management. Delhi has an estimated 600,000 front line workers, and the registration process for this category is underway.The government will this week intensify its awareness drive to allay concerns regarding vaccination, said a second senior government official. “Starting Sunday, all registered vaccine candidates will get a call from the district surveillance teams. The caller will try to engage with the candidate over potential risks, concerns and try to allay fears, if any.”Currently, candidates receive text messages informing them of the date and time of the scheduled vaccination, as well as the location of the respective centre.The second official said the government has also asked agencies and departments to start conducting group-counselling for their staff – largely frontline workers — to ensure they are ready to receive the vaccine when their turn arrives.A senior doctor from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), who asked not to be named, said, “There are some who are extremely excited about the vaccination drive. However, some others would like to wait and see what happens, and some who prefer to avoid getting immunised at the moment. The fears especially revolve around potential adverse effects — both short and long-term.”On Saturday, Delhi recorded 51 instances of minor adverse reactions such as mild fever, rashes and swelling at the site of injection, while one recipient — an AIIMS staffer — suffered a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, after receiving a dose of Covaxin. The staffer was admitted to hospital on Saturday, and discharged on Sunday, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria confirmed.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College, said, “With time, more people will turn up. Efforts are being made on several fronts to ensure confidence building and reduce hesitancy. For counselling drives in the days to come, the government can also take help of people who have been vaccinated and engage them in group discussions with potential candidates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/health-care-workers-in-delhi-who-skip-vaccine-shot-to-be-allotted-another-slot-101610904904484.html

No disruption will be caused to official Republic Day celebrations or provocative speeches will be made. The national flag will be placed on all tractors,” farmer leaders said during the press conference.Farmer leaders said they will urge the Haryana and Delhi Police to cooperate. “There will be no threat to any national heritage sites, or to any other site. The vehicles in the parade will consist of tableaus and floats that will reflect the agricultural reality of different states in addition to showcasing historical regional and other movements. No political party flags will be allowed,” said farmer leader Darshan Pal.Meanwhile, a day after India kicked off its vaccination drive against Covid , farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders maintained that they would not leave the capital to go to their home states to get vaccinated before the three contentious farm laws were repealed.Though the first round of vaccines have been reserved for health care personnel followed by front line workers, the elderly – considered to be at risk – will be next in line to get the vaccines administered. This is crucial as a sizable number of farmers protesting at the national capital’s borders are above 50 years of age.On Sunday, Chamkaur Singh, 63 and his friend Dabinder Singh, 61, from Moga district of Punjab, were among the several at the protest site who said they will not return to their villages to get vaccinated unless the three new contentious farm laws were repealed.“We have heard many doctors say that Covid-19 existed earlier as well and affected people with less immunity. There are thousands of poor people living on the streets here, who have no means to wash their hands or wear masks. How are they managing? We believe the lockdown was just a ploy of the government to get the [farm] laws passed without any resistance,” said Chamkaur Singh, who hails from Dhudike village in Moga district, and is a member of Kirti Kisaan Union. Dabinder added, “We will get vaccinated only if we have the disease. Not otherwise.”Several others in the crowd added that they did not trust the government’s claims on the fatality rate of Covid-19 disease. Balpreet Singh, 28, a farmer from Marur village in Firozpur, said, “We have been here since day one and it has been impossible to maintain physical distancing. Yet, we are yet to encounter any Covid-19 cases in our group of 100-200 people. The fear of the disease is more fatal than the disease itself.”“What will we do with the vaccine if we lose our lands and homes eventually due to the farm laws? This fight will continue and we are now looking forward to the tractor march on Republic Day,” he said.Farmers also raised questions on the efficacy of the vaccines, as several leaders had not been vaccinated yet. Mer Singh, 55, a farmer from Panipat in Haryana, said, “The Prime Minister should step forward and take the vaccine and lead by example. It will help in dispelling rumours about the vaccines. We have read reports of people having reactions, even dying, after getting vaccinated. There is a strong feeling among farmers that this Covid-19 threat has been made bigger than it actually is just to counter resistance.”However, not all protesters were against taking the Covid shots. Kuldeep Kaur, 68, a farmer from Chamkaur Sahib in Rupnagar district, said, “Though we don’t have Covid-19 cases in our village, I will get vaccinated when I return to Punjab and the vaccine is made available to us. I will not get vaccinated here though.”Health care workers volunteering at the spot said they had no plans to counsel farmers on the need for vaccines. Virendra Singh, a neurotherapist volunteering at the medical camp set up by United Sikhs NGO at Singhu border, said, “It is too early to counsel the farmers. Let the health care workers get vaccinated first. Right now, we have very few volunteers focusing on the immediate needs of farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-declare-tractor-parade-on-outer-ring-rd-on-r-day-maintain-they-won-t-get-vaccinated-till-farm-laws-are-repealed-101610904844567.html

However, Singh’s family members said that all the outstanding power dues in his name had been cleared in 2016 itself. Singh had won the Khurja seat (Jewar was then part of it) as Socialist Party candidate in the assembly elections in 1957. According to Manjit Thakur, grandson of the former MLA, Singh had died on October 18, 2015. The family lives at Dayanatpur village in Jewar. Thakur, who is also a local BJP leader, said that he wrote a letter in this regard to the UP energy minister Srikant Sharma. “After my grandfather’s death, who was also a freedom fighter, I went to the PVVNL office on July 9, 2016, and cleared all outstanding dues in his name. After that, we applied for a fresh power connection in the name of my mother Veena Devi, which we got within a week. We’ve been paying our electricity bills regularly. But our family gets disturbed now as the discom has issued us the notice to clear the dues in my grandfather’s name,” Thakur said. When asked, state energy minister Sharma said that he has asked the PVVNL officials to look into the matter immediately. “I’ve seen the final disconnection certificate issued by PVVNL and asked the discom officials to resolve this issue immediately. Such acts tarnish the image of a leader, who was considered as a high-principled leader in the area,” said Sharma. Virendra Nath Singh, Noida divisional chief engineer of PVVNL, said that he has got information about the issue on Sunday. “I feel extremely sorry for this error, which is apparently committed by the billing agency outsourced by us. We are looking into the matter and it will be sorted out soon. The guilty officials will have to send a letter of apology to the former MLA’s family,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-years-after-death-discom-serves-electricity-bill-of-86-000-to-former-mla-101610904544464.html
17-01-2021||Other||Noida’s air quality improves to ‘very poor’||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida improved to ‘very poor’ on Sunday after being under ‘severe’ levels for the past three days. Weather experts said that better ventilation conditions on Sunday helped pull the air quality out of ‘severe’ zone. The three cities, however, remained the most polluted in the country. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Greater Noida was 384 (‘very poor’) on Sunday against 438 a day earlier – both highest in the country on their respective days. Noida’s AQI on Sunday was 383 against 434 on Saturday, while Ghaziabad recoded an AQI of 368 against 423 a day earlier – third worst in the country. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. “The changing wind directions and slightly better speed has improved the ventilation conditions in the region. The particle pollutants could be dispersed, thereby improving the air quality. The weather conditions are likely to improve over the next two days, so the air quality may further improve,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Sunday, the wind direction changed from icy cold north-westerly to mostly easterly that led to lifting the fog, thereby blocking the sunlight and dropping the daytime mercury and cold day like conditions, Srivastava said. According to IMD, the minimum temperature dipped for Noida, with Sunday seeing a minimum and maximum temperatures of 6.1 degrees Celsius and 15.1 degrees Celsius, against 7.8 degrees and 18.3 degrees a day earlier. The major pollutant or PM2.5 in the region ventilated to become three times the safety standards against being eight times a day earlier. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Sunday was 229.44 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) against 351.22 µg/m3 on Saturday. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 232.86 µg/m3 against 341.64 µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 220.11 µg/m3 against 404.06 µg/m3 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the air quality is likely to stay in the ‘very poor’ category for the next two days. “Surface winds are moderate and East Northeasterly. The better wind speed has helped improve dispersion. The air quality is likely to stay in the same very poor category for the next two days. Further improvement is expected on January 20 in the lower end of the very poor to poor category,” Safar said in a statement on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noidas-air-quality-improves-to-very-poor-101610904544954.html

17-01-2021||Noida||Species diversity rises yet population drops at Okhla Bird Sanctuary||Following the trend set last year, the bird population at Noida’s only eco-sensitive zone, the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, dropped this year. On a positive note, the diversity of species had increased to the highest in three years. The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021 was conducted by the Wetlands International South Asia and the divisional forest department Gautam Budh Nagar. Fifteen volunteers and forest department officials counted 8,068 birds of total 73 species of water birds, of which 27 were resident and local migratory species and 46 migratory species. Last year’s AWC-2020 saw only 62 species – 28 residents and 34 migratory species -- however the numbers were higher at 8,776 birds as compared to January 2021. The census also included 8 species of IUCN Red-listed threaten birds – Black-headed Ibis (Indian resident), Black-tailed Godwit (Winter migratory from Central Asia), Common Pochard (Winter migratory from Central Asia), Painted Stork (Indian resident species), Greater Spotted Eagle (Winter migratory migrates from Central Asia), Oriental Darter (Resident), River Lapwing (Resident), Ferruginous Duck (Winter migratory from Central Asia). According to the ecologists, the drop in population numbers was primarily owning to poor habitat health. “Due to global climate change impact like delayed winter, slow migration and fewer winter migratory water birds has been recorded almost everywhere in northern India. Okhla Bird Sanctuary on Yamuna, one of the 467 important birding area (IBA) Sites in India used to be rich habitat for birdlife diversity but degrading due to urban development, biotic pressure and much disturbance losing year by year species diversity and population,” said TK Roy, ecologist and conservationist, AWC. He added that OBS is among only two IBA in Delhi-NCR, the other being Sultanpur National Park in Haryana. Pointing out some interesting and among uncommon sightings, Roy named -- Common Shelduck ( total five spotted, migrates from Central Asia), Mallard ( three spotted, migrates from Central Asia) and Great Crested Grebe ( seven spotted, migrates from Central and East Asia). Meanwhile, the forest department stated that the census was held with the protocols of bird flu – like wearing protective gears, etc. “Since there had been a bird flu alerts, so there were some protocols at place like wearing masks and gloves. However, we still went ahead with the census as it would help us take a stock of ground reality since the birds are indicator of the habitat health. We are committed to develop better habitat and manage our wetlands so that the population and species diversity increases,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. According to the experts, water birds are one of the key indicators of wetlands health that provides feeding, resting, roosting, and foraging habitats for these species. The migratory birds start arriving in the region by October from far Central Asia, North Asia including Russia and Siberia, while their strength reaches its peak by December. Their departure begins by March and by mid-April they are all back to their breeding grounds in central Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/species-diversity-rises-yet-population-drops-at-okhla-bird-sanctuary-101610904484418.html

After that, the drive will take place bi-weekly -- likely on Mondays and Fridays, according to health officials.Health care workers (HCWs) will remain the focus of the vaccination drive and districts have been told to prepare their list of beneficiaries and vaccination centres.“The first round of vaccination was successful (on Saturday). In all, 22,643 people were vaccinated (of the 31700 they had targeted, which is a 71% turnout) and we used both vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin in the state. The next round of vaccination will be held on January 22 and thereafter the vaccination will take place for two days in week. The list of beneficiaries is being prepared with the help of the Co-WIN portal,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). The Centre on Sunday had advised states to keep the vaccination sessions four days in a week so as to avoid disruption of health services. Depending on their cohort, resources and staff, the states have created their weekly schedule ranging from six to two days a weekDuring the on-going phase 1 of vaccinations, over 900,000 HCWs are expected to be vaccinated over several weeks in the state. Those who were vaccinated with Covishield on Saturday are expected to get their second booster shot on February 15. Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad district officials said they will further fine tune their ground protocols for the second round of vaccinations. The districts were told to prioritise vaccinating HCWs over 40 years of age.On Saturday, the Ghaziabad district vaccinated 379 of 400 listed HCWs in four centres, while Gautam Budh Nagar vaccinated 393 of 600 in six centres. In terms of turnout, the Ghaziabad district stood third after Siddharth Nagar and Baghpat, while Gautam Budh Nagar was on 53rd spot among all 75 districts. On Saturday Hindustan Times reported how a centre in Dasna had to call beneficiaries up when they realised that people had not got their text message informing them of their shot, date, time and centre the previous day. Some beneficiaries in Ghaziabad were on leave and could not take their shot. “We have learnt our lessons from the first round. For the next, we will procure a list of beneficiaries from the centres and rule out people suffering from ailments and also those on leave, and include those who are willing to get vaccinated. So, this will help us get more coverage,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO).“We will also deploy a dedicated team for each centre that will contact beneficiaries over phone a day before the vaccination drive,” said Dr Gupta.Of the stock of 2,741 vials of Covishield vaccine, the district used 40 vials during the first round. A vial contains 10 doses. District officials said they will continue with routine immunizations --- polio, DPT, diphtheria, tetanus and BCG, among others -- on Wednesdays and Saturdays.Gautam Budh Nagar district administration said their drive on Saturday was smooth and they had nothing to improve.“We will likely increase the number of centres. The exact number of beneficiaries will be decided by Thursday,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate.Of the stock of 3,500 vials of Covishield vaccine, the district used 44 vials during the first round in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/next-vaccination-round-on-january-22-ghaziabad-chalks-procedures-for-increased-coverage-101610904424424.html

He has been managing the dedicated Covid-19 facility since April and on Saturday was vaccinated against the coronavirus disease. When asked about his experience after the vaccination, Gupta said that it was a regular vaccination lasting nothing more than a few seconds. “But indeed, it was a moment of pride to be among the first lot to be inoculated against the deadly virus that halted the growth across the globe for over nine months. None of our staff suffered nausea or dizziness after getting their shot,” he said. Chief medical superintendent (CMS) of Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) Dr DK Singh said that everybody should get the vaccine as responsible citizens. “Since the vaccine has been developed by seasoned scientists after sufficient trials and it is safe for use, I had no side effects. I am continuing work today as per my routine,” he said. Dr Pallavi Sharma, assistant professor in school of dental sciences in Sharda university, said that none of the health workers in her campus complained about vomiting tendency or fever, after getting the first dose of vaccine on Saturday. “To me, it was like other vaccines – some pain for a few seconds and nothing else.

Some of these will also be sent to the Singhu and Tikri borders protest sites. With this march, we have vowed to protect our soil. We also took out a tiranga yatra in which we stitched a 150-metre long tricolour,” Sanjeev Mathur, convener of the organisation, said while adding that about 15,000 volunteers joined the rally at UP Gate. “It is being said that only farmers from Punjab are part of the ongoing agitation, but this is not so. The fight is even for small and marginal farmers alike, as well as landless farmers. Even our leaders such as Dr BR Ambedkar would have supported farmers. So, members of our organisation decided that we should take out the awareness rally and support farmers at the UP Gate,” he added.Members of the Bhagat Singh Ambedkar Brigade also organised a rally.“Our organisation took out a rally to support farmers and we want them to emerge victorious. We feel that their talks with the government should continue and we also support their proposed tractor march on January 26,” said Shyam Kishor Yadav, founder member of the organisation.MAHILA KISAN DIVASMembers of the UP Gate protest site said they will observe Monday as Mahila Kisan Divas wherein hundreds of women farmers from different areas will join them. They added that the dais will be coordinated by women farmers on Monday. Besides, a kabaddi match has been scheduled on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway.“Women farmers will come to the protest site in large numbers for the Mahila Kisan Divas. Besides, a Kabaddi event is scheduled for Monday. The day will be observed to remember the contribution of women farmers,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of the UP Gate committee and a farmer leader from Uttarakhand. TRAFFIC AND SOUND CONTROL PANEL Thousands of farmers have been camping at the UP Gate since November 28 over their demand of repeal of the three new farm laws. Successive talks with the government have so far failed to break the deadlock. The gathering at the UP Gate has swelled further as tractor-trolleys and camps have been put up all across the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway, from UP Gate to Khoda Colony. The farmers have also come up with a traffic and sound control committee, which has 11 members who are all senior citizens. A special camp at the site has been erected for the committee members. “The idea behind this committee is to keep an eye on youngsters who play loud DJ music in their vehicles and perform stunts in tractors. We don’t allow them to play loud music at night, since it will trouble residents nearby (of Khoda Colony). We keep a 24-hour check on such instances and no loud music is allowed here after 10pm,” said Satnam Singh, a senior citizen from Lakhimpur Kheri.He added that a youngster got injured a couple of days ago while performing stunts with his tractor.“The boy got injured and his tractor saw major damages. It could have led to injuries to people in camps.

17-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers from Karnataka, Maharashtra join protestors at Haryana border||Groups of farmers from Karnataka and Maharashtra joined the ongoing agitation on the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Sunday. Farmers said that the growing numbers would help to strengthen the agitation ahead of January 26, when farmers plan to proceed towards Delhi. Farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, Maharashtra and other states have been campaigning at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district since December 13. Farmers have been protesting against the three new farm laws, which were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sanjay Madhav, state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that nearly 300 farmers from Karnataka and 250 from Maharashtra had reached the protest site on Sunday. He said that the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha was of the view that the government was not serious in its approach towards the ongoing talks. As such, the number of protesting farmers would continue to rise until the laws are rolled back, said Madhav. He added that women farmers had also joined the protest in large numbers ahead of the women farmers’ day celebrations scheduled for Monday. “Right now, there are more women farmers than men here. Women farmers are an equal part of the movement and we plan to celebrate their contributions tomorrow,” said Madhav. Women farmers at the site also said that they were not happy with the Supreme Court’s stance that women, children and elders should avoid protests. Sohni Singh Punia, a 58-year-old farmer from Sikar in Rajasthan, said that women were an integral part of the farmers’ agitation and will not back down until the three laws are rolled back. “People say that women should not protest. It’s unfair. No one can stop us from protesting, it’s our democratic right. We will sit here till the three laws are taken back,” said Punia. She said that women farmers from different states had joined the ongoing agitation to strengthen the movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-from-karnataka-maharashtra-join-protestors-at-haryana-border-101610904064434.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||HSVP prepares layout plan for transport hub in Sector 33||After a delay of almost two decades in setting up a transport nagar (hub) for parking and operation of commercial vehicles in the city, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has finally prepared the revised layout plan for setting up this facility in Sector 33. The authority had initially planned the project initially over 70 acres but due to litigation and encroachment of land, it has decided to develop this facility on around 35 acres of encumbrance-free land. A revised layout plan for the transport nagar has been prepared and it will be soon sent to the headquarters in Chandigarh for approval, said Jitender Yadav, HSVP, administrator. The authority on Friday held its first meeting with the leading transporters in the city and discussed the revised plan regarding development of this project. It has sought inputs from the operators to make the project more suited to their needs.“We discussed this project in detail and have already taken their inputs in the matter. We have also given them a week’s time to give final suggestions after which the proposal will be sent to Chandigarh for final approval,” said Yadav. HSVP officials said that revised layout plans for the transport nagar in Sector 33 and an auto market in Sector 10 have been prepared and they are seeking inputs from all the stakeholders. “Due to litigation, these projects were delayed. However, we have worked on removing the roadblocks. These projects will be developed over land which is free from litigation and encroachments,” said Yadav, adding that the auto market project will be taken up next month. Hukam Chand Sharma, president, Gurugram Transporters’ Welfare Association said that they held a meeting with HSVP officials and shared their views about the proposed project. “We have requested the authority to allot space at the earliest to transporters located inside the city. Otherwise, issues like congestion would not get resolved,” he said, adding that they have been waiting for this facility since 1996, when it was first conceived. In a memorandum submitted to the HSVP on Friday, the transporters’ association stated that there are four kinds of operators in the city — those who book retail goods, those who act as brokers for warehouses, those who are wholesale goods transporters, and large contract-based operators. The association said office and godown space should be made available for all of them in addition to spaces for spare parts shops, vehicle mechanics, petrol pumps and recreational activities for drivers and helpers. Vivek Kalia, estate officer-l, HSVP, said that after incorporating the inputs, the proposal will be sent to the headquarters for approval, which will also decide the rate and mode through which shops, warehouses and offices are to be alloted to the transporters. “We are confident that project would be executed in the next few months on the ground,” he said. Sharma said that there are around 100 large transport operators in the city and they should be accommodated on priority. “Most of the cities in Haryana have developed such facilities. It is heartening to see such a project come up in Gurugram finally,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-prepares-layout-plan-for-transport-hub-in-sector-33-101610904005433.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||Additional charges give MCG chance to avoid missteps in Manesar||As many as 22 officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) have been given additional charges in the newly formed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM), which provides them with a chance to avoid missteps and issues of the MCG.The MCM was formed on December 23, 2020, with MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh appointed its first commissioner. It will be responsible for all civic activities in 124.32 square kilometres of its jurisdiction.In over a decade since the MCG’s formation in 2008, issues of basic infrastructure, a multiplicity of agencies, lack of online services, non-inclusion of residents in development and lack of access to MCG offices have hampered smooth functioning of the agency.Officials said that setting up roads, drainage and water lines before urban expansion; establishing coordination among various public bodies; using an e-office mode of operating; integrating RWAs into localised projects; and setting up zonal offices are some of the key matters they want to incorporate in the MCM from its beginning.Besides Singh, the MCG’s additional municipal commissioner, deputy municipal commissioner, chief town planner, senior medical officer, and officials of the engineering, electrical, taxation and sanitation wings have been given additional charges.Urban expansionThe MCG was formed nearly a decade after Gurugram had already witnessed unprecedented urbanisation. Due to the absence of a municipal body and proper urban planning, the city’s civic amenities continue to remain heavily affected. Over the last 12 years, MCG has always been playing catch-up to Gurugram’s civic mess.Each time there is heavy rain, the city is inevitably waterlogged due to either absence of drainage lines or choked drains. As recently as 2019, underpasses in the city were inundated and had to be shut to the public, which compounded traffic issues.The newer areas of the city — sectors 58-115 — where over half a million people are estimated to be living, continue to be hampered by civic issues such as poor road connectivity and absence of streetlights. In some of the newer sectors, condominiums and societies are yet to get direct water or sewerage connections, and remain heavily dependent on private water tankers and septic tanks.Vinay Pratap Singh said that in areas falling under the MCM, the majority of urbanisation has occurred in areas bordering Gurugram. He said that there are many parts of the city where urbanisation is yet to take place, giving MCM officials an opportunity to properly lay utilities and above all, the time to do it properly.“Prior to leasing out land for housing or industrial projects in areas which are yet to be developed, we will ensure that utilities have been provided so that expansion is carried out around it and there is no shortage or absence of civic amenities,” said Singh.Coordination among agenciesOfficials said that although the MCM is set to become an independent civic body once officials lay the groundwork, the functioning would be streamlined so that both the MCG and MCM work together for large-scale projects that would cater to demand of both the cities.“In the initial period, both the MCG and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) were operating separately. However, we soon realised that our objectives and work were not only similar but also largely covered the same areas or overlapped. Hence, for multiple projects such as monsoon preparedness, cleaning of drains and setting up of cycle tracks, the MCG and GMDA now work together. The MCG and MCM will also have a similar arrangement,” said Singh.After its formation in 2017, the GMDA took over all the master roads and drains from the MCG. The MCG subsequently handled only arterial roads and drains. However, after a year of operations, the two bodies realised that their projects needed to be coordinated.For instance, if the arterial drains leading to a master drain or vice versa were in a bad condition, there was no outlet for stormwater or sewage to flow. Often, the MCG and GMDA officials would clear their respective lines only to find that the line ahead was choked, making the entire project redundant.So far, the GMDA has been handling the master roads and drains in Manesar, while the arterial works were taken care of by village panchayats.Online servicesIn one of the first announcements since being appointed the MCM commissioner, Singh said that the new civic body will operate as an e-office. Under an e-office, all files are digitised and approved and sanctioned via e-signatures. The GMDA is the only government authority in Gurugram which offers a complete array of services on the internet.Due to the entire record being digital, officials said that discrepancies, such as forged signatures, missing files or misappropriation of funds — all of which are a regular occurrence in the MCG — will be difficult to execute as it will leave a digital footprint.The MCG has been working on digitising its entire mode of operations since December 2018. However, barring its property tax wing, none of the other wings has been completely digitised so far.“E-office is the best way of operating as it has many benefits. Even if an official is not present at their designated office space, he/she can approve or sanction a project from any location through e-office. This mode of operating will not only expedite work but also bring transparency to the daily mode of operations,” said Singh.Including residents in local worksIt took the MCG officials nearly nine years to fully realise the benefits of incorporating residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) in their operations. Since 2017, of the 800 parks in the city, nearly 500 are being managed by local RWAs, with the rest by the MCG.“By decentralising the upkeep of parks, the MCG has been able to create a system where parks are managed at a micro-level rather than on a macro basis. This way, the standard of parks has improved significantly over the past three years across the city,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.If the RWAs fail to maintains the standards in the parks, the MCG reserves the power to take over the management. Further, the MCG also holds competitions and offers monetary incentives to the 10 best parks.Further, the MCG has also started open-air gyms at a few selected parks, where RWAs have volunteered to look after its upkeep as well. After the equipment at its first two open-air gyms — near Kanhai village and St Thomas Marg — were broken and items were stolen soon after their launch in February 2016, the MCG decided to seek the assistance of RWAs to make the venture successful.MCG officials said that they would be adopting similar strategies with RWAs in Manesar and incorporating them within the MCM from the start to increase surveillance and utility of localised projects.Zonal officesEven though the MCG has four zones, residents of Zone 3 — those living along Golf Course Road and nearby areas — had to visit the civic body’s main office in Sector 34, an industrial sector, located on the outskirts at a distance of 9 kilometres, to get their issues redressed for nearly 11 years.In July 2019, the MCG opened the Zone 3 office in Sector 42, at a distance of around a kilometre, to address both the distance issue and also deploy staff to address the residents’ concerns and expedite local projects.In Gurugram, there are two zonal offices at present for residents to get their issues addressed. Offices for zones 1 and 2 are at Civil Lines, while residents of Zone 4 have to reach out to officials at the Sector 34 office.Singh has already announced that zonal offices will be made in MCM to give better services to residents and the civic body will set up seven zones in Manesar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/additional-charges-give-mcg-chance-to-avoid-missteps-in-manesar-101610904006089.html

Although the complaint was lodged by the victim, Mohammad Sabbir, a resident of Baldev Nagar, in August last year, the case was filed on Saturday after initial investigation. The police said Sabbir, who saw a job posting on an online portal in August, last year for the position of a security guard in a multinational company, called on the phone number provided, said the police. According to the police, Sabbir was looking for a career abroad and had applied for a job in a multinational company in other countries in the past. He was interviewed over the phone and was asked to submit documents of educational qualifications, past experience and salary slips from his previous jobs. The victim said, within half-an-hour, he received another call from a person named Vijay Kumar, who allegedly posed as the head of a department of a multinational company in Dubai. The man said that he was presently in based in his home town in Panipat in Haryana. The suspect told the victim that since the profile being sought was that of a senior guard position, the portal would provide him with a relationship manager to take care of the hiring process, for which charges would be applicable. He further said that there were as many as four levels of services to choose from — starting from the basic level to the priority level, said the police. According to the police, the victim first paid ₹5,000 for the basic level as registration fee, and then proceeded to pay for all the subsequent levels, in instalments of ₹20,000. All the transactions were carried out within a week. Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that the victim transferred the amount in August last through his debit cards. “The suspect had promised that the amount will be refunded in his bank account after 24 hours of his placement. The executive had also said that they will only deduct 10% of the total amount,” he said. Goel added that after the amount was transferred, the victim did not receive any invoice for the same. “Vijay Kumar had told me that the invoice will be generated within 24 hours, but I did not receive any calls. I tried calling him repeatedly but he did not receive my calls. When I tried calling from a different number, he picked my call and asked for another day to send the invoice. I thought that the man was genuine, as he made himself sound convincing. Later, he blocked my numbers and accounts from all social media platforms.” Sabbir Singh. The suspect had promised to generate the interview ID within 48 hours but when the victim again sent an email, it bounced back and all numbers were found to be switched off. The victim then approached the police after he realised that he had been duped. A case under sections 420 (cheating) of the IPC and section 66 D of the IT Act was filed at the cyber police station after six months, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/security-guard-duped-of-80k-on-pretext-of-getting-a-job-101610904004911.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||Civic group writes to HSPCB over gaps in air quality data||A city-based civil society group has written to the chairperson of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), drawing attention to gaps in official air quality data from Gurugram.As per an analysis done by the group — Citizens for Clean Air — 10% to 22% of PM2.5 data each day is either erroneous or compromised. While officials did not comment on the veracity of the analysis, they admitted to persisting issues with collection of air quality data in the city.“We have observed that when we try to access the online monitoring units... the data reading is unavailable on some days for the stations in Gurugram. This frequent failure of air quality monitoring units is causing great concern. To give an example, the data for Gurugram, at various stations, was missing on January 7, January 12, January 14 and January 15,” states the letter, authored and signed by eight members of the collective.The issue, members of the group pointed out, is perennial at three of the four monitoring sites in the city, namely at Sector 51, Gwal Pahari and Vikas Sadan.Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer for Gurugram, said, “There are no issues with the monitors in themselves. The data is not reflecting on the official websites on some days because it is not being relayed to the central CPCB server, perhaps. I have asked a technical expert to look into the matter.”A deeper analysis reveals more worrying gaps in the data. Abhishek Shrivastava, an environmental engineer and member of Citizens for Clean Air (CFCA), pointed out that between 10% and 22% of daily readings of finer particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), across all four monitors, are either missing or erroneous. This was done by scrutinising about 1,201 data points at each monitoring station, which quantifies the amount of PM2.5 present in the vicinity of the device every 15 minutes. The data was analysed from January 1 to 13.At Vikas Sadan in Sector 11, for instance, 211 of the 1,153 readings available are marked as “None / Null”.“This is over 18% of data compromised,” said Shrivastava.“None/Null” readings have been marked in 178 of 1,153 readings for the TERI Gram monitor, while 76 readings are marked below 10 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3). “So, in total, 254 out of 1,153 readings available are erroneous. That is over 22% of data compromised,” said Shrivastava.“The standard expectation of any continuous monitoring system is that at most, data should be less than 5% erroneous, so that systematic interventions, both on short-term and long-term measures can be taken and impact can be monitored. It is evident that any positive action taken by government unfortunately with a system that does not deliver accurate values cannot be identified or scaled,” states CFCA’s representation to the HSPCB, dated January 15.Ruchika Sethi, a founding member of CFCA, which claims to have over 200 active members across 67 residents’ welfare associations in Gurugram, said, “Correct and timely information about air quality should be freely available to all taxpayers. Such persistent gaps in the data essentially mean that we are not getting an accurate picture of how bad the air is. Given that there is an inadequate number of monitors to begin with, what data we do get should be trustworthy.”S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, did not directly comment on the contents of the letter. She said, “We have received the communication and are waiting for comments from the field office. The CAAQMS are all outsourced to expert agencies and if there are some issues in connecting to servers we will take up with them and resolve at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/civic-group-writes-to-hspcb-over-gaps-in-air-quality-data-101610903948604.html
17-01-2021||Other||28 ex-councillors, local leaders resign from SAD in former Mohali mayor Kulwant’s support||A day after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal expelled former Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh from the party, 28 local leaders, including office-bearers and former councillors, also tendered their resignation on Sunday and said they will be contesting the upcoming municipal elections under the banner of Azad group led by the former mayor. Of the 28 members, eight were holding party posts at various levels in the district. Kulwant had raised the banner of revolt against the party by deciding to contest the elections independently along with other former SAD councillors. The elections are scheduled on February 14. The group is now gearing up for the polls and have opened their office in Sector 78. “We paid obeisance at the Sohana gurdwara before starting our new innings,” said Kulwant. “The screening of candidates is going on and we are hopeful of announcing the final list soon.” Parvinder Singh Sohana, who resigned from the post of president, Youth Akali Dal, Mohali, said: “We gave everything to the party, but they back-stabbed and humiliated us. We will not even have any post-election alliance with SAD.” Blaming former member parliament Prem Singh Chandumajra for this debacle, former Akali councillor RP Sharma alleged: “He is hand in gloves with Congress and will help them in winning the elections.” Another former councillor, Surinder Singh, said that it was difficult for them to resign after having “sacrificed our entire life to SAD”. “But we were helpless as we were not heard. There were several issues that forced us to contest the elections independently,” he said. On Saturday, SAD expelled Kulwant from its primary membership after recommendations from senior leader Prem Singh Chandumajra, who stated that he was involved in anti-party activities. In the 2015 elections, Kulwant had led the Azad group (of independents) and won 10 seats. With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. Later, in 2017, he joined SAD. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 last year. Last week, SAD had officially declared a list of 28 candidates (all of whom were former councillors) for the upcoming elections, but on January 11, 22 of them sided with Kulwant. With the latest development, a four-cornered fight awaits the MC polls. In the fray are SAD, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Kulwant’s group. The splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has opted out of the elections and will support AAP candidates and independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/28-ex-councillors-local-leaders-resign-from-sad-in-former-mohali-mayor-kulwant-s-support-101610903947898.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG to set up state’s first dog sterilisation centre||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to set up Haryana’s first dog sterilisation centre at Begumpur Khatola, said officials on Saturday. MCG officials said that the centre will have an operation theatre, vaccination area, separate dog sheds and a ground for dogs to play. The issue of dog sterilisation has remained a source of friction between the civic bodies and residents, who have claimed several instances of cruelty and lack of adherence to procedures by the MCG contractors. Two weeks ago, the MCG terminated the contract of a Jhajjar-based team over allegations of animal cruelty, non-performance of duties and misbehaviour with residents. The Jhajjar-based firm was hired after the previous firm’s contract was terminated in February 2020, also due to complaints of mistreatment of dogs from residents and activists.Last month, MCG officials had visited Lucknow and examined the dog sterilisation centre operated by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation, following which they decided to open one in Gurugram. “Estimates for the project are being prepared. We will be floating a tender to finalise a contractor next month. The centre will be set up a one-acre plot owned by the MCG, and will conform to all guidelines of the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI),” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.MCG officials privy to the matter said that the civic body would also simultaneously start proceedings of hiring a new contractor to sterilise dogs.“One of the main reasons behind setting up a centre is for the MCG to keep constant surveillance on all the operations carried out by the contractor. By creating a single infrastructure where all stray dogs are sterilised, the MCG can ensure all procedures are being carried out according to the norms and the possibilities of cruelty, negligence would be minimised. This way, there would be greater supervision on day-to-day operations of the contractor,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.As per MCG officials, geo-tagging of dogs would also be carried out prior to their capture to ensure they are released at the same location from where they are picked up. Further, the MCG is also working on a strategy to create avenues for offering strays for adoptions.“As per the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates, the stray dog population corresponds to 3% of the total human population of any area wherever dog birth control centre is absent. Hence, setting up dog birth control centre is vital as it is one of the first steps for mitigating man-animal conflict,” said Chetna Devendra Joshi, AWBI representative for Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-set-up-state-s-first-dog-sterilisation-centre-101610903946050.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Minimum temperature at 5.7°C, shallow fog to prevail||The city recorded maximum and minimum temperatures of 14.2 degrees Celsius and 5.7 degrees Celsius, respectively, even as the air quality continued to remain in the very poor zone for a fourth consecutive day, with a reading of 330 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said that there could be a rise in temperature next week with a change in wind direction.As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 7 degrees Celsius and 21 degrees Celsius, respectively, on Monday. As per the IMD’s forecast, shallow fog is expected on Monday. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the minimum temperature on Sunday and the reading was taken from the IMD’s AWS in Palam of Delhi. The air quality worsened marginally from a reading of 316 recorded a day before. Experts said that the wind speed had picked up Sunday and improvement in the air quality is likely over the next few days. Vijay Soni, the head of IMD’s Environment Monitoring Research Centre, said that the wind direction had changed from westerly to easterly. “Fog will prevail tomorrow as well. The air quality is expected to improve since we expect stronger winds in the coming days,” said Soni. He said that a western disturbance is expected around January 22, but there is no expectation of rain on account of it. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality over Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in the lower end of the very poor category on 18.01.2021. The air quality is likely to remain in the lower end of very poor to poor category 19.01.2021.” Subsequently, over the next five days, the air quality is largely expected to remain in the poor category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugramminimum-temperature-at-5-7-c-shallow-fog-to-prevail-101610903945464.html
17-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination to pick up steam in Gurugram||Nearly 4,800 front-line healthcare workers are expected to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district on Monday, health department officials said.Of the total, nearly 3,300 work at private healthcare facilities and Monday’s inoculation drive will be conducted at 45 vaccination booths located across 31 vaccinations sites, with 100 healthcare workers assigned to each.Despite certain hitches in meeting their target on Saturday, department officials said they are confident of inoculating at least 4,386 healthcare workers in the next round, which is more than seven times Saturday’s target of 600 individuals. “We have registered 3,301 private workers and 1,535 public workers in the next schedule. There were also some server issues with the Co-WIN portal on Saturday, but they have been resolved so we expect Monday’s drive to be a lot smoother,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, Gurugram.“All medical officers have been instructed to counsel their staff on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Personally speaking, I have not experienced any adverse event after immunisation; neither has anyone else who received the vaccine on Saturday. While vaccination isn’t voluntary, it is certainly recommended,” said Singh, adding that nearly 4,600 workers will be inoculated per day, on three days every week, which have been stipulated as involution days — Monday, Thursday and Saturday.About 46,000 healthcare workers across private and public facilities are expected to receive the vaccine over the next month.When asked whether the department is taking steps to address vaccine hesitancy among registered beneficiaries, Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “All medical officers have been instructed to speak to their staff. Ensuring them of the vaccine’s safety and efficacy is paramount. The health department has to lead by example. Text messages are also being sent to beneficiaries who did not receive the vaccine on Saturday, whether by choice or some logistical challenge.”A senior medical officer who is privy to the matter said that lesser vaccine hesitancy is expected among those employed in the private sector. “Private hospitals have been conducting their own dry runs and have assured us that all beneficiaries will come forward. They are also better equipped to communicate with staffers and handle any questions, though we have also been making an effort at that. It will help our own workers to see those in the private sector accept the vaccine,” the official said.Representatives of private hospitals said they are prepared for the drive.Dr Sameer Kulkarni, regional director, Paras Hospital, Gurugram, said, “We have made all necessary preparations for the exercise including identification of vaccination sites and registration of healthcare and other front-line workers. Our healthcare staff, who will be vaccinated tomorrow, have been briefed well about the whole exercise.”Dr Shuchin Bajaj, director, Ujala Cygnus group of hospitals, said, “We have gone through an extensive dry run a few days ago under the supervision of all experts, and have trained our health workers, paramedics and doctors to recognize any adverse events early on and deal with them, if they occur. But, nothing of that sort has been reported from anyone in the January 16 drive. The vaccine looks very safe to me. We have also done the registration of all healthcare workers and other front-line workers for tomorrow’s vaccination drive.”Dr Tarun Jhamb, consultant (internal medicine) at Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, said, “The vaccinations will start on January 18 from 9am and continue till 5pm. We are aiming to inoculate 100 healthcare workers every day.”District registers 45 new cases of Covid-19 on SundayGurugram recorded 45 new cases of the Covid-19 infection on Sunday, along with 75 recoveries and no new deaths.

17-01-2021||Gurugram||Top cop directs SHOs to look out for illegal call centres||The police commissioner on Sunday directed station house officers (SHOs) to watch out for illegal call centres and warned of strict action if any such centres are found running in areas under their respective jurisdictions.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that it is not that difficult for an officer to find out illegal activities running in his area. “We have been focusing on curbing street crime. Fraud cases have been on the rise for the last few months. These illegal call centres are operational at night and are mostly operational from commercial spaces or residential areas. The police station concerned will have to be alert and keep a track on the movement of people at night,” he said. Rao said most of the call centres provide pick and drop facility to their employees and give short breaks at night. “The employees move out during breaks and can easily be spotted near tea vendors and cigarette shops. This exercise needs ground working and activating sources in the areas,” he said. Rao has also directed that assistant commissioner of police concerned, who are the nodal officers to keep track of illegal call centres, and other senior officials be informed about activities of any illegal call centres. “Such Illegal activities have reduced in the city since we have started raiding these operations and have arrested over 100 suspects in the last one year. The only challenge we are facing is getting victims on the record. We are working towards finding a way and have involved embassies in this regard,” he said. The police said that Udyog Vihar, Golf Course Road, Sohna Road and residential areas near Sector 56 are on their radar. The chief minister’s flying squad has busted six call centres and has recently conducting mapping of the areas from where illegal call centres were operating across the city. The officials involved in the raid said fake call centres have mushroomed in the city over the last six years and people have minted money by duping citizens of foreign countries, mostly the US and the UK. Most of the suspects involved in running these call centres are repeat offenders and have been arrested multiple times, said officials. Most of them know one other, but not one of them has been convicted, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/top-cop-directs-shos-to-look-out-for-illegal-call-centres-101610903944948.html
17-01-2021||Chandigarh||Stricter fire safety rules in the works in Chandigarh||After years in slumber, the Chandigarh municipal corporation is finally set to enforce stricter fire safety rules with harsher penalties against violators and additional powers to its fire department for enforcement. The new rules will allow the fire department to remove encroachments (that may cause fire or obstruct movement during a fire rescue) from markets and houses. In addition to the power to seal the premises that violate fire safety norms, the MC will be authorised to cancel water connection in such cases. An increase in the quantum of fines, with provision for imprisonment, is also in the works. Violations will include failure to share information regarding an outbreak of fire, failure to take precautions to prevent fire and wilfully obstructing the rescue operations. It was in the aftermath of the fire tragedy at a paying guest accommodation in Sector 32 that led to the death of three girls on February 22, 2020, that the MC officials realised the civic body was following now defunct Delhi Fire Prevention and Fire Safety Act, 1986, and outdated rules under the repealed Act. “The fire department lacked enough teeth to punish property owners who violated fire safety norms, particularly those creating permanent or temporary structures that blocked firefighting and rescue efforts. At the time of the Sector 32 fire incident, it fell upon the UT estate office to take lead in initiating action against the violators under building rules,” said an MC official, privy to the development. While the national capital adopted Delhi Fire Safety Act, 2007, in 2010, the MC neither adopted the new law nor revised its rules formulated under the previous Act to keep these in line with the changed circumstances over the years. Confirming the development, Anil Kumar Garg, additional commissioner, MC, said: “We will be adopting the Delhi Fire Service Act, 2007, with modifications as per the city’s needs, and will formulate rules thereunder.” For formulating fresh rules, the MC has constituted a committee headed by Garg, which comprises all fire station officers, law officer and fire superintendent. The committee’s report will be approved by the MC House. “The changed rules will also be in sync with the national building code in terms of fire safety norms. They will allow for better enforcement of building codes,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stricter-fire-safety-rules-in-the-works-in-chandigarh-101610903645163.html
17-01-2021||Other||Delhi: Fraudsters target people looking for affordable housing||New Delhi: Sometime around November 2018, Dr. Shivali Seth, a Delhi-based dermatologist, came across a newspaper advertisement regarding an affordable housing scheme being launched by a private developer in southwest Delhi’s Chhawla. The developer claimed that the scheme was under the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) land pooling policy. “Since the advertisement had the DDA’s name and the scheme was lucrative and affordable, I invested R12.37 lakh, after my name figured in the list of people selected in the lucky draw. I did some basic online and physical verification of the real estate developer and the proposed site which threw up some red flags. Two months later, I found out that the housing scheme was fake with no DDA connection at all. All my hard-earned money was gone,” said Seth, a single mother. Pushkar Rawat from Uttam Nagar, who worked in a private company, said he took loans and invested ₹7 lakh in 2018 in a similar proposed housing scheme in Dwarka, after getting reference from a relative. But he sound found himself cheated, when in November he read about the fraud and the arrest of the company’s two office bearers by Delhi Police. “The company’s office is closed and its executives who processed the flat’s booking and payments have switched off their phones. I am paying nearly ₹6,000 every month as interest for the loan I had taken. I lost my job during the lockdown and am struggling to pay the loan interest and make ends meet,” said Rawat. Owning a house in Delhi is a dream for many. But like Rawat, Seth and thousands of home buyers, this dream turned into a nightmare after being duped by various developers and promoters, who allegedly tricked them into investing in different housing schemes by fraudulently using the DDA’s land-pooling policy, which is yet to become operational. In the last one and a half years, Delhi Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) has registered 19 cases of cheating and fraud against various developers and housing society groups. So far, EOW has arrested 13 officer bearers of four companies – Revanta Multi State CGHS Ltd, Aerocity Dwarka, Rudra Welfare Society, and Eminent Officers Welfare Society. Three of the four arrested office bearers of Revanta group are now out on bail, at least three EOW officials probing these cases said. “The fraudsters had launched web portals and various types of electronic advertisements were being sent to attract homebuyers and dupe them in the name of allotting flats. It was also revealed that a Nigerian gang was also involved in duping people, through online transactions, in the name of the DDA’s land pooling policy. A special investigation team (SIT) was formed to probe the cases,” said one of the officers. The DDA had notified its land pooling policy for the first time in 2013 and later in 2015. But it is only in 2018, the land-owning agency started work on it. Currently, the DDA is in the process of getting land owners in 95 urbanised villages to come together to pool their land. So far, DDA says 6500 hectares (approx.) of land has been pooled. DDA officials say that they are yet to start planning for its use. Joint commissioner of police (EOW) OP Mishra said that even as the land pooling policy planning was in the early stage, various builders and promoters have grabbed this as an opportunity to exploit the situation by luring in and duping innocent flat buyers. They often promised flats in Dwarka, Chhawla, Najafgarh and Rohini under the scheme. “They raised huge amounts for advance bookings in the name of registration and allotment,” he said. By the time the DDA could learn about this fraud in 2014-15 and begin issuing public notices to warn people to stay away from “any illegal offer of registration of plots or flats under the land pooling policy”, many real estate firms set up their offices in Delhi, mostly in Dwarka and its neighbouring areas, and hundreds of home buyers had already invested their money in various housing schemes, which only existed on “attractive brochures and papers”, the EOW officials said. Officials said the DDA began receiving complaints from cheated homebuyers in 2018 and the authority contacted the EOW, which by then had also received similar complaints. After preliminary verification, the first case was registered in December 2019 against the Revanta Group, which alone had duped more than 4,000 homebuyers of over Rs450 crore, said the officials. “The company offered flats in L-Zone Dwarka under the DDA’s land pooling policy, even though the authority had not allotted any land for any housing project there. The company’s founders purchased lands in Dwarka at very high rates – R10 crore per acre against the circle rate of R53 lakh. Land facilitation agencies were incorporated and direct land deals with farmers were avoided to siphon off the funds. One of the members sold his own land posing as a farmer,” said Mishra. The joint CP said that the company hired facilitation agencies and paid them around ₹115 crore for bringing homebuyers by contacting them through phone calls, text messages and emails. When contacted, founder member and former president of Revanta group Satender Maan (out on bail) said, “We purchased 48 acres of land using the investors’ money but the problem began when the DDA reduced the floor area ration (FAR) and we informed investors that they will either have to pay more money for the extra land or would get reduced size flats. Many filed police complaints and civil suits. After registering the case, the police freezed our bank accounts and we could not progress in our project.” When contacted regarding the frauds, the DDA released a statement and said, “DDA has time and again cautioned home buyers and investors against fraudulent practices by some developers and societies to lure people into buying houses under the false pretext of land policy. Any person interested or being given promise of any land or apartments under any land pooling scheme, must go through the instructions and details about the scheme on DDA’s website so as to safeguard their interests and avoid any trap by fraudsters floating and advertising false and fictitious land pooling schemes. DDA is again requesting the aggrieved persons, who have invested in the name of fraudulent land pooling schemes, to approach the EOW and file formal complaints against the fraudsters.” EOW officials said that there are many victims of similar frauds. “We are doing campaigns to make people aware of this land pooling policy frauds and come forward to file their complaints, if they have been duped,” added Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-fraudsters-target-people-looking-for-affordable-housing-101610903524498.html
17-01-2021||Chandigarh||Documentary film on Ganga screened at Chitkara University||Chitkara University organised an exclusive movie screening of feature-length documentary film ‘Moving Upstream: Ganga’ directed by Shirdhar Sudhir, an industry mentor at Chitkara Design School and National Institute of Design alumnus.The screening was held at the university auditorium in the presence of pro-chancellor Dr Madhu Chitkara among other dignitaries. Proper social distancing norms were followed for everyone’s safety.The documentary, filmed over six months between June 2016 and April 2017 on slow river exploration journeys based on research projects and archives for fixing accountability, is a first-person account of a 3000-kilometre walk from Ganga Sagar in West Bengal till Gangotri in Uttarakhand. The project has documented the flow of the river and life of the riparian community living along Ganga.The producer, Siddharth Agrawal, also the founder of Veditum India Foundation’s Moving Upstream project, is an aerospace engineer from IIT Kharagpur, feels that walking allowed the time gap needed for clear thinking. The slow pace allowed a calm thinking bereft of the clutter associated with the highly politicised topic of the Ganga.Director of the film, Shridhar Sudhir is a graduate of the NID, Ahmedabad, and has been making independent films, both fiction and non-fiction, on contemporary India for the last five years. Based out of Himachal Pradesh, he is the founder of Buddhijeev Studios, a venture which tries to make vernacular content for the Indian audience through independent films and the YouTube channel Buddhijeev.Sudhir has been associated with Chitkara Design School for the past one year as an integral member, teaching filmmaking to our students. His movie is a piece of art which gave our students the chance to witness the nuances of independent film-making, a faculty member said.The film includes unique footage that interprets stories from the immediate vicinity of the Ganga. The ‘Moving Upstream’ series is an attempt to document the stories of the rivers of India, bringing out a first person narrative of the river’s condition and life of the people of the basin.Shridhar treaded over 500 km along the Ganga in the final stretch of the Moving Upstream walk, and his documentation forms an integral component of the film.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/feature-film-on-ganga-screened-at-chitkara-university-101610903466657.html
17-01-2021||Kolkata||Eyes on polls, TMC reshuffles three district units; Jitendra Tiwari sidelined||With eyes on the coming assembly polls, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership on Sunday made some major organisational changes in the districts of South Dinajpur, West Burdwan and Malda where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made noticeable inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Significantly, the ruling party once again projected senior leaders apparently to weed out dissent that cropped up among a section of veterans after comparatively younger leaders were given important portfolios in district units.The most significant reshuffle was made in West Burdwan where two adjacent Lok Sabha seats are represented by Union ministers Babul Supriyo and SS Ahluwalia.The district’s heavyweight leader Jitendra Tiwari, who turned rebel in December last year and resigned from the post of administrative head of the Asansol municipal corporation and president of the district unit before holding a meeting with Suvendu Adhikari before the latter joined the BJP, has found no place in the new setup. Though not included in the new district committee in West Burdwan, Tiwari said, "My best wishes are with the new team. If they want me to play any role I will be obliged to help as a faithful party worker. I never hankered for any high post."Law minister Moloy Ghatak, a senior legislator, has been made chairman of the committee and Apurba Mukherjee is the new president.Also read: Facebook, Twitter representatives to appear before IT parliamentary panelIn north Bengal, where the BJP won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha polls, the South Dinajpur district, which is located adjacent to Bangladesh and has a 24.63 per cent Muslim population, has witnessed the growth of the saffron camp in recent months. BJP’s Sukanta Majumdar wrested the Balurghat Lok Sabha seat in 2019.On Sunday, former lawmaker Biplab Mitra, who joined the BJP in 2019 but returned to the TMC in July last year, was made chairman of the district committee. TMC leaders said Mitra was rewarded for his loyalty.In Malda, where BJP’s Khagen Murmu wrested the Malda North Lok Sabha seat last year, the TMC made veteran leader Krishnendu Narayan Chowdhury the chairman of the new district committee, retaining Mausam Noor as the district president.The reshuffles were announced after the party said that Satabdi Roy, the three-time Lok Sabha member from Birbhum district who voiced dissent against the leadership and triggered speculation that she might join the BJP, would be one of the vice-presidents of the state committee.The changes however could not address dissent everywhere.In Howrah district, the TMC is in an uncomfortable position because of forest minister Rajib Banerjee who said in a live social media post on Saturday that he was not being allowed to work freely in the party. On Sunday, Banerjee was conspicuous by his absence at a grand rally that minister and district unit chairman Arup Roy led in the afternoon. “If anyone has anything to say about the party then he should raise it inside the party, not in public,” said Roy.TMC spokesperson and former Rajya Sabha member Kunal Ghosh said, "These are purely internal decisions of the party and taken for the betterment of the party."While TMC leaders attempted to play down the organisational changes as “internal matters” of the party, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “This is disaster management by the TMC because it is disintegrating. Mamata Banerjee is trying to keep everybody happy but it will not help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/eyes-on-polls-tmc-reshuffles-three-district-units-jitendra-tiwari-sidelined-101610902861922.html

17-01-2021||Bangalore||Home minister Shah asks Congress to stop undermining Indian vaccines||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday lashed out at the Congress claiming that the party has been undermining the efforts of the developers of the Covid-19 vaccine amid the pandemic. Shah said the opposition party has been doing nothing other than resort to protesting against the government’s initiatives and should refrain from demoralising those who are fighting to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.“Congress leaders raised questions on Covid-19 vaccine. We know you cannot do anything other than protest but at least don't stop the ones making efforts. Both vaccines developed in India are completely safe,” Shah was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He also encouraged people to get vaccinated in order to stop the spread of Covid-19 and not pay attention to rumours related to the vaccine. “Do not believe what Congress says, when it is your turn, please get vaccinated and India will soon become a country free of coronavirus,” Shah said while addressing a public rally at Karnataka’s Belagavi.Congress and several other opposition parties have been criticising the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for politicising the pandemic and the approval of emergency use authorisation of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. Congress’ Punjab lawmaker Manish Tewari on two separate occasions said that the government chose to overlook necessary scientific procedures in its bid to show that vaccines were developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat drive. He also questioned the reliability of Covaxin earlier in January.Tewari lashed out at the Centre a few hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Covid-19 vaccine drive on Saturday. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” Tewari had asked.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan was quick to counter the criticism levelled at the government and said that Congress is indulging in activities that fuel rumours and spread fear. He also shared pictures of doctors in AIIMS taking the Covid-19 jab.Earlier in January, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav had also questioned the government regarding the vaccine rollout and said that he distrusts the vaccines launched under central government’s supervision.Amit Shah also lashed out at the Congress during his address calling the party anti-poor and blamed the previous governments under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) for not doing enough to develop Karnataka.Shah was on a two-day visit to Karnataka where he laid the foundation stone for a new campus for the Central Reserve Police Force’s (CRPF's) new Rapid Action Force battalion in Bhadravathi. He also laid the foundation stone of various projects related to the farming sector in Bagalkot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/home-minister-shah-asks-congress-to-stop-undermining-indian-vaccines-101610890515978.html

However, the child should be called to school only with the consent of parents, following the enclosed standard operating procedure. Further, while the records of children coming to school be maintained, the same should not be used for attendance purposes as sending the child to school is completely optional for parents,” the Directorate of Education (DoE) said in a circular issued on Wednesday.Schools that are outside containment zones of the national capital have only been allowed to open and students, teachers and staff living in these zones will not be allowed to attend.

The app was designed to ease the process of verification and registration of over thirty million health care workers in the country, avoid hoarding and ensure vaccination of only verified beneficiary. Dr Ashish Bharti, health chief, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), who was present at the Kamala Nehru hospital, said, “We had alerted authorities about technical glitches and had to manually carry out beneficiary verification. Since most of the government staff are already present at the hospital, we did not face a major issue throughout the day. However, major hospitals like Sassoon General Hospital and private hospitals whose staff are working in shifts had to call their off-duty staff back to the hospital for vaccination. The state is insisting to vaccinate only as per the software list, but the site is not working even on mobile.” “We have been asked to upload the data offline since the app was not working during the day, but it was not working at most sites and we were unable to upload the data,” he said. Multiple hospitals reported that the Co-WIN site had either crashed or was too slow and beneficiaries could not be registered on it. One of the staff at the Kamala Nehru hospital handling the registration process said, “The site crashed and we had to manually verify each beneficiary. We received the list last night and are vaccinating beneficiaries who turned up and not according to the software. We took a print of the list and manually verified each beneficiary before allowing them at the vaccination site.” By late evening, local authorities got messages from the state government that the Co-WIN app has started working and upload data offline. Dr Manisha Karmarkar, chief operating officer, Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We got the list of beneficiaries late Friday night. We then prepared a time slot for beneficiaries and put it out on our various hospital WhatsApp groups. The messages to beneficiaries did not mention any time and so we prepared a time slot for each beneficiaries and asked them to come at that particular time. Since this was the first day, we could personally message everyone and create time slots and get it done, but it would be better if the app could create time slots in case we have to vaccinate staff from other hospitals. “ Dr Rebecca George, deputy medical director at the hospital said, “Earlier, we had to verify all the information on the app and update once the beneficiary is vaccinated, but early morning the Co-WIN site did not open at all and we manually entered all the information on our computers and kept it ready in case we are asked to upload it later. We had not even received the password and login ID as of Saturday morning. Those who could not make it for vaccination today would be scheduled automatically by the Co-WIN app.” Siddharth Waghmare, medical officer, Dhole Patil road ward which houses multiple major hospitals, was present at Ruby Hall Clinic to supervise the vaccination process. He said, “The site is slow and so we have asked the hospital staff to manually enter information. At each stage — verification, vaccination and post-observation — we had to enter the details, however, that could not be done.” Dr HK Sale, executive director at Noble hospital said, “The vaccination process was carried out smoothly, but we faced a few glitches. The site was not opening and so we had to manually enter the details. Also, the messages were sent out to beneficiaries late Friday night and since it was a weekend maybe some of them were not present in town or even had just finished their shifts in the morning and had gone home. “ Dr Prakash Rokde at Aundh district hospital confirmed that they had to manually enter the details of beneficiaries since the site was not working. He said, “It could be because all the sites across the country were trying to log in at the same time and so the site got slow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cowin-app-slows-down-pune-hospitals-forced-to-do-manual-registration-101610888822928.html

After that, I was depressed for about six months and spent my time only by playing PUBG. Then one day, I thought it's enough and I will get out of this, and that's how the idea of this popped up."Parents had their doubtsBatra is a BSc in computer science and claims to have opened the cafe with his savings, He said his parents, especially his father was a bit "sceptical" when he told him about opening a cafe with a such name.Also read: Thousands of tractors will enter Delhi for disciplined Kisan Republic Day parade"My mother was very supportive of the fact that I was going to start something of my own after the bad phase I went through but my father was not convinced with the name of the cafe. But one day, one of his friends who was unaware that the cafe is mine, praised the food and its ambience. Then my dad got convinced that I am doing something productive," he said.Tales of heartbreakBatra, who manages the cafe with his younger brother Rahul Batra, said that "more than doing business, he wanted to provide a platform to people like him with heartbreaks to share their stories.""Everyone in their life goes through the same phase. Hence, I wanted them to come here and share their tales and the pain in their heart so that I can help them overcome this and move on. I am even succeeding in this as many are now coming by seeing the cafe's name and sharing their break-up stories with me," said Batra.The visitors of the cafe are also commending the concept and sharing their tales with Batra.One of the visitors said, "I work as a teacher and had a breakup with my partner recently after a relationship of about 3 years. I was totally heartbroken since then. Then a few days ago, while passing by the area, I saw the cafe and stopped only to end up sharing my pain with Batra and feeling lighthearted."Another visitor who was having his coffee at the cafe said, "After having a heartbreak, I came here and Batra helped me a lot in coping with the bad phase and moving on. I am really grateful to him and continue to come here."After getting a good response from the customers Batra has plans for expanding the cafe."I am soon going to have a franchise in Haridwar within a month and have plans of opening up another branch in Dehradun after a couple of months," said Batra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/heartbroken-dehradun-youth-opens-up-tea-joint-called-dil-tuta-aashiq-cafe-101610888439146.html

At least 1,802 healthcare workers of the total 3,100 who were targeted to be vaccinated on day one were inoculated at the 31 vaccination centres across the district. As many as 1,150 beneficiaries did not report to the centres and 71 refused to take vaccine, according to the district information source. In Pune city, 438 of the 800 targeted beneficiaries were vaccinated, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) saw 456 out of 800 and in rural Pune 908 were vaccinated out of 1,500 targeted. Amidst a ceremonial moment, the first beneficiary of Covid-19 vaccination drive under the first phase was inoculated on the fifth floor at Kamala Nehru Hospital at around 11 am. Dr Vinod Shah, 74, was relieved that he could now step out with safety precautions in place. Dr Shah practices at Kamala Nehru Hospital and is consultant at other hospitals. Dr Nitin Abhyankar, a 57-year-old physician and a diabetic, also received the Covishield vaccine. Dr Shah said, “I was forced to provide consultation and diagnosis to patients via phone or computer since the past ten months due to my age and comorbidities. The vaccine has boosted my confidence. After the second dose, I am sure that I will be able to step out by following the Covid safety measures.” Dr Abhyankar said, “I have treated over 600 Covid patients and seen deaths caused by the virus. With the vaccine in place, we hope to see no more deaths. The vaccine is definitely a game-changer.” PMC mayor Murlidhar Mohol, PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar, additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal and divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao were also present at Kamala Nehru hospital for vaccination. Dr RS Wadia (88) was vaccinated at Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune with Covishield. He was probably one of the oldest doctors to be vaccinated in the city. Dr Rebecca George, deputy medical director at the hospital, said, “We had prepared four booths, but we were later told to use only one booth and go slow with the vaccination process.” Dr Avinash Naniwadkar, head of the radiology department at the hospital who also received the vaccine jab, said, “We got messages for vaccination on Friday night and follow-up calls in the morning. My blood pressure and pulse oximeter were checked before and also ten minutes after the vaccination process.” At BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, which was also part of the Covishield clinical trial phase two and three, dean of the college Dr M Tambe was the first person to get the vaccine. Dr Tambe was administered with the Covishield vaccine. “To send a message to all my colleagues I decided to take the vaccine first. Since the outbreak, Sassoon had been flooded with Covid-19 cases and it was a tough time for the entire team. Being the only tertiary care hospital, we had the responsibility to handle critical cases. Many doctors, nurses and hospital staff, almost a hundred, were exposed and several got infected,” said Tambe. “I am absolutely fine and have no adverse effect post the vaccination,” said Dr Tambe. Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, HOD, microbiology department, Sassoon, said, “I am happy that I got vaccinated today. Vaccination is the best way to achieve herd immunity safely, effectively, and in the shortest time. We have the most effective tool to halt the pandemic. One must get vaccinated to protect self, family and society.” Aundh district hospital, meanwhile, was the only hospital to get Covaxin which has been developed and produced by Bharat Biotech and is India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine. Dr Prakash Rokde, senior ophthalmologist, Aundh district hospital, said, “The poor turnout could have been because of the late-night SMSes sent to beneficiaries or because of our staff’s shift timings. The turnout at our hospital was 60% which is a good number.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1802-healthcare-workers-vaccinated-in-pune-district-on-first-day-101610888583843.html

Eight cases of Adverse Effects Following Immunization (AEFI) were reported at Thergaon Hospital in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and one at Wagholi primary health centre. Dr Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Zilla Parishad, said, “The incident at Wagholi primary health centre was where the nurse, who did not have proper food after her night shift, felt anxious and was overwhelmed by the vaccination process.” Doctors at the centre clarified that it was a psychological experience. Dr Ashish Bharti, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health department chief, said that there were observation sites for vaccine beneficiaries. “We have also put up emergency contact numbers of ambulances and drivers at the observation sites. Also, referral hospitals were ready to tackle any adverse case. However, no such case was reported. At Sutar Hospital, we had made rangoli to welcome healthcare professionals,” said Dr Bharti. Dr Subhash Kokane, the first beneficiary at Rajeev Gandhi hospital for the vaccination, said that he took the vaccine first to ensure others’ safety. “I was working for Rajeev Gandhi hospital during the pandemic. And I was tested positive for Covid in October and recovered. I have seen many patients lose their life to the virus. I encourage everyone to take the vaccination to keep themselves and their family safe,” said Kokane. The vaccination drive at PMC-run Rajiv Gandhi hospital started smoothly on Saturday. The beneficiaries are mostly staff from the hospital. The hospital is equipped to vaccinate 100 persons on the first day. The staff during the vaccination informed the beneficiaries about the emergency contacts if they experience uneasiness post-vaccination. Sharing similar views, Pooja Bandal, a nurse at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, said that even though she was not infected by the virus, she was happy to be the first woman to receive the vaccination at the hospital. “I am not fearful if the vaccination shows any side effects. All necessary arrangements are made by the hospital in case of any emergency. There is a follow-up after seven days and the next shot is after 28 days,” said Bandal. Speaking about the necessity of vaccination, Dr Maya Lohar, medical superintendent at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, said that the beneficiaries are kept under observation for half an hour. “Most of the beneficiaries are from the hospital. And we are all very positive because of the vaccination. We have made all necessary arrangements to tackle any emergency,” said Dr Lohar. Dr Varsha Doiphode, additional civil surgeon, district hospital, Aundh, said that all the staff members at the hospital are excited to get the vaccination shots. “Our nurses and doctors have been the first to handle the Covid emergency.

Savita Jadhav, telemedicine facility management, Aundh hospital, who tested positive for Covid in May, said that she is happy to receive the vaccination. “It is an indigenous vaccination. And I feel proud to receive it on day one. The hospital has followed all rules and regulations to give the jab,” said Jadhav. JS Ghodke who is a paediatric nurse and cold chain and vaccine incharge at Aundh Hospital said that those who came in for vaccination were positive about the drive. “Our staff and beneficiaries are happy.

The exemption, however, excludes those travelling in public transport services such as taxis, rickshaws, trucks and tempos. As of now, ₹200 fine per person is being imposed for not wearing masks in public places. The new rules have been imposed with immediate effect.The decision has been taken following several complaints by the citizens.The BMC had set the fines for skipping out on masks as well as spitting in public places at ₹1,000 in April. Later, the amount was reduced to ₹200 in September after citizens complained of the fine being too stringent.Recently, motorists had complained to the BMC about marshals fining them while they were inside their car. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed all cleanup marshals to stop fining people for violating mask rules if they are in their private vehicles.Also read: Thousands of tractors will enter Delhi for disciplined Kisan Republic Day paradeA senior civic official said, “Implementation of new directives has been started from Sunday afternoon. However, marshals will continue fining people not wearing masks in public places. The ones travelling in public transport will also be fined."In October, the BMC had launched a massive drive with a target of penalising 20,000 citizens daily for not wearing a mask. On October 12, when the drive was launched, nearly 40,000 citizens were penalised. In ten days, as of October 21, additional 60,000 citizens were penalised for not wearing a mask.Apart from collecting fines, the BMC has also started making violators perform community services, such as sweeping roads for an hour or cleaning graffiti, if they argue or refuse to pay the fine amount of ₹200 for not wearing masks. This punishment is being implemented as per the BMC’s solid waste management by-laws which empowers the civic body to make citizens perform community services for spitting on roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-fine-for-not-wearing-masks-in-private-vehicles-in-mumbai-101610886295415.html

Later, he was convicted by a district and session court while his friend was acquitted by the same court. Yadav was awarded punishment for life imprisonment.“Yadav completed the jail term of 14 years and the state government was going to give him the benefit of remission on January 26, 2021 (Republic Day) but before his release, MP High Court, Gwalior bench declared him innocent on January 15, said Atul Gupta, the advocate of Yadav.The double bench of the court, comprising judge Anand Pathak and judge Vishal Mishra, in its judgment delivered on Friday said, “Regretfully appellant’s 14 years which otherwise he could have served the nation as an army personnel cannot be returned back but certainly he can be given solace by removing the stigma of an accused from him, therefore, this court proceeded to conclude its findings on merits.”Also read: India gives Nepal 'iron clad' commitment on vaccine, supply schedule coming week“It is concluded that the prosecution couldn’t prove the case beyond reasonable doubt and material contradictions, omissions and discrepancies crept into the case of the prosecution.

It clearly shows that Kannada has been ignored though the foundation stone that has been laid in Karnataka," Kumaraswamy tweeted.Stating that it is the responsibility of the Centre to show due respect towards the languages of the states as our country has adopted the three-language formula, he said, but violation of such a sensitive norm by the union Home Minister himself is an insult to the Kannada language as well as Kannadigas."The behaviour of Mr Shah who has ignored Kannada in the process of providing prominence to English and Hindi indicates an anti-Kannada attitude. It is an insult to the pride of Kannadigas. It is Karnataka that has given land for the Centre's RAF unit," the former Chief Minister pointed out."It is an unpardonable act that despite getting land from Karnataka for the RAF unit, Kannada has been completely ignored in the foundation stone plaque," he said, adding Amit Shah should clarify to Kannadiagas on the episode of violation of three-language formula in the foundation stone plaque.The Karnataka government has provided a 50.29-acre land for the headquarters of the 97th battalion of the RAF, the blue dungaree wearing special anti-riots wing of the Central Reserve Police Force.Kumaraswamy said, it is "highly condemnable" that even the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister who were present on the occasion chose to ignore dignity and honour of our land and its language."Those who tolerate insult to the dignity and honour of land as well as its language are not fit to hold the reins of state's administration. The act and behaviour of the Union Home Minister, Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister are nothing but betraying Kannadigas," he added.Kumaraswamy had earlier too had been very critical of the alleged Hindi imposition and discrimination against the people of other languages, especially from the south.Terming "Hindi Diwas" celebration as an "underhand method" to impose the language on people speaking other languages, he had in September demanded its cancellation.The JD(S) leader had also asked as to how much more people of other languages including Kannadigas have to "sacrifice" in this country for not knowing Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/kannada-has-been-ignored-kumaraswamy-accuses-shah-101610880992097.html

We know that you're a weak CM but for the sake of your position, please don't let human lives be sacrificed. It is your (Bihar CM) responsibility to control crime in the state,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“No arrests made yet. DGP says crime rate was higher in 2019, has come down now but for 16 years, Nitish Kumar has been CM.

The number of incidents of crime is increasing here. It was ridiculous to see the chief minister yesterday. Nitish Kumar seemed helpless, very weak and tired,” he had said on Saturday.Yadav had also accused Bihar ministers of being involved in Singh's murder during a Facebook live session on Friday.

In the video, both the grandfather and the father of the girl are also seen crying. After the video went viral, Hindu organisations started putting pressure on the police to act and accused it of inaction,” said a police official.He added that when the police contacted the girl to verify the allegations made in the video, she denied all the allegations and said she had not been converted either before or after her marriage. The police too released the video on social media to put things in perspective.“I got married as per my will. Do not do false politics. This is not love jihad. We have married on our own free will, no one has been forced," the official quoted the girl as saying.However, the girl's grandfather released another video saying the family had lost respect. The girl's father claimed that he was also receiving threats.Bikaner’s superintendent of police, Priti Chandra, rubbished the claims made by the girl’s family. “All the allegations made by the girl's family are false.

17-01-2021||Other||A week before deadline, government receives 49 objections to merger of 23 villages||The Pune divisional office has received as many as 49 suggestions and objections to the proposed merger of 23 areas – known as villages in government records – in to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. The process, to receive suggestions and objections on the inclusion, began on December 22, 2020, after state government issued a notification for the same. Officials said most of the responses received under “suggestions” and “objections” are opposing the proposed merger, although the quantum is too small as compared to 2017, when 11 areas were merged into the PMC. In its notification issued by state government related to the merger of 23 areas into the Pune corporation, the state government’s urban development department had given a month’s period to register views. Prashant Khandkekar, deputy regional director, municipal administration, Pune Division, said, “Till date (Friday), we got 49 suggestions and objections from local residents of the 23 merged areas. The number is less as compared to 11 merged areas notifications in 2017. At that time, we had received 2,900 suggestions and objections. However, only 265 people were present at the time of hearing.” According to Khandkekar, the process to sort out the objections area-wise has not started yet. “It will be done on January 22. In 2017, when large number sent their views and opposed the merger of 11 areas, most residents raised objections expressing concern of increasing property taxes, uncertainty of getting services, and that there was no need for a merger due to lack of urbanisation,” he said. As per the 2011 census, the population of 23 merged villages is 1,90,619. According to PMC officials, it may have now reached half a million given the rapid grown of real estate in these areas. On the other hand, the Pune corporation limit has grown to 518 sq km, from the existing 331 sq km, which become the first corporation in the state in terms of geographical area. The PMC had also informed state government that if these 23 areas are to be merged, the PMC has to be given ₹9000 crore to provide basic amenities to these parts. On the political front, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has given full support to the merger of 23 areas. However, the Shiv Sena and Congress party have taken a stand to prepare a detailed plan for development, manpower and funds before final decision. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has insisted that first the PMC carry out development of the 11 areas it merged in 2017 and then, step by step, include these 23 areas in the PMC limits. Shrinag Chavan, who had filed a public litigation for merger of villages in the Mumbai High court, said, “Fewer suggestions and objections show that people are happy with the decision. They want the inclusion of 23 villages. They need better infrastructure to live a better life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-week-before-deadline-government-receives-49-objections-to-merger-of-23-villages-101610878800951.html

In March last year, the trial court allowed the plea and summoned the company, Kalra and the employee, it said.Hence, the present petition for quashing the trial court order was filed, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-puts-on-hold-trial-court-order-summoning-make-my-trip-ceo-in-cheating-case-101610878461441.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi High Court says parents of road accident victim entitled to compensation||Parents are dependent on their children at some stage of life and it would be inequitable to deny compensation to those who lost their ward in a road accident, the Delhi High Court has said.Justice JR Midha said even if parents are not dependent on their children at the time of an accident, they will certainly be dependent, both financially and emotionally, upon them at the later stage of their life, as the children were dependent upon their parents in their initial years.The high court’s observations came while awarding compensation for loss of dependency to a woman, who lost her 23-year-old son in a road accident in 2008, and enhanced the award amount from ₹2.42 lakh to ₹6.80 lakh.The motor accident claims tribunal had held that though the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the parents of the victim were not entitled to compensation for loss of dependency but only to compensation for loss of the estate.It had held that the victim’s father was working with the Delhi Police as a Sub-Inspector and was, therefore, not dependent upon the deceased.It had also said that his mother cannot be said to be dependent upon the victim as her husband was employed with the Delhi Police.The high court, however, said it was of the view that parents of the deceased are considered in law as dependent on their children, considering that they are bound to support their parents in their old age, when the parents would be unable to maintain themselves.The court, which said the law imposes a responsibility on the children to maintain their parents, added that “it would therefore be unfair as well as inequitable to deny compensation for loss of dependency to a parent, who may not be dependent on his/her child at the time of accident per se but would become dependent at him or her later age”.It further said that provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act cast an obligation on the children to maintain their parents and these legislations recognise the legal rights of parents to be maintained by their children.The high court directed that a copy of this judgement be sent to the Registrar General who shall circulate it to all Motor Accident Claims Tribunals to note that the principles relating to the loss to the estate in Keith Rowe judgement and Dinesh Adhlak judgement are not applicable to the claim of the parents in respect of the death of their child, claim of children in respect of death of their parents and claim of a spouse in respect of death of his/her spouse in a motor accident.It said the copy of this judgement be also sent to Delhi Judicial Academy to sensitise the claims tribunals about the principles laid down by this court in this verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-says-parents-of-road-accident-victim-entitled-to-compensation-101610877849665.html

The Thiruvananthapuram-bound Malabar Express from Mangaluru was stopped at Edava, about 60 km from here, after a gatekeeper there noticed smoke billowing out of the luggage van close to the engine and alerted officials around 7.40 am, they said. Fire force personnel said halting of the train in time averted a major blaze as the fire did not spread to other coaches. According to the railway sources, the gatekeeper informed the station master of Varkala, around 15 km from Edava, who in turn alerted the loco pilot and the guard, following which the train was halted immediately. An attempt was made to douse the blaze with fire extinguishers available in the train before the fire force personnel, who rushed to the spot, put it out, the sources told PTI. Shinoj, a passenger of the train, said seeing the smoke he first thought it must be due to some garbage being burnt on roadside. He later informed the police control room. Two motorcycles were among the goods gutted, the sources said adding a staff of Kasaragod railway parcel office has been suspended pending inquiry into lapses if any in booking of the vehicles. According to preliminary assessment, it was suspected one of the bikes could have triggered the fire, the sources said without elaborating further. Later, the train left for its destination after officials, including the Senior Divisional Mechanical Engineer, inspected the luggage van and found it fit for journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fire-in-luggage-van-of-running-train-doused-in-time-in-kerala-101610876783526.html
17-01-2021||Kolkata||Covid-19: Mamata administration questions Centre’s vaccination data||In a fresh flashpoint between the Centre and the West Bengal government, the Mamata Banerjee administration has questioned the data on vaccination published by the Union government on Saturday, alleging that it was incorrect.While the state health department claimed that at least 15,707 people were vaccinated on the first day in West Bengal, the union health ministry in its tweet said 9730 beneficiaries received the jab in the eastern state.A senior official of the West Bengal government said on Saturday that that the state had set a target to vaccinate 20,700 health workers on the first day. Out of them, the official said, 15,707 (75.9%) received the shot. While 92% of the target could be achieved in Kolkata, in some districts such as Jhargram 100% target was achieved.Late on Saturday night, however, the Union heath ministry tweeted that out of the 191,181 beneficiaries across the country, only 9,730 were from West Bengal, which is less than 50% of the target set by the state.“This is not correct. We are taking it up with them (the Centre),” said NS Nigam, state health secretary.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday requested the Union government to send adequate supply of Covid-19 vaccines for all citizens in the state, and said her government was ready to bear the cost. Banerjee earlier announced that her government would provide free vaccine to all citizens across the state.On Saturday, India launched the world’s largest coronavirus vaccination drive, setting in motion a complex deployment plan aimed at stemming the wide spread of infections across a nation of more than 1.3 billion people.This is, however, not the first time that differences have surfaced between the Bengal administration and the Union government over Covid-19 data and related issues.In May 2020, an inter-ministerial central team (IMCT), which was sent to assess Bengal’s response to Covid-19, alleged discrepancies in the number of cases reported by the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/covid19-mamata-administration-questions-centre-s-vaccination-data-101610876240754.html
17-01-2021||Kolkata||After rebellion, TMC MP Satabdi Roy made party’s Bengal vice-president||Less than 48 hours after Satabdi Roy, three-time Lok Sabha member from Birbhum district, voiced dissent against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership and triggered speculation that she would join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the TMC on Sunday made the actor-turned politician a vice-president of the West Bengal state committee.While Roy welcomed the move, saying chief minister Mamata Banerjee wants her to work more for the people, the party’s secretary general, Partha Chatterjee, described the appointment as an “internal matter” of the organisation.Two other leaders, Moazzem Hossain and Shankar Chakraborty were also made vice-presidents of the TMC state committee.Speculations over Roy’s future started on Thursday over a post in a Facebook page of the Satabdi Roy Fan’s Club. The post, which Roy on Friday said was written by her, mentioned that she was unable to connect with voters in her constituency as she was not being invited to TMC programmes since the 2019 polls.Roy told the media that she would fly to Delhi on Saturday. This led to rumours that she would meet Union home minister Amit Shah. “As an MP, I can always meet Shah. But I am not saying that I will join the BJP,” Roy said on Friday afternoon.For the first time, TMC’s youth unit president and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, stepped in to fight the crisis. He sent party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh to bring Roy to his office and held a two-hour long meeting on Friday evening.“I discussed everything with our leader Abhishek Banerjee. I conveyed to him the grievances I had. He said he will solve all the problems,” Roy said after emerging from the meeting.Saumitra Khan, BJP state youth front president and Lok Sabha MP from Bankura district, however said Roy would join the BJP very soon. “Mamata Banerjee may have stopped her now but not just Roy but seven or eight MPs, such as Prasun Banerjee, will subsequently join the BJP,” Khan said on Saturday.Banerjee, a former football star, however dismissed Khan’s claim. “I am and will always be an integral part of the TMC,” he said.Though the TMC managed to stop Roy from leaving, the party was in an uncomfortable position because of state forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who has been avoiding most of the government and party programmes since September last.Banerjee said in a live social media post on Saturday that he was not being allowed to work freely in the party. Since September, the minister has been speaking against a section of TMC leaders in Howrah district.Making things a little easier for the TMC in East Midnapore district, where Suvendu Adhikari was a legislator from the Nandigram seat, Siraj Khan, a senior functionary of the zilla parishad (district council) left the BJP and returned to the TMC on Sunday morning. Khan was welcomed into the BJP in November last year by the party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/after-rebellion-tmc-mp-satabdi-roy-made-party-s-bengal-vicepresident-101610876301122.html
17-01-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata nurse stable, experts try to find cause of illness post vaccination||The health condition of a 35- year-old nurse, who fell ill here following the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, is currently stable, and a medical board of experts has been formed to find out why she fainted after taking the shot, a senior official said on Sunday.The health department official, who is also a prominent doctor, said the experts are examining her condition as of now, and the analysis might take some time."She is is stable. We have formed a board of experts to take care of the treatment procedure. Let's see how quickly we can analyse the reason behind her illness and come up with a solution. As of now, she is responding well to the treatment," the official told PTI.The health department is also consulting vaccine expert Dr Shantunu Tripathy, who was earlier associated with School of Tropical Medicine, he said.Asked if there was any underlying cause, the official said, "No one can say anything for sure as of now. Experts are examining her condition. We have found out that the woman suffers from chronic Asthma and is hypersensitive to a number of drugs."The nurse was on Saturday admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital here as she complained of uneasiness and fainted shortly after taking the shot, during the nationwide vaccination programme."We checked on her this morning and found that all her vital health parameters are normal. Her blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels are also fine. Oxygen support has been removed for the time being. We will soon decide on the next course of action," the senior official said.Thirteen other 'Adverse Event Following Immunisation' (AEFI) cases have also been reported from various parts of the state but "none of those were serious", the state health department said."All these vaccine recipients showed minor side effects like increased blood pressure and feverish feeling. They were discharged after preliminary treatment. Our doctors in respective districts are keeping a tab on their health condition and will take a call as per the demand of the situation," the official said.AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence following immunisation and might not have any relation with the vaccination process, officials said.Of the 14 AEFI cases in Bengal, three are from Murshidabad district and two from Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-nurse-stable-experts-try-to-find-cause-of-illness-post-vaccination-101610874375531.html

We are united and committed towards it. Respects to the martyrs with this promise," the CMO tweeted.Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belgaum, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending that the majority of population in these areas is Marathi- speaking.The dispute between the two states over Belgaum and other border areas is pending before the Supreme Court for many years.Thackeray last year appointed Maharashtra ministers Eknath Shinde and Chhagan Bhujbal as co-coordinators to oversee the state government's efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-vows-to-incorporate-karnataka-occupied-areas-into-maharashtra-101610872943841.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Only 843 passengers travelled in Mumbai AC local train in 1 month||Nearly a month after the Central Railway began operating air-conditioned (AC) local train services for its mainline passengers between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan, the service has not been able to gain ridership.Less than 1,000 passengers travelled by the AC train after it was introduced on December 17, states the data shared by railway officials.Between December 17 and January 16, only 843 passengers travelled by the AC local train. Of them, 220 passengers were monthly season pass holders and others were single journey passengers. It means, on an average, a meagre 25 to 30 passengers travelled by the AC local train daily in the last one month.On December 20 and December 25, only three passengers travelled by the AC local train services, according to the daily statistics.Nearly 5,000 passengers can travel at a time in an A/C train on the route.The Central Railway introduced 10 AC local trains between CSMT and Kalyan railway stations on the slow railway line corridor. They are operated from Monday to Saturday. The fares of the AC local train are 1.3 times higher than the fares of normal local trains.Railway authorities have stated that they expect an increase in traffic after local train services resume for the general public.“We are constantly advertising about the AC local train and seeking passenger feedback. Implementation of feedback from passengers will be done before local train services resume for the general public. We are expecting the number of passengers to increase after the resumption of local train services for all,” said a senior Central Railway official.Currently, those working in the essential and emergency sectors, cancer patients and differently-abled persons are allowed to travel on local trains. From the third week of October, women commuters have also been allowed to travel in specified hours.The Central Railway has also started an online survey to find out commuting preferences for the passengers of the AC local train. Passengers were asked to name their preferred travel routes from among CSMT - Kalyan, CSMT- Dombivli, CSMT- Thane, CSMT-Kurla, CSMT- Vashi, CSMT- Belapur, CSMT- Panvel, CSMT- Bandra, CSMT- Andheri and CSMT- Goregaon routes.With an aim to increase the passenger footfall, the railway authorities have also started approaching offices to encourage staffers to travel on the AC local train.Passenger associations have claimed that a reduction in the fares of the AC local train for women passengers, senior citizens and students could help in increasing the ridership.“Employees working in private companies have their commute provided by the companies. Railways could charge first class fare from women, senior citizens and college students to attract more passengers. However, they are likely to increase only after train services reopen for the common people," said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-843-passengers-travelled-in-mumbai-ac-local-train-in-1-month-101610870738431.html

The incidents of crime, especially murders, daylight robberies and snatchings have recently shifted focus to the law and order situation in the state.Singhal, who assumed charge almost four months ago, expressed concern over the recent incidents of crime and inquired about the progress in the investigation in Rupesh Singh murder case.He held closed-door meetings with range IG, SSP, City SP and SIT members to discuss the progress of the probe. DGP later told mediapersons that the case was complicated and there murder could have been committed for either personal or professional reasons. He added that the police had some important clues after interrogating several persons and is expecting to work the case out, soon. The DGP also said that contract killers were employed to kill Rupesh Kumar.Singhal said that the forensics team, along with the SIT, was scientifically probing the case. He dismissed allegations that the law and order situation in the state was on the wane and said isolated incidents can’t be used for an effective assessment (of the situation).Police officials in the police headquarters said a breakthrough was likely in the case. “We are following some specific clues that might lead to the arrest of the suspects soon. Separate teams have raided places in Bihar as well as in Uttar Pradesh. All possible angles were probed in detail and we are ruling out one after the other,” said a police official, adding that some inmates lodged in high security blocks in central prisons across the State were also being questioned.The SIT was verifying information and the details would be disclosed at the right time. “No arrests have been made so far, but we will get a result soon,” the official said.Rupesh Kr Singh was sprayed with bullets while he waited inside his SUV for the gates of his residence at Punaichak locality in the city to open, after he returned from office on Tuesday evening.

Aurangzeb had a strong hatred for other religions. He tortured Sikhs and Hindus. Why should we pay attention to their relics? Who was Aurangzeb?

Taking up a petition by former Haryana IAS officer Sudeep Singh Dhillon, justice Arvind Singh Sangwan of the high court issued notice of motion to the CBI. “List again on February 24. In the meantime, the trial court is directed to adjourn the case beyond the date fixed by this court,’’ said the January 15 high court order. Dhillon, a former director of the town and country planning department, argued before the high court that the acquisition proceedings were initiated by the industries department and, therefore, the town and country planning had no direct role to play either in the acquisition or in the decision-making process of dropping the acquisition proceedings. The counsel for Dhillon contended that the chief secretary’s office while examining the sanction to prosecute sought by the CBI had in a file noting of January 19, 2018, exonerated him saying that his involvement in the acquisition or dropping of land acquisition proceedings in the Manesar matter have not been proved. The comments of the town and country planning and industries departments confirm this too, the petitioner said, quoting the government order. HOODA GOVT DROPPED 600 ACRES FROM ACQUISITION The then Congress government had in 2007 dropped about 600 acres in Manesar from the acquisition process on the orders of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The land was to be acquired for the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) for creating residential and recreational utilities in the Industrial Model Township (IMT) at Manesar. In 2015, the CBI registered a case under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code against unknown persons on a recommendation made by the BJP government in Haryana. The investigating agency filed a chargesheet in the trial court, accusing Hooda and three former IAS officers, ML Tayal, Chhatar Singh and SS Dhillon, besides others of dropping acquisition proceedings to help real estate builders. Builders were also named as accused. In 2018, the Supreme Court set aside the decision of Hooda government to drop land acquisition proceedings and directed the CBI to unravel the role of middlemen in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-directs-cbi-court-to-adjourn-manesar-land-case-till-after-february-24-101610867820374.html

The government has also approved ₹300 crore for the purchase and management of the multi post EVMs by the SEC, officials said.Additional chief secretary, panchayati raj, Amrit Lal Meena said, “The SEC will now purchase the EVMs from ECIL. The use of EVMs would make the election process more transparent and the counting process will be much quicker.”Secretary, SEC, Yogendra Ram also confirmed that the poll panel had received the approval from the panchayati raj department.The SEC will purchase 15,000 multi post EVMs for use during the panchayat polls. While the use of EVMs in rural polls in Bihar is going to take place for the first time, many other states, namely Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, have conducted panchayat polls using the voting machines in the last few years.The multi post EVMs are different from EVMs used in assembly and lok sabha polls as it has a central unit with six ballot unit for the six posts of ward member, gram panchayat, panch, sarpanch, mukhiya, panchayat samiti member and district board members to be contested in the elections.The SEC is giving final touches to the tentative schedule of panchayat elections for 2.58 lakh posts. The polls are likely to be held from March to May this year. 1.19 lakh polling stations have been identified so far.“As the voting will be done through EVMs, the counting will be done after the conclusion of each phase in districts by taking out the secure detachable memory module of the EVMs. It will allow the results to be declared in districts, where polling gets complete, within a couple of days of voting. This would also free up EVMs to be dispatched to districts, where the next phase of polling is scheduled,” said, an official in the SEC, who didn’t wish to be named.Panchayat polls in Bihar could be held in eight to nine phases depending on the availability of security forces and preparedness in districts.“We will be sending the schedule of election to the state government for approval soon. The election process would start from March onwards after the final publication of the ward-wise voters’ list, being prepared by the SEC,” said another SEC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/multi-post-evms-to-be-used-in-bihar-panchayat-polls-for-the-first-time-101610867334716.html

He added that the ‘development officer’, under whom the agent worked, has been summoned in the matter.Besides the birth certificate, proof of residence and a photograph are needed to open an insurance policy with the LIC. “We have apprised the top authorities in LIC of the matter and further departmental enquiries are being conducted,” an LIC official said on the condition of anonymity.This is not the only instance of institutions and official machinery’s suspected misuse. Earlier, Katihar circle office was in the spotlight for allegedly issuing a license of lending in the name of Dawood Ibrahim. However, Katihar circle officer Sonu Bhagat later denied that such license was ever issued to Dawood Ibrahim from his office.On December 15 last year, Katihar police had arrested five Afghan nationals from a rented house in Choudhary Mohalla under Katihar town police station; however, one Afghan national and the landlord have since been absconding.Seemanchal, due to its proximity to Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bangladesh borders, is considered a safe haven for anti national elements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-lic-office-under-lens-for-selling-insurance-policy-to-afghan-national-101610865354179.html

It will make things easier for the visitors who will have an option to go for short- and long- duration trips or a combination of them as per the time they have. They will be launched soon," said Ayodhya district magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha.Once these trips and walks start, all that the visitors will have to do is to book packages of their choice either over phone or online. "Walks obviously will be guided ones with an expert guide walking along and describing heritage, history, religious significance. The trips would be on package-provided vehicles," said a cultural department officer.So far, a total of six circuits have been finalised. For instance, there is a seven-hour package tour that would begin at 6.30 am every day from Laxman temple at Sahastradhara ghat. It will traverse through Chandrahari temple, Nageshwarnath temple, Ram Ki Paidi, Korea Park, Ramkatha Sangrahalaya, Vilvahari temple, Dashrath samadhi, Shitala Devi, Hanuman Gadhi, Kanak Bhawan and Shri Ram Janmabhoomi before culminating at Ram Ki Paidi.Another one will start at 12.30 pm each day from Hanuman Gadhi, passing through several places such as Kanak Bhawan, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi, various ghats, including Guptar ghat, Bharat Kund, will take the visitors to Ram Ki Paidi for Saryu Aarti.The biggest one (170 km long circuit) is ten-and-a-half-hour trip starting from Naya ghat at 8am. It will go to various temples and then to Saryu-Ghaghara Sangam (confluence of Saryu and Ghaghara rivers), Tusli ashram, Agastya ashram, Parashar ashram and then facilitate Saryu Aarti at Ram Ki Paidi—its final point.The one heritage walk finalised so far will begin at 6 am from Rin Mochan crossing, making visitors walk through Jhunki ghat, Gola ghat and Sahastradhara before ending at Maukhada tirth sthal."The state government is doing a lot of things to make it a prominent religious tourism city in the world. These tour packages and walks will make it convenient for the tourists and visitors once they land in Ayodhya," said the culture department officer."Already, the annual Deepotsava has won Ayodhya a lot of eyeballs globally and the Ayodhya administration is also engaged in renovating all religious, mythological, and historical sites under its Chaurasi kosi, Chaudaha kosi and Panch kosi parikrama (circumambulation). Along with shelters for pilgrims, there will also be arrangements of other basic facilities besides 'kuccha' routes for pilgrims on foot. A separate action plan has also been prepared for the development of major sites like Makhauda," the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/guided-tour-packages-heritage-walks-for-ayodhya-soon-101610861053686.html

17-01-2021||Delhi||Will set an example that the vaccine is safe, say Delhi’s 1st beneficiaries of Covid-19 jab||Most health care workers in the national capital who volunteered to take the first shot of the Covid-19 jab said they were doing it to set an example that the vaccine was safe, as the world’s largest immunisation programme against the coronavirus disease kicked off across the country on Saturday.From sanitation workers to hospital administration clerks, from senior doctors to ambulance drivers, those who volunteered to take the vaccine shot said they would lead the way in inspiring confidence in the antidotes by defeating the virus.Though civil defence volunteers and police personnel were posted outside Delhi’s 81 vaccination centres to manage crowds and keep intact law-and-order, there were no reports of any untoward incidents from any of these points.Until Saturday evening, 4,319 of the scheduled 8,100 persons had got vaccinated in Delhi. Hospital authorities said some who were to get the jab said they were not in the city, or cited personal reasons. Authorities said the absentees could also be attributed to a glitch in the CoWIN app, and to people either being on duty or on leave.“It could be because people wanted to wait and watch what happens. It could also be that some of them were on duty or in quarantine,” said a senior doctor from GTB hospital.A senior doctor from Lady Hardinge Medical College said that a technical snag on Friday night resulted in fewer people turning up for vaccination. At Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, many doctors said they did not want to take a Covaxin jab, which the facility had received.While only 32 workers were vaccinated at Lok Nayak hospital, 45 were given their first doses at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (RGSS) hospital.Each centre had a target of vaccinating 100 people on Saturday.Dr Ajeet Jain, nodal officer of Covid-19 and cardio surgeon at RGSS hospital, “There is vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers despite conducting multiple counselling sessions.”But those who visited the vaccination centres called the process “smooth and effective”. Those who received Covaxin doses had to sign a consent form since it is being administered under a clinical trial.At most centres, health care workers, who received the vaccine shot on the first day, were welcomed by their colleagues with gift hampers and sweets. While a gift hamper with chocolates, chips, and juice were distributed at RGSS hospital, workers at Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital were greeted with sweets.Several hospitals, including Max Hospital in Saket, decorated their premises to mark the first day of the vaccination drive.On Saturday morning, the process started with the beneficiaries showing the SMS received on their phone regarding their appointment. This was checked by the civil defence volunteers deputed at the front desk by the office of the district magistrate of Central Delhi. The process also included noting the name, phone number of the beneficiary along with an additional phone number of a person close to the person, who would be informed in case of any side-effect.Once verified with a photo identification document, beneficiaries were asked to sit in a waiting room while maintaining social distance. The beneficiaries then went inside and got the vaccine shots. After which they were sent to the observation room for 30 minutes to check on any possible symptoms.“It took around 45 minutes for the entire process to get over. I can vouch for the vaccine as I feel no discomfort even 2 hours after taking the first shot. Each person who is getting vaccinated is being informed about the type of vaccine being administered before the injection,” said Dr Abhishek Bhowmick, 32, a senior resident doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital.The hospital was inspected by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, state health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev and health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt. Kejriwal also interacted with two beneficiaries, including Atmaja Priyadarshini Nayak, a nursing officer. “I was vaccinated in the presence of the chief minister. He also asked about my wellbeing. I have not witnessed any side-effect,” the 37-year-old said.Biji Tony, a nursing officer in Lok Nayak hospital, was the first to get the Covishield vaccine at the state-run facility.At Delhi state cancer institute, 46 healthcare workers were vaccinated on the first day. Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer of vaccination at the institute and Head of Department (HoD) Clinical Oncology, volunteered to take the first shot at the institute. “I decided to take the first shot in an effort to inculcate confidence among my team members,” she said.At around 12:20 am, health care and paramedical staff at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in Tahirpur welcomed their colleague Dr Akansha Rathore.A senior resident at the hospital, Dr Rathor had been on Covid-19 duty from the beginning of the outbreak. “I am proud and overwhelmed at the same time. I did not face any discomfort. I request people to not believe rumours and participate in the vaccination drive.”RGSS hospital saw 45 vaccinations on day one. Dr Vikas Dogra, head of department of the school of pulmonology, was the first person to get the vaccine shot there. Vinish Kumar, 30, a nursing staff complained of some discomfort after the shot. However, he was immediately shifted to the emergency room for further observation. “Immediately after taking the shot, it felt as though my blood pressure had fluctuated. I informed the doctor and they immediately examined me. After staying in observation for an hour, I feel absolutely fine now. There is no discomfort anymore,” he said.The vaccination process was smooth at Charak Palika Hospital (CPH), Moti Bagh, the only civic bodies run hospital designated for the vaccination in the first phase. Dr CK Bakshi, CMO coordination for Covid-19 activities in New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said that the vaccines, received on January 15, were preserved on the hospital campus. “The vaccine drive commenced at 11.30 am on Saturday. One the first day we administered vaccine shots to 43 beneficiaries including doctors, nurses, paramedic staff, and other hospital staff. As many as 671 healthcare staff have volunteered to get inoculated at the hospital in the first phase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-set-an-example-that-the-vaccine-is-safe-say-delhi-s-1st-beneficiaries-of-covid-19-jab-101610827983185.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||One small jab, a giant leap for Delhi||A total of 4,319 healthcare workers — 53.3% of those registered — received the Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi on Saturday, becoming the first batch of people to be inoculated as India launched one of the biggest immunisation campaigns to control the coronavirus disease.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal assured people about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, saying “there is no need to worry” and urged people to continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing. State health minister Satyendar Jain described the drive as successful.Experts attributed the low turnout mostly to vaccine hesitancy but added that since no major adverse events were reported on Saturday, more people will join the drive on Monday.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Lok Nayak hospital where 32 healthcare workers turned up for vaccination.While the next Covid-19 vaccination will be held on Monday at the same centres, each site has been allowed to vaccinate a maximum of 100 people a day.“I want to say to all not to pay attention to rumours and misinformation. The experts say vaccines are safe and there is no need to worry,” Kejriwal said.“Every person who has been vaccinated is happy, nobody is experiencing any problems. We have started this at 81 sites, and we will increase this number to 175 in the coming days. As and when the vaccine supply increases, we will start vaccination at 1,000 sites,” Kejriwal said after inspecting the arrangements at Lok Nayak hospital.The inoculation drive was launched at 81 centres or vaccination sites in Delhi with just one serious adverse event following immunization (AEFI) reported in the south district. Of the 4,319 beneficiaries, 51 reported minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection and fever. South and southwest districts reported the highest number of minor AEFI with each reporting 11 such cases.The exercise proceeded smoothly at all centres with no major glitches being reported from anywhere.The Delhi heath minister said once the 240,000 registered healthcare workers are vaccinated, nearly 600,000 frontline workers will be next in line.Senior government officials said the turnout was better in the city’s private hospitals with Max Saket vaccinating all of its 100 registered beneficiaries. Sir Ganga Ram hospital vaccinated 88 healthcare workers, while Indraprastha Apollo saw 72 of them.Among the government hospitals, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) vaccinated 95 people with a couple of them being turned away with fever and other symptoms.The drive started after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, after 11am. Almost all centres, including GTB hospital and AIIMS, had installed LED televisions to live broadcast the PM’s speech which was shown to the beneficiaries to boost their morale.At AIIMS, a sanitation worker, Manish Kumar, was the first to get the jab. He was followed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and NITI Ayog member Dr VK Paul with his wife Dr Shashi Paul – all three were administered a dose of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Allaying apprehensions over Covaxin, Dr Guleria said, “We may keep arguing about which vaccine is good and which is better, at the end of the day all the vaccines that are safe and efficacious will help in saving lives and reducing mortality..”Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College said, “Vaccine hesitancy had a major role to play when it came to the low vaccination rate on Saturday. Many people were comparing the two vaccines. But, with no major adverse events reported, I think more people will come forward in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/one-small-jab-a-giant-leap-for-delhi-101610827603041.html
17-01-2021||Other||Increased criminal activities on Friday nights, Ludhiana police increase vigil||With Friday nights becoming notorious for increased criminal activities, especially burglaries, the Ludhiana police has increased vigil near banks and ATMs for this night of the week.Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that Friday nights are sensitive for the police as gangs of snatchers and burglars are the most active at this time due to impending weekend closure. “Most offices and shops operate for five days a week and remain shut on Saturdays and Sundays. Burglars target such establishments on Friday night as after executing the crime, they get ample time to hide or flee the city, as it takes owners or employees at least two days to discover the incident. Most owners remain clueless about the incident till Monday morning.”“A lot of shopkeepers also keep all their sales in the shops on Friday as some banks don’t conduct public dealing during weekends. Moreover, the banks also keep their ATMs loaded with money as people do more transactions on weekends,” he added.Besides, the fog cover during winter nights also helps miscreant to hide. To deter such criminal activities, at least 110 patrolling teams are deployed at major spots, markets, roundabouts, banks and other financial institutions. Three gazetted officers also make rounds of the city on rotation. Police officials said that on other nights too, the security is tight as 80 to 90 patrolling parties keep vigil in the city.The police commissioner said that the cops have already indentified sensitive points in the city which are prone to become targets of such miscreants and beefed up security.Besides, the heightened security also helps keep a check on revelers who become more active before weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/increased-criminal-activities-on-friday-nights-ludhiana-police-increase-vigil-101610827432864.html

I salute all health and frontline workers who have been serving the city through the toughest time of Covid-19 in April, May and June. It is our duty to honour this work, and hence they have been selected to receive the first vaccine doses. In Mumbai, we built Covid-19 centres like BKC, and this was all possible due to health and frontline workers.”Dr Madhura Patil, a dietician at the Asian Heart hospital, received the first shot at BKC, while Dr Deepak Sawant, former health minister and Shiv Sena member of legislative council (MLC), was the first person to receive the coronavirus vaccine shot at Mumbai’s Cooper Hospital, after the Prime Minister’s address to the country via teleconference at 10.30 am.Thackeray also urged Mumbaiites to continue the use of masks, and measures such as handwashing and social distancing, despite being vaccinated. “Even after taking vaccine, we will have to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Thackeray said.When asked to comment on the safety concerns raised around Covaxin, which is still in the trial stage, Thackeray said on Saturday, “The Centre takes the decision about which vaccine is to administered. Considering the Prime Minister has launched the vaccine drive today, there should not be any hesitation in the minds of citizens regarding the safety of any vaccine.”The state has received the vaccines from the centre, for emergency usage for health and frontline workers. We do not have clarity on when it [vaccines] will be available for all citizens, Thackeray said. He also said the vaccine is being administered for free for health workers on Saturday. Decisions regarding cost will be taken following further guidelines from the centre.The nine vaccination centres in the city are the four major hospitals — King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital where 243 health workers were vaccinated on the first day, BYL Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central where 190 were vaccinated, Cooper Hospital where 262 people were vaccinated, and Sion Hospital where 188 people were vaccinated; four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha hospital at Bandra where 149 people were vaccinated, V N Desai hospital at Santacruz where 80 people were vaccinated, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar where 289 were vaccinated, and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar hospital, Kandivli, where 266 were vaccinated; and the Covid-19 facility at BKC where 220 were vaccinated . The state-run JJ Hospital is the 10th vaccination centre in the city where 39 people were vaccinated.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “1,926 health workers were vaccinated on Saturday. No adverse incident was reported. On Sunday, the drive will start at 9am, so we will get three or four hours more, up to 5pm, so the number of people who will receive their vaccine shots on Sunday will increase. We have already supplied enough vaccine doses to all centres in the city from the storage facility in Parel, to suffice for a week.” Mumbai received 139,500 vaccine vials from the Serum Institute of India (SII) on Tuesday this week.Dr Rajesh Dhere, dean, BKC Covid-19 vaccination centre, said, “No adverse effect has been reported in any vaccine beneficiary yet. But one 32 year-old health worker had reported anxiety post vaccination. We counselled her and she is fine.”Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital, who is a member of Covid-19 taskforce and who took the vaccine at BKC, said, “By keeping faith and trust on the government and scientists who have worked hard for the Covid-19 vaccine, I appeal to all health workers and frontline workers to take the vaccine.”Dr Madhura Patil, the first person to receive the vaccine at BKC jumbo facility, said, “When I came to know that I was selected for vaccination, I was more than willing to take it. We have been working hard throughout the pandemic, and this vaccination drive dedicated to us is something that every health and frontline worker should take benefit of. I did not experience any adverse effect after undertaking the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1926-health-workers-in-mumbai-vaccinated-101610826478553.html

However, she kept the matter a secret as her family was wary of her getting the inoculation. “A doctor informed me about this vaccination around a month ago and I agreed. However, my 18-year old daughter opposed my decision so I went ahead without telling anybody as I am not one to break a commitment,” she said. “We are a family of five but no one knows that I was going to get the first vaccine shot. Had they known, they would have never allowed me to come,” said Saroj. A resident of sector 11, Haripur, Saroj said she had joined the dispensary around 20 years ago at a salary of ₹500. With time, her salary was increased to ₹1,000 and now she earns ₹5,800 per month. She says she did not deviate from her routine even amid the pandemic. “I did not take any leave.

17-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccine drive Day 1: 50 vaccinators inoculate hundreds in Mumbai||On Day One of the nationwide mass Covid-19 immunisation programme, around 50 vaccinators inoculated hundreds of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the city. For a majority of vaccinators, most of whom were nurses attached to the hospital’s immunisation centres, administering a jab felt like a personal victory against Covid-19.For the last 10 months during the ongoing pandemic, these vaccinators have witnessed the deadly outbreak of coronavirus very closely, while taking care of infected patients. Janhavi More, 52, was stationed at BYL Nair Hospital on Saturday as a vaccinator. Her husband contracted the virus on July 23 and was admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Karuna Hospital, Borivli. After five days, he was moved out of ICU. “I know the feeling when your loved ones contract the virus. Now, with a vaccine in my hand, I feel that we have won the battle against the virus,” said More. Shraddha More, who was among three vaccinators stationed at the government-run Sir JJ Hospital, also witnessed the virus close at hand. In April, her husband had contracted the virus and was hospitalised for a week.“We have come a long way. Today, I felt like the goddess Durga, weaponed with Covid-19 vaccine in my hands,” she added.The vaccinators were thrilled and excited to provide vaccines to HCWs. Some even visited temples before going to their immunisation centres. Rucha Salgaonkar, in-charge of nurses at Nair Hospital and one of the vaccinators at the hospital said, “It is an emotional day for us. We have worked tirelessly for months. In the initial days of the pandemic, we didn’t even go home to our family to maintain social distance. We have seen patients die before our eyes. So, this is an extremely important day for us.” Though the vaccinators have years of experience inoculating lakhs of children up to five years, they were trained by the state health department before starting the mass immunisation programme. Sweta Rane from Shatabdi Hospital, Kandivli, said, “We have also been trained to identify and take care of beneficiaries, in case they develop any adverse reaction, like allergy or dizziness, and to respond to queries posed by beneficiaries.”However, it was the first time on Saturday that they vaccinated adults with a new vaccine. When asked, Rane said that it was nothing different from the routine immunisation process, except that the vaccine was new. However, vaccinators also observed anxiety and anticipation among some HCWs about taking the vaccine. “When we vaccinate children, their level of acceptance is high. But among adults, some were sceptical about the vaccine and asked us different questions about safety rules. But overall, the response has been quite promising,” said Janhavi.Joyas Thanchand, a vaccinator stationed at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital said they had to counsel a few anxious beneficiaries during the immunisation process. “I wish to get vaccinated soon. As a healthcare worker who has worked closely with Covid-19 patients, it is my responsibility to boost confidence among the public and encourage them to take the vaccine,” said Janhavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-vaccine-drive-day-1-50-vaccinators-inoculate-hundreds-in-mumbai-101610825332513.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||Air ‘severe’ despite improved wind speeds||An unexpected weather phenomenon, which washed off pollutants hanging in the air, along with improved wind speeds, came to Delhi’s rescue once again on Saturday, saving the city from what was supposed to have been a severely polluted day.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Saturday was 407, in the ‘severe’ zone, as against the 460 recorded on Friday.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Friday forecasted that the air quality of Delhi was on its way to sliding into the ‘severe plus’ or ‘emergency’ levels on Saturday. Even though till 10am on Saturday, Delhi was engulfed in a thick blanket of fog, as the day progressed this fog condensed and melted the pollutants that had accumulated.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that on Saturday morning the fog cover over Delhi condensed and precipitated, washing the accumulated pollution particles with it.“Even though dense fog conditions usually leads to a rise in pollution levels, sometimes the fog condenses and precipitates. In simpler words, when the moisture level in the air increases beyond a point, it flushes and clears the atmosphere. The average wind speed during the day was also around 7-8 kmph, which made conducive conditions for the air to clear off,” said Soni.IMD recordings show this phenomenon more clearly. At 8.30 am the relative humidity, which is essentially the moisture content in the air, was 100%.Soni said that from Sunday afternoon the wind direction will change from north-westerly to easterly and this will bring further relief for Delhiites.“There is also a forecast of another western disturbance impacting Delhi. Even though this western disturbance will not bring any rainfall in the plains, it will improve the wind speed in Delhi and the NCR towns, and this will lead to a further improvement in the air,” she added.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that from 1am to 10am on Saturday, Delhi experienced a prolonged fog spell, which reduced the visibility to zero metres for several hours.Despite the dense fog, the minimum temperatures in the city rose to 6.6 degrees Celsius, which was only one degree below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official recording for the entire city, was 19.1 degrees Celsius.“On Sunday too, the temperature is expected to remain in the same range. However, after the wind direction changes to easterly, in the next week, the mercury will rise and even reach around 10 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-severe-despite-improved-wind-speeds-101610824798631.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai records lowest temperature of the year, breathes cleanest air||The city woke up to a chilly Saturday morning as temperatures dropped to 16.6 degrees Celsius, the lowest so far this year. Mumbaiites also breathed the cleanest air so far, this year, with air quality index (AQI) at 162.The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal. This is the second-lowest minimum temperature recorded this season following a mercury drop to 16 degrees Celsius on December 22 last year. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, which was at par with the normal temperature. The IMD attributed this drop in temperature to the cold westerly winds. “There was a chill in the air as westerly winds have started blowing over parts of the state. Since parts of north-west India are under the influence of a cold wave, north-westerly winds from these parts are colder. The minimum temperature in the state is expected to see gradual fall in the state in the coming days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of the western region, IMD. Maximum temperatures also remained low compared to the beginning of the week. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 31.2 degrees Celsius, which just normal. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 29.6 degrees Celsius which was 1.6 degrees below normal. Meanwhile, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), air quality improved further on Saturday. An overall AQI of 162 (moderate), was recorded on Saturday morning. This is better than Friday’s 190. “Winds blowing from the north and west has cleared the air of pollutants. If the wind continues, air quality will remain moderate for the next couple of days, despite a drop in temperatures. However, without the winds, air quality may become worse,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 365 (very poor). Andheri was a distant second among the 10 locations with an AQI of 221.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-year-breathes-cleanest-air-101610825092332.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||High pollution levels turn giant lung billboard at Kharghar, near Mumbai black in a day||A giant pair of artificial lungs fitted with filters and fans to mimic the human lungs, which was fitted in Kharghar by an environmental organisation on Friday, has started turning black within a day.A similar installation was set up in Bandra last January but it took 14 days to turn completely black. The installation changing colour within a day of being set up has caused concerns about increasing pollution levels among residents. This comes four weeks after a study found that air pollution levels on the outskirts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) along the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt are above safe limits for nearly two-thirds of the day, with peak pollution during early morning hours posing a threat to morning walkers and joggers. Kavita Choutmal, mayor of the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC), who visited the site, has demanded the setting up of an expert committee to study the deteriorating air quality in the area. “There is an urgent need to understand the cause of such high levels of air pollution in this belt and then work on solutions. However, the PCMC and MPCB (Maharashtra Pollution Control Board) needs to immediately take strict action against industries in Taloja MIDC as well as nearby areas that are not following norms and causing air pollution,” said Choutmal.The artificial lungs, called the lung billboard, was installed to demonstrate the effect of pollution levels on the lungs by the Waatavaran Foundation, a non-government organisation. The installation is placed near the Bank of India Chowk at Sector 7.Designed by the digital advocacy group Jhatkaa.org, the artificial lungs are made up of a white filter medium. A pair of fans are fixed at the back of the billboard to suck in the air, in a bid to mimic the functions of lungs while breathing.“Such visuals (like the billboard) are important methods to raise awareness about finer particles bringing out a vivid image on how they impact the lungs. Air quality spikes could be mostly due to vehicular emissions in these areas. The impact needs to happen across all stakeholders to understand how various sources of pollution are contributing to this issue,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.“Over the next few days and weeks, particulate matter from different sources will begin getting trapped in the filters. This will lead to the lungs changing colour- from chalk-white to brown to black. The billboard is also fitted with a digital air quality monitor that will record and display the real-time Air Quality Index (AQI),” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder of Waatavaran.On Saturday, even as the overall air quality of Mumbai remained in the moderate category, in Navi Mumbai it was in the very poor category with an AQI of 365. BOX:A study released by Waatavaran in December 2020 found extremely high levels of PM2.5 in the air, especially between 6am and 8am, and average air quality above safe standards for 17 hours every day in the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt. The data from five locations – Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Taloja; Sector 13, Panvel; Navade, Taloja; Sector 7 and 36, Kharghar, showed average PM2.5 levels over 31 days was 101.12 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3), which is almost twice the national safe standard (60μg/m3), and four times the World Health Organization (WHO) standard (25μg/m3). The highest PM2.5 concentration was at 7am at 141.1μg/m3 (average data from five monitors). MIDC Taloja had the most polluted air among five locations at 197.4 μg/m3 at 7am. PM2.5 data was accessed using five low-cost air quality monitors between November 13 and December 13 and then analysed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-pollution-levels-turn-giant-lung-billboard-at-kharghar-near-mumbai-black-in-a-day-101610824972336.html

In a temporary relief to management studies students of NL Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research, Mira Road who had alleged illegal collection of fee by the institute, the FRA issued a notification on Thursday stating, “It is clarified that students in 2019-20 batch are not required to pay any amount, on any count, more than whatever approved by the FRA till the issue is decided by the FRA.” HT has reviewed the notification. Seema Saini, chief executive officer and administrative head of NL Dalmia Institute of Management Studies and Research, was unavailable for a comment. FRA had approved an annual fee of ₹1.87 lakh for the academic year 2019-20. Several students from the 2019-20 batch had earlier written to FRA complaining that the institute was charging almost ₹2.3 lakh over and above what was approved by the regulatory body. Based on the complaints, FRA, which regulates fees of all professional courses offered by colleges in Maharashtra, had sought a response from the college. “The college has admitted that for the value-added course, they (the institute) are collecting an extra fee from students. The entitlement to collect extra fees is under consideration of FRA,” the body said in its notification. Meanwhile, students alleged they were being forced to withdraw their complaints. “The institute is forcing us to sign letters to FRA withdrawing our complaints unconditionally.

Most municipal corporations had to conduct the drive manually as the server was down. Thane district had to temporarily suspend the vaccination process for more than an hour on Saturday.Kailas Pawar, civil health surgeon, Thane district, said, “Despite the delay at the start, we managed to complete vaccination of all the 100 beneficiaries by 4.30pm. As the CoWIN portal was overloaded, we had to resort to manually feeding the data of all the beneficiaries. However, we managed to successfully complete the first day of vaccination with no major hurdles.”Pawar was the first to get vaccinated at the civil hospital followed by which there was a delay of around one-and-a-half hours.“We arrived at around 10.45am at the hospital for the vaccination but had to wait till 1pm to get vaccinated due to the technical glitch. However, the vaccination was a pain-free process and it was executed smoothly,” said Dr Jinal Rokade, dental surgeon.The Thane Municipal Corporation and Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation authorities had to individually call all the beneficiaries on Friday night to inform about the vaccination process and allot time slots accordingly due to the issues faced by the CoWIN portal. Glitches were seen in three centres of Kalyan-Dombivli, where the drive was conducted manually from 10.50am.“There was a guideline from the state on Friday that if the online system doesn’t work, vaccination should be carried out on time and the details of the beneficiaries shall be recorded manually. We followed the same. We will update the data on the server later,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC.Meanwhile, a major delay was observed in Navi Mumbai as the vaccination drive at its four centres began only at around 1pm due to technical error. The entire process was finally carried out offline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/technical-glitches-mark-vaccination-drive-across-thane-district-101610824313144.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||CoWIN loses: Maharashtra Covid vaccination drive on halt for 2 days||The day Maharashtra kickstarted the Covid-19 immunisation programme, it was put on hold for two days to fix the glitches in the CoWIN app, even as the state vaccinated 18,338 or 64.34% of the targeted health workers on Saturday.The next session will be held on Tuesday, according to the press release issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “We expect the issue to be resolved by Sunday evening, but we wouldn’t be in position to reach out to the beneficiaries to resume it on Monday. As the government wants the data entry online only, we have decided to not resume it before Tuesday,” a health department official said.Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission, said, “As no vaccination sessions were planned on January 17 or 18, the question of cancellation does not arise. The sessions will be organised next week as per the Centre’s guidelines.”Many districts faced technical glitches in the CoWIN app that resulted in communication lags. “The server went slow leading to difficulties in uploading the data at many centres. In Dhule district, all four centres faced the problem. We have now directed the vaccination teams to register the details offline and upload them subsequently. We had to use hard copies of data on beneficiaries,” said Dr PD Gandal, deputy director, health services, Nashik division. “We couldn’t send out messages as the server slowed down on Friday night. The issue was resolved by 2am,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department. Health officials also said the low turnout was a result of technical glitches in the app and concerns among beneficiaries. Barring 10 cases of mild reaction in some districts, no major side effects or Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) were reported in the state. The state is holding four sessions a week and is expected to complete about 4.4 lakh health care workers in 15 sessions over 28 days. The stock of 963,000 vials could cover about 4.4 lakh health workers with two doses each. Based on the allotted stock, the state plans to carry out the immunisation drive over the next 28 days and will demand additional stock at the earliest. Mumbai vaccinated 48.5% – 1,926 of 4,000 – of the people planned, Pune (1,795 of 3,100), Nagpur (776 of 1,200), Nashik (745 of 1,300) and Aurangabad (647 of 1,000). Districts like Hingoli (100%), Beed (90.2%) and Buldhana (95.83%) saw a high percentage of inoculation. “We always expect 100% turnout, but technical glitches in the app led to delay in sending alerts to the beneficiaries about their turn, which in turn hit the response. We have sent messages to the beneficiaries only a day prior to the vaccination, which may be why many couldn’t make it,” said Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer. According to another official from the state health department, some beneficiaries are in ‘wait and watch’ mindset and are expected to turn up gauging the results of the vaccination in the initial days. In six districts of Nagpur division, the turnout percentage was 63%, while in four districts of Latur division it was 68%. “We will accommodate the beneficiaries left out today in the next few days. The response from the beneficiaries will increase from next week,” said Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director, health services, Nagpur division. Thane district saw 79.39% vaccination, as 1,826 of the 2,300 beneficiaries got vaccinated in 23 centres. The district saw no major glitches apart from a server error. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation was the only corporation in the city to complete 100% vaccination target, as the drive began on time and ended on time with no chaos. Mira-Bhayander reported 89.33%, Thane city 88.25%, Navi Mumbai 75.75%, Ulhasnagar 71%, Thane rural 69.40% and Bhiwandi Nizampur 61.33%. Abhijeet Bangar, NMMC commissioner, said the number is likely to increase in the coming days. Thane district collector Rajesh Narvekar inaugurated the vaccination drive in the city. “This is a day of pride and happiness,” said Narvekar. Dr Patil said very few complained of giddiness, nausea and inflammation. “We vaccinated 2.92 crore people during our measles and rubella mass vaccination drive last year. The backup machinery to take care of any reaction was ready for any major reaction, but no beneficiary was required to be admitted,” he said. When asked about the short supply of the vaccines, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said it was the responsibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that all states get proportionate number of vaccines. “I do not want to politicise it,” he said. Thackeray, who inaugurated the drive at BKC in Mumbai at 11.30am on Saturday, said there was no clarity if common people will get free vaccine as the call has to be taken by the Centre. “People are happy to get inoculated and have been waiting for their turn. I am sure once the prioritised groups are vaccinated in next three-four months, the vaccine will be available for even general public. We are also going to ask for the additional stock of the vaccines during our video conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan,” said Rajesh Tope, state health minister. Dr Padmaja Saraf was the first beneficiary at the Jalna district hospital. She said, “After having gone through very challenging times at the hospital when the pandemic was at the peak, I am happy that the vaccine is now available. The vaccine is very safe and everybody should go for it whenever available,” she said. Meanwhile, the state reported 2,910 cases and 52 deaths on Saturday, taking the tally to 1,987,678 and toll to 50,388. Mumbai clocked 571 cases and 8 new deaths taking the tally to 3,02,226 and toll to 11,237. Maharashtra has 51,965 active patients, with the highest number of patients in Pune, 15,887, followed by 9,608 in Thane and 6,966 in Mumbai. The state’s recovery rate stands at 94.79% as 18,84,127 patients have been recovered. The state’s case fatality rate stands at 2.54%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cowin-loses-maharashtra-covid-vaccination-drive-on-halt-for-2-days-101610824252801.html

17-01-2021||Mumbai||Lower turnout likely to lead to Covid vaccine wastage, say health officers in Maharashtra||rupsa.chakraborty@htlive.com The Maharashtra government on Saturday morning cited concerns over the possible wastage of vaccine vials if the turnout of healthcare workers (HCW) for inoculation was lower than the registrations. Each of the 10 vaccination centre is capable of inoculating 100 HCWs. The health department has provided 10 vials of vaccine for every unit and each vial can vaccinate 10 people. Once opened, a vial cannot be preserved more than eight hours. Thus, if vaccination centres get fewer healthcare workers, the remaining opened dosages will go to waste. For instance, if any vaccination unit gets 92 HCWs, then the remaining eight dosages will get wasted. “It is expected that if the vaccination centres don’t get a calculated number of HCWs, then it will lead to wastage of dosages. But this won’t happen always. As we start the immunisation programme for a higher number of people, we can make optimum use of vaccine doses,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of state health services. Dr Patil urged all registered HCWs to come forward and get vaccinated. “All HCWs have worked round the clock during the pandemic, risking their lives. It is now time to come forward and set an example for the general public. This will boost up the citizens’ confidence too in the vaccine,” she added. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani, who has worked throughout the pandemic, said it is an emotional day. “We have been waiting for months for a vaccine that can bring an end to the pandemic. Now, finally the day has come...We hope to complete vaccinating the HCWs in the next 10-15 days. I would urge the registered HCWs to get themselves vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lower-turnout-likely-to-lead-to-covid-vaccine-wastage-say-health-officers-in-maharashtra-101610823714240.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body starts inoculation as healthcare workers queue up for Covid-19 vaccine jab||The nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive reached the city on Saturday morning. The drive in India is the largest inoculation exercise in the world. In Mumbai, 40 vaccination booths have been set up in 10 vaccination centres. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) achieved 48.15% of its target of administering vaccines to 4,000 frontline workers on the first day before the vaccination drive was suspended till January 18 due to glitches in the Covid vaccine intelligence network (CoWIN) app.The 10 vaccination centres in Mumbai were decked up on the first day of the vaccination drive. Some, like the centres at BYL Nair Hospital and the Covid-19 jumbo centre at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), had selfie spots where people can take photos with the message “I got my Covid-19 vaccine” in the background. “Since it was the first day of vaccination, some centres reported crowding but the system will be gradually be channelised better to stop the gathering of beneficiaries,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.At around 8.30am, the “vaccine van” carrying 500 units of Covishield reached Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital at Vile Parle, where it was welcomed by cheering staffers. Covishield is the Indian variant of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Cooper Hospital’s nursing staff welcomed the vaccine van with arti, applause and sweets. After the vaccines were unloaded, the sweets were distributed and cheers of “hip hip hurray” could be heard.At Sion Hospital, before starting the vaccination drive, dean Dr Mohan Joshi gave an emotional lecture to staffers, in which he recounted the past 10 months of the Covid-19 pandemic and thanked all medical staffers for their tireless service. Despite last-minute delays in informing registered healthcare workers (HCWs) of the timing and location of vaccination centres, 1,926 HCWs (including doctors, nurses, accredited social health activists (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers were able to reach the centres. BMC had said it would vaccinate 4,000 HCWs on the first day, but around 48.15% HCWs received the vaccines.Owing to the slow server, health officers couldn’t send messages about the place and timing for the vaccination using the CoWin app, which has been developed by the Centre to monitor the inoculation drive. “This [technical failure] will further increase the work of officers. So, the decision has been taken to halt it [vaccination] for two days. The final decision will be taken on Monday if the app starts functioning properly,” said Kakani. Due to these glitches, none of the beneficiaries got vaccination certificates on Saturday and BMC officials said they were unable to update data manually on the excel sheet recording beneficiaries, which is maintained by the state health department. After a low turnout in the first few hours, footfall increased in the afternoon. Among senior citizen HCWs was Dr Devadhvala Dilnazj, 75, a retired anaesthetist reached BYL Nair Hospital by 9.30am and was the first to get vaccinated at the hospital. Beneficiaries had to show identity cards (most showed PAN cards), following which they were given token numbers. Until their token number was called, they had to wait in the waiting areas which were quickly overcrowded and the requisite distancing could not be maintained. There were long queues at vaccination centres in Cooper and Shatabdi hospitals, and at the jumbo centre in BKC.Dr Dilip Patil, state surveillance officer said there was no adverse side effects of the vaccine. On Saturday, there were 22 minor incidents of side effects like headache, pain at a local side, tenderness and dizziness . “This is normal in all kinds of vaccination where such minor side effects are recorded. There is no case of severe or major side effects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-starts-inoculation-as-healthcare-workers-queue-up-for-covid-19-vaccine-jab-101610823593978.html

Choutmal visited the giant-sized billboard on Saturday.“Air pollution is a major concern and the civic body’s environment department will work on finding measures. We will try to form an expert committee in the coming days with the help of the environment department of the civic body ,” said Choutmal.Titled as ‘The Billboard that Breathes’ these artificial lungs have been put up near Sector 7. Kharghar.The giant pair of lungs are made up of a white filter medium. A pair of fans are fixed at the back of the billboard, which suck in the air. Gradually, particulate matter will get trapped in the filters and change colour from chalk-white to brown to black. The billboard is also fitted with a digital air quality monitor that records and displays the real-time Air Quality Index (AQI).“In 15 days, it will show how much pollution exists in the area. The giant lungs billboard is a way to create awareness about the health impacts of air pollution. When we placed a similar billboard in Bandra, Mumbai it took 14 days to go completely black but in Kharghar the colour has begun changing a day after installation itself,” said Bhagwan Keshbhat, founder of the foundation.Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB, said, “Such visuals are important to raise awareness about finer particles bringing out a vivid image on how they impact the lungs. Air quality spikes could be mostly due to vehicular emissions in these areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navi-mumbai-plea-to-form-panel-to-check-air-quality-in-kharghar-taloja-belt-101610823592324.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t believe in rumours, get vaccinated, say medical workers||Covid-19 inoculation drive for health workers, which kick started on Saturday, saw a lower than expected turnout. Around 50% of beneficiaries visited the 10 vaccination centres in the city. While all the centres had set a target of inoculating 500 people each on Saturday, only around 200 on an average reached the centres for their vaccination. The vaccination process started from 11am after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed health workers across the nation.Initially, some of the prime vaccination centres such as the one at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and RN Cooper Hospital at Juhu witnessed chaos due to overcrowding, which fizzled out later in the day.While the overcrowding due to the presence of media persons, beneficiaries and medical staff at the centres did not deter the vaccination process, some mismanagement was reported which inconvenienced beneficiaries. Many beneficiaries said they were informed about the vaccination at the eleventh hour. This, however, was due to the snag reported in CoWIN application on Friday evening.The beneficiaries appealed to the citizens to volunteer for vaccination when it starts and not believe in rumours.With 10 booths at the vaccination centre in Cooper hospital, some beneficiaries faced inconvenience while some got emotional.While the general public dealt with some bad situations during the lockdown, health workers witnessed numbers of Covid deaths and felt helpless most of the time: This is how Dr Naina Dalvi, anaesthesia professor and Covid ICU in-charge at Cooper hospital, recalls the initial days of the pandemic.Dalvi was the fourth one to get vaccinated at Cooper hospital and has supervised the dry run carried out at the Cooper vaccination centre. “It was an emotional moment to get vaccinated. For the past 10 months, we have seen people dying. There were times when we were helpless. It was a painful situation. Today, I can see that battle coming to an end and nothing can be better than this,” Dalvi said who almost broke into tears.On the other hand, Vitthal Pardeshi, mukadam at Nanavati Hospital, faced inconvenience as he had to wait for three hours after pulling all-nighters at his workplace. The 60-year-old commutes for two hours every day to reach his home in Kalyan. “I had reached at 9.30am and could only get vaccinated by 12.30pm. I stood for three hours in the queue and now I have to go home and come back to office for my 10pm-7am shift. It’s ridiculous,” Pardeshi said. The turnout of beneficiaries was equally low at BKC centre. A couple of patients had also complained.Dr Sachin Jain from Hinduja Hospital, Khar said, “I was informed in the morning at around 6.30am that I have to go out and get vaccinated at BKC on Saturday between 10am to 5pm. Hence, I went ahead and got myself vaccinated. I understand that even for BMC this is a new thing and we all are figuring it out, but I would appeal to everyone to go and get vaccinated.”He added, “The vaccine has just launched, and I am sure that there are health workers who are anxious about getting vaccinated, but now is the time. The whole nation was waiting for the vaccine, and now when we have the vaccine, we should go ahead and get vaccinated.”Dr Shashank Joshi from Lilavati Hospital and member of Covid-19 task force, another senior health worker who got vaccinated, said, “By keeping faith and trust on the government and scientists who have worked tirelessly to get us a vaccine, I appeal to all health and frontline workers along with citizens to go out and get vaccinated as the vaccine is rolled out for all.”Dr Rajesh Dere, dean at BKC Covid-19 vaccination centre, said, “No adverse effect has been reported in any of the vaccine beneficiaries yet. But one 32-year-old health worker had reported anxiety post-vaccination. We counselled her, and she is fine now.”He added, “Today we will vaccinate 500 volunteers considering it’s the first day. Gradually, from tomorrow, we will increase the capacity to vaccinate.”Another health worker, Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital, said, “The year 2021 has come with the good news of vaccination. Hence, we should take it in a positive spirit by going ahead and getting vaccinated. Scientists have worked hard for the vaccine. Hence, citizens should not believe in any rumours.”Present at the launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “I pray that this Covid centre remains vacant like it is now. I don’t want to do politics over Covid-19 vaccination. Citizens of all states should be equal and are equal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so there is no question of inequality.”Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, who also was also present at launch, said, “We have a capacity to store 10 million vaccines, and currently have the capacity to vaccinate 15,000 persons daily. This capacity will increase to over one lakh being vaccinated daily as private institutions will later be involved in the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaidont-believe-in-rumours-get-vaccinated-say-medical-workers-101610823292704.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi zoo reports first bird flu death, doubles down on safety measures||Delhi Zoo on Saturday confirmed its first case of bird flu, after samples taken from an owl that was found dead on its premises on Monday, came out to positive. Senior zoo officials said that all safety protocol laid down by the Centre was being followed.Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, said, “The zoo witnessed the death of a brown fish owl in its captivity. Its cloacal, tracheal and ocular swabs were sent to the animal husbandry unit of the Delhi government for serological examination, which returned positive for H5N8 avian influenza.”“As per standard protocol and guidelines issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC) and the animal husbandry department of Delhi government, sanitation and surveillance drills have been intensified in the zoo and all possible preventive and prophylactic measures are being taken,” he added.Environment ministry officials confirmed that with the positive case at Delhi zoo, safety protocol at the premises had been intensified. The only solace this time, as compared to the last avian flu breakout at the zoo in 2016, is that this time the zoo is already closed for the general public. This will make managing the flu among the inhabitants a lot easier, according to officials.“Two barn owls, which were next to the enclosure of the owl that tested positive, have been isolated. A close watch is being kept on the migratory birds, who may be carriers. Zoo staff have been distributed special drapers and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. They are following our advisory and are in constant touch with the ministry of animal husbandry. The zoo is closed, so there is no fear of transmission to people,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, environment ministry’s additional director-general.In a statement issued, the ministry also said that the zoo authorities have been directed to use disinfectant spray of lime juice, Virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite, and foot bath of potassium permanganate is being done at regular intervals.“Chicken feed to raptors and entry of vehicles inside the zoo had already been stopped. This is being further reinforced and intensified. Movement of staff and workers in zoo is also being restricted and regulated keeping in view the animal influenza threats,” the ministry statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-reports-first-bird-flu-death-doubles-down-on-safety-measures-101610822292723.html

The health condition of one recipient turned serious after vaccination but was later said to be stable.The state had set a target of vaccinating 20,700 people at 207 centres across the state. In Kolkata, the turnout was 92 per cent.“She (Banerjee) has already requested the Union government to supply an adequate number of vaccines for not only the frontline workers but also for all the people of West Bengal. She strongly felt that all the people of West Bengal should get vaccines free of cost as early as possible. If needed, the state might bear the financial burden,” said a statement issued by the state government.Also read: Maharashtra suspends Covid-19 vaccine drive till Jan 18 due to CoWIN app glitchBanerjee said this at a program organised at the state secretariat from where she virtually addressed all the healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, support staff, ASHA and students among others, who gathered at the vaccination centres.At least 14 people complained of AEFI, which is less than one in 1,000 persons. The health condition of one recipient, who works as a nurse in a state-run hospital, was slightly serious. Later her condition was stated to be stable.“She started shivering and was rushed to the NRS Hospital. She was doing fine. Her husband said that she was allergic to some drugs since childhood. This is not alarming and such AEFI is normal if anyone is allergic to some drugs,” said a top health official."The nurse developed rigor and had to be rushed to the NRS Hospital. This could be an acute allergic reaction. She has a history of drug allergy and in such cases, it is expected but rare. She is undergoing treatment and there is no reason to worry. The AEFI committee swung into action," said a senior doctor of the hospital.Starting next week, the vaccination drive would be carried out four days a week – Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday.Meanwhile, at least two Trinamool Congress MLAs, Rabindranath Chatterjee and Subhas Mondal, took the vaccine in Purba Burdwan district on Saturday triggering a political row.The BJP attacked the chief minister and said that she has a habit of complaining without finding any solutions.“She has a habit of complaining and doesn’t want to find any solutions. If TMC MLAs take the vaccine then there is bound to be a shortfall. Has she developed any factory in her locality or she wants to bring vaccines from China? What’s the guarantee that the vaccine, which she wants to give, would not be real vaccine and not water from the river Ganges?” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP state president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/will-bear-cost-mamata-banerjee-requests-centre-for-adequate-supply-of-vaccine-101610821150306.html
17-01-2021||India||One severe adverse impact in Delhi: Person is stable, AIIMS says||A 20-year-old man had a severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the only severe reaction reported in Delhi on the first day of the national vaccine roll-out. Anaphylaxis causes skin rash, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and shock, if not treated promptly.The hospital had been administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“An AIIMS security guard has developed an allergic reaction after receiving Covid-19 vaccination here today. He is kept under observation of doctors at the hospital,” an AIIMS official said.In all, Delhi reported 51 minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection, or fever.A senior NDMC official, who asked not to be named, said two cases of mild AEFI (adverse effects following immunisation) symptoms were reported at Charak Palika Hospital. Two of the hospital’s health care workers who took the Covid-19 vaccine in the afternoon, reported slight tightness in the chest during the observation period.“They were immediately attended to by the AEFI team and kept under observation. They felt normal within half-an-hour and were discharged. There is nothing to be worried about AEFI cases, as such symptoms are normal to occur after any vaccination,” the official said.Hospitals across the city said they were equipped to deal with any adverse events.At Lok Nayak, two consultation rooms in the observation area were converted to high-dependence units with all emergency medications and oxygen support available.“The rooms are like mini emergency centres in themselves and can handle any adverse events that may take place during vaccination. The patient will not even have to be moved from the vaccination site,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, the hospital’s medical director.At GTB hospital, intensive care unit beds were kept ready just above the vaccination site on the first floor of the emergency building. And at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, a resuscitation centre was set up – similar to the one in Lok Nayak – at the vaccination site, which was also close to the ICU facility at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-severe-adverse-impact-in-delhi-person-is-stable-aiims-says-101610819631564.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||RML resident docs raise concerns over Covaxin shots||A section of resident doctors at the Central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital expressed apprehension regarding the use of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on the first day of Covid-19 vaccination drive, and requested the hospital’s medical director to give them a shot of Covishield instead.“We would like to bring to your notice that the residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers thus defeating the purpose of vaccination. We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield, which has completed all stages of trial before its roll out,” the letter written by some of the representative of the resident doctors’ association at the hospital said.The letter was not on the official letterhead of the Resident Doctors’ Association and had not been signed by the president of the organisation.Dr Nirmalaya Mohapatra, the vice president of the organisation and one of the signatories of Saturday’s letter said, “We have been having regular discussions about the vaccination drive with the resident doctors and realised that they were not very enthusiastic about Covaxin. This will only hamper the vaccination drive. We are not against any vaccine; however safety data from phase III is not available for Covaxin. So, Covishield is the logical choice.”“We came to know only last night that the hospital has received Covaxin and hence wrote the letter on Saturday,” he said.The medical superintendent of the hospital Dr AK Singh Rana said that the hospital did a “decent job” during the vaccination drive on Saturday. The hospital saw 31 health care workers receive the shot after signing an informed consent form as mandated by the country’s apex drug regulator that gave the vaccine an approval in “clinical trial mode.”“The numbers are of course less than expected, and that is the case everywhere. Whenever something new happens, people are a little hesitant and that is the reason probably we saw fewer beneficiaries coming in. As for which vaccine the hospital gets, the decision is taken by senior level officers and it is not my place to question that. However, I will try to speak to the resident doctors on Monday and allay their concerns,” said Dr Rana, who himself received the shot on Saturday.“If I did not think the vaccine was safe, I would not have taken it. Perhaps they will see this and decide to get the vaccine,” he added.The hospital was one of the 81 centres across the city that was to vaccinate 100 people each on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rmlresident-docs-raise-concerns-over-covaxin-shots-101610819511114.html
17-01-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 vaccine drive kicks off in national capital, 53% turn out for jabs||A total of 4,319 healthcare workers -- 53.3% of those registered -- received the Covid-19 vaccine in Delhi on Saturday, becoming the first batch of people to be inoculated as India launched one of the biggest immunisation campaigns to control the coronavirus disease.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal assured people about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, saying “there is no need to worry” and urged people to continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing. Health minister Satyendar Jain described the drive as successful.The beneficiaries on Saturday included some of the leading doctors of Delhi who volunteered to take the first jab at various centres to build confidence about the two vaccines among the healthcare workers and the general public.Of the 11 districts in Delhi, the highest turnout was recorded at 71.44% in south Delhi where 668 of the 935 total registered beneficiaries were vaccinated. This was followed by the northwest district where 706 (64%) of the 1,100 healthcare workers were given the first dose. The north district vaccinated 116 (32.1%) of the total target of 361 persons -- the lowest among the 11 districts. Experts attributed the low turnout mostly to vaccine hesitancy, pointing out that since no major adverse events were reported on Saturday, more people will join the drive on Monday.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Lok Nayak hospital where 32 healthcare workers turned up for vaccination. While the next Covid-19 vaccination will be held on Monday at the same centres, each site has been allowed to vaccinate a maximum of 100 people a day.“I want to say to all not to pay attention to rumours and misinformation. The experts say vaccines are safe and there is no need to worry,” Kejriwal said.“Every person who has been vaccinated is happy, nobody is experiencing any problems. We have started this at 81 sites, and we will increase this number to 175 sites in the coming days. As and when the vaccine supply increases, we will start the vaccination process at 1,000 sites,” Kejriwal said after inspecting the arrangements at Lok Nayak hospital.The inoculation drive was launched at 81 centres or vaccination sites in Delhi with just one serious adverse event following immunization (AEFI) reported in the south district. where a security guard of AIIMS developed an allergic reaction after receiving vaccination.“He complained of palpitations and developed an allergic skin rash within 15-20 mins after being inoculated and was admitted immediately. He is stable and is under observation. He is likely to be released tomorrow,” said a senior AIIMS official.Of the 4,319 beneficiaries, 51 reported minor reactions such as rashes, swelling at the site of injection and fever. South and southwest districts reported the highest number of minor AEFI with each reporting 11 such cases. Northeast and Shahdara districts reported no AEFI cases.The exercise proceeded smoothly at all centres with no major glitch being reported from any centre. Some technical snags that were reported at Lady Hardinge Medical College on Friday led to fewer people turning up. The hospital vaccinated 26 health care workers.The Delhi heath minister said once the 240,000 registered healthcare workers are vaccinated, nearly 600,000 frontline workers will be next in line. “After frontline workers, we will vaccinate people who are above the age of 50 and this will be followed by those below 50 with co-morbidities,” Jain said.Senior government officials said the turnout was better in the city’s private hospitals with Max Saket vaccinating all of its 100 registered beneficiaries. Sir Ganga Ram hospital vaccinated 88 healthcare workers, while Indraprastha Apollo saw 72 of them.“There was some hesitation among the doctors in receiving the vaccine, but if I did not believe that the vaccine was safe why would I take it. I will speak to the doctors and try to allay concerns,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where only 31 people were vaccinated and some resident doctors asked the hospital for Covishield vaccine.Among the government hospitals, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) vaccinated 95 people with a couple of them being turned away with fever and other symptoms.Even as the centres were opened on time at 9 am, a number of them started the process post 11 am, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation. Almost all centres, including GTB hospital and AIIMS, had installed LED televisions to live broadcast the PM’s speech which was shown to the beneficiaries to boost their morale.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan visited AIIMS where a sanitation worker, Manish Kumar, was the first to get the jab. This was followed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and NITI Ayog member Dr VK Paul with his wife Dr Shashi Paul – all three were administered the Covaxin dose manufactured by Bharat Biotech.Allaying apprehensions over Covaxin, Dr Paul said, “Both the vaccines are good, very effective, and very safe. I would urge the healthcare workers to take the vaccine assigned to them.”Dr Guleria said, “We may keep arguing about which vaccine is good and which is better, at the end of the day all the vaccines that are safe and efficacious will help in saving lives and reducing mortality. These will evolve over time and we may get second-generation vaccines by the middle of this year that will need only one shot or one that can be a nasal spray.”Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College said, “Vaccine hesitancy had a major role to play when it came to the low vaccination rate on Saturday. Many people were comparing the two vaccines, many people wanted to wait and see what happens, and others wondered whether they needed it, having recovered from the infection recently. When people were asked to sign the consent forms, that also led to a lot of anxiety. But, with no major adverse events reported, I think more people will come forward in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccine-drive-kicks-off-in-national-capital-53-turn-out-for-jabs-101610819391084.html
17-01-2021||Mumbai||In 1 day, giant lung billboard at Kharghar starts to turn black due to pollution||A giant pair of artificial lungs fitted with filters and fans to mimic the human lungs, fitted in Navi Mumbai's Kharghar by an environmental organisation on Friday, started turning black within a day.A similar installation was set up in Bandra last January but it took 14 days to turn completely black. The installation changing colour within a day of being set up has caused concerns of increasing pollution levels among residents.This comes four weeks after a study found that air pollution levels on the outskirts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) along the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt are above safe limits for nearly two-thirds of the day, with peak pollution during early morning hours posing a threat to morning walkers and joggers.Kavita Choutmal, mayor of the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC), who visited the site, has demanded the setting up of an expert committee to study the deteriorating air quality in the area.“There is an urgent need to understand the cause of such high levels of air pollution in this belt and then work on solutions. However, the PCMC and MPCB (Maharashtra Pollution Control Board) needs to immediately take strict action against industries in Taloja MIDC as well as nearby areas that are not following norms and causing air pollution,” said Choutmal.Also read: Maharashtra suspends Covid-19 vaccine drive till Jan 18 due to CoWIN app glitchThe artificial lungs, called the lung billboard, were installed by a non-government organisation called the Waatavaran Foundation in a bid to demonstrate the effect of pollution levels on the lungs. The installation is placed near the Bank of India Chowk at Sector 7.Designed by the digital advocacy group Jhatkaa.org, the artificial lungs are made up of a white filter medium. A pair of fans are fixed at the back of the billboard to suck in the air to mimic the functions of the lungs while breathing.“Such visuals (like the billboard) are important methods to raise awareness about finer particles bringing out a vivid image on how they impact the lungs. Air quality spikes could be mostly due to vehicular emissions in these areas. The impact needs to happen across all stakeholders to understand how various sources of pollution are contributing to this issue,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.“Over the next few days and weeks, particulate matter from different sources will begin getting trapped in the filters. This will lead to the lungs changing colour - from chalk-white to brown to black. The billboard is also fitted with a digital air quality monitor that will record and display the real-time Air Quality Index (AQI),” said Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder of Waatavaran.On Saturday, even as the overall air quality of Mumbai remained in the moderate category, in Navi Mumbai it was in the very poor category with an AQI of 365.A study released by Waatavaran in December 2020 found extremely high levels of PM2.5 in the air, especially between 6 am and 8 am, and average daily air quality above safe standards for 17 hours in the Kharghar-Panvel-Taloja belt.The data from five locations – Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Taloja; Sector 13, Panvel; Navade, Taloja; Sector 7 and 36, Kharghar - showed average PM2.5 levels over 31 days was 101.12 microgrammes per cubic metre (μg/m3), which is almost twice the national safe standard (60μg/m3), and four times the World Health Organization (WHO) standard (25μg/m3).The highest PM2.5 concentration was recorded at 7 am at 141.1μg/m3 (average data from five monitors). MIDC Taloja had the most polluted air among five locations at 197.4 μg/m3 at 7 am. PM2.5 data was accessed using five low-cost air quality monitors between November 13 and December 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-one-day-giant-lung-billboard-at-kharghar-turns-black-due-to-high-pollution-101610815798898.html
17-01-2021||Chandigarh||Raj Bhawan versus Haryana govt:Opposition expresses shock over govt opposing governor||Opposition leaders in Haryana expressed shock over the embarrassing treatment meted out to governor Satyadeo Narain Arya by the state government that termed his orders to extend the services of a Red Cross Society official illegal before the Punjab and Haryana high court. Responding to a report in Hindustan Times, state Congress chief Kumari Selja said a constitutional crisis has been perpetrated in the state. “This is something unheard of. It seems the right hand does not know what the left one is doing. Either the governor or the chief minister should go,’’ Selja said. Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) general secretary Abhay Chautala said it is shameful and the CM should have asked the advocate general to resign. “The governor is the constitutional head. How can his own government term his orders illegal? And what about the arbitrary appointments of BJP cronies made by the chief minister every now and then. Will the advocate general have the courage to term them illegal as well,’’ Chautala said. Expressing shock at the development, former Haryana minister Karan Dalal said that the advocate general and the chief minister should quit for this impropriety. “What kind of a government is this? I have never heard anything like this before. The government has severely undermined the office of the governor, who is the executive head of the state,’’ Dalal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/raj-bhawan-versus-haryana-govt-opposition-expresses-shock-over-govt-opposing-governor-101610809970064.html

Cut off his intelligence."Asked about Gordon's recommendation, Klain told CNN's "State of the Union" program that Biden would want to hear from his own intelligence professionals before making any decision."We'll certainly look for a recommendation from the intelligence professionals in the Biden administration ... and we will act on that recommendation," he said.Gordon, who resigned in 2019, said any former president was a foreign intelligence target but Trump "might be unusually vulnerable to bad actors with ill intent," citing, among other things, his business interests abroad."It is not clear that he understands the tradecraft to which he has been exposed, the reasons the knowledge he has acquired must be protected from disclosure, or the intentions and capabilities of adversaries," she added.Democratic House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff was more blunt, telling CBS' "Face The Nation" program, "I don't think he can be trusted with it."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-will-wait-for-recommendation-on-sharing-secrets-with-trump-101610904556412.html

There are scores of other temples, dharma shalas, paat shalas, Gattu shalas, Anat Ashram, cremation grounds, satsung hall, gurdwaras and other worship places across Pakistan which needed to be protected and preserved, he added."We demand from the government to ensure protection to minorities places to avoid Terri like incident," he added.In December, a temple in Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district was attacked by a mob after members of the Hindu community received permission from local authorities to renovate its decades-old building. The mob had demolished the newly constructed work alongside the old structure.The attack on the temple in Terri village by members of radical Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party (Fazal ur Rehman group) drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders, prompting the Supreme Court to order its reconstruction.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents.

17-01-2021||World||In inaugural address, Joe Biden will appeal to national unity||President-elect Joe Biden will deliver an appeal to national unity when he is sworn in Wednesday and plans immediate moves to combat the coronavirus pandemic and undo some of President Donald Trump’s most controversial policies, his incoming chief of staff said Sunday.Biden intends a series of executive actions in his first hours after his inauguration, an opening salvo in what is shaping up as a 10-day blitz of steps to reorient the country without waiting for Congress, aide Ron Klain said.Klain told CNN's “State of the Union” that Biden, in his inaugural address to the nation, will deliver "a message of moving this country forward. A message of unity. A message of getting things done.”Biden will end Trump’s restriction on immigration to the US. from some Muslim-majority countries, move to rejoin the Paris climate accord and mandate mask-wearing on federal property and during interstate travel. Those are among roughly a dozen actions Biden will take on his first day in the White House, incoming chief of staff Ron Klain said Saturday in a memo to senior staff.Other actions include extending the pause on student loan payments and actions meant to prevent evictions and foreclosures for those struggling during the pandemic.“These executive actions will deliver relief to the millions of Americans that are struggling in the face of these crises,” Klain said in the memo. “President-elect Biden will take action — not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration — but also to start moving our country forward.”Incoming White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said Biden would use his address to the American people to appeal to those frustrated by the rancor of Washington and to explain how his administration will tackle the nation's challenges.“I think you can expect that this will be a moment where President-elect Biden will really work to try to turn the page on the divisiveness and the hatred over the last four years and really lay out a positive, optimistic vision for the country, and lay out a way -- lay out a path forward that really calls on all of us to work together," she told “Fox News Sunday.”Despite the flurry of expected executive action, "full achievement” of Biden’s goals will require Congress to act, Klain said memo, and that includes the $1.9 trillion virus relief bill that Biden outlined last Thursday. Klain said that Biden would also propose a comprehensive immigration bill to lawmakers on his first day in office.Some lawmakers have already balked at the aid bill's price tag, and immigration overhaul efforts over the past decade and a half have all stalled in Congress. Still, Klain expressed optimism.“I think there are people in both parties we can work with to move this agenda forward," Klain said Sunday, noting voters elected a 50-50 Senate, where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will serve as the tie-breaking vote. “We’re going to have to find ways to get Democrats and Republicans to work together to get things done.”Providing a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the US illegally will be part of Biden's agenda, according to people briefed on his plans.Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum and among those briefed, said immigrants would be put on an eight-year path. There would be a faster track for those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields people from deportation who came to the US as children, and for those from strife-torn countries with temporary status.On Thursday, the new president's second day in office, Biden would sign orders related to the Covid-19 outbreak aimed at reopening schools and businesses and expanding virus testing, Klain said. The following day, Friday, will see action on providing economic relief to those suffering the economic costs of the pandemic.In the following week, Klain said, Biden would take additional actions relating to criminal justice reform, climate change and immigration — including a directive to speed the reuniting of families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border under Trump’s policies.More actions will be added, Klain said, once they clear legal review.Incoming presidents traditionally move swiftly to sign an array of executive actions when they take office. Trump did the same, but he found many of his orders challenged and even rejected by courts.Klain maintained that Biden should not suffer similar issues, saying “the legal theory behind them is well-founded and represents a restoration of an appropriate, constitutional role for the President.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-inaugural-address-joe-biden-will-appeal-to-national-unity-101610902497187.html
17-01-2021||World||Far-right personality 'Baked Alaska' arrested in Capitol riot probe||Far-right media personality Tim Gionet, who calls himself “Baked Alaska,” has been arrested by the FBI for his involvement in the riot at the US Capitol, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press.Gionet was arrested by federal agents in Houston on Saturday, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter before the public release of a criminal complaint and spoke on condition of anonymity.Thousands of supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress was meeting to vote to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral win. Five people died in the mayhem.Gionet faces charges of violent and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds and knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority, according to the US Department of Justice.Court documents don't list an attorney for Gionet or say where he is being held. The jail in Harris County, which includes Houston, didn't immediately reply to phone messages seeking further information.FBI Special Agent Nicole Miller said in an affidavit filed in the case that Gionet streamed live for about 27 minutes from inside the Capitol and could be heard encouraging other protesters not to leave, cursing and saying “I’m staying,” “1776 baby," and “I won’t leave guys, don’t worry.”She wrote that Gionet entered various offices and when told by law enforcement officers to move, identified himself as a member of the media. Miller wrote that Gionet then asked officers where to go before cursing a law officer while alleging the officer shoved him, then leaving the building.Gionet also posted video that showed Trump supporters in “Make America Great Again” and “God Bless Trump” hats milling around inside the Capitol and taking selfies with officers who calmly asked them to leave the premises. The Trump supporters talked among themselves, laughed, and told the officers and each other, “This is only the beginning.”Law enforcement officials across the country have been working to locate and arrest suspects who committed federal crimes. So far, they have brought nearly 100 cases in federal court and the District of Columbia Superior Court.In a 2017 interview with “Business Insider,” Gionet said he was given the nickname “Baked Alaska” because he is from Alaska and that he smoked marijuana at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farright-personality-baked-alaska-arrested-in-capitol-riot-probe-101610902475161.html

Carved in human form and painted in bright colours, many of them are still intact.Ancient games, statues, and masks were also found."All these discoveries will rewrite the history of Saqqara and the New Kingdom," said Hawass.Officials are keen to show off newly discovered artefacts as they try to revive visitor numbers after the tourism industry received a painful blow during the coronavirus pandemic.

17-01-2021||World||Law enforcement officials brace for pro-Trump protests at state capitols||Law enforcement officials battened down statehouses across the country on Sunday in anticipation of potentially violent protests by Trump supporters who believe the baseless claim that electoral fraud robbed the president of a second term.More than a dozen states have activated National Guard troops to help secure their capitol buildings following an FBI warning of armed protests, with right-wing extremists emboldened by the deadly attack on the US Capitol in Washington on January 6.Security officials have eyed Sunday as the first major flashpoint, as that is when the anti-government "boogaloo" movement made plans weeks ago to hold rallies in all 50 states."Following the siege at our nation's capitol and reports on threats to state capitals, I'm bringing all resources to bear to protect our residents and democratic process," Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker wrote on Twitter on Sunday, adding that he was activating the state police and national guard to protect the state's capital, Springfield.Capitals in battleground states, where Trump has directed his accusations of voter fraud, were on especially high alert.Several hundred law enforcement officers and National Guard troops milled around Georgia's state house in Atlanta early Sunday. Chain-link fences and cement barriers protected the Capitol grounds and multiple armored vehicles were stationed nearby.In Lansing, Michigan, crews were setting up barricades, blocking off streets around the capitol building as snow flurries fell on Sunday morning. Office buildings around the capitol had boarded up their windows.In addition to increasing police presence, some states, including Pennsylvania, Texas and Kentucky, have taken the further step of closing their capitol grounds to the public.It is just days until Wednesday's Inauguration Day, when Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn in as president amid extraordinary security efforts in Washington, DC.The nationwide security scramble followed the attack on the US Capitol in Washington by a mix of extremists and Trump supporters, some of whom called for the death of Vice President Mike Pence as he presided over the certification of Biden's election victory.POTENTIAL VIOLENCEThe FBI and other federal agencies have warned of the potential for future violence leading up to the inauguration, as white supremacists and other extremists look to exploit frustration among Trump supporters who have bought into falsehoods about electoral fraud.It was not clear whether the FBI warning and ramped up security presence around the country might lead some protesters to stay at home.Following the Jan. 6 violence in Washington, some militia members said they would not attend a long-planned pro-gun demonstration in Virginia on Monday, where authorities were worried about the risk of violence as multiple groups converged on the state capital, Richmond.Some militias and extremist groups have told followers to stay home this weekend, citing the increased security or the risk that the planned events were law enforcement traps.Bob Gardner, leader of the Pennsylvania Lightfoot Militia, said his group had no plans to be in Harrisburg this weekend, where the Capitol has been fortified with barricades and will be protected by hundreds of members of its National Guard."We've got our own communities to worry about," Gardner said earlier this week. "We don’t get involved in politics."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/law-enforcement-officials-brace-for-pro-trump-protests-at-state-capitols-101610900580221.html
17-01-2021||World||Explained: Why Kremlin critic Navalny faces immediate arrest in Russia?||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Sunday left for Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year with a Soviet-style nerve agent from the Novichok group. The Russian opposition leader announced his return on Wednesday and a day later, Russia’s prison service said that Navalny faces immediate arrest once he arrives in Moscow.After boarding the Moscow-bound plane, Navalny said that it was the best moment for him in the last five months as he was finally returning to his home town, according to news agency Reuters. The Russian leader told reporters that he is an innocent person and didn’t think he would be arrested."What do I need to be afraid of? What bad thing can happen to me in Russia?" he added. "I feel like a citizen of Russia who has every right to return."Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) issued a warning in December that Navalny faced prison time in case he fails to immediately report to its office. FSIN stated that Navalny, a staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was supposed to report to them as per the terms of a suspended sentence and probation period that ended on December 29, 2020.Navalny has been jailed several times over various charges, including embezzlement and holding unauthorised protests, which the Russian leader has denounced as politically motivated. On Thursday, the FSIN said in a statement that an arrest warrant was issued against Navalny following his failure to report to its office.The prison service asserted that it was “obliged to take all the necessary action” to detain the Russian leader, adding that it had already asked a Moscow court to turn the suspended sentence into prison time. Meanwhile, a parallel criminal case against the 44-year-old politician has been opened on charges of fraud related to his alleged mishandling of $5 million in private donations.Read: Ally of poisoned Kremlin critic Navalny jailed in Moscow for extremismNavalny has been at the forefront of the anti-corruption struggle in Russia and has organised several demonstrations in the past against Putin and his political allies. He had also strongly criticised the sweeping constitutional reforms introduced by Putin that gave him an option to stay in power beyond term limits.In August, Navalny fell unconscious during a flight from the Siberian city of Tomsk and the plane had to make an emergency landing in Omsk. He was brought to Berlin on a special flight sent by German non-governmental organisation Cinema for Peace after Navalny’s team alleged that the Russian government was behind the poisoning, an allegation Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

17-01-2021||World||Dutch PM Mark Rutte and his entire cabinet quits over welfare scandal||Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his entire Cabinet resigned Friday to take political responsibility for a scandal involving investigations into child welfare payments that wrongly labeled thousands of parents as fraudsters.In a nationally televised speech, Rutte said he had informed King Willem-Alexander of his decision and pledged that his government would continue work to compensate affected parents as quickly as possible and to battle the coronavirus.“We are of one mind that if the whole system has failed, we all must take responsibility, and that has led to the conclusion that I have just offered the king, the resignation of the entire Cabinet,” Rutte said.Not long after delivering his statement, Rutte got on his bicycle and rode to the king's palace in a forest in The Hague to formally inform the king. Dutch television showed him parking his bike at the bottom of steps leading into the palace and walking inside.The move was seen as largely symbolic; Rutte’s government will remain in office in a caretaker mode until a new coalition is formed after a March 17 election in the Netherlands.The resignation brings to an end a decade in office for Rutte, although his party is expected to win the election, putting him first in line to begin talks to form the next government. If he succeeds in forming a new coalition, Rutte would most likely again become prime minister.Geert Wilders, leader of the largest opposition party in the Dutch parliament said it was the right decision for the government to quit.“Innocent people have been criminalized, their lives destroyed and parliament was informed about it inaccurately and incompletely,” he tweeted.The Netherlands is the third European country thrown into political uncertainty this week in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. In Estonia, the government resigned over a corruption scandal, while Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte’s governing coalition is at risk of collapse after a small partner party withdrew its support.Rutte said earlier this week that his government would be able to keep taking tough policy decisions in the battle against the coronavirus even if it were in caretaker mode. The Netherlands is in a tough lockdown until at least Feb. 9, and the government is considering imposing an overnight curfew amid fears about new, more contagious variants of the virus.“To the Netherlands I say: Our struggle against the coronavirus will continue,” Rutte said.Jesse Klaver, the leader of one opposition party, told national broadcaster NOS he would continue to support the government in its coronavirus campaign.On Thursday, the leader of the opposition Labor Party stepped down because he was minister of social affairs in a coalition led by Rutte when the country’s tax office implemented a tough policy of tracking down fraud with child welfare.A sitting minister, Eric Wiebes, who also was linked to the scandal, said Friday he was resigning with immediate effect and would not be part of the caretaker administration.At Friday's Cabinet meeting, ministers decided their reaction to a scathing parliamentary report issued last month, titled “Unprecedented Injustice,” that said the tax office policies violated “fundamental principles of the rule of law.” The report also criticized the government for the way it provided information to parliament about the scandal.Many wrongfully accused parents were plunged into debt when tax officials demanded repayment of payments. The government has in the past apologized for the tax office’s methods and in March earmarked 500 million euros ($607 million) to compensate more than 20,000 parents.In a written reaction, the government pledged to reform the welfare system as a result of the scandal and to quickly pay affected parents 30,000 euros ($36,300) and expand existing compensation schemes.“Everything is aimed at offering the parents and their children a new start in life,” the government said.One of the parents waited near parliament as the Cabinet met and said she wanted it to resign.“It's important for me because it is the government acknowledging, ‘We have made a mistake and we are taking responsibility,’ because it's quite something what happened to us,” Janet Ramesar told The Associated Press.Rutte plans to lead his conservative People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy into the March election, and polls suggest it will win the most seats. That would put Rutte, who has been in office for a decade at the head of three different coalitions, first in line to attempt to form the next ruling coalition.But he said that it was up to voters at the election to decide on his future, noting that he took ultimate responsibility for failings within his government.“The buck stops here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-and-his-entire-cabinet-quits-over-welfare-scandal-101610900452800.html
17-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Brazil regulator to decide on emergency use of Sinovac, AstraZeneca vaccines||Brazilian health regulator Anvisa on Sunday opened an extraordinary meeting of its board of directors to decide whether to approve emergency use of Covid-19 vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech and Britain's AstraZeneca to begin immunizations as the pandemic enters a deadly second wave.Anvisa's decision will be a simple majority vote of the board's five directors. The meeting started just after 10 a.m. local time (1300 GMT) and is expected to last about five hours.President Jair Bolsonaro, a coronavirus skeptic who has refused to take a vaccine himself, is under growing pressure to start inoculations in Brazil, which has lost more than 200,000 to Covid-19 – the worst death toll outside the United States. However, delays with vaccine shipments and testing results have held up vaccinations in the country, once a global leader in mass immunizations and now regional laggard after peers such as Chile and Mexico started giving shots last month.Bolsonaro's government was planning to kick off a national immunization program this week but is still waiting on shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine at the center of its plans. That has added to public frustration and offered a political rival the chance to upstage the right-wing president.Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who oversees the Butantan biomedical center that partnered with Sinovac in Brazil, could start vaccinations in the state capital on Sunday if Anvisa approves emergency use of the Chinese shot, called CoronaVac, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.Bolsonaro, who considers Doria a potential rival for his 2022 re-election efforts, has taunted the governor over CoronaVac's disappointing 50% efficacy in Brazilian trials, but the federal Health Ministry has agreed to acquire and distribute the shot for the national immunization drive.Adding to urgency for vaccinations, a second wave of the outbreak in Brazil is snowballing as the country confronts a new, potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus that originated in Amazonas and prompted Britain and Italy to bar entry to Brazilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-brazil-regulator-to-decide-on-emergency-use-of-sinovac-astrazeneca-vaccines-101610899393974.html
17-01-2021||World||US military says its troop removal from Somalia is complete||The US military says its troop withdrawal from Somalia is complete, in one of the last actions of President Donald Trump's presidency.Some experts have warned that the withdrawal of an estimated 700 US military personnel comes at the worst possible time for Somalia, as the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group improves its bomb-making skills and continues to attack military and civilian targets even in the capital, Mogadishu.The withdrawal comes less than a month before Somalia is set to hold a national election.The US personnel trained and supported Somali forces, including its elite special forces, in counter-terror operations. They are being moved to other African countries such as neighboring Kenya and Djibouti, home of the only permanent US military base in Africa, but US Africa Command spokesman Col. Chris Karns would not say how many are going where.Asked whether the administration of President-elect Joe Biden will reverse the withdrawal, Karns replied in an email: “It would be inappropriate for us to speculate or engage in hypotheticals.” Karns said the operation enters its “next phase of periodic engagement with Somali security forces.” He would not go into details.The withdrawal was announced late last year, with a Jan. 15 deadline. The US military, which has carried out a growing number of airstrikes against al-Shabab and a small band of fighters linked to the Islamic State group during Trump's administration, says it will continue to pressure al-Shabab. The extremist group has an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 fighters.Those Somali forces, even US assessments have said, are not ready to take over responsibility for the country's security, especially as a 19,000-strong multinational African Union force is also set to withdraw by the end of this year.The US Africa Command commander, Gen. Stephen Townsend, noted “no serious injuries or significant loss of equipment, despite significant efforts to target us by al-Shabab” during the “intense” operation to remove the US personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-says-its-troop-removal-from-somalia-is-complete-101610899077755.html

17-01-2021||World||Donald Trump pushed the limits of the US legal system: Here’s how it held up||In his four years in the White House, Donald Trump gave the US Constitution an unprecedented workout, challenging norms and laws in ways that left few parts of America’s foundational legal document untouched.The president throughout his term faced suspicion of colluding with a foreign government, worries that his business might create conflicts of interest and fears that his temperament and conduct would violate the norms of the nation’s highest office. Trump responded to almost all of these concerns with defiance — rejecting most Congressional oversight, stonewalling law enforcement, issuing executive orders by the seat of his pants and, in his final act, refusing to accept the results of a democratic election.Many of his actions inevitably landed in the courts.“Trump is unique in being the maelstrom of all the things one might have worried about in thinking — well, does any president have the ability to wreak havoc on the nation, at least in the sense of stability of our democratic institutions,” said Elizabeth Joh, a law professor at the University of California at Davis and co-host of the podcast “What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law.”Some provisions held fast, others were shown to perhaps be weaker than the Constitution’s framers may have intended. Many of the infirmities are likely to be debated by legal scholars and lawmakers for years after Trump leaves offices. One silver lining, says Joh, is that the public is also likely to be more engaged with those debates than before.“Maybe the past four years, as hard as it’s been in many ways for lots of people, has been a giant civic education project for us,” she said. Here are some of the constitutional provisions that were tested by Trump and where they stand now:The ElectionWhat happened: It had long been assumed that the loser of a presidential election would acknowledge defeat once the outcome was clear. But Trump and his allies launched an unprecedented legal campaign to try to overturn the 2020 results through dozens of lawsuits, essentially asking for votes from Democratic-leaning pools in battleground states to be invalidated or for all votes to be tossed in favor of state legislatures picking the winner. Scores of Republican members of Congress voted against certifying the state electoral college votes for Biden, and Trump pressed Vice President Mike Pence to use his role overseeing the tally to overturn Biden’s win.What the issues were: Trump and his allies claimed the constitutional equal protection and due process rights of their supporters were violated by potential fraud among Democrats, particularly in large cities. Many of their suits also argued that changes in voting rules, especially those expanding mail-in voting in response to the pandemic, were unconstitutional because they were instituted by state election officials or courts instead of legislatures. Republican members of Congress asserted a right to “audit” state-certified election results, with some claiming Pence had a constitutional right to reject electoral votes for Biden and hand victory to Trump.How it was resolved: Courts uniformly rejected Trump’s claims, with many judges pointing out that the suits were seeking the unprecedented remedy of invalidating millions of votes without any real evidence of fraud. Pence consulted with conservative constitutional law scholars who told him his role was limited to tallying the electoral votes, which he did after Congress reconvened following the Capitol riot. But though the Constitution held firm against Trump’s claims, widespread belief among his supporters that the presidential election was fraudulent raises concerns about future support for democratic elections and the rule of law.Impeachment and the 25th AmendmentWhat happened: The two constitutional provisions for removing the president have become familiar to many Americans for the first time during the Trump presidency. He’s been impeached twice by the Democratic-controlled House, first in December 2019 for asking the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation designed to politically damage Biden and again on Jan. 13 for inciting the Capitol riot one week earlier. The Senate acquitted him over the Ukraine call and and is expected to begin a trial over the second impeachment shortly after Biden’s inauguration. Ahead of its impeachment vote, the House passed a resolution asking Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and a majority of the cabinet to temporarily remove a president who is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”What the issues are: Pence refused to act, arguing the 25th Amendment should only be used when a president is medically incapacitated. Many Republicans argued against both impeachments on the ground that Trump’s actions didn’t meet the Constitution’s “high crimes and misdemeanors” standard, saying his Ukraine call wasn’t a federal crime and his Jan. 6 speech was merely inappropriate. Others, pointing out that Trump will be gone from office before the Senate trial commences, have argued that continuing with impeachment proceedings against a former president is constitutionally impermissible. Democrats have argued that it’s still important to hold Trump accountable and ensure that he can’t run for office again in the future.How it was resolved: We’re still waiting for the outcome of the Senate trial, as well as a possible legal challenge down the line if Trump is convicted. For all the legal arguments, removing a president is largely a partisan political affair. That hasn’t always been the case — President Richard Nixon resigned after Republican lawmakers told him he faced certain impeachment by both parties over the Watergate scandal. The party-line fights over impeachment during the Trump years have raised concern that this once-rare step will become a routine tool of political warfare — Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican and QAnon adherent, has already vowed to introduce articles of impeachment against Biden on Jan. 21.The Emoluments ClausesWhat happened: Trump has been unique in modern times in entering the presidency while maintaining ownership of a substantial international business. Federal ethics laws that prevent officials from benefiting from their positions don’t apply to the president, but the Constitution’s so-called emoluments clauses limit the president’s ability to receive payments, gifts or other things of value from foreign governments or domestic office-holders. Several lawsuits were filed seeking to bar Trump from profiting from spending by foreign diplomats at his properties, particularly the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, and require him to divest his holdings.What the issues were: Trump argued that normal commercial transactions, such as hotel bills, rent payments and golf club fees aren’t prohibited by the emoluments clauses. He also challenged the legal standing of the groups suing him, which included Democratic members of Congress, saying they could not demonstrate that they were directly injured by his acceptance of spending at his properties. How was it resolved: The legal back-and-forth over standing prevented the courts from reaching any definitive ruling on whether the president violated the emoluments clauses, and the cases may be thrown out as moot soon after Trump leaves office. Trump’s ability to evade the issue may make it easier for future presidents to mix their interests with the nation’s.Presidential ImmunityWhat happened: Trump was under scrutiny by federal law enforcement even before he took office over comments and associations that hinted at ties with Russians trying to help him win the 2016 election. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team ultimately detailed instances in which Trump may have obstructed its probe of Russian interference but also cited the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president.  That policy may also have shielded Trump from the federal campaign-finance charges to which his former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty for arranging hush-money payments to women who said they had sex with Trump years before he became president. Cohen said Trump directed the payments, and the president was described by federal prosecutors in court papers as “Individual 1.” New York state prosecutors launched an investigation into how Trump’s business handled those payments, and served a subpoena on the president’s accountants at Mazars USA seeking tax and financial records.What the issues were: Trump challenged the Mazars subpoena by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, arguing the presidency also grants him absolute immunity from state criminal investigation. Echoing Trump’s boast during the 2016 campaign that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any supporters, his lawyers argued that, if the president committed such a crime, he couldn’t be investigated, much less charged and arrested, until his term was over.How it got resolved: The case went to the Supreme Court, which ruled 7-2 in July that presidents aren’t immune from state criminal investigations and that prosecutors don’t have to meet a stricter standard when seeking evidence from the occupant of the Oval Office. Vance’s probe has since broadened and is seen as perhaps the most dire legal threat Trump will face in his post-presidency.Congressional Subpoena PowerWhat happened: Unlike his predecessors, Trump largely rejected the idea of congressional oversight, and his administration routinely denied legislators’ requests for information. House committees subpoenaed Trump’s taxes and financial records from his accountants and bankers as part of what lawmakers said were various congressional probes. House committees also subpoenaed Trump’s taxes from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and sought the testimony of White House Counsel Don McGahn concerning instances of obstruction of justice detailed in the Mueller report.What the issues were: Trump fought the congressional subpoenas for his financial records by arguing that the Constitution’s separation of powers meant lawmakers had no authority to investigate him for potential wrongdoing outside of an impeachment proceeding (he later refused to cooperate in that too). In the McGahn case, the administration contended that Congress did not have legal standing to sue to enforce its subpoena and that the courts had no power to resolve a dispute between the executive and legislative branches of government. The Mnuchin case was put on hold pending a ruling on McGahn’s subpoena.How it got resolved: Courts largely ruled that Congress could subpoena information from Trump and other administration officials, including a 7-2 Supreme Court ruling in the financial records case. But it’s telling that the information sought has yet to be turned over, with the cases now bogged down in litigation over additional issues. The drawn-out result suggests that an administration determined to stonewall Congress will still be able to find a way.ImmigrationWhat happened: Trump’s campaign and presidency were built in large part on hostility towards immigrants and foreigners. One of his first official acts was an executive order barring people from a group of majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. He also limited the ability of asylum-seekers to enter the country, separated families at the border, sought to exclude undocumented immigrants from the decennial U.S. Census and tried to end protections for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children. What the issues were: Critics claimed Trump’s policies violated the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause by enshrining racial, ethnic and religious bias, as well as other laws and legal precedents concerning immigrants. The Trump administration in turn argued that many of its immigration policies fell within the executive branch’s discretion over national security. It likewise pushed back on arguments that its push to drop undocumented immigrants from the census directly contravened language in the Constitution requiring “the whole number of persons” in each state to be counted by asserting executive power over how the tally is conducted. On the other hand, it argued the Dreamer protections President Obama put in place through his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive order were an unconstitutional usurpation of Congress’s legislative powers.How it was resolved: The Supreme Court has recognized that the president has broad authority over immigration. Still, many constitutional issues remain undecided, with Trump retreating on policies like family separation and others actions failing due to poor crafting or implementation. The Supreme Court blocked the attempt to end DACA because the Trump administration didn’t follow proper administrative procedure in trying to rescind Obama’s order. The justices also threw out as premature a challenge to Trump’s plan to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census because it wasn’t clear how the administration would implement it — the plan was dropped last week. A 5-4 court did uphold Trump’s third version of his travel ban, reaffirming the president’s “broad discretion” to block foreigners from entering the country and saying his motives couldn’t be questioned. Immigrants will likely be able to rest easier under the new administration, and Biden has also voiced support for making some protections permanent, particularly with legislation giving Dreamers a path to citizenship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pushed-the-limits-of-the-us-legal-system-here-s-how-it-held-up-101610893920201.html

"I feel great. Finally, I'm returning to my home town."He said he didn't think he would be arrested, calling himself an innocent person."What do I need to be afraid of? What bad thing can happen to me in Russia?" he added. "I feel like a citizen of Russia who has every right to return," he added.He was accompanied by his wife Yulia, and his spokeswoman.Navalny, who is hoping for success in parliamentary elections in September, faces potential trouble in three other criminal cases too, all of which he says are politically motivated.Conundrum for KremlinHis return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests and punitive Western action by turning him into a political martyr. Or do nothing and risk looking weak in the eyes of Kremlin hardliners.He is expected to arrive in Moscow at 1620 GMT.The opposition politician, who says he has nearly fully recovered, says Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin denies involvement, says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and that he is free to return to Russia.Navalny says the Kremlin is afraid of him. The Kremlin, which only refers to him as the "Berlin patient," laughs that off. Putin allies point to opinion polls that show the Russian leader is far more popular than Navalny, whom they call a blogger rather than a politician.Supporters plan to greet himNavalny took a flight operated by Russian airline Pobeda, owned by state-controlled Aeroflot.His supporters plan to meet him at Moscow's Vnukovo airport despite a forecast of bitterly cold minus 20 Celsius weather and over 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital.So far, at least 2,000 people have used a Facebook page to say they plan to be there, with another 6,000 expressing an interest. Pro-Kremlin activists are also expected to turn up.The Moscow prosecutor's office, which says it has officially warned 15 pro-Navalny organisers, has said the event is illegal because it is not sanctioned by the authorities. That means that people who turn up could be detained, fined or jailed.Reuters reporters saw a heavy police presence at the airport with dozens of police trucks.Citing COVID-19 restrictions, the airport has said it will not allow media inside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-navalny-boards-plane-in-germany-to-fly-to-russia-101610893054678.html

NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens revealed that there has been an increase of 15,000 inpatients across the country since Christmas, adding that it is equivalent to filling 30 hospitals with only Covid-19 patients.“The facts are very clear and I'm not going to sugar-coat them, hospitals are under extreme pressure and staff are under extreme pressure...Every thirty seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus,” said Stevens during the Andrew Marr show.The United Kingdom has been witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases following the emergence of highly transmissible variants of Sars-CoV-2. The rise in cases has forced authorities to announce temporary shut down of all travel corridors from 4am (local time) on Monday. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that inbound travellers will have to show a negative Covid-19 test result, taken within 72 hours before departure, along with a passenger locator form.“This means that if you come to this country, you must have proof of a negative Covid test that you've taken in the 72 hours before leaving. And you must have filled in your passenger locator form, and your airline will ask for proof of both before you take off,” Johnson announced.The UK is currently under an indefinite nationwide lockdown, with all non-essential businesses and services closed during the period. Meanwhile, the NHS has decided to open 10 new mass vaccination centres to increase the pace of its immunisation drive, including a rugby ground, racecourse, a food court and a cathedral as vaccination centres.“I'm pretty confident by the time we get to the end of today, Sunday night, we will have perhaps done 1.5 million vaccinations this past week, that's up from around a million the week before,” said Simons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-covid-19-patient-getting-admitted-to-hospital-every-30-seconds-nhs-chief-101610890130530.html

"But it's better that it happens now when we have stockpiles than when the wider vaccination campaign starts."He told Franceinfo that a limited delay should not present a huge problem.Nevertheless, several Nordic and Baltic countries have described the situation as "unacceptable", and Belgium's vaccination strategy task force condemned Pfizer for failing to consult them.France, which saw its death toll rise past 70,000 at the weekend, is set to begin a campaign to inoculate people over 75 from Monday. Russia plans to begin mass vaccinations the same day.The long process of vaccine rollouts mean countries still have few options but to rely on lockdowns, curfews and social distancing to control the spread of the virus.Switzerland and Italy are tightening their restrictions from Monday and Britain will require all arrivals to quarantine and show negative tests.Newspaper reports suggested the UK could try to emulate countries such as Australia and New Zealand in requiring travellers to self-isolate in hotels at their own expense.Foreign minister Dominic Raab said such a system could be difficult to manage but "we need to look at that very carefully based on the experience of other countries".Austria, currently in its third national lockdown, said that the current curbs will be extended by another two weeks until February 8 in face of the rise in infections and the spread of virus variants believed to be much more contagious.Biden pledgeAs Europe manages its vaccine rollout, the United States is struggling with a contagion that has killed close to 400,000 as president-elect Joe Biden prepares to take the reins of power from Donald Trump.Biden says he will sign executive orders to tackle the pandemic on the day he is inaugurated next week.He has pledged to set up thousands of immunisation sites, deploy mobile clinics and expand the public health workforce in a bid to revive the stuttering rollout of vaccines.India, second to the United States in the number of coronavirus cases, aims to inoculate 300 million people by July in one of the world's biggest vaccination drives.It will use two vaccines, the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot made locally by India's Serum Institute, and a homegrown jab called Covaxin.Spain began administering Sunday second vaccine doses to people who had already received the first at the end of December, mostly nursing home residents and care staff.In Norway, where 13 frail elderly people died after a first vaccine injection, the Medical Medicines Agency, after assessing the cases, suggested last week that the deaths could be linked to side effects of the jab.But agency official Steinar Madsen told public broadcaster NRK that the there was no cause for alarm."It is quite clear that these vaccines present very little risk, with the minimal exception of the most fragile patients", he said.'Anti-mask lunacy'With populations across the globe tiring of lockdown measures, protests continue to be held in many countries.Roughly 10,000 people marched in Austria's capital Vienna against coronavirus restrictions on Saturday, calling on the government to resign.Most of them refused to wear masks or respect social distancing rules, and their rally was condemned as "anti-mask lunacy" by a much smaller counter-protest.The pandemic also continues to wreak havoc on the global sporting calendar.The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year, was thrown into disarray Saturday when three people tested positive on two of the 17 charter flights bringing tennis players and their entourages to the country.A fourth person, a member of a broadcast team on one of the same flights tested positive Sunday.Quarantine rules mean 47 players will not be allowed out to train but organisers said the tournament was still set to begin February 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-seeks-to-ease-vaccine-concerns-as-virus-curbs-intensify-101610890683409.html
17-01-2021||World||German minister says coronavirus curbs should be eased for vaccinated people||People who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 should be allowed to go to restaurants and cinemas earlier than others, a German minister said, contradicting other cabinet members who have so far opposed special freedoms for those inoculated.Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the state had massively restricted people's basic rights in order to contain infections and avoid overwhelming hospitals."It has not yet been conclusively clarified to what extent vaccinated people can infect others," Maas told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper."What is clear, however, is that a vaccinated person no longer takes a ventilator away from anyone. This removes at least one central reason for restricting fundamental rights."Around 1 million people in Germany had been vaccinated as of Friday, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. Some 83.2 million people were living in the country at the end of 2020, data from the statistics office show.Maas's comments contrast with other German ministers, who have opposed such special rights, fearing it could lead to inequalities in society at a time when not everyone has the opportunity to get inoculated.A spokesman for the justice ministry told Reuters its was "out of the question" to treat vaccinated people differently while it had not been scientifically proven that vaccination also prevents transmission of the virus.A health ministry spokesman also rejected the suggestion, while Andrew Ullmann, health spokesman for the Free Democrats in the German parliament, said a discussion over privileges could only be held once vaccination becomes more widespread.Maas said the government was also restricting the rights of people who ran restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums."They have a right to reopen their businesses at some point, if there is a possibility to do so," he said, adding that if there were only vaccinated people at such venues they could no longer endanger each other.While Maas acknowledged this might lead to inequalities for a "transitional period", he said such a move would be justified under the constitution, as long as there was an objective reason and it didn't affect basic public services.Germany has extended lockdown measures until at least the end of January, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has brought forward a meeting with regional leaders to Tuesday to discuss tougher restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-minister-says-coronavirus-curbs-should-be-eased-for-vaccinated-people-101610888577533.html
17-01-2021||World||Senate divided by party gives Kamala Harris powerful tiebreaker role||Kamala Harris’s term as vice president will be defined from the start by the Senate’s partisan split, as the former lawmaker is pushed into a powerful role in a chamber that must decide whether to convict the outgoing president of inciting an insurrection.After wins by Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in Georgia’s runoff elections, the upper chamber is divided 50-50 between Republicans and the Democratic caucus, meaning Harris can use her tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate to push through nominees and pass bills on which senators are split along party lines.And it’s a cudgel she will likely have to use, even though President-elect Joe Biden’s team has said it hopes to secure Republican support for legislation, especially if Democrats don’t do away with the 60-vote rule on most legislation.No sooner than Biden and Harris are sworn in, they’ll be working to pass their $1.9 trillion Covid-relief plan, which has elements that would likely appeal to enough moderate Republicans to gain some favor in the Senate but other parts that may spur partisan warfare.Under current rules, Democrats can pass some items with just 51 votes through a process known as budget reconciliation. The rest will require the spirit of cooperation Biden had promised he can resurrect.Yet there’s no reason to believe Republicans will be in the mood to play along.Their narrow defeats in Georgia, setting up the 50-50 split, mean Republican Leader Mitch McConnell will lose his power to dictate the agenda in Washington or block nominees. But as minority leader, he’ll still hold sway over his own caucus.And the recent mob that stormed the Capitol, while uniting most members against the violence, also highlighted the deep political divides Biden’s administration will face.The Senate may soon be turning to putting Trump on trial after the House impeached him last week for a historic second time.The Supreme Court chief justice normally presides when a sitting president is tried, but Trump will be out of power by then. McConnell, in a memo to GOP senators, said it was unclear whether Chief Justice John Roberts would preside, and Roberts has declined to comment.If he doesn’t, Harris likely would be the presiding officer, which would give Democrats a one-vote edge to settle disputes on issues such as evidence.Biden has suggested that Harris could be a dealmaker instead of a tie-breaker, potentially taking on some of the good will he earned with the few senators remaining from his 36 years in the Senate.“I’ve never once misled any of my Republican colleagues. Not one single time. And they know they can trust Kamala as well. And we can figure out where we can cooperate. Where we can’t, we have our arguments,” Biden said on a December call with supporters.But Harris’s ability to win over Senate Republicans may be limited. Her contact list of friendly Republicans is smaller than Biden’s. She’s not known for close relationships with McConnell or his leadership team. Nor has she gained a reputation as a participant in the various “gangs” of party moderates and compromisers.In her four years in the Senate, Harris’s work put her consistently at odds with McConnell’s efforts with President Donald Trump to reshape the federal judiciary and pass the massive 2017 tax-cut bill with only GOP votes.On the Senate Judiciary Committee, she used her high-profile seat to oppose Trump’s judicial nominees and was a particularly incisive questioner of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings.Still, the progressive senator has collaborated with some Republicans. She worked with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Trump loyalist, to reauthorize a preservation program for historically black colleges and universities. She also worked with Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma on legislation that sought to protect U.S. elections from foreign meddling by strengthening the cybersecurity of voting systems.The narrow majority means party leaders will also have to accommodate Democrats from Republican-leaning or battleground states, such as West Virginia’s Joe Manchin and Montana’s Jon Tester. Recently elected Democrat Mark Kelly won in Arizona as a moderate, and he’ll be back on the ballot in 2022 as a target for Republicans.Democrats could craft a package that includes more stimulus checks, a progressive tax rewrite, a climate plan and an expansion of the Affordable Care Act. Trump used budget reconciliation to pass his tax cuts and attempted to use it to end the ACA, known as Obamacare, which was also passed in 2010 using budget reconciliation.The process does have limits, and with only 50 votes plus Harris, Democrats have no wiggle room. Changes to Social Security, for example, aren’t allowed under reconciliation, nor are items with even an incidental impact on spending or taxes.Other Democratic priorities such as gun control or increasing funding for agencies are also not allowed under reconciliation. Instead, those would be subject to a filibuster, a tactic the minority party can use to block action unless there are 60 votes in the Senate to proceed. That means incoming Majority Leader Chuck Schumer would have to find 10 Republicans to support the Democrats’ efforts.“Where we can find common purpose and common ground, let’s do that. Let that be our priority,” Harris told ABC News last month. “As opposed to finding out where we disagree, let’s actually focus on where we might agree, and then get some work done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-divided-by-party-gives-kamala-harris-powerful-tiebreaker-role-101610887250538.html
17-01-2021||World||Italian PM Giuseppe Conte to plough ahead with parliament vote||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte plans to plough ahead with a parliamentary showdown this week even with the prospect of a flimsy majority, newspapers including la Repubblica reported on Sunday.Conte may fall short of an absolute majority in the Senate on Tuesday after a plan to bring a significant number of independent and centrist senators on board to replace a junior ally failed, la Repubblica reported, without citing the source of the information. Matteo Renzi’s 18 senators will probably abstain, the former premier, who withdrew Italy Alive’s ministers from the cabinet last week, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera, published on Sunday.The outcome of Conte’s quest is still uncertain. He needs about a dozen more votes in the upper house to restore an outright majority in the 321-strong upper chamber after the defection of the group led by Renzi. Italy Alive’s abstentions would be enough to let Conte’s government survive. Renzi told Corriere he’s still seeking a coalition government with the same majority backing Conte.While Democratic Party and Five Star Movement officials have spoken against patching things up with Renzi, governing with a minority would put key legislation in jeopardy, including budget laws. Conte could still submit his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella after surviving the Senate vote to try and forge a new and stronger government, with more time to negotiate.Mattarella, who would oversee the process of forging a new government, has pressured Conte to ensure a quick resolution to the crisis and has insisted he must have a stable majority if he is to remain premier, officials with knowledge of the matter said. A group of centrists courted by the majority said on Saturday they wouldn’t back Conte’s government, Ansa reported, citing the UDC party.To bring senators on board, Conte’s supporters -- chiefly from the center-left Democratic Party and other centrists -- have been warning of the risk of a snap election, which would likely see a center-right alliance take power, officials campaigning of behalf Conte, who asked not to be identified, said.They’ve also argued that calling a general election in the middle of a global pandemic would damage Italy’s international credibility and risk unnerving investors and urged senators instead to focus on approving a plan to spend the windfall from the European Union’s recovery fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-to-plough-ahead-with-parliament-vote-101610884766286.html
17-01-2021||World||UK must not do trade deals with rights abusers, foreign minister says||Britain should not engage in free trade with countries that abuse human rights, but proposals that the country's courts should decide whether genocide has been committed by trade partners is flawed, foreign minister Dominic Raab said.Last week, Raab said Britain would introduce new rules for its companies to try to prevent goods linked to China's Xinjiang region entering their supply chains.Some British lawmakers want to go further and are due to consider proposals passed in the upper house of parliament that would give courts the power to stop free-trade agreements with countries if they consider them to have committed genocide."The bar is being set incredibly high," Raab told BBC television on Sunday. "I mean, frankly, we shouldn't be engaged in free-trade negotiations with countries abusing human rights well below the level of genocide."He said the proposals in parliament were problematic because Britain's High Court did not have the resources to investigate allegations of genocide."I think there's a second issue, which is really in relation to what we now know about what's going on in Xinjiang, the question is whether, in relation to any country that engaged in those human rights abuses, you engage in free-trade negotiations," he said."We shouldn't really be delegating the political question of who you engage in free-trade negotiations with to the courts," Raab said. "That's something MPs (members of parliament) should hold government to account about and we absolutely embrace that."Addressing parliament last week, Raab said there was evidence of forced labour among Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang after the United Nations estimated at least 1 million members of the minority among others were held in internment camps.China denies the accusation. A foreign ministry spokesman denounced the accusations of abuse in Xinjiang as Western lies.Britain is hoping to strike its own trade agreements with countries around the world following the expiry of a post-Brexit transition period for leaving the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-must-not-do-trade-deals-with-rights-abusers-foreign-minister-says-101610884304807.html
17-01-2021||World||Beirut blast chemicals possibly linked to Syrian businessmen: Report||The company that bought the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut last August had possible links to two Syrian businessmen under US sanctions for ties to President Bashar al-Assad, according to a report by a Lebanese journalist and London company filings.Savaro Ltd, the trading firm which procured the chemicals in 2013, shared a London address with companies linked to George Haswani and Imad Khoury, according to the report by documentary film-maker Firas Hatoum, which aired on Lebanon's al-Jadeed TV station this week.Haswani, Khoury and his brother Mudalal Khoury have all been sanctioned by Washington for supporting Assad's war effort. All three are joint Syrian-Russian nationals, according to the US sanctions list and a database that gathers data from official Russian institutions.The US Treasury accused Mudalal Khoury in 2015 of "an attempted procurement of ammonium nitrate in late 2013". It sanctioned his brother Imad a year later for engaging in business activities with Mudalal. Haswani was sanctioned in 2015 on charges of helping Assad's government to buy oil from Islamic State militants, which he has denied.In reviewing filings with Companies House, the UK's companies registry, Reuters found that Savaro and Hesco Engineering and Construction Company Ltd, a firm subject to US sanctions for its links to Haswani, both moved their corporate registers -- official company records -- to the same London address on June 25, 2011.That address was also the registered office for IK Petroleum Industrial Company Ltd, in which Imad Khoury was a director, the filings show.Dozens of companies can share listed addresses and such links do not necessarily prove company owners are connected. But it is rare for firms to move their registers, particularly to the same address on the same day, according to a Reuters review of filings by hundreds of companies.Reuters located the agent which had helped register Hesco, but it did not respond to attempts to seek comment about Hesco's relationship with Savaro. Reuters could not determine if Haswani controlled Savaro, which might have provided a possible indication of his involvement in the procurement of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut.Imad Khoury denied links to Savaro. "There is a registrar in London, many companies are registered by it, not just mine," he told Reuters. "I don't know this Savaro."Mudalal Khoury said there was "no logic" behind laying blame for the Beirut explosion on a company registered at a London address where many others are also registered.Reuters could not reach Haswani for comment. His son told Reuters in Moscow that his father was unlikely to comment on allegations of links to the chemicals because they are "total nonsense".CALL FOR INVESTIGATIONThe findings about the possible links between Savaro and the Syrian businessmen have raised questions among some in Beirut over whether the ammonium nitrate, which is used for fertilizer but also explosives, may have been destined for Syria."We want this to be investigated," Youssef Lahoud, a lawyer who represents around 1,400 victims of the blast, told Reuters."It may lead us nowhere or it may be the thread that unravels but we must follow up."Lebanese Justice Minister Marie Claude Najm told Reuters the report should be investigated, as with any other allegations related to the ongoing probe into the blast, which is in the hands of the investigating judge and is confidential.The Companies House register identifies a Cypriot national, Marina Psyllou, as director and majority owner of Savaro since 2016. Psyllou told Reuters in an email on Friday that she does not manage or own Savaro. She did not respond to questions about Haswani.The Beirut blast killed 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed entire neighbourhoods. Officials have said the chemicals went up in flames after being stored at the port in poor conditions for years.The ammonium nitrate was loaded onto a ship called the Rhosus in Georgia, shipping records show, before making an unscheduled stop in Lebanon in late 2013. It never left, becoming tangled in a legal dispute. The Mozambican firm that ordered the nitrate, FEM, has said it ordered the shipment through Savaro Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beirut-blast-chemicals-possibly-linked-to-syrian-businessmen-report-101610884132281.html
17-01-2021||World||UN says nations failing to fund climate adaptation to help vulnerable countries||The world is falling short of promises made under the Paris climate deal to help the most vulnerable nations deal with the increasingly devastating impacts of climate change, according to the United Nations.Adaptation -- reducing the fallout among communities and increasing their capacity to deal with climate-related disasters such as floods and drought -- is a pillar of the landmark 2015 accord, which aims to chart a path away from catastrophic warming.The deal requires signatories to implement adaptation measures through national planning, but also through funding to at-risk countries.The UN Environment Programme Adaptation Gap report found that the current finance levels of around $30 billion annually for adaptation fell far short of the annual cost in developing nations of $70 billion.It said the true cost of adapting to climate impacts in these nations could be as high as $300 billion every year by the end of the decade and $500 billion by mid-century."The hard truth is that climate change is upon us," said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director."Its impacts will intensify and hit vulnerable countries and communities the hardest -- even if we meet the Paris Agreement goals of holding global warming this century to well below 2C."UNEP called for a drastic scale-up of public and private finance for adaptation, as well as increased investment in nature-based solutions such as protecting and sustainably restoring ecosystems.Limit lossesWith just over 1C of warming since the start of the industrial era, Earth is already experiencing more intense and frequent extreme weather such as droughts and flooding, as well as storms supercharged by rising seas.Much of the devastation wrought by climate-linked disasters falls on developing nations, and despite promises to help out financially, richer countries still aren't hitting their adaptation funding targets.UNEP said funding for adaptation currently represented just five percent of all climate finance.With the cost of natural disasters set to skyrocket this century, hard-hit nations are finding it difficult to secure the finance to rebuild after extreme events.Mozambique, which was battered by twin cyclones in early 2019, said that one year since the disasters it had received less than a quarter of the estimated $3 billion it needed to recover.The UN report found that cutting greenhouse gas emissions will provide a long-term economic benefit by reducing the costs associated with climate change.Achieving the 2C Paris Agreement temperature rise limit could curb losses in annual growth to 1.6%, compared with 2.2% for 3C of warming -- the current trajectory if nations' current Paris pledges are upheld.Under the deal's "ratchet" mechanism, countries are supposed to file new emissions reduction plans -- known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs -- every five years.The deadline for the first round of new NDC submissions was December 31, 2020. However just 71 countries representing under a third of global emissions have done so.UNEP says global emissions must fall 7.6 percent annually this decade to keep the more ambitious Paris temperature target of 1.5C in play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-nations-failing-to-fund-climate-adaptation-to-help-vulnerable-countries-101610883412570.html

The cause of the incident was not immediately clear."We will start the rescue operations of the approximately 15 crew members stuck on three lifeboats," Guner said. "There are no reports of casualties or of the lifeboats sinking right now. Weather conditions are poor, rescue teams are also struggling to go out," he was cited as saying.No further details were immediately available.Guner said rescue operations were underway despite poor weather conditions in the area, which initially caused rescuers to struggle in reaching the crew members. He added civilian ships had also been asked to help with rescue operations.He said lifeboats carrying the crew members could be seen 600-700 metres from the shore and that a Navy vessel had been deployed to reach them.

17-01-2021||World||Navalny plans to return to Russia after recovery in Germany||Leading Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny plans to fly home to Russia on Sunday after recovering in Germany from his poisoning in August with a nerve agent.Navalny announced Wednesday that he would return, despite Russian authorities' threats to put him behind bars again. He is expected to fly from Berlin to Moscow. On Thursday, Russia's prison service said that he faces immediate arrest once he returns.Navalny, who has blamed his poisoning on the Kremlin, charged that Russian President Vladimir Putin was now trying to deter him from coming home with new legal motions. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied a role in the opposition leader's poisoning.At the end of December, the Federal Penitentiary Service, or FSIN, warned Navalny that he faced time in prison if he fails to immediately report to its office in line with the terms of a suspended sentence and probation he received for a 2014 conviction on charges of embezzlement and money laundering that he rejected as politically motivated. The European Court for Human Rights had ruled that his conviction was unlawful.The FSIN said Thursday it issued an arrest warrant for Navalny after he failed to report to its office. The prison service, which has asked a Moscow court to turn Navalny's 3 1/2-year suspended sentence into a real one, said it's “obliged to take all the necessary action to detain Navalny pending the court's ruling.” Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later.Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Russian authorities insisted that the doctors who treated Navalny in Siberia before he was airlifted to Germany found no traces of poison and have challenged German officials to provide proof of his poisoning. They refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.Last month, Navalny released the recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he described as an alleged member of a group of officers of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him in August and then tried to cover it up. The FSB dismissed the recording as fake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-plans-to-return-to-russia-after-recovery-in-germany-101610879440906.html

"It may take time, but in the meantime, we can always order a moratorium," he added.At the end of December, the United States moved to boost tariffs on French and German aircraft parts, wines and other spirits in the Boeing-Airbus subsidy dispute, but the bloc decided to hold off on retaliation for now.The EU is planning to present a World Trade Organization reform proposal in February and is willing to consider reforms to restrain the judicial authority of the WTO's dispute-settlement body.The United States has for years complained that the WTO Appellate Body makes unjustified new trade rules in its decisions and has blocked the appointment of new judges to stop this, rendering the body inoperable.The Trump administration, which leaves office on Wednesday, had threatened to impose tariffs on French cosmetics, handbags and other goods in retaliation for France's digital services tax, which it said discriminated against US tech firms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-wants-suspension-of-poisonous-us-europe-trade-spat-101610876880867.html

It did not elaborate.On Saturday, Germany, France and Britain pressed Iran to back off its plan to develop uranium metal, calling it “the latest planned violation” of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something Iran insists it does not want to do.“Iran has no credible civilian use for uranium metal,” they said in a joint statement. “The production of uranium metal has potentially grave military implications.”On Thursday, the IAEA said Iran had informed it that it had begun installing equipment for the production of uranium metal. It said Tehran maintains its plans to conduct research and development on uranium metal production are part of its “declared aim to design an improved type of fuel.”Iran reacted to the European statement Sunday saying Iran informed the UN nuclear watchdog nearly two decades ago of its plans for the “peaceful and conventional” production of uranium metal. It also said it provided updated information to the agency two years ago about its plans to produce silicide advanced fuel.The statement said uranium metal is an “intermediate product” in the manufacture of uranium silicide, a fuel used in nuclear reactors that is safer and has more power capability than uranium oxide-based fuel, which Iran currently produces.The three European nations alongside the US, Russia and China signed the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that prohibited research and production of uranium metal.President Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from Iran’s nuclear deal, in which Tehran had agreed to limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. After the US then ramped up sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal’s limits on its nuclear development.President-elect Joe Biden, who was vice president when the deal was signed during the Obama administration, has said he hopes to return the US to the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-urges-un-watchdog-not-to-publish-unnecessary-details-on-nuclear-program-101610874598356.html
17-01-2021||World||Trump asks appeals court to let him dodge rape accuser suit||President Donald Trump urged a federal appeals court to rule that he qualifies as a government employee under a law that would let him to dodge a defamation suit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York advice columnist who claims he raped her two decades ago.Trump late Friday asked the US Court of Appeals in Manhattan to reverse a district judge’s finding from October that presidents aren’t covered by the Westfall Act of 1988, which protects government workers from being personally sued for actions related to their official duties. The US Justice Department filed a separate brief backing Trump’s argument.Carroll went public in 2019 with her allegation that Trump attacked her in a deserted area of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan. She then sued him for defamation after he said she was lying and accused her of conspiring with Democrats to undermine him. Trump claims his statements denying Carroll’s claim were part of his official duties.“Presidents plainly are employees of the Government, and Congress plainly intended Presidents to be covered by the Westfall Act -- notwithstanding the District Court’s strenuous but strained and unsuccessful effort to show otherwise here,” Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said in the filing.The case won’t be impacted by Trump’s departure from office next week after losing the November election to President-elect Joe Biden, whose Justice Department will inherit the case. Carroll has been trying to push ahead with the exchange of evidence between the two sides, including deposing Trump under oath and securing a DNA sample from him.It isn’t a foregone conclusion that the Biden administration will accept Carroll’s novel arguments about the law. The Westfall Act has previously been applied to other presidents in litigation, including Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, though under different circumstances. But even if the incoming administration believes the law applies to Trump, it may disagree that his specific comments about Carroll were part of his official duties.“We expect that the new Department of Justice under President Biden will want to take a long, hard look as to whether they agree with Donald Trump that his hateful and defamatory statements about E. Jean Carroll were made within the scope of his employment as President of the United States,” Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, said in a statement on Saturday.U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan rejected the Justice Department’s argument in October, finding that Trump’s comments about Carroll wouldn’t be protected by the law anyway because they related to an allegation about conduct from before he was elected. On Friday, the government said Kaplan was mistaken.‘Scope of His Office’Trump’s disputed comments were an “outgrowth of the President’s public response to allegations challenging his fitness for office,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Jennifer Dickey said in the filing. “He thus acts within the scope of his office when, in this context, he seeks to defuse personal issues that threaten to impair his ability to achieve his agenda.”The court will look at several comments by Trump after Carroll’s claims went public, including a statement issued to the media by the White House comparing Carroll’s claims to “false” accusations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and saying they “diminish the severity of real assault.” Trump later told reporters: “I’ll say it with great respect: Number one, she’s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened.”The appeals court will determine whether the president is an “employee of the government” for purposes of the federal law protecting such workers from litigation. It will also decide whether Trump was acting within the scope of his office when he made allegedly defamatory statements.If the court allows the U.S be substituted for Trump as defendant in the suit, the case would be dismissed because the government can’t be sued for defamation.The case is Carroll v. Trump, 20-cv-07311, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-asks-appeals-court-to-let-him-dodge-rape-accuser-suit-101610875231385.html

Some sought refuge in the mountains, while others went to cramped evacuation centres, witnesses said.Police and military officers have been deployed to crack down on looting in several parts of the region, Jati added.An emergency response status, intended to help rescue efforts, has also been put in place for two weeks, he said.Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's meteorological, climatology and geophysical agency (BMKG), has said that another quake in the region could potentially trigger a tsunami.Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.Just two weeks into the new year, the world's fourth-most populous country is battling several disasters.Floods in North Sulawesi and South Kalimantan province each have killed at least five this month, while landslides in West Java province have killed at least 29, authorities said.On Jan. 9, a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea with 62 onboard.East Java's Semeru mountain erupted late on Saturday, but there have been no reports of casualties or evacuations.Dwikorita said extreme weather and other "multi-dangers" of hydrometeorology are forecast in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quake-death-toll-at-73-as-indonesia-struggles-with-string-of-disasters-101610874669730.html
17-01-2021||World||Explainer: Italy faces a political crisis amid a pandemic||Former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi is testing his already low popularity by provoking a political crisis that could bring down Italy's coalition government at a critical juncture in the coronavirus pandemic.Renzi orchestrated the resignations of two ministers from his tiny but key Italia Viva party. The outcome of his power play will become clearer this week, when Premier Giuseppe Conte addresses both houses of Parliament. If Conte makes a successful bid for support, he could go on to form what would be his third coalition government since Italy's 2018 election.Renzi’s power playThis is not Renzi’s first foray as an iconoclast shaking up Italian politics. He became premier in 2014 by out-maneuvering and unceremoniously deposing then-fellow Democratic Party member Enrico Letta as Italy's leader. Renzi himself fell from power nearly three years later after gambling his popularity on a constitutional referendum that failed.Now, the 46-year-old former Florence mayor might bring down Conte. He broadly accuses the premier of not properly managing the coronavirus crisis. Renzi says he is only following his conscience, at great political cost.“Italia Viva did not start the crisis. It has been going on for months,’’ he asserted during a press conference last week.Renzi, a senator for the Italia Viva party, supported Conte during an earlier, failed power grab by Matteo Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League party that was part of Conte's first government.New polls show junior coalition partner Italia Viva has the support of just 2.4% of survey respondents, down from a high of 6.2% at the party’s inception. Italia Viva was created in September 2019 when Renzi bolted the Democratic Party he once ran. He brought with him two Cabinet members, giving himself the kind of leverage he employed last week.Conte's next moveWith the resignation of the Italia Viva ministers, Conte is working to shore up support in parliament among independent lawmakers. He still has the backing of the Democratic Party and the 5-Star Movement, which have criticized Renzi’s move as irresponsible.Conte will make his case in the lower house on Monday and to the Senate on Tuesday. A voice vote will take place after each appearance, tantamount to a vote of confidence.If he fails to secure enough backing, Conte would likely submit his resignation to Italian President Sergio Mattarella. In that case, a technical government could be put in place. Analysts believe an early election is the least likely outcome, due to the difficulty of holding a political campaign and election during the pandemic. There are also concerns that the right-wing opposition would gain strength, and possible lead a new government. The current majority would like to hold on at least until January 2022, when a new president must be chosen.Conte may survive to lead what would be his third government by cobbling together enough support in both houses. And it is still possible that Italia Viva will restore its backing.What's at stakeItaly expects to have 222 billion euros ($268 billion) in European Union economic recovery funds to manage, money that is crucial to modernizing the country and its limping economy.While Conte had wide support during Italy's devastating go-round with the coronavirus in the first half of 2020, cracks in his popularity have appeared during the even more deadly fall resurgence. Four months into the government's system of tiered restrictions, new confirmed daily infections remain stubbornly high, and Italy's pandemic death toll of 81,800 is the second-highest in Europe after Britain.Conte's government also is under fire for not keeping high schools open during the pandemic, a decision mostly tied to inadequate transportation to allow for social distancing. And there are concerns that Italy does not have enough medical personnel to carry out the country's vaccination campaign.But the crisis was ultimately spurred when Conte presented a plan that would have put himself in charge of managing the EU recovery funds. Political analyst Wolfgang Piccoli called it “the ultimate mistake,’’ setting up Renzi’s move to reassert his own “prominence.”Italians are showing little patience for the political infighting when the nation’s priority is getting the coronavirus pandemic under control and rolling out the vaccines that many hope will end the nation's long coronavirus nightmare. In a new poll, 42% of Italians said they didn't understand what provoked the latest government divisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-italy-faces-a-political-crisis-amid-a-pandemic-101610873264145.html
17-01-2021||World||East European inoculation efforts hit snag over vaccine skepticism||Vaccines from the West, Russia or China? Or none at all? That dilemma faces nations in southeastern Europe, where coronavirus vaccination campaigns are off to a slow start — overshadowed by heated political debates and conspiracy theories.In countries like the Czech Republic, Serbia, Bosnia, Romania and Bulgaria, vaccine skeptics have included former presidents and even some doctors. Serbian tennis champion Novak Djokovic was among those who said he did not want to be forced to get inoculated.False beliefs that the coronavirus is a hoax or that vaccines would inject microchips into people have spread in the countries that were formerly under harsh Communist rule. Those who once routinely underwent mass inoculations are deeply split over whether to get the vaccines at all.“There is a direct link between support for conspiracy theories and skepticism toward vaccination,” a recent Balkan study warned. “A majority across the region does not plan to take the vaccine, a ratio considerably lower than elsewhere in Europe, where a majority favors taking the vaccine.”Only about 200,000 people applied for the vaccine in Serbia, a country of 7 million, in the days after authorities opened the procedure. By contrast, 1 million Serbians signed up for 100 euros ($120) on the first day the government offered the pandemic aid.Hoping to encourage vaccinations, Serbian officials have gotten their shots on TV. Yet they themselves have been split over whether to get the Western-made Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or Russia’s Sputnik V, more divisions in a country that is formally seeking European Union membership but where many favor closer ties with Moscow.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Saturday greeted a shipment of 1 million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, saying he will receive a shot to show that it is safe.“Serbs prefer the Russian vaccine,” read a recent headline of the Informer, a pro-government tabloid, as officials announced that 38% of those who have applied to take the shots favor the Russian vaccine, while 31% want the Pfizer-BioNTech version — a rough division among pro-Russians and pro-Westerners in Serbia.In neighboring Bosnia, a war-torn country that remains ethnically divided among Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats, politics also are a factor, as the Serb-run half appeared set to opt for the Russian vaccine, while the Bosniak-Croat part likely will turn to the Western ones.Sasa Milovanovic, a 57-year-old real estate agent from Belgrade, sees all vaccines as part of the “global manipulation” of the pandemic.“People are locked up, they have no lives any longer and live in a state of hysteria and fear,” he said.Djokovic has said he was against being forced to take a coronavirus vaccine in order to travel and compete but was keeping his mind open. The top-ranked tennis player and his wife tested positive in June after a series of exhibition matches with zero social distancing that he organized in the Balkans. They and their foundation have donated 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to buy ventilators and other medical equipment for hospitals in Serbia.Serbian Health Ministry official Mirsad Djerlek has described the vaccine response as “satisfactory,” but cautioned on the state-run RTS broadcaster that “people in rural areas usually believe in conspiracy theories, and that is why we should talk to them and explain that the vaccine is the only way out in this situation.”A study by the Balkans in Europe Policy Advisory Group, published before the regional vaccination campaign started in December, concluded that virus conspiracy theories are believed by nearly 80% of citizens of the Western Balkan countries striving to join the EU. About half of them will refuse to get vaccinated, it said.Baseless theories allege the virus isn’t real or that it’s a bioweapon created by the US or its adversaries. Another popular falsehood holds that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is using Covid-19 vaccines to implant microchips in the planet's 7 billion people.A low level of information about the virus and vaccines, distrust in governments and repeated assertions by authorities that their countries are besieged by foreigners help explain the high prevalence of such beliefs, according to the Balkans think tank.Similar trends have been seen even in some eastern European Union countries.In Bulgaria, widespread conspiracy theories hampered past efforts to deal with a measles outbreak. Surveys there suggested distrust of vaccines remains high even as coronavirus cases keep rising. A recent Gallup International poll found that 30% of respondents want to get vaccinated, 46% will refuse and 24% are undecided.Bulgarian doctors have tried to change attitudes. Dr. Stefan Konstantinov, a former health minister, joked that people should be told neighboring Greece would close resorts to tourists who don't get vaccinated, because “this would guarantee that some 70% of the population would rush to get a jab.”In the Czech Republic, where surveys show some 40% reject vaccination, protesters at a big rally against government virus restrictions in Prague demanded that vaccinations not be mandatory. Former President Vaclav Klaus, a fierce critic of the government's pandemic response, told the crowd that vaccines are not a solution.“They say that everything will be solved by a miracle vaccine,” said the 79-year-old Klaus, who insists that people should get exposed to the virus to gain immunity, which experts reject. “We have to say loud and clear that there’s no such a thing. … I am not going to get vaccinated.”Populist authorities in Hungary have taken a hard line against virus misinformation, but rejection of vaccines is still projected at about 30%. Parliament passed emergency powers in March that allows authorities to prosecute anyone deemed to be “inhibiting the successful defense” against the virus, including “fearmongering” or spreading false news. At least two people who criticized the government's response to the pandemic on social media were arrested, but neither was formally charged.Romanian Health Minister Vlad Voiculescu said he is relying on family doctors to “inform, schedule and monitor people after the vaccine” and that his ministry will offer bonuses to medical workers based on the number of people they get onboard. Asked if such incentives would fuel anti-vaccination propaganda, Voiculescu said: “I am interested more by the doctors’ view on the matter than I am about the anti-vaxxers.”Dr. Ivica Jeremic, who has worked with virus patients in Serbia since March and tested positive himself in November, hopes vaccination programs will gain speed once people overcome their fear of the unknown."People will realize the vaccine is the only way to return to normal life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/east-european-inoculation-efforts-hit-snag-over-vaccine-skepticism-101610872974879.html
17-01-2021||World||Indonesia hunts for survivors as quake death toll hits 60||A powerful earthquake on Indonesia's Sulawesi island has killed at least 60 people, authorities said Sunday, with thousands left homeless as rescuers raced to find anyone still alive under mountains of rubble more than two days after the disaster.But monsoon rains were challenging the search effort, as hundreds of injured overwhelmed the only local hospital still operating in the aftermath of the 6.2-magnitude quake, which struck early Friday.The tremor triggered panic among residents of the island, which was hit by a 2018 quake-tsunami disaster that killed thousands.Rescuers have been filling body bags with corpses hauled from beneath crumpled buildings in Mamuju, a city of 110,000 people in West Sulawesi province, where a hospital was flattened and a shopping mall lay in ruins.Others were killed south of the city.The death toll could still climb.Excavators, cranes and other heavy equipment were deployed across the devastated seaside city where buildings were reduced to a tangled mass of twisted metal and chunks of concrete, including the regional governor's office.It was unclear how many people -- dead or alive -- could be still under the debris."We heard a roaring sound and the house started shaking," said survivor Jumardi, 50, from a shelter where he and six family members took refuge."All I had in my mind was that I would die...Everyone was panicking."Authorities have not given a figure for how many survivors have been rescued.A pair of young sisters plucked from under the mass of concrete and other debris were treated in hospital.Meanwhile, corpses were recovered from under a collapsed hospital, while five members of a family of eight were found dead in the crumpled remains of their home.Running low on food, supplies Masked doctors treated patients with broken limbs and other injuries at a makeshift medical centre set up outside the only one of the city's hospitals that survived the quake relatively intact.Among them was Wawan, who was rescued by neighbours after the violent tremor buried him.The 27-year-old initially didn't want to go into a hospital to treat a broken foot."I was traumatised," said the man, who like many Indonesians goes by one name."But people convinced me that the doctors were treating patients outside the building, so I agreed to go."Thousands left homeless by the quake took to makeshift shelters -- many little more than tarpaulin-covered tents filled with whole families.They said they were running low on food, blankets and other aid, as emergency supplies were rushed to the hard-hit region.Many survivors are unable to return to their destroyed homes, or were too scared to go back fearing a tsunami sparked by aftershocks, which are common after strong earthquakes."It's better to take shelter before something worse happens," said Mamuju resident Abdul Wahab, from a tent with his wife and four kids, including a baby.Fearing an outbreak of coronavirus in the crowded camps, authorities were trying to separate high- and lower-risk groups."Covid-19 further complicates (the) emergency response," said NGO Project HOPE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-hunts-for-survivors-as-quake-death-toll-hits-60-101610871745654.html
17-01-2021||World||Second wave of Covid in Canada is far more widespread||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Canada is proving to be far more widespread than even the spring outbreak, with public health officials projecting the country could record an additional 100,000 cases of infections within a 10-day period.To place that figure in context, it took months to reach the number in Canada in 2020 after the coronavirus crisis began. According to the news outlet CBC, it has taken less than a fortnight for the number of confirmed cases in the country to jump from 600,000 and cross the 700,000 mark. Canada is now reporting 702,183 cases with 17,865 deaths.This continued escalation comes even as the country grapples with a slow pace of vaccinations amidst a major supplier, Pfizer, cutting supplies for the time being.The manufacturer of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is reducing supplies as it retools production in Belgium to expend long-term production capacity, impacting the vaccination plans to several provinces which have already undertaken administration of the first dose to many in vulnerable demographics.Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand tweeted, “We are once again in touch with representatives from Pfizer to reiterate firmly the importance for Canada to return to our regular delivery schedule as soon as possible.”The government was hopeful regular supplies will be restored by March so the vaccination drive could return to normal.That comes amidst grim projections from the Public Health Agency of Canada. New modelling indicates that cases could rise to over 12,500 daily if the current level of contacts is maintained by Canadians and could reach nearly 30,000 per day if interactions were to increase. Drastic measures, like an overnight curfew in the province of Quebec, and a near-lockdown in Ontario, are among the steps that have been taken in an effort to change the trajectory.Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam said that forecasting showed that “we could have 10,000 cases daily by the end of January, with increasing hospitalisations and deaths expected to continue to follow the rising case numbers.” She added that given the current momentum “rapid accumulation of cases will continue until we can make significant progress in interrupting spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-wave-of-covid-in-canada-is-far-more-widespread-101610872081053.html
17-01-2021||World||Biden has already calmed the Middle East||Reconciliation is breaking out across the Middle East. A Saudi-led quartet of Arab states has ended a three-and-a-half-year embargo of Qatar. Turkey is seeking accommodations with France, Greece, Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia after years of tensions. Egypt, Jordan, France and Germany are pressing for new peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.There is every prospect other Arab states will join the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan in normalizing relations with Israel — Oman and Qatar are the likeliest. Even Hamas in Gaza seems open to terms of cohabitation with the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in Ramallah.This unprecedented series of pronouncements and meetings in the region comes on the run-up to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. It bookends an era of Hobbesian hostility in the Middle East that characterized President Donald Trump’s isolationism, and the eagerness of other powers — notably Russia — to upend American global hegemony.Also Read: Joe Biden unveils $1.9 trillion plan to stem virus and steady US economyTrump’s vow to put America first destabilized traditional U.S. relationships with Europe, NATO, allies in Asia and multi-lateral approaches to various conflicts in the Middle East. He described the Syrian conflict, where the U.S. had successfully built a coalition to defeat Islamic State, as a wasteland of “blood-stained sand.” He told the graduating class of West Point that it was “not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that. many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world.”This was a radical departure from President George H.W Bush’s “new world order” that set the U.S. on course to play a key role in the Middle East in the 1990s and 2000s. Trump’s message to countries in the region was that they should go it alone. While there were already wars in the region when he came into office, American inattention allowed the intensification of conflicts, usually involving foreign actors—Turkey, Russia and Egypt in Libya; Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen; Turkey, Russia and Iran in Syria.Even though the Trump administration took a tough approach on Iran sanctions, the Islamic Republic felt free to step up attacks on shipping in the Gulf of Oman, use drones and cruise missiles against Saudi oil infrastructure and traffic men, money and munitions to proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.With Biden administration now imminent, many belligerents are softening their tone in anticipation of a more active American role in the region. Even Iran, which has bucked the trend by ratcheting up uranium enrichment and conducting a series of sabre-rattling exercises, is hoping the President-elect will quickly disavow Trump’s policies.    Expectations of a return to the pre-Trump order have been heightened by the President-elect’s choice of officials with substantial Middle East experience for key cabinet positions: Anthony Blinken (nominee for Secretary of State), Lloyd Austin (nominee for Secretary of Defense) and Jake Sullivan (nominee for National Security Advisor). It is not lost on anyone in the Middle East that Biden himself has had a long, deep engagement with the region, and a personal connection to many of the key players.Also Read: Proud moment, says kin of Kashmiri-origin woman named in Joe Biden teamSo, at the very least, the region’s leaders are inclined to ease up on their mutual hostility as they wait to see how the new dispensation in Washington addresses their anxieties and ambitions. It is striking how, after several years in which each week seemed to bring the prospect of fresh confrontation or conflict, a calm has descended over the Middle East.The existing hostilities won’t end with Biden’s swearing-in, of course. But it might just end the impression that countries can use any means to get what they want in the absence of an American-led, rules-based international order. That view, fostered by Trump, encouraged a scramble for ungoverned spaces and occupation of weak states or disputed areas. Now that Biden has declared, “America is back,” it appears the Middle East is paying heed.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Seth J. Frantzman covers Middle East affairs for the Jerusalem Post.

17-01-2021||World||Merkel’s successor Laschet needs to strike right tone with Biden and EU||The election of Armin Laschet as the new leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union is good news for the European Union and those who welcome engagement with China and Russia.What kind of rapport he strikes with the new U.S. leader remains to be seen.The 59-year-old state leader from the industrial heartlands endorses the moderate economic and foreign policy course set by Merkel, has a good relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron and shares her vision of a more integrated EU.More controversially, he shares Merkel’s openness toward Chinese network provider Huawei Technologies Co. and her support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Russia. Both of those issues posed problems for the previous U.S. administration and the stance in Washington is unlikely to shift with the transition from Donald Trump to Joe Biden following next week’s inauguration.Analysts assume no change. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmieding described Laschet as “no foreign policy expert so he will therefore continue Merkel’s foreign policy.” Is that the right assumption?The challenge for Laschet will be to offer continuity while carving his own path as someone with an eye on running Europe’s dominant economy come September elections. He’ll want to avoid the fate of a predecessor who was never able to emerge from Merkel’s shadow and point to a track record of being a conservative able to win in a traditionally left-dominated state.In terms of raising his international profile, Laschet was one of the first German politicians who congratulated Biden and praised his victory as proof that elections could still be won without a populist campaign. Tellingly, he also signaled openness to a transatlantic trade agreement once Biden will have taken office.There’s no guarantee that Laschet will be nominated to be chancellor when the CDU and its Bavarian sister party choose their candidate for the federal election. But his position as party leader will nevertheless give him a central role in that decision and, most likely, in shaping the policies of the next German government.His election also gives a clear indication of the mood within the CDU. Faced with the opportunity to abandon Merkel’s moderate line in favor of the hard-edged conservatism of Friedrich Merz, a long-time critic of the chancellor, the party’s 994 voting delegates opted for Laschet, albeit by a narrow margin of 53% to 47%.“I look forward to our cooperation,” Merkel announced in a statement on the party’s Twitter account. Laschet might even prove to be a stronger advocate of EU integration than Merkel was. As former member of the EU parliament, he’s still strongly attached to the vision of a more united Europe. “The Germany I imagine is a European Germany,” Laschet told delegates ahead of the vote.On domestic policy too, Laschet represents business as usual. He’s backed Merkel’s decision to leverage the power of the federal balance sheet to help German businesses weather the pandemic as well as her goal of returning to a balanced budget in 2022.“We will face major economic challenges after the pandemic,” Laschet told public broadcaster ARD in an interview Saturday evening. “We will have a huge budget problem, because we still have to hand out state aid to businesses during the pandemic.”During the 2015 refugee crisis that left the chancellor seriously weakened, Laschet was one of her staunchest defenders -- his ties to the immigrant community earned him the nickname “Turkish Armin” and made him a target for conservatives.On climate too, Laschet has matched Merkel’s cautious approach of trying to limit emissions without imposing too much of a burden on German industry. As state leader in North-Rhine Westphalia, he’s familiar with the interests of the still-powerful coal mining and steel industries.Just how much scope he will have to pursue that vision will be determined by his party’s next major decision, when the CDU and the Christian Social Union from Bavaria pick their candidate for September’s general election.Laschet has signaled he’d be prepared to step aside if CSU leader Markus Soeder looks a better bet, though some in the CDU say he’s too ambitious to do that.“As party leader, he’s in the pole position,” Schmieding said. “But the narrow margin of his victory shows that not everybody in the party supports him.”Either candidate would be in good position to forge a coalition deal with the Greens after the election -- which is the most likely combination indicated by the polls. Soeder was photographed with a tree in 2019 as he sought to demonstrate his environmental credentials, whereas Green party leaders had suggested cohabiting with Merz would be difficult.Laschet has a brief window to prove himself by engineering gains in state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate in March before the nomination is finalized.“We will work well together: the chancellor, the new CDU party leader and me,” Soeder said in a televised statement after the vote. “I am sure that Armin Laschet and I will resolve all further questions.”Many conservatives view Soeder, who isn’t shy about his political ambitions, as better suited for the chancellor candidacy.

17-01-2021||World||'350 miles across five states over 22 days': Sindhi community in US to hold march against Pak atrocities||Members of the Sindhi community, a minority from Pakistan, are gearing up to stage a protest of a different kind against atrocities committed by Pakistan authorities in Sindh province.US-based Sindhi Foundation has decided to raise awareness for climate change through a "Long Walk' or a march stretching from New York City to Washington DC, covering a distance of more than 350 miles on foot.Titled "Long Walk for Freedom, Nature and Love", is a demonstration that will cut through five US states: Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. Along the way, participants will meet with community members, other human rights groups and even political leaders who wish to support the fight against climate change and human rights violations.The idea of the Long Walk stems from the appalling realities of Sindh province in Pakistan.Issues such as enforced disappearances, the plight of Sindhi women in Pakistan, environmental problems in Sindh and even something as basic as water has been some of the major concerns for the people of Sindh for decades, including those who live away from home in exile, including a Sindhi activist based in Washington DC, who is also the person behind the Long Walk.Munawar Langri, aka 'Sufi', left Pakistan to seek political asylum in the United States more than two decades ago and is one of the most known faces of hope for the many oppressed minorities of the Islamic country. Langri has often appeared on streets of Washington voicing the atrocities against minorities in Pakistan. And the New York to DC Long walk is largely Langri's effort to raise awareness about his homeland Sindh."I have been marching about 15- 20 miles a day for a while now, as a practice for the walk," said activist Langri."We have to fight against Pakistan. That's the only way. There is no other way. We have to unite because they don't learn from one or two protests. I invite all the people belonging to persecuted nations to join us in this effort, " Munawar Langri, Executive Director of Sindhi Foundation further added.While speaking to ANI, Langri said that he draws the inspiration of the Long Walk from his friend and fellow activist- Sindhi Inam, a prominent Sindhi voice living in Pakistan. Earlier in June, Inam decided to stand alone outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against enforced disappearances. That's when he decided to walk to Rawalpindi from Karachi spreading awareness around enforced disappearances of Sindhi people."Inam's struggle has been very unique. He has not only inspired someone like me sitting almost 10,000 miles away in America but also to many even in Pakistan. And it's because of his struggle, many were released, but still there are many in the hands of the Pakistani inter-service intelligence agencies (ISI)", Langri further addedWith a budget of USD 60,000 USD to cover all the logistics, the march will end in Washington DC with a meeting between Long Walk participants and members of US Congress. The march is tentatively scheduled on the April 7th and is to end by April 29th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/350-miles-across-five-states-over-22-days-sindhi-community-in-us-to-hold-march-against-pak-atrocities-101610862530377.html

Their driver is wounded," Qaweem said."The vehicle was transporting the women judges to their office."There are more than 200 female judges working for the country's top court, the spokesman added.Kabul police confirmed the attack."They were judges working for the Supreme Court," said Jamshid Rasuli, spokesman for the attorney general's office.Violence has surged across Afghanistan in recent months, especially in Kabul where a new trend of targeted killings of high-profile figures have sown fear and chaos in the restive city.The latest attack comes just two days after the Pentagon announced it had cut troop levels in Afghanistan to 2,500, their lowest numbers during the nearly two decades of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-shoot-dead-two-afghan-women-judges-in-kabul-101610868132626.html
17-01-2021||World||Greenhouse gas, pollution cause regional impacts on extreme fire weather: Study||In a first-of-its-kind study, scientists have assessed the influence of human activities on extreme fire weather risk, and found that greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution have distinct regional impacts on wildfire outbreaks.The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, analysed the climate under various combinations of human influences since 1920, isolating individual effects and their impacts on extreme fire weather risk.While previous studies found that human activities and their products like greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution raise the risk of extreme fire weather, the scientists, including those from the University of California (UC) Santa Barbara in the US, said the specific influence of these factors has been unclear."To get a wildfire to ignite and spread, you need suitable weather conditions -- you need warm, dry and windy conditions," explained Danielle Touma, a co-author of the study from UC Santa Barbara."And when these conditions are at their most extreme, they can cause really large, severe fires," Touma said.According to the researchers, heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant contributors to temperature increases around the globe.By 2005, they said emissions raised the risk of extreme fire weather by 20 per cent from preindustrial levels in western and eastern North America, the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon.The study predicted that by 2080, greenhouse gas emissions are expected to raise the risk of extreme wildfire by at least 50 per cent in western North America, equatorial Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia, while doubling it in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, eastern North America and the Amazon.According to the scientists, biomass burning and land-use changes have more regional impacts that amplify greenhouse gas-driven warming.The study noted a 30 per cent increase of extreme fire weather risk over the Amazon and western North America during the 20th century caused by biomass burning.Land use changes, according to the research, also amplified the risk of extreme fire weather in western Australia and the Amazon.The scientists said industrial aerosols block some of the solar radiation from reaching the ground and tend to have a cooling effect on the climate."We knew something had been compensating in a sense for greenhouse gas warming, but not the details of how that compensation might continue in the future," said Samantha Stevenson, a co-author of the study from UC Santa Barbara.However, in Southeast Asia, "where aerosols emissions are expected to continue," the study said there may be a weakening of the annual monsoon, drier conditions and an increase in extreme fire weather risk."Southeast Asia relies on the monsoon, but aerosols cause so much cooling on land that it actually can suppress a monsoon," Touma said."It's not just whether you have aerosols or not, it's the way the regional climate interacts with aerosols," he added.The scientists hope that the current understanding of fire risk at a regional scale helps in mitigation and planning purposes."In the broader scope of things, it's important for climate policy, like if we want to know how global actions will affect the climate," Touma said."And it's also important for understanding the potential impacts to people, such as with urban planning and fire management," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greenhouse-gas-pollution-cause-regional-impacts-on-extreme-fire-weather-study-101610867230214.html

17-01-2021||World||Deaths, self-immolation draw scrutiny on China tech giants||E-commerce workers who kept China fed during the coronavirus pandemic, making their billionaire bosses even richer, are so unhappy with their pay and treatment that one just set himself on fire in protest.China’s internet industries already were known for long, demanding days. With millions of families confined at home, demand surged and employees delivered tons of vegetables, rice, meat, diapers and other supplies, often aboard scooters that exposed them to sub-freezing winter cold.For white-collar workers in the technology industry, pay is better than in some industries but employees are often expected to work 12 hours a day or more.The human cost caught public attention after the deaths of two employees from e-commerce platform Pinduoduo, known for selling fresh produce at low prices. Their deaths prompted suggestions they were overworked. In an indication of high-level concern, the official Xinhua News Agency called for shorter work hours, describing long hours of overtime at the expense of employees’ health as an “illegal” operation.Renewed concerns over dire working conditions for delivery drivers also came to the forefront when a video circulated on Chinese social media showing what it said was a driver for Ele.me, part of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, setting himself on fire to protest unpaid wages.The controversy is a blow to the image of internet industries that are transforming China’s economy and generating new jobs. They have made some of the founders among the world’s wealthiest entrepreneurs. During the heights of the pandemic, the fortunes of the biggest, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Pinduoduo founder Colin Huang, swelled as online consumer spending boomed.In a video widely circulated on Chinese social media, 45-year-old delivery driver Liu Jin poured gasoline and set himself on fire outside a distribution station for Eleme in the eastern city of Taizhou, shouting that he wanted his money. Others snuffed the flames and rushed him to a hospital, where he is being treated for third-degree burns on his body.Details of Liu's complaint could not be verified and Eleme did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Separately, a 43-year-old delivery driver collapsed on the job and died last week while delivering food for Eleme.The company said in a statement that it will give 600,000 yuan ($92,700) to the driver’s family and raised its insurance coverage for drivers to that level. Its statement said Eleme “had not done enough in terms of accidental death insurance, and needs to do more.”The issue was highlighted again after a Pinduoduo employee surnamed Tan committed suicide after taking leave from the firm to return to his hometown, less than two weeks after a 22-year-old employee surnamed Zhang in Urumqi collapsed while walking home from work with colleagues, and later passed away.Pinduoduo, China's third-largest e-commerce firm, released statements saying it was providing assistance and support to the families of the two employees who died. Shanghai authorities also are reviewing working hours, contracts and other conditions at the company.The deaths raised an outcry on social media, with many people suspecting that they were a result of overwork. Chinese social media users blasted the country's technology sector, criticizing not just Pinduoduo for a culture of long hours but pointing out that this was an industry-wide problem, with similar company cultures seen at most of China's large technology companies.They also revived a national debate over the tech sector's so-called “996” working culture, in which employees often work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. Companies sometimes pay huge bonuses to some employees, enticing them to work more overtime.“We must strive to succeed in pursuit of dreams, but the legitimate rights and interests of workers cannot be ignored or even violated,” said state-owned Xinhua News Agency in a post on microblogging site Weibo.The issue has also cast a spotlight on the working conditions of delivery drivers, who are under heavy pressure to get orders to customers quickly and at times make less than 10 yuan ($1.55) per delivery. If they fail to meet deadlines, fines imposed can range from as little as 1 yuan ($0.15) to as much as 500 yuan ($77.30) if a customer lodges a complaint.As part of the gig economy, such delivery workers often do not get the benefits provided to full-time employees, such as social or medical insurance.Since there are many people willing to work under those conditions, it is hard for employees to negotiate better pay and conditions.Last August, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) — the only trade union allowed to legally exist in communist-ruled China — said that 6.5 million delivery workers had joined it since 2018. However, the worker rights group China Labor Bulletin, which tracks labor relations in China, says little has been done to improve workers' ability to win better treatment from companies. The union provides only skills training, legal assistance and some medical benefits.“Labor unions need to become more effective, otherwise labor laws cannot be enforced,” said Li Qiang, founder of China Labor Watch, another organization that monitors labor rights.Under China's labor laws, workers and laborers should work no longer than eight hours a day, or more than 44 hours a week on average. Total amount of overtime should not exceed more than 36 hours in a month, and should only be done “after consultation with the trade union and laborers”.However, even though the labor laws exist, they are rarely enforced as employees become mired in a culture of overwork while striving for bonuses or in cases of delivery drivers, to eke out a living.Delivery workers are part of a corporate culture where even white-collar employees in the technology sector work excessively long hours, Li noted.“Employees who do not work overtime cannot survive in technology or white-collar jobs. Everyone is working overtime. If they do not work overtime, they will be terminated,” Li said.Putting workers at an even bigger disadvantage, indemnity clauses are at times written into workers’ contracts in some industries, absolving a company from responsibility for death on the job and other such events, said Li of China Labor Watch. Although such clauses may violate China's labor laws, the legal system in China is opaque and laws can be difficult to enforce.“In Western countries, if an employee dies because of working overtime, then the legal and economic costs will be greater, and they are generally more restrained as the country’s laws will intervene,” said Li. “But in China, there is no bottom line when it comes to working overtime, and companies are generally not held liable in the event of death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-self-immolation-draw-scrutiny-on-china-tech-giants-101610865156122.html

It also said that the Communist Party of China devoted enormous resources to deceit and disinformation.The fact sheet is divided in three parts - illnesses inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), the research there and Secret military activity at the institute.The fact sheet said that the US government has "reason to believe" that several researchers inside the Wuhan institute became sick in autumn of 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak. "This," the state department said, "raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli’s public claim that there was 'zero infection' among the WIV’s staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses."It also said that accidental infections in labs have caused several previous virus outbreaks in China.The Communist Party in China prevented independent journalists, investigators, and global health authorities from interviewing researchers, which the fact sheet said is crucial for inquiry into the origin of the virus.The state department document came out on a day when a team of international experts of the World Health Organisation (WHO) arrived in China to investigate the origins of Covid-19."WHO investigators must have access to the records of the WIV’s work on bat and other coronaviruses before the Covid-19 outbreak. As part of a thorough inquiry, they must have a full accounting of why the WIV altered and then removed online records of its work with RaTG13 and other viruses," the state department said.The fact sheet added that in 201the researchers at WIV were conducting experiment involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus identified in January 2020 as its closest sample to Sars-CoV-2."Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian institution, the United States has determined that the WIV has collaborated on publications and secret projects with China’s military. The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017," the state department said.It also said that the United States will continue to do everything it can to support a credible and thorough investigation.The WHO team, meanwhile, has started its work by holding virtual meetings with their Chinese hosts from a hotel in Wuhan, where the pandemic first emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-systematically-prevented-probe-into-covid-19-origins-says-us-101610862909834.html
17-01-2021||World||Biden to return US to Paris accord, rescind Muslim ban on day one in office||President-elect Joe Biden will begin his term on Wednesday by signing executive orders to return the US to the Paris Agreement on climate crisis and rescind the travel ban on people from certain Muslim-majority countries, reversing two of his predecessor Donald Trump’s most controversial decisions.They will be among a dozen or so orders Biden will sign on his first day in office, said his chief of staff Ron Klain, in a memo to his staff on Saturday, outlining a 10-day plan of action for the incoming president.“We face four overlapping and compounding crises: the Covid-19 crisis, the resulting economic crisis, the climate crisis, and a racial equity crisis,” Klain wrote. “All of these crises demand urgent action. In his first 10 days in office, President-elect Biden will take decisive action to address these four crises, prevent other urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world.” The other orders will include the launch of a “100 masking challenge” that will mandate masks on federal property and interstate travel, extend the pause on repayment of and interest on student loans, continue restrictions on evictions and foreclosures; all related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden will be inaugurated on January 20 amid unprecedented security with more than 25,000 National Guard troops deployed in Washington DC in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol on January 6. FBI has warned of “armed protests” in days leading up to the inauguration.President Trump announced US exit from the Paris Agreement in June 2017, saying it disadvantaged the country, blunted its competitive edge, and favoured India and China. Trump had falsely claimed that India, a major backer of the agreement, “makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries”. It was a complete misrepresentation of India’s position that developed countries should do more to mitigate global warming to compensate for their outsize contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.The Paris Agreement is a legally binding global treaty that was signed in December 2015 and entered into force on November 2016. Signatory countries fix its own mitigation targets, called Nationally Determined Contributions. The accord remains in force, unaffected by US exit.America’s return to the Paris Agreement was one of Biden’s key campaign promises, as part of an aggressive climate agenda.So was the revoking of the Muslim ban. Just a week after his inauguration in 2017, Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning foreign nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries — Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen — from entering the US. It was struck down by courts, but a much-diluted version remains in force.Over the next nine days, according to the 10-day plan unveiled by Klain, Biden will sign “executive actions to move aggressively to change the course of the Covid-19 crisis”, to reopen schools and businesses, expand testing, establish clear public health standards, announce measures to bring relief to families.In other orders, Biden will “strengthen Buy American provisions”, support communities of colour, issue additional directives to address climate crisis, expand healthcare and, revers another Trump-era controversial policy, to “restore dignity to our immigration system and our border policies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-return-us-to-paris-accord-rescind-muslim-ban-on-day-one-in-office-101610863079929.html
17-01-2021||World||China reports 109 new Covid-19 cases to keep concerns simmering before Lunar NY||Worries simmered in mainland China about a potential fresh wave of coronavirus cases ahead of the Lunar New Year next month as authorities on Sunday reported 109 new Covid-19 cases, most of them in Hebei province surrounding Beijing.Though the Jan. 16 tally of new cases was less than the previous day's 130, China has in the past week seen the number of daily cases jump to an over 10-month high.The unsettling trend has emerged while a World Health Organization-led (WHO) team of investigators remained in quarantine in the city of Wuhan, where the disease was first detected in late 2019. The team aims to investigate the origins of the pandemic that has now killed over 2 million people worldwide.Giving details of the latest daily caseload, the National Health Commission (NHC) said 96 were local infections, 72 of them in Hebei, 12 in northeastern Heilongjiang province, 10 in northeastern Jilin province and two in Beijing.There had been 130 new cases on Friday.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 119 on Saturday from 79 on Friday.The numbers remain well below levels seen at the height of the outbreak in China in early 2020, but authorities remain on guard, and as a result of the outbreak in recent weeks about 28 million people have been put under lockdown.NHC Minister Ma Xiaowei said on Saturday that outbreaks in the northeast have come from travellers entering the country or contaminated frozen food imports. China is the only country to claim COVID-19 can be transmitted via cold chain imports, even though the WHO has downplayed the risks.Beijing city will begin requiring travellers from abroad to undergo health monitoring for seven additional days following 21 days of medical observation, state run news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday.Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital and the hardest-hit spot in the latest surge of infections, reported 65 new locally transmitted confirmed cases on Jan. 16, the provincial health commission said.State media also reported a "super-transmission event" linked to one person, who was found asymptomatic on Jan 12 and turned into a confirmed case on Saturday. Data from Jilin showed that 98 cases, mostly asymptomatic, could be linked to the person who had travelled between Heliongjiang and Jilin earlier in the month.The total of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China stands at 88,227, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,635.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-109-new-covid-19-cases-to-keep-concerns-simmering-before-lunar-ny-101610862793982.html

That is the level Tehran achieved before striking the deal with world powers to contain its disputed nuclear ambitions.The Islamic Republic's breaches of the nuclear agreement since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018 and subsequently imposed sanctions on Tehran may complicate efforts by President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, to rejoin the pact."The Trump administration chose what it called the maximum pressure campaign on Iran. The result was that this strategy only increased the risk and the threat," Le Drian told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper."This has to stop because Iran and - I say this clearly - is in the process of acquiring nuclear (weapons) capacity."The agreement's main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it so chose, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.Western diplomats have said Iran's repeated breaches have already reduced the "breakout time" to well below a year.Iran denies any intent to weaponise its nuclear programme.With presidential elections in Iran due in June, Le Drian said it was urgent to "tell the Iranians that this is enough" and to bring Iran and the United States back into the accord.Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes strict compliance with it. Iran says sanctions must be lifted before it reverses its nuclear breaches.However, Le Drian said that even if both sides were to return to the deal, it would not be enough."Tough discussions will be needed over ballistic proliferation and Iran's destabilisation of its neighbours in the region," Le Drian said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-iran-is-building-nuclear-weapons-capacity-urgent-to-revive-2015-deal-101610857579203.html

Imposed sanctions on CCP officials, halted imports of products made with forced labor, and so much more. When the world averts its eyes, America speaks up, and acts," Pompeo tweeted."We also gave courageous Uyghur women a platform to tell the world about their families who were disappeared by the #CCP," he added.Under Trump administration, the United States spearheaded the campaign against the CCP for its human right abuse in Xinjiang. In July last year, Pompeo said that that it is time "for a new alliance of democracies" to counter Beijing's aggressive policies.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has vehemently denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.Recently, a commission of the United States Congress, in a new report, said that China has possibly carried out "genocide" against Uyghurs and other minority Muslims in its western region of Xinjiang,The report, released by The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), stated that the Chinese government and Communist Party have taken unprecedented steps to extend their repressive policies through censorship, intimidation, and the detention of people in China for exercising their fundamental human rights."Nowhere is this more evident than in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) where new evidence emerged that crimes against humanity--and possibly genocide--are occurring, and in Hong Kong, where the ''one country, two systems'' framework has been effectively dismantled," read a report released on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-led-the-world-in-exposing-horrific-abuses-in-xinjiang-says-mike-pompeo-101610861020295.html

The January 20th inauguration, the 59th in all, wherein Biden would be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States is already historic in the making as for the first time ever a woman Kamala Harris would be sworn as the vice president of the country.Harris, 56, is also the first ever Indian-origin and African American to be sworn in as the vice president of the United States.It is also for the first time ever that so many Indian-Americans have been roped into a presidential administration ever before the inauguration. Biden is still quite far away from filling all the positions in his administration. Topping the list is Neera Tanden, who has been nominated as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget and Dr Vivek Murthy, who has been nominated as the US Surgeon General.Vanita Gupta has been nominated as Associate Attorney General Department of Justice, and on Saturday, Biden nominated a former foreign service official Uzra Zeya as the Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights.“The dedication that the Indian-American community has shown to public service over the years has been recognised in a big way at the very start of this administration! I am particularly pleased that the overwhelming majority are women. Our community has truly arrived in serving the nation,” Indiaspora founder M R Rangaswami told PTI. Mala Adiga has been appointed as Policy Director to the future First Lady Dr Jill Biden and Garima Verma would be the Digital Director of the Office of the First Lady, while Sabrina Singh has been named as her Deputy Press Secretary.For the first time ever among the Indian-Americans include two who trace their roots to Kashmir: Aisha Shah, who has been named as Partnership Manager at the White House Office of Digital Strategy, and Sameera Fazili, who would occupy the key position of Deputy Director at the US National Economic Council (NEC) in the White House.White House National Economic Council also has another Indian American, Bharat Ramamurti, as Deputy Director.Gautam Raghavan, who served at the White House in the previous Obama Administration returns to the White House as Deputy Director in Office of Presidential Personnel.Among Biden’s inner circle is his top confident for year Vinay Reddy, who has been named as Director Speechwriting. Young Vedant Patel all set to occupy a seat in the White House lower press, behind the briefing room, as Assistant Press Secretary to the President. He is only the third-ever Indian American to be part of the White House press shop.Three Indian-Americans have made their way to the crucial National Security Council of the White House, thus leaving a permanent imprint on the country’s foreign policy and national security.They are Tarun Chhabra: Senior Director for Technology and National Security, Sumona Guha, Senior Director for South Asia, Shanthi Kalathil: Coordinator for Democracy and Human Rights.Sonia Aggarwal has been named Senior Advisor for Climate Policy and Innovation in the Office of the Domestic Climate Policy at the White House and Vidur Sharma has been appointed as Policy Advisor for Testing for the White House Covid-19 Response Team.Two Indian Americans women have been appointed to the Office of the White House Counsel: Neha Gupta as Associate Counsel and Reema Shah as Deputy Associate Counsel.Also, for the first time in any administration, the White House would have three other South Asians in key positions.Pakistani-American Ali Zaidi as Deputy National Climate Advisor White House; Sri Lankan American Rohini Kosoglu as Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice President and Bangladeshi-American Zayn Siddique: Senior Advisor to the White House Deputy Chief of Staff.During the campaign, Biden had indicated that he would rope in a large number of Indian Americans.“As President, I'll also continue to rely on Indian-American diaspora, that keeps our two nations together, as I have throughout my career,” Biden had said in his address to the Indian-American community during a virtual celebration of India’s Independence Day on August 15, 2020.“My constituents in Delaware, my staff in the Senate, the Obama Biden administration, which had more Indian Americans than any other administration in the history of this country and this campaign with Indian Americans at senior levels, which of course includes the top of the heap, our dear friend (Kamala Harris) who will be the first Indian American vice president in the history of the United States of America,” Biden said in his video address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-ropes-in-20-indian-americans-in-his-administration-17-at-key-wh-positions-101610857852152.html
17-01-2021||World||Kremlin foe Navalny faces arrest as flies back to Russia||Arch Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny returns to Russia from Germany on Sunday, facing imminent arrest after authorities warned they would detain him for violating a sentence over alleged fraud.The 44-year-old opposition leader is flying back to Moscow after spending several months in Germany recovering from a poisoning attack that he said was carried out on the orders of President Vladimir Putin.Navalny fell violently ill on a flight over Siberia in August and was flown out to Berlin by medical aircraft in an induced coma.Western experts concluded he was poisoned with a Soviet-designed nerve toxin Novichok.The Kremlin denied involvement and Russian investigators said there were no grounds to launch a probe into the attack.Berlin said Saturday it had responded to requests for legal assistance from Moscow and handed over transcripts of an interview conducted by German police with Navalny.- Warning against airport crowds -Russia's prison service (FSIN) is now saying Navalny may face jail time on arrival to Moscow for violating the terms of a 2014 suspended sentence he was handed on fraud charges.FSIN said it would be "obliged" to detain Navalny.The anti-graft campaigner may also face criminal charges under a probe launched by Russian investigators late last year who say he misappropriated over $4 million worth of donations.Navalny and his allies view these moves as attempts to prevent his return and encouraged supporters to come meet the opposition leader on Sunday evening when he lands in Moscow's Vnukovo airport.More than 2,000 people said they are planning to go in a Facebook event.Groups opposed to Navalny are also planning to show up with a nationalist movement promising to welcome him with "zelyonka", a bright green antiseptic solution that is commonly found in Russia.Navalny had previously been attacked with the green dye that can take days to wash off.For around a decade, Navalny has been the symbol of Russia's protest movement, after rising to prominence as an anti-corruption blogger and leading anti-government street rallies.Navalny's team publishes YouTube investigations into the wealth of Russia's political elites, some of which garner millions of views, making them a target of lawsuits, police raids and jail stints.Moscow prosecutors on Friday warned against participating in the "public event" organised in Vnukovo airport, saying it has not been authorised.The airport told journalists that it will not allow media to work inside citing coronavirus concerns.Neither statements directly mention Navalny -- a common practice for Russian authorities and pro-Kremlin media which instead refer to him as the "Berlin patient" among other euphemisms.- Negative state media coverage -Navalny is ignored or given negative coverage by state-controlled TV, the primary source of news for many Russians, which makes it unclear how much support Navalny enjoys among ordinary citizens.According to a poll published by the independent Levada Centre last year, only 20 percent of respondents said they approved of Navalny's actions, while 50 percent disapproved.Navalny has never held elected office. He came second in a 2013 vote for mayor of Moscow but was barred from standing against Putin in the 2018 presidential elections.His allies are also frequently prevented from running for election.In 2019, several Navalny allies were barred from running for the Moscow city council, sparking mass rallies in the capital that lasted several weeks.With elections to the country's lower house State Duma coming up in September, protest sentiments among Russia's opposition would be unfavourable to the ruling United Russia party.Observers say the Kremlin is faced with a choice on Sunday: let Navalny roam free and risk looking weak, or arrest him in front of hundreds of people and cameras, sparking an outcry from the opposition."I have a feeling the Kremlin has grown tired of these games," analyst Tatyana Stanovaya told AFP. "The confrontation with Navalny has been going on for too long".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-foe-navalny-faces-arrest-as-flies-back-to-russia-101610855578428.html
17-01-2021||World||Ally of poisoned Kremlin critic Navalny jailed in Moscow for extremism||Pavel Zelensky, a member of the Anti-Corruption Foundation team of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, was jailed by a Moscow court on Saturday until Feb. 28 on charges of inciting extremism on the internet, according to a court statement.His detention by the Presnensky District Court comes a day before Navalny's planned return to Russia since being poisoned in August and evacuated to Germany where he has been recuperating.Zelensky is a camera operator for the opposition leader's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which specialises in publishing high-impact investigations into what it says is official graft. Some of those targeted have disputed its findings and taken successful legal action.He was detained on Friday, the head of Agora, a Moscow-based human rights group, said on social media, and will now spend over a month in pre-trial detention.Zelensky's case revolves around a tweet posted last October, Agora cited the camera operator's lawyer as saying.The tweet contained a photo of Irina Slavina, a Russian journalist who died after setting herself on fire in front of a branch of the Interior Ministry a day after her apartment was searched by police.The social media post expressed anger at the government and called for people to take any feelings of protest offline."(We) will not give up and will help Pasha Zelensky's family in every way possible," Ivan Zhdanov, director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Twitter after the court hearing.Navalny last week announced his plan to return to Russia on Jan. 17, signalling his intention to continue his political struggle against Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he accuses of ordering his poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent.His return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests, punitive Western action and creating a political martyr; or do nothing and risk looking weak.Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead. The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence Navalny was poisoned and that he is free to return to Russia at any time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ally-of-poisoned-kremlin-critic-navalny-jailed-in-moscow-for-extremism-101610855598134.html

The batches of contaminated ice creams were manufactured by Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company, according to Livehindustan.The company had to destroy 2,089 boxes of the ice cream; authorities say around 4,836 boxes have been contaminated Livehindustan reported.The health authorities are tracing the customers who bought the ice cream, they are being asked to submit their health details.The Independent reported that over 1,600 employees of Tianjin Daqiaodao Food Company have been placed under quarantine and are being tested for Covid-19. Of them, the test results of 700 employees have come negative.The authorities say that the coronavirus survived in ice cream because of the cold temperature. They believe the virus reached the ice cream through an infected person.China, meanwhile, reported 109 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Sunday, two-thirds of them in a northern province that abuts Beijing, and no deaths.There were 72 new cases in Hebei province, where the government is building isolation hospitals with a total of 9,500 rooms to combat an upsurge in infections, according to the National Health Commission.China had largely contained the virus that first was detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 but has reported hundreds of new infections since December. The country's health commission on Saturday blamed them on travellers and imported goods it said brought the virus from abroad.China's death toll stands at 4,653 out of 88,227 total cases.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-found-in-china-ice-cream-samples-thousands-of-boxes-seized-report-101610854598056.html

17-01-2021||World||NASA's Boeing moon rocket cuts short 'once-in-a-generation' ground test||NASA's deep space exploration rocket built by Boeing briefly ignited all four engines of its behemoth core stage for the first time on Saturday, cutting short a crucial test to advance a years-delayed U.S. government program to return humans to the moon in the next few years.Mounted in a test facility at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, the Space Launch System’s (SLS) 212-foot tall core stage roared to life at 4:27 p.m. local time (2227 GMT) for just over a minute — well short of the roughly four minutes engineers needed to stay on track for the rocket's first launch in November this year."Today was a good day," NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a press conference after the test, adding "we got lots of data that we're going to be able to sort through" to determine if a do-over is needed and whether a November 2021 debut launch date is still possible.The engine test, the last leg of NASA’s nearly year-long “Green Run” test campaign, was a vital step for the space agency and its top SLS contractor Boeing before a debut unmanned launch later this year under NASA’s Artemis program, the Trump administration’s push to return U.S. astronauts to the moon by 2024.It was unclear whether Boeing and NASA would have to repeat the test, a prospect that could push the debut launch into 2022. NASA's SLS program manager John Honeycutt, cautioning the data review from the test is ongoing, told reporters the turnaround time for another hot fire test could be roughly one month.To simulate internal conditions of a real liftoff, the rocket’s four Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engines ignited for roughly one minute and 15 seconds, generating 1.6 million pounds of thrust and consuming 700,000 gallons of propellants on NASA’s largest test stand, a massive facility towering 35 stories tall.The expendable super heavy-lift SLS is three years behind schedule and nearly $3 billion over budget. Critics have long argued for NASA to retire the rocket’s shuttle-era core technologies, which have launch costs of $1 billion or more per mission, in favor of newer commercial alternatives that promise lower costs.By comparison, it costs as little as $90 million to fly the massive but less powerful Falcon Heavy rocket designed and manufactured by Elon Musk's SpaceX, and some $350 million per launch for United Launch Alliance's legacy Delta IV Heavy.While newer, more reusable rockets from both companies - SpaceX's Starship and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan - promise heavier lift capacity than the Falcon Heavy or Delta IV Heavy potentially at lower cost, SLS backers argue it would take two or more launches on those rockets to launch what the SLS could carry in a single mission.Reuters reported in October that President-elect Joe Biden's space advisers aim to delay Trump's 2024 goal, casting fresh doubts on the long-term fate of SLS just as SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin scramble to bring rival new heavy-lift capacity to market.NASA and Boeing engineers have stayed on a ten-month schedule for the Green Run "despite having significant adversity this year," Boeing's SLS manager John Shannon told reporters this week, citing five tropical storms and a hurricane that hit Stennis, as well as a three-month closure after some engineers tested positive for the coronavirus in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-boeing-moon-rocket-cuts-short-once-in-a-generation-ground-test-101610850267338.html
17-01-2021||World||US state capitals, Washington on alert for possible pro-Trump armed protests||Ten days after rioters breached the US Capitol in a deadly attack that stunned the world, cities nationwide were girding for a potential new wave of violent protests over the weekend, erecting barriers and deploying thousands of National Guard troops.The FBI warned police agencies of possible armed demonstrations outside all 50 state capitol buildings starting Saturday through President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, fueled by supporters of President Donald Trump who believe his false claims of electoral fraud.Michigan, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington were among more than a dozen states that activated their National Guards to strengthen security. Meanwhile, downtown Washington, DC, was virtually empty, with streets near the Capitol closed and battalions of camouflaged National Guard soldiers taking up positions across the city center.The nationwide security scramble followed the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol by a mix of extremists and Trump supporters, some of whom called for the death of Vice President Mike Pence as he presided over the certification of Biden's election victory.The Democratic leaders of four US congressional committees said on Saturday they had opened a review of the events and had written to the FBI and other intelligence and security agencies asking what was known about threats, whether the information was shared and whether foreign influence played any role."This still-emerging story is one of astounding bravery by some US Capitol Police and other officers; of staggering treachery by violent criminals; and of apparent and high-level failures — in particular, with respect to intelligence and security preparedness," said the letter.It was signed by House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.There were scattered demonstrations on Saturday, but statehouses remained mostly quiet. Law enforcement officials have trained much of their focus on Sunday, when the anti-government "boogaloo" movement made plans weeks ago to hold rallies in all 50 states.Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement late Friday that intelligence indicated "violent extremists" may seek to exploit planned armed protests in Austin to "conduct criminal acts." Texas closed its Capitol through Inauguration Day.In Michigan, a fence was erected around the Capitol in Lansing, and troopers were mobilized from across the state to bolster security. The legislature canceled meetings next week, citing concern over credible threats.In a nod to both the coronavirus pandemic as well as security concerns, festivities around Biden's inauguration will largely be held online, though the president-elect still plans to be sworn in and deliver his inaugural address at the Capitol.The inaugural committee's virtual "welcome event" took place on Saturday evening, featuring appearances from union leaders, activists and celebrities such as actor Whoopi Goldberg."Make no mistake, the road ahead - it won't be easy," Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, who closed out the event, told viewers. "But America is ready, and so are Joe and I."The perception that the Jan. 6 insurrection was a success could embolden domestic extremists motivated by anti-government, racial and partisan grievances, spurring them to further violence, according to a government intelligence bulletin dated Wednesday first reported by Yahoo News.The Joint Intelligence Bulletin, produced by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center, further warned that "false narratives" about electoral fraud would serve as an ongoing catalyst for extremist groups.Thousands of armed National Guard troops were on the streets of Washington in an unprecedented show of force after the assault on the US Capitol. Bridges into the city were to be closed, and the National Mall and other iconic US landmarks were blocked off into next week.Authorities were on high alert. A Virginia man, Wesley Allen Beeler, was arrested on Friday evening at a security checkpoint after police said he presented an "unauthorized inauguration credential," according to a Capitol Police spokeswoman. Beeler had a loaded handgun and more than 500 rounds of ammunition, according to court papers.A tearful Beeler later told the Washington Post he had been working security in Washington all week and pulled up to the checkpoint after getting lost. He told the paper he forgot the gun was in his truck and denied having so much ammunition.Beeler was released after an initial court appearance on Saturday and is due back in court in June, records show.Responding to news of the arrest, Democratic US Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said the danger was real and the city was on edge."Anyone who can avoid the area around the Capitol and Mall this week should do so," Beyer wrote on Twitter.The alarm extended beyond legislatures. The United Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination of more than 4,900 churches, warned its 800,000 members there were reports "liberal" churches could be attacked in the coming week.Following the Jan. 6 violence in Washington, some militia members said they would not attend a long-planned pro-gun demonstration in Virginia, where authorities were worried about the risk of violence as multiple groups converged on the state capital, Richmond.Some militias across the country have told followers to stay home this weekend, citing the increased security or the risk that the planned events were law enforcement traps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-capitals-washington-on-alert-for-possible-pro-trump-armed-protests-101610851244146.html

17-01-2021||World||Biden to prioritize legal status for millions of immigrants||President-elect Joe Biden's decision to immediately ask Congress to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million people in the country has surprised advocates given how the issue has long divided Democrats and Republicans, even within their own parties.Biden will announce legislation his first day in office to provide a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the United States illegally, according to four people briefed on his plans.The president-elect campaigned on a path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million people in the US illegally, but it was unclear how quickly he would move while wrestling with the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and other priorities. For advocates, memories were fresh of presidential candidate Barack Obama pledging an immigration bill his first year in office, in 2009, but not tackling the issue until his second term.Biden's plan is the polar opposite of Donald Trump, whose successful 2016 presidential campaign rested in part on curbing or stopping illegal immigration.“This really does represent a historic shift from Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda that recognizes that all of the undocumented immigrants that are currently in the United States should be placed on a path to citizenship,” said Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, who was briefed on the bill.If successful, the legislation would be the biggest move toward granting status to people in the country illegally since President Ronald Reagan bestowed amnesty on nearly 3 million people in 1986. Legislative efforts to overhaul immigration policy failed in 2007 and 2013.Ron Klain, Biden’s incoming chief of staff, said Saturday that Biden will send an immigration bill to Congress “on his first day in office.” He didn’t elaborate and Biden’s office declined to comment on specifics.Advocates were briefed in recent days on the bill's broad outlines by Esther Olivarria, deputy director for immigration on the White House Domestic Policy Council.Domingo Garcia, former president of the League of Latin American Citizens, said Biden told advocates on a call Thursday that Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate may delay consideration of the bill and that they shouldn’t count on passage within 100 days.“I was pleasantly surprised that they were going to take quick action because we got the same promises from Obama, who got elected in ’08, and he totally failed,” Garcia said.Ali Noorani, president of the National Immigration Forum and among those briefed Thursday night, said immigrants would be put on an eight-year path to citizenship. There would be a faster track for those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields people from deportation who came to the country as young children, and Temporary Protected Status, which gives temporary status to hundreds of thousands of people from strife-torn countries, many from El Salvador.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris offered similar remarks in an interview with Univision that aired Tuesday, saying DACA and TPS recipients will “automatically get green cards” while others would be on an eight-year path to citizenship.More favorable attitudes toward immigration — especially among Democrats — may weigh in Biden's favor this time. A Gallup survey last year found that 34% of those polled favored more immigration, up from 21% in 2016 and higher than any time since it began asking the question in 1965. The survey found 77% felt immigration was good for the country on the whole, up slightly from 72% in 2016.Noorani said the separation of more than 5,000 children from the parents at the border, which peaked in 2018, alienated voters from Trump's policies, particularly conservatives and evangelicals. He believes a constantly shifting outlook for DACA recipients also hurt Trump among people who felt he was using them as “political pawns.”“What was seared in their mind was family separation. They took it out on the Republican Party in 2018 and they took it out on Trump in 2020," Noorani said. "To put a really fine point on it, they want to end the cruelty of the Trump administration.”It is impossible to know precisely how many people are in the country illegally. Pew Research Center estimates there were 10.5 million in 2017, down from an all-time high of 12.2 million in 2007.The Homeland Security Department estimates there were 12 million people in the country illegally in 2015, nearly 80% of them for more than 10 years. More than half were Mexican.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-prioritize-legal-status-for-millions-of-immigrants-101610846497434.html

A total of 47 people died in Mamuju and nine in Majene.Jati said at least 415 houses in Majene were damaged and about 15,000 people were moved to shelters. The agency is still collecting data from the area.Mamuju, the provincial capital of nearly 300,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings. The governor's office building was almost flattened by the quake and a shopping mall reduced to a crumpled hulk. Two hospitals were damaged.The disaster agency said the army corps of engineers cleared the road connecting Mamuju and Majene that was blocked by landslides.

However, it is a party to the Stockholm Convention, which aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants and is working to phase out the use of PFOS. Weber added that China needs to analyse drinking water as well as groundwater and contaminated sites to understand the scale of the problem and then draw up plans to tackle it."Europe and the United States are facing large challenges with monitoring and controlling PFAS contaminated sites and I think it is now the right time that China is moving forward, making science based limits and then cleaning the drinking water and control emissions from industries and other uses," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsafe-drinking-water-supplied-to-nearly-100-million-chinese-people-101610845309310.html

The Scandinavian country, which has inoculated more than 25,000 people since the vaccination drive began on December 27 last year, has confirmed the deaths.ALSO WATCH | First feeling, side-effects, doubts: Vaccinated doctors share experienceEarlier, the age group thought to be in the danger zone was above 80, but the fresh six deaths on Saturday further lowered it to 75 and also raised questions over which groups to target in national inoculation programme.Here is what we know so far:- The Covid-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech is the only one available in Norway and all deaths are seen to be linked with it, according to Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA).Also Read: Norway says Covid-19 vaccines may be too risky for elderly, terminally sick- The NMA wrote to news agency Bloomberg and confirmed that while most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, 13 deaths have been assessed and another 16 are being looked at for having been caused due to it. “There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said, adding that all the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders”.- The side effects being seen in most people are nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), the vaccine could have marginal or no benefit for those who have a very short remaining life span anyway. For those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences, it added.Also Read: Pfizer to cut vaccine shipments as Belgian factory renovated- Pfizer has said it is investigating the deaths along with BioNTech and the NIPH and the agency has found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations.”- Norway, however, has not said that younger, healthier people should avoid being vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/29-dead-in-norway-after-getting-vaccinated-what-we-know-so-far-101610845410090.html

Approximately two-and-a-half years later, there is still no report.""Finally in his seventh year, Imran Khan has accepted that things have gone awry when it comes to foreign funding. But he has put the responsibility of this on his agents and said that they must have done this," he noted.On the report submitted to the commission, Sharif said that the State Bank of Pakistan had given the ECP information about 23 accounts, 15 of which the Premier hid and did not include in the report given to the commission."He did not disclose the total amount, the source, and did not give a money trail or receipts," he said."If there is no corruption, then why was it hidden? Do these suspect accounts not come under the crime of money laundering? Where is the money trail? And why is the information not being given to the ECP and to the people?" he questioned.He further said the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties, will protest in front of the ECP office in the capital on January 19, urging people to join the opposition's march and to save the country from "injustice", Dawn reported.The foreign funding case against Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in November 2014 was registered by Akbar S Babar, one of the founding members of the party, alleging major financial irregularities in the party's accounts.The allegations made by Babar included illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts in the country and abroad, money laundering, and using private bank accounts of PTI employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the Middle East, Dawn reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-criminal-nawaz-sharif-questions-negligence-in-foreign-funding-case-101610845257335.html

This is why we demand that they step down."He also mentioned that anti-corruption body Transparency International says the "most corrupt government" in Pakistan is the PTI government.Seeking details about the foreign funding case against Imran Khan's PTI, he said: "There are very serious allegations that PTI is a foreign-funded party. Their own member has raised allegations. But unfortunately, whether it is the court or the election commission, the truth has not been put forth before the people.""This is why the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) will protest on January 19 outside the Election Commission of Pakistan and will demand that the case be taken to its conclusion and all the facts of the case be made public," Bilawal said.He asserted that the public must be made aware of the countries that "gave so much money to PTI".He said he believes "if such a senior member has provided proof of such a serious allegation", the truth of these allegations should have been put before the public by now, The News International reported.The foreign funding case against PTI in November 2014 was registered by Akbar S Babar, one of the founding members of the party, alleging major financial irregularities in the party's accounts.The allegations made by Babar included illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts in the country and abroad, money laundering, and using private bank accounts of PTI employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the Middle East, Dawn reported.The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an 11-party opposition alliance, has demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister by January 31.Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari are among major leaders who have said that they will send the Imran-led government packing and have organised several PDM rallies including those in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Multan, and Lahore since October 16, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bilawal-bhutto-demands-foreign-funding-case-against-imran-khan-to-be-made-public-101610840335144.html

They say the prime minister is working to end the outbreak while they hold demonstrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-cold-weather-anti-netanyahu-protests-continue-in-israel-101610840603170.html
17-01-2021||World||Biden plans 10 days of action on four ‘overlapping’ crises||President-elect Joe Biden plans an early blitz of executive action to reverse some of President Donald Trump’s most contentious policies and address the coronavirus pandemic, according to an outline of Biden’s first 10 days in office.The plan, spelled out in a memo Saturday by Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain to incoming White House advisers, will address what Klain called “four overlapping and compounding crises.”They are the Covid-19 pandemic that has claimed close to 400,000 US lives, the resulting economic downturn, climate change, and a national reckoning over racial equity in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement.“In his first 10 days in office, President-elect Biden will take decisive action to address these four crises, prevent other urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world,” Klain wrote. “President-elect Biden will take action -- not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration -- but also to start moving our country forward.”Klain said Biden would begin with about a dozen executive actions on Wednesday, Inauguration Day, a federal holiday usually devoted more to ceremonies and celebrations than the actual work of the presidency. But Biden’s inaugural has been greatly scaled down because of the coronavirus outbreak and security concerns.First-day directives will focus on measures to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, including an extension of student loan forbearance past Jan. 31 and an extension of a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures, according to Klain. Biden will also launch a “100 Day Masking Challenge,” imposing new mandates that require masks on federal property and for interstate transportation.Typically, “Day One” is more a rhetorical concept for any new administration, with actions often rolled out over days, weeks or longer. But during the campaign and since his election, Biden has repeatedly promised action “on Day One,” creating what would be an overwhelming priority list.Klain’s memo is the transition team’s first effort to temper those expectations with an ambitious but achievable to-do list. Biden will spread out some orders over the first 10 days “in order to highlight the actions the president-elect is taking,” Klain said.Awaiting ClearanceOther orders are waiting on a legal clearance process -- a step Trump often skipped in his first days, leading to confusion and legal challenges that sometimes required him to correct his own orders. Klain emphasized that Biden’s orders will restore “an appropriate, constitutional role for the President.”“Clearly, this is for public consumption,” said Andrew Rudalevige, a Bowdoin College professor and expert on executive orders. He said Biden was probably eager to demonstrate a more organized White House after Trump’s turbulent governing style, and to reassure key Democratic constituency groups that action on their priorities is coming, even if it’s not on day one.The 10-day plan also includes presidential directives on safely re-opening schools and businesses, and Covid-related economic relief measures planned for Jan 21. and Jan. 22.The week after his inauguration, Biden will take additional action on “Buy American” provisions in federal purchasing and on criminal justice, climate, science and health care matters, Klain said. He’ll overturn Trump’s border enforcement policies and set up a process to reunite migrant children the Trump administration separated from caregivers after they crossed into the U.S.The executive actions will take the form of executive orders, presidential memoranda, and directives to Cabinet agencies. The New York Times reported earlier on Klain’s memo.The Klain memo also made clear that Biden’s agenda would require “robust congressional action.” Biden will propose at least one significant piece of legislation on his first day: an immigration overhaul to create a path to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.Other top legislative priorities include Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid and economic recovery package, and bills on voting rights, the minimum wage and violence against women, Klain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plans-10-days-of-action-on-four-overlapping-crises-101610840302150.html
17-01-2021||World||UN says breakthrough achieved in Libya transition talks||The top UN official for Libya said Saturday that an advisory committee for representatives of Libya's different regions has proposed a way forward for choosing a transitional government that would lead the war-torn country to elections late this year.The talks in Geneva, structured around the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum, have been taking place amid a heavy international push to reach a peaceful settlement to Libya’s civil war. Previous diplomatic initiatives have all collapsed.UN acting envoy for Libya Stephanie Williams told a news conference in Geneva that the advisory committee’s members “have met their responsibility with a constructive spirit, cooperative efforts, and a great deal of patriotism.”The committee is part of a 75-member forum that represents all the three main regions of Libya. The 18-member committee has proposed that each region's electoral college name a representative to a three-member presidential council, Williams said. A prime minister would be chosen by the 75-member forum. A successful nominee should receive 70% of votes.Williams said that the forum would resort to lists formed from Libya’s three regions, with each list consisting of four names, nominated for the presidential council and a prime minister position.She said a list should obtain 17 endorsements: eight from the western region, six from the eastern region and three from southern Libya. The wining list should receive 60% of the votes of the 75-member forum in the first round. A run-up is expected if no list received the required votes, she said.Williams said the forum would vote on the proposed mechanism on Monday and the results are expected the following day.The transitional government would be “a temporary unified executive staffed by Libyan patriots who want to share responsibility rather than to divide the cake,” the UN acting envoy said.The US welcomed the breakthrough and urged all parties of Libya “to work with urgency and in good faith” to establish an interim government, according to a statement by the US Embassy in Libya.“It is time to move past the conflict and corruption facilitated by the status quo,” it said.The forum is part of the UN efforts to end the chaos that engulfed the oil-rich North African nation after the 2011 overthrow and killing of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It has reached an agreement last year to hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Dec. 24, 2021.The oil-rich country is now split east to west between two rival administrations, each backed by an array of militias and foreign powers.The warring sides agreed to a UN-brokered cease-fire in October in Geneva, a deal that included the departure of foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya within three months.No progress was announced on the issue of foreign forces and mercenaries since they inked the cease-fire deal almost two months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-breakthrough-achieved-in-libya-transition-talks-101610840645157.html

What the hell is the matter with you? It's time to grow up," he said."The result? At least four members of Congress today, including a cancer survivor, now have COVID-19 who were in those rooms," Biden saidCongresswoman Coleman, who recently tested COVID-19 positive, is a 75-year-old cancer survivor.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has imposed fines this week on members who refuse to wear masks on the House floor, with a USD 500 penalty for a first offence and USD 2,500 for a second offence.Biden said wearing a mask is not a political, but a lifesaving issue."For God's sake, wear a mask if not for yourself, for your loved ones, for your country. These are real matters of life and death. We need you to stick with the handwashing, social distancing, and avoid indoor gatherings with people outside your own household,” he said.“I hope we now know this is not a political issue. This is about saving lives. I know it's become a partisan issue, but what a stupid, stupid thing for it to happen. This is a patriotic act.

She also has held private sector roles and advised on matters involving companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.More notably, Hesse advised Amazon on its more than $13 billion acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods, according to her bio on the website of New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, where she is currently a partner.Her role could pose conflict of interest issues as the Justice Department pursues its widely-followed case against Google, the sources said. The Justice Department sued Google on Oct. 20, accusing the $1 trillion company of dominating search and advertising.The other front-runner is Juan Arteaga, who has also worked for the Justice Department under President Barack Obama between 2013 to 2017 and served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Civil Enforcement, according to the sources, who did not wish to be named.Arteaga also has held private sector roles and advised companies such as JP Morgan Chase & Co and AT&T Inc .Other contenders under consideration include Jonathan Kanter, who co-chaired the antitrust department at the law firm Paul Weiss and now runs his own firm, the sources said. He is a prominent Big Tech and Google critic. Many progressive groups favor Kanter's appointment as they push for more aggressive antitrust enforcement.To be sure, the names reflect the thinking of the Biden transition so far and could change as the vetting process moves forward, the sources said.The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Antitrust enforcement has emerged as an issue the Biden transition team has been paying attention to. For example, a third source said the transition is prioritizing getting a landing team in to start working on issues and that Arteaga could be a good fit.Also, on Nov. 18, the Biden transition's agency review team for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice held a meeting with outside progressive and moderate groups to discuss antitrust policy priorities, according to three separate sources.Some of the broad priorities discussed on the call included having more "aggressive" antitrust enforcers."Bring cases even if you're going to lose," said one source, describing the way this point was made in the meeting.Other topics discussed during the session included reversing merger guidelines, retrospective scrutiny of mergers, revamping antiquated competition laws and offering more funds for federal enforcement agencies such as the FTC, the sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-eyes-ex-obama-staff-to-tackle-big-tech-and-other-antitrust-issues-101610840946179.html

"It is only right that we approach the challenge of building back better by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future."Britain has suffered badly during the Covid-19 crisis, with the highest death toll in Europe of more than 86,000 people.But, while a third wave of the virus causes more than 1,000 deaths per day, the country is leading the way on vaccinations having been the first in the world to authorise their use, and hopes to have much of the population protected within months.Last year's G7 meeting, due to be hosted by US President Donald Trump, was cancelled due to the pandemic, meaning the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Japan, the European Union and Canada have not met in person since the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, France.Johnson has also invited Australia, India and South Korea to attend.The summit will take place in the tiny resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, southwest England - an area now most famous for its beaches and surfing but also home to fishing fleets and once an important mining area."Two hundred years ago Cornwall's tin and copper mines were at the heart of the UK's industrial revolution and this summer Cornwall will again be the nucleus of great global change and advancement," Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-invites-g7-leaders-to-cornish-resort-for-june-summit-101610840416221.html

The secretary of Pakistan’s Alpine Club, Karrar Haideri, said 10 Nepali Sherpas reached the summit around 5pm.At 8,611m (28,251 feet), K2 is the most prominent peak on the Pakistani side of the Himalayas, and the world’s second tallest after Everest. Winter winds on K2 can blow at 200kmph and temperatures drop to minus 60 degrees Celsius.“This was never done by anyone before in winter,” said Haideri. The 10 climbers had earlier been spread across the different teams, but formed a new group to claim the feat in Nepal’s name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepalese-team-first-to-climb-k2-second-tallest-peak-in-winter-101610836935407.html
17-01-2021||World||Lawmakers face fire for role in riot||US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday said lawmakers who may have helped in the January 6 storming of the Capitol in any way will be prosecuted.Democrats have alleged that rioters were given advance tours of the US Capitol ahead of the attack by some Republicans. How else, they have argued, could the rioters know their way around, reaching office rooms deep inside the building.“If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecutions,” Pelosi said at a news conference.“In order to serve here with each other, we must trust that people have respect for their oath of office, respect for this institution,” she added.Mikie Sherrill, a Democratic lawmaker who is also a former US Navy pilot, said she saw “members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on January 5 for reconnaissance for the next day”. She leads a group of Democrats demanding action against them.James Clyburn, a senior Democrat whose endorsement was crucial to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the primaries, was surprised that the rioters reached his unmarked office. “Well, it seems to me that something was going on - some coordination was going on between sitting members of Congress and some of these visitors to the Capitol,” he said.Four insurrectionists and one Capitol police officer were killed in an attack on the US Capitol on January 6 by a mob incited by outgoing President Donald Trump to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.Trump was impeached on Wednesday for “incitement of insurrection”, making him the first American president to be impeached twice. A trial by the Senate will take place at a date and time not announced yet.Preparations are underway to secure the US Capitol for Biden’s inauguration on January 20 - with four times more troops deployed in Washington, DC than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined as well as tall fencing.Trump will not attend Biden’s inauguration, he has said before, breaking a long-running tradition. Biden does not want him there either.Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the inauguration. He called vice-president elect Kamala Harris on Thursday afternoon to congratulate her.Neither Pence nor his boss had conceded defeat until then or congratulated the incoming team. Trump still hasn’t. And along with his enablers, he had contested the results with baseless claims of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-face-fire-for-role-in-riot-101610823968781.html
17-01-2021||World||US gears up for inauguration day amid fears of pro- Trump rallies||US law enforcement officials are gearing up for pro-Trump marches in all 50 state capitals this weekend, erecting barriers and calling in their National Guards to try to prevent the kind of violent attack that rattled the nation on Jan. 6.The FBI has warned police agencies of possible armed protests at all 50 state capitols starting Jan. 16 through President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, fuelled by supporters of President Donald Trump who believe his false claims of electoral fraud.Michigan, Virginia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Washington are among the states that have activated their National Guards to strengthen security, while Texas took the step of closing its Capitol from Saturday through Inauguration Day.Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said in a statement late Friday that intelligence indicated "violent extremists" may seek to exploit planned armed protests in Austin to "conduct criminal acts."The scramble follows the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol in Washington by a mix of extremists and Trump supporters. Law enforcement officials have trained much of their focus on Sunday, when the anti-government "boogaloo" movement has flagged plans to hold rallies in all 50 states.In Michigan a fence was erected around the Capitol building in Lansing and troopers were mobilized from across the state to bolster security. The legislature nevertheless canceled meetings next week, citing concern over credible threats."We are prepared for the worst but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our Capitol do so peacefully," Michigan State Police Director Joe Gasper told a news conference on Friday.The perception that the Jan. 6 insurrection was a success could embolden domestic extremists motivated by anti-government, racial and partisan grievances, spurring them on to further violence, according to a government intelligence bulletin dated Wednesday that was first reported by Yahoo News.The Joint Intelligence Bulletin, produced by the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and National Counterterrorism Center, further warned that "false narratives" about electoral fraud would serve as an ongoing catalyst for extremist groups.Thousands of armed National Guard troops are now on the streets in Washington in an unprecedented show of force in the US Capitol. The National Mall and iconic US landmarks will be closed to visitors into next week.Experts say that the capitals of battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona are among those at most risk of violence. But even states not seen as likely flashpoints are taking precautions.Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said on Friday that while his state had not received any specific threats he was beefing up security around the Capitol in Springfield, including adding about 250 state National Guards troops.Suzanne Spaulding, a former undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said disclosing such security measures can act as an effective deterrent."One of the ways you can potentially de-escalate a problem is with a strong security posture," said Spaulding, now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "You try to deter people from trying anything."Some militias and other groups have told followers to stay home, citing the increased security or the risk that the planned events were law enforcement traps.Even so, Michael Hayden of the Southern Poverty Law Center said he has not been this worried about the potential for violence in a long time. Among other factors, he said the perceived censorship of conservative voices by technology companies such as Twitter has served to meld right-wing extremists and run-of-the-mill Republicans into a common cause."It has provided a kind of unifying grievance between groups that had no connection with one another before," Hayden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-capitals-on-edge-for-armed-protests-as-trump-presidency-nears-end-101610797960734.html
17-01-2021||India||MP: 8 held for rape of 13-year-old||Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh police on Saturday arrested eight people on charges of abducting a 13-year-old Class 9 student and gang-raping her twice in eight days, causing her acute trauma, officials said on Sunday.The accused were arrested under section 376 (d) (gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under relevant section of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Police have identified the eight accused Akash Singh, Rahul Kushwaha, Paras Soni, Manu Kewat, Onkar Rai, Eitendra Singh, Rajnish Choudhary and Rohit Yadav. All the accused are in the age group of 20 to 30 years and they will be produced in court on Monday.Umaria superintendent of police Vikas Shahwal said the girl was in trauma and was being counselled.“The girl, a Class 9 student, stays with her father in Jabalpur. She had come to Umaria from Jabalpur to meet her mother in December,” the SP said.Giving details of the sequence of events, the SP said while the girl was on her way to Jabalpur, she met a person identified as Akash Singh on January 1 in Umaria. On January 4, Akash Singh contacted her again and took her to a nearby eatery.“Akash Singh, with dhaba {eatery} owner Paras Soni, and a shopkeeper, Onkar Rai, raped the girl for the first time on January 4 at Soni’s dhaba at Umaria. Out of fear, she didn’t share her ordeal with anyone,” he said.Quoting the girl’s statement to the police, Shahwal said Akash Singh and a man identified as Rahul met her in a market in Umaria on January 11. “They asked her to join them for lunch to apologise for their act. They took the girl to a forest and raped her,” said Shahwal.Her trauma did not end there.Singh and his friend took her back to the eatery, where she was held hostage for a whole night.“Later, Paras Soni and four others raped her. The girl requested the accused to leave her. The girl was sent to her home in a truck. She shared her trauma with the truck driver, Rohit Yadav, who instead of informing the police, raped her. The truck driver left her near a toll plaza on Umaria-Katni road. She flagged down another truck and the unidentified driver too raped her. The girl somehow reached her home on January 13 and informed the police,” the SP said.A senior police officer, requesting anonymity said that although she had gone missing on January 11, her family did not register a complaint until January 12. “Her family told us that they were searching for her themselves,” the officer said.The SP said the entire family was in extreme trauma and shock. “The victim’s parents are being counselled as they are in shock and depression,” the SP said. He added that the father was a contractual employee in a government office in Jabalpur whereas the mother lived in their ancestral village in Umaria.The police are yet to identify the second truck driver.On Sunday, the police razed the eating place run by Paras Soni and the shops of all other accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-8-held-for-rape-of-13yearold-101610907141256.html

He had moved the high court after the magistrate’s court, as well as the sessions court rejected his bail plea. The chief judicial magistrate had also extended Faruqui’s judicial custody till January 27.Faruqui and four other stand-up comedians were arrested on January 1 for allegedly insulting Hindu gods and violating Covid-19 protocol at a New Year event in Indore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prayagraj-cops-submit-production-warrant-for-comedian-munawar-faruqui-101610906700494.html

17-01-2021||India||Oppn seeks probe into Goswami chats||New Delhi: Opposition politicians on Sunday demanded a probe of purported WhatsApp chats of Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, and Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the TV audience measurement agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), in which the former makes remarks that his critics say show he may have had advance knowledge of the Indian Air Force strike on a terrorist camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.The latest salvo against Goswami came from Congress party MP Manish Tewari, who said a joint parliamentary committee should take up the issue as the government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remained silent.  “If what sections of Media is reporting is correct then it points towards a direct linkage between Balakot air strikes and 2019 General elections. Was National Security milked for electoral purposes ? Needs a JPC investigation,” Tewari wrote on Twitter.The chats form part of Mumbai police’s 3,600-page supplementary charge sheet in a recent scandal over alleged manipulation of TV ratings.The over 500-page transcript of WhatsApp conversations between Goswami and Dasgupta sparked allegations of collusion and alleged access the TV news anchor had to classified information. Three days before the February 26, 2019 IAF strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot, in reprisal for the February 14, 2019, Pulwama terrorist attack that left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers dead, Goswami allegedly said in one of the chats that “something big will happen”, indicating he knew about the military action before it took place.Even Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra raised the issue. “Nation Needs to Know: Transcript of WhatsApp chats shows clearly Government gave prior information about both Balakot strikes & abolishing Article 370 to TV anchor,” she tweeted. “What is going on? Am I the only one who thinks ModiShah owe us answers?”There is a growing clamour among Congress leaders to take up the issue. Party leaders, on condition of anonymity, told Hindustan Times that the issue had been discussed by Congress Lok Sabha MPs. Leaders familiar with the matter said the issue was raised by Congress Lok Sabha MP Karti Chidambaram. “The party must demand answers from the BJP,” a party leader said on the condition of anonymity. “This is not the time to soft-pedal the issue.”Congress functionaries say they are studying the documents closely and will respond to the issue later. Senior party leader such as Jairam Ramesh, Jitendra Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Karti Chidambaram posted public comments on the issue on Saturday.“Does the @BJP4India have any comments on the #ArnabGate chat details, or is it too trivial to merit a response?,” Karti wrote on Twitter.“Arnab’s chats dated 23.02.2019 refer to sharing of Intel reaction along the Pak border. It means someone very senior in Govt is leaking highly confidential info which may endanger the lives of our soldiers & so that mercenary considerations can add to TRPs {television rating points},” Singhvi said.  Ramesh added that BARC was aiding “weapons of mass disinformation”.“Since 1967 BARC has stood for Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Thanks to Arnab Goswami another self-styled BARC —Broadcast Audience Research Council -- is in news now. The first BARC built a strong & scientific India. The other BARC is aiding & abetting weapons of mass disinformation,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-seeks-probe-into-goswami-chats-101610906524707.html

The team recovered hundreds of litres of illicit liquor and destroyed it on the spot. About 20 cows drank the liquor and fell ill. Three cows died on Saturday while the two died on Sunday. The carcasses were buried after post mortem. The remaining 15 cows are being treated in a camp of the veterinary department,” said G Das, deputy director animal husbandry department.However, the locals claimed that as many as nine cows died after drinking the illicit liquor. Gau Samvardhan Board, Datia, vice president and a local resident, Shishupal Singh Chauhan said, “Nine cows died but the district administration is trying to hide the matter. The cows died due to negligence of authorities. They destroyed the drums having illicit liquor in the open. The liquor collected in small pits from where it was consumed by cows. The district administration should take action against the officials responsible.”Datia district collector Sanjay Kumar refuted the claims of locals of higher bovine casualties.“The locals are exaggerating the number of deaths. Only five cows died after consuming illicit liquor. I ordered an inquiry in the matter and further action will be taken after the inquiry,” Kumar said.Earlier this week, 24 people were killed in a hooch tragedy in Morena. Last October, 14 people died after drinking illicit liquor in Ujjain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hooch-bust-in-datia-district-of-madhya-pradesh-ends-in-death-of-5-cows-101610905064910.html

Kadam alleged that there were dialogues between the characters in the web series where Hindu deity Lord Shiva has been ridiculed. The West Ghatkopar MLA demanded that the series should remove the part as it hurts the sentiments of people. “Filed complaint against Tandav Web Series at Ghatkopar police station. Police has assured quick investigation, FIR under Sec 295A of IPC, Section 67A of IT Act & Atrocities Act. Producer, Director, Writer, Actors & Amazon to be summoned soon,” Kadam tweeted.BJP parliamentarian from Maharashtra Manoj Kotak also said that the creators of the web series must apologise for hurting sentiments of the people. He also claimed that there were ‘concerted efforts’ to portray Hindu deities ‘in poor light’. Demanding a ban on the web series, the Mumbai Northeast MP also wrote to the information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar.“We have made a demand to Javadekar ji and have written to him to ban the web series immediately. The actors, producers and directors should apologise for hurting sentiments. Different organisations and individuals have complained that Hindu Gods and Goddesses have been ridiculed in 'Tandav' web series.

17-01-2021||India||Facebook, Twitter representatives to appear before IT parliamentary panel||The Parliamentary Panel on Information Technology has called the representatives of Facebook and Twitter on January 21 on the issue of "safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms including special emphasis on women security in the digital space,” according to the Lok Sabha website.The panel will also hear from the officials of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on the same issue. HT had reported on Wednesday that the panel was mulling the decision in the wake of the privacy concerns surrounding WhatsApp’s new policy.The new privacy policy, which was rolled out by WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, last week, includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, application users before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists.Also read: India inoculates close to 225k in first two days of Covid-19 vaccination driveThe move has faced massive backlash globally, with users en masse deflecting to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram. The issue of data privacy had been raised by Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and supported by other MPs, a person familiar with the matter had said."If WhatsApp says its data is end-to-end encrypted, how can it be shared with someone else? This raises serious concerns about data privacy. Moreover, in this case, why can't they share the data with the government of India," the person added.The person mentioned above had added that issue of Twitter’s "arbitrary" ban of US President Donal Trump, in the aftermath of an armed insurrection by his supporters on the Capitol building in Washington, was raised by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey and Congress MP Karti Chidambaram. "If they are intermediaries, how can they ban someone.

The exact date of the meeting has not yet been set, but it will happen in the coming weeks.”Being intermediaries provides the social media platforms freedom from persecution as they are not considered publishers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-twitter-representatives-to-appear-before-it-parliamentary-panel-101610900560892.html

Here on the LoC we remain in full control and are prepared for all contingencies,” he said in a video shared on Chinar Corps' Twitter handle.The GoC said that the LoC was quiet owing to the heavy snowfall in frontier areas.“The Line of Control remains fairly active because Pakistan desires to push in the terrorists and do some mischief in our forward areas. Presently due to the snow levels, the area of infiltration has definitely shrunk a bit so some sanity prevails on the LoC right now,” he said.He said that the ceasefire violations from the other side were basically to help terrorists s sneak in.“In response we target terrorist launch pads and also those who support the infiltration especially the forward posts of the enemy. We are aware of Pakistan’s designs and we have plans in place to maintain full control on the LoC,” he said.The corps commander said that the counter infiltration system of the forces included not only the soldiers but included modern technology.“ I can say with a fair amount of confidence that today we have a strong counter infiltration grid based on an anti infiltration obstacle system- a combination of physical obstacles, the soldiers who are guarding it and the technologies to detect and neutralize. This is something which goes through the rigours of snow every year but we put it back in place to ensure its efficacy in the summers,” he said.In another video, General Raju said that the army ispresently working with the government for a suitable surrender policy."A well thought out surrender policy will be of great help. At this stage I would say this is a work in progress," he said.The General said that what was important was how to rehabilitate those who surrender."How does the community reintegrate them? In my opinion, after their coming back this is the combined effort of the army, police, civil administration and the local community elders who have to take this task, " he said.He appealed the youth who have been misled gone astray is to come back."You can get back and we will take care of you. We have given this important message to everybody terrorists, parents and society and large. And we have demonstrated this on ground also. In the last six months, close to 17 strayed youth have come and we are very happy for them, "he said.In a third video, the GoC requested people to be vigilant of what he claimed to be "terrorists without weapons"."These are those people who instigate, fund and control terrorism as a means to their own selfish ends. For them anyone not following their ideology is fit to be killed. They are the biggest threat to peace in Kashmir, " General Raju said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infiltration-across-loc-down-by-70-says-chinar-corps-commander-101610896331046.html
17-01-2021||India||Record construction of 534 km of national highways in one week, says govt||The road ministry on Sunday said that a record 534 km of national highways was constructed in one week, beginning January 8, 2020.In a statement, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said that it has "created a record by constructing 534 km of National Highways (NHs) in the last week commencing 8 January".The ministry has constructed 8,169 km of NHs from April 2020 to January 15, 2021 in the current financial year 2020-21, i.e. with a speed of about 28.16 km per day.During the same period in the last fiscal, 7,573 km roads were constructed, with a speed of 26.11 km per day.The ministry is hopeful that with such pace it should be able to cross construction target of 11,000 km by March 31.The road ministry also awarded NH projects of 7,597 km during this period (April 2020 to January 15, 2021). In 2019-20, projects of 3,474 km were awarded during the same period. Thus, the pace of award has also more than doubled this fiscal.In total, projects of 8,948 km of roads were awarded in 2019-20 while 10,237 km of roads were constructed.The achievement assumes significance given the fact that the first two months of the current fiscal were lost due to nationwide lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.The ministry has taken several initiatives to increase the pace of construction. The pace of construction is expected to increase further in the remaining months of the current financial year, which are conducive for construction activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-construction-of-534-km-of-national-highways-in-one-week-govt-101610895893748.html

The remaining two phases are slated to be held on January 19 and 21. The state has 3,615 gram panchayats.At 103, Negi cast his vote at the Kalpa polling booth, where he was given a warm welcome by laying a red carpet by the district administration.Deputy Commissioner Hemraj Bairwa honoured Negi with a Kinnauri 'topi' and shawl. The DC said young voters should get inspiration from Negi, who turned up to cast his vote despite bad health.In his message to people, Negi said voters should participate in the election process to elect honest and capable candidates.Negi, who had made a special appearance in a Hindi film, “Sanam Re”, said he never missed casting his vote, be it panchayat, assembly or the Lok Sabha polls.Believed to the first voter in the 1952 General Election, Negi was born on July 1, 1917 and retired as a schoolteacher, as per official records.Remembering how he became the country's first voter, Negi had earlier said the India's first General Election was held in February 1952 but in tribal areas of the state, the voting took place five months in advance on October 23, 1951 due to fears of inclement weather rendering the exercise impossible during winter.“I was a schoolteacher then and had been put on election duty. Due to it, I reached my polling booth at the Kalpa primary school in Kinnaur at 7 am to cast my vote. I was the first one to reach there and vote,” he had said.Meanwhile, Electoral Officer Sanjeev Mahajan said a voter turnout of over 70 per cent was recorded in the first round.Over 63 per cent voters of two panchayats in Kaza block in Lahaul-Spiti braved extreme cold weather conditions at a temperature of minus seven degrees Celsius to cast their vote, a district official said.A voter turnout of 76 per cent was recorded in Hamirpur district.Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur and his family members cast their votes at Government Primary School at Kurani in Murhag panchayat of Mandi district.State Congress president Kuldeep Singh Rathour and his wife Tripta Rathour voted at Medhavani village in Kumarsain tehsil of Shimla.The Himachal Pradesh Election Commission also wrote to the Kangra administration, ordering an inquiry into the omission of former state minister Sudhir Sharma’s name from the electoral rolls for the panchayat polls.In a letter to the Kangra deputy commissioner, the election commission secretary sought to know how the Congress leader’s name was omitted from the electoral rolls of Rakkar panchayat falling under the Dharamshala development block.Last week, the former state urban development minister had alleged that names of hundreds of voters are missing from the electoral rolls in almost every panchayat in the state.He termed it a "well thought-out conspiracy", claiming most voters whose names are missing believe in the Congress ideology.The counting of votes for ward members, deputy village heads and village heads will take place soon after voting. However, the counting for members of panchayat samitis and zila parishads will be conducted on January 22.The candidates are contesting elections as independents and not on a party symbol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-103-india-s-first-voter-casts-vote-in-himachal-pradesh-panchayat-polls-101610894640361.html

A determined government had responded fiercely to the terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama in Kashmir between 2014 and 2019, he said. "The BJP government carried out surgical strikes inside Pakistan twice and eliminated terrorists there," Shah said. These strikes gave confidence to the public that the nation's borders are safe because Modi is the Prime Minister and the country is ruled by the BJP, he said, speaking at the Janasevak Samavesha, a public meeting to greet BJP backed candidates who won the recent Panchayat polls in Karnataka. Out of a total of 5,470 villages, party backed candidates won in 3,142 villages, he said. Referring to the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, launched nationwide on Saturday, he said both vaccines are safe and the exercise was being monitored personally by the Prime Minister himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surgical-strikes-in-pak-gave-public-confidence-borders-are-safe-under-modi-led-bjp-govt-amit-shah-101610893436080.html
17-01-2021||India||Farooq Abdullah asks PM to restore 4G internet in J&K; prays for vaccine success||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restore 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir as he highlighted various problems due to lack of the facility and the harsh winter in the Union Territory.He prayed for the success of the Covid-19 vaccine and urged people to maintain communal harmony and brotherhood at all costs for overall prosperity and development.“The prime minister is saying 5G is coming in India while we are deprived of 4G (mobile internet service). May he come and live here after leaving the chair and see how we are living under 2G (service),” Abdullah, the former chief minister of the erstwhile state, said at a book release function here.The 4G mobile internet service was snapped across Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 following revocation of special status and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two union territories.While the service was restored in two districts, Udhampur in Jammu and Ganderbal in Kashmir, after over a year, it is still suspended in rest of the 18 districts.The well-attended function was organised by Gurjar Desh Charitable Trust to release the biography of its patron-in-chief Masud Ahmad Choudhary, a retired Additional Director General of Police and ex-vice chancellor of Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (Rajouri).“Students are sitting in their homes and getting education through internet and the businessmen are also dependent on internet connectivity. My request to the prime minister is that if you are saying this place is on the path of development, give us 4G for the sake of god so that we too can benefit and our children move forward,” Abdullah said.He said attention is required to be given towards it.“There is a talk of ₹28,000 crore package. First, let us know what happened to the earlier ₹80,000 crore package and where the money had gone. See our condition and had there been no army, the Srinagar-Jammu national highway would have remained closed for one year,” the NC leader said referring to the restoration of the highway by Border Roads Organsiation (BRO), which constructed a bailey bridge near Kela Morh to restore traffic on the strategic highway after a portion of the road caved-in on January 10.Earlier this month, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced a new industrial development scheme (IDS) with a total outlay of ₹28,400 crore to encourage new investment and to take industrial development to the block level.Abdullah said people in Kashmir are faced with a lot of problems amid sub-zero temperature.“What can I say about the problems we are facing in Kashmir where there is no electricity, petrol, diesel, kerosene oil and shortage of daily use food items. Jammu is the door to Kashmir and it is pathetic that former prime minister A B Vajpayee promised a rail link (between Kashmir and rest of the country) by 2007, which was revised to 2022 by this regime. Hope it would not extend to 2040 when I will be no more,” he said.Abdullah said he is advising his brother Mustafa Kamal not to travel by Jammu-Srinagar national highway in view of the lurking threat of shooting stones from the hillocks overlooking the highway from Udhampur onwards.“I am not doing any politics. This is the present day condition in J&K. Yesterday, I received the New Year greeting card from Delhi Chief Minister and five days back a friend's letter from abroad dispatched in November last year. I telephoned him and requested him not to post any letter in future,” he said.He said the situation is no different in Jammu even as the present regime promised 24x7 electricity to consumers.“This is the condition of capital cities, god knows the condition of the people in village and far flung areas.”Referring to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, he said the virus has brought the world to its knees and showed people power of the almighty.“People today are afraid of handshakes and hugging each other as thousands are still dying on a daily basis in various parts of the world. Vaccine has been found and only time will tell about its efficacy but I am praying for its success so that the situation gets normal,” he said.He, however, expressed surprise that some people were not adhering to the SOPs and moving around without masks, urging them not to lower their guard.Urging people to be courageous and never deviate from truth, Abdullah said education has the power to empower the people and make them distinguish between right and wrong.“Make yourself courageous which is possible when you receive education, both religious as well as worldly knowledge. Nothing will happen if you get only one of the two… innocents are being put inside jails and criminals are roaming freely. Why because we lack boldness?” he said.Abdullah said people must introspect and try to understand the religion that they practice.“No religion teaches hatred. The religion is not bad but it is the human who is bad,” he said, adding every religion teaches brotherhood and to live in harmony.“When we do not respect our religion, how will we respect the religion of others? He (god) is everywhere and in every shape. We are Muslims for namesake and are practically far away (from Islam). Till we become practical, we cannot change our destiny,” he said.Hailing the contribution of Choudhary for the upliftment of his community, he said Gujjars are still facing poverty and disease and need to be empowered economically and educationally.He urged the trust to translate the released Urdu biography of Choudhary into other languages, especially Hindi and said “they think Urdu is a language of Muslims but do not know this is not the Muslim's language alone. This is one of the languages in the country.”                “We will die but the language (Urdu) will remain. It is the identity of India,” Abdullah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farooq-abdullah-asks-pm-to-restore-4g-internet-in-j-k-prays-for-vaccine-success-101610891578821.html
17-01-2021||India||Will hold peaceful Republic Day parade in Delhi, say farm unions||Tens of thousands of farmers will take out a colourful Kisan Republic Day parade (farmers’ Republic Day parade) in a “disciplined and peaceful” way in the national capital on January 26, leaders of farm unions protesting three pro-reform agricultural laws said on Sunday.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions spearheading the ongoing farmers’ agitation, said farmers all over the country would also take out similar parades in state capitals and district headquarters.The farm unions’ said their parade on tractors would cover a 60-km stretch and pass through New Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, covering areas as Peeragarhi, Janakpuri and Munirka etc.The farm unions also said their march would commence only after the official military parade on Rajpath ends so that official celebrations to mark Republic Day are not disrupted.“Farmers on hundreds of tractors decorated beautifully, along with tableau, will take out an eye-catching parade,” said Darshan Pal, a senior farm leader.The Union government had earlier asked the Supreme Court not to allow the farmers’ procession, citing security concerns, but the court had said farmers had the right to protest peacefully.“This is not a preparation for any attack. Nor are we going to go to Rajpath or Red Fort. We will be disciplined and peaceful. We will maintain honour and dignity that the occasion deserves,” senior farm leader Yogendra Yadav said.Yadav also said that the farmers’ tractors on parade would display only the national flag with appropriate respect and flags of farm unions.In what has been a tough political challenge for the Modi government, tens of thousands of protesting farmers have encircled the national capital for over a month, demanding the government scrap the three laws approved by Parliament in September last year.The laws essentially ease restrictions on farm trade, which farmers have alleged will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.“The decision to hold a peaceful tractor rally with the national flag on Outer Ring Road is a befitting reply to those who were alleging farmers are anti-national and would allegedly disrupt Republic Day parade,” said Sudhir Panwar, a farm leader and former member of Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission.The ninth round of discussions between the Union government and farm unions failed to make any progress on Friday, but both sides agreed to meet again on January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-peaceful-republic-day-parade-in-delhi-say-farm-unions-101610891950638.html

I think the agitation will continue... Protesting farmers will not return to their homes till the new farm laws are repealed," he said adding that more than 550 farmers unions of the nation have joined the movement.In response to the Agriculture Minister's request to have a clause-wise discussion, the farmer leader said that the farmers would not have a clause-wise discussion. The next meeting between farmers demanding the repealing of the farm laws and representatives of the government is scheduled for January 19.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-forced-to-agitate-as-opposition-in-country-is-weak-tikait-101610889935423.html

"After discussions with Party Chief Shri Uddhav Thackeray, Shivsena has decided to contest the West Bengal Assembly Elections," Sanjay Raut tweeted, adding a portion in Bengali as well.So, here is the much awaited update. After discussions with Party Chief Shri Uddhav Thackeray, Shivsena has decided to contest the West Bengal Assembly Elections. We are reaching Kolkata soon...!!Jai Hind, জয় বাংলা !This will not be Shiv Sena's debut in West Bengal as the party had contested in the Lok Sabha elections from the state in 2019 and assembly election in 2016.In 2019 Lok Sabha election, Shiv Sena had contested from 15 seats in West Bengal, including Tamluk, Contai, Midnapur, North Kolkata, Purulia, Barrackpore, Bankura, Barasat, Bishnupur, North Malda, Jadavpur etc. In 2016 assembly election, Shiv Sena contested from 18 seats but did not win any.Shiv Sena's entry in West Bengal Assembly election this year was being speculated as the party has dropped such hints after it contested in Bihar Assembly elections 2020.With the BJP exuding confidence of wresting Bengal from the Trinamool Congress, the assembly election will witness a tooth-and-nail fight. What adds to these are the entries of Shiv Sena, AIMIM etc while Congress and the Left have decided to join hands.Asaduddin Owaisi has already visited West Bengal for AIMIM's poll preparations and has met Abbasuddin Siddiqui, a popular Muslim leader.The Left Front and the Congress on Sunday said that their seat-sharing arrangement will be finalised by the end of this month. Congress state chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that his party and the Left Front will hold further parleys to finalise the nitty-gritty of the deal.Left Front chairman Biman Bose said that though the BJP is the "biggest enemy of the country", but given the situation in West Bengal, the fight is against both the TMC and the saffron party to save the state from communal strife and the "binary" that is being created among the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reaching-kolkata-soon-shiv-sena-will-contest-in-west-bengal-election-101610889523685.html
17-01-2021||India||Why many in Delhi skipped 1st-day vaccine, explains Satyendar Jain||A day after India began its emergency vaccination drive against Covid-19, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said at least 47 per cent of those who were registered for day one vaccination stayed away. Attributing this to personal choice, the minister said that the trend was similar across the country. Since getting vaccinated is optional, no one can be forced to take the jab, he said.In Delhi, a total of 4,319 healthcare workers — 53.3 per cent of those registered — got the vaccine shots on the first day of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday. The vaccine drive in the city will be held four times a week."Some people decided not to turn up at the last moment. The vaccination programme is completely voluntary. We cannot ask anyone to compulsorily take the shot even if the person has registered for it," he said.Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital's medical director BL Sherwal said people are taking a 'wait and watch' approach. "There is a little bit of apprehension (about the vaccine). Also, people in India adopt a 'wait and watch' approach in important matters, be it purchasing a new car or an appliance. People consider the experiences of others before taking a call," he said."There is a need for creating more awareness and building confidence among people. No major vaccine-related side effects were reported on Saturday, which is going to encourage others to take the shots," he said.Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, said technical glitches in Co-Win app could be a reason why many people could not take the shots on the launch day. Maharashtra stalled vaccination for two days owing to the technical glitch, which the health ministry has also admitted.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-many-in-delhi-skipped-1st-day-vaccine-satyendar-jain-explains-101610887986387.html
17-01-2021||India||AAP’s selfie campaign to ‘expose’ bad condition of govt schools in Uttarakhand||The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Uttarakhand unit has begun a "selfie with school" campaign in a fresh attack on the BJP government in the state ahead of 2022 state assembly polls.Under the campaign, the party has asked the people of the state to send them photographs of the government schools in dilapidated condition in their respective areas. The party then organizes an exhibition of such photographs in their district offices with the first such exhibition held on January 15.The AAP state leaders have been attacking the BJP led state government alleging it of "doing nothing on the educational system" in the state but "misleading" people.Earlier this month, the two parties had sparred over a live debate challenge by senior AAP leader and deputy chief minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia in Dehradun in which Uttarakhand minister Madan Kaushik did not show up.Sanjay Bhatt, AAP’s spokesperson in Uttarakhand said, "We decided to launch the campaign after BJP attacked Sisodia when he returned to Delhi after completing his Dehradun visit in January first week. Minister Kaushik didn't accept his debate challenge on the development issue but attacked him after he returned.""The BJP leaders in their attack on the AAP government in Delhi had claimed that Uttarakhand has better schools than Delhi. With this campaign of ours, we have exposed them as people have sent hundreds of photographs showing schools in very bad condition," said Bhatt.The AAP leader while citing the photographs received under the campaign alleged the BJP government of making "hollow claims and misleading the people.""The government had claimed that the state has better schools than Delhi but the photographs have totally exposed them. They have done nothing to improve the condition of schools where learning is no less than a survival test for both children and teachers," said Bhatt.He added, "We will continue the campaign and hold more exhibitions like this to further expose the BJP government."The BJP termed the AAP's campaign as a political "gimmick" to grab attention in the state's political scenario where they have "no presence.""AAP has absolutely no ideology of its own and just misleads the people with lies and hollow claims. People of Uttarakhand will not fall for their lies as they know that our government has done a lot of development works after coming to power in 2017," said Manveer Singh Chauhan, BJP media in-charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aaps-selfie-campaign-to-expose-bad-condition-of-govt-schools-in-uttarakhand-101610888163419.html

17-01-2021||India||Apex Court appointed panel on farm laws to meet on Jan 19 for first meeting||The Supreme Court-appointed committee on the three new farm laws is scheduled to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus here, its member Anil Ghanwat said on Sunday.The Supreme Court had on January 11 stayed the implementation of the three laws, against which farmers are protesting at Delhi borders for over 50 days now, till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann, however, recused himself from the committee last week.Apart from Ghanwat, agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi are the other panel members."We are meeting on January 19 at the Pusa campus. Only members will meet to decide the future course of action," Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra), told PTI."One of the four members has backed out of the committee. If the apex court does not appoint a new member, the existing members will continue," he said.The Supreme Court may take into account the matter of recusal of the member from the panel on Monday when it is scheduled to hear the pleas relating to the controversial farm laws and the farmers protests.Ghanwat said the committee has received the terms of reference and will begin its work from January 21.Asked about the government holding parallel talks with protesting farmer unions after the setting up of the SC panel, he said, "We have no issue if a solution is found and the protests end from either (efforts of) our panel or from the government's separate talks with the protesting farmer unions.""Let (Government) them continue the discussion, we have been given a duty and we will focus on that," he added.So far, the government has held nine rounds of formal talks with 41 farmer unions but has failed to break the logjam as the latter have stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting on January 19 to end the long-running protest at various Delhi borders.The top court would also hear on Monday the plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against a proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers that may disrupt the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-to-meet-on-jan-19-for-first-meeting-101610885652620.html
17-01-2021||India||Thousands of tractors will enter Delhi for disciplined Kisan Republic Day parade, say farm union leaders||Protesting farmers will enter Delhi on thousands of tractors for a ‘disciplined’ Kisan Republic Day parade, farm unions leaders said on Sunday. They will cover around 50km and pass through the national capital’s Outer Ring Road, they added. “No disruption will be caused to the official Republic Day ceremony,” Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Farmers from Punjab have left from Ludhiana for Delhi to participate in the tractor parade on Republic Day as a mark of protest against the three contentious farm laws, ANI reported. "We are leaving for Delhi with our tractors and will continue to do so till January 24. Around 11 thousand tractors will be making a move to Delhi from Ludhiana itself. In total, one lakh tractors will participate in the Republic Day tractor parade from Ludhiana, Amritsar, Faridkot, and Bhatinda districts," a farmer was quoted as saying by the news agency.Farmers’ leaders had earlier said that they will hold their tractor march on January 26 on one side while the Republic Day parade is underway. However, they later said they won't march to the Red Fort and will only take out tractor marches at Delhi's borders with Haryana where they have been camping since November last year.Meanwhile, the Centre has moved the Supreme Court through Delhi Police against the proposed tractor march by farmers. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde will on Monday hear the plea seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor rally. This is a separate plea than the one which the top court was hearing regarding farmers' protests.Earlier in the day, farmers' unions said notices are being served by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on supporters of their ongoing agitation, which they say could be a hurdle in ongoing talks. Labelling it as “harassment” by the government, the unions have decided that no farmer who has received such notices will appear before the agency as a mark of protest, Balbir Singh Rajewal, a senior leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of unions, told HT.Parallel to this, consultation between farmers and the Centre is going on with the 10th meeting scheduled on January 19.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against three farm laws—Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020— enacted by the Centre in September last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-union-leaders-say-thousands-of-tractors-will-enter-delhi-for-disciplined-kisan-republic-day-parade-101610885855649.html

17-01-2021||India||Shiv Sena and Congress in war of words over renaming of Aurangabad||Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition partners Shiv Sena and Congress clashed again on Sunday over the renaming of Aurangabad city as Sambhaji NagarShiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, in his weekly column in Saamana, stated that a ‘secular’ party like Congress is not in favour of renaming because minorities would get upset, and will affect their vote bank.It drew a sharp retort from Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat who said that the Sena is worried about their votes and raked the issue ahead of civic polls in the city. The senior Congress minister also asked why the Sena did not rename the city in the last five years when they were in power.The two allies have been at loggerhead over the issue for the last two weeks after the Sena raised thedecade-old issue to rename Aurangabad city as Sambhaji Nagar. The Congress has opposed the move with its leaders calling it an issue outside the purview of the common minimum programme (CMP) and that renaming cities will not ensure development.On Sunday, the Sena said that if Mughal ruler Aurangzeb is dear to somebody then it's not secular behavior. Raut wrote that though Congress is against the renaming, a large section of people are of view that there should not be any sign or mark of Aurangzeb. He said that renaming is not fanaticism but can be called "Shiv Bhakti" or "pride of Maharashtra" or "sense of history"."A 'secular' party like Congress is of the opinion that Aurangabad should not become Sambhaji Nagar. If it is renamed the Muslims, that is the minorities, will be upset and have a resultant impact on the vote bank. [Ultimately], it will create a question mark on their secular image. The ones who are opposing the renaming also raised the issue if rechristening will solve the issues of the people and development [there]. Whatever it may be, but there is a large section of people, in Maharashtra at least, who do not want to keep any corner [named] after Aurangzeb," Raut wrote.Thorat tweeted a statement asking why the Sena and BJP which enjoyed power at the Centre and the state for five years did not remember the issue of renaming Aurangabad then. Without naming the two parties, Thorat wrote, "The two [parties] who are in power in Aurangabad for years now should speak about development. The people of Aurangabad want this, but they both have disappointed them and therefore they have to take support of the issue of renaming ahead of the municipal corporation election.""Our ally in the state Shiv Sena is worried about their votes therefore they have started this 'Saamana' (war) of renaming cities. About BJP, hypocrisy is their character trait, therefore people view their words and actions as entertainment," Thorat said.The Congress leader also made it clear that the renaming row will not affect the stability of the three-party government.Raut in his column targeted the Congress party over their reservations to support the renaming. The Sena leader wrote about the history of the "aggressive" Mughal emperor Aurangzeb “on whose order Sambhaji Raje was tortured and killed by Mughal chieftains and his dismembered body was thrown on the road near Pune”.Raut added that the political leaders should revisit history books to know about the rule of Aurangzeb. "Aurangzeb was never 'secular'. He wanted to expand the empire based on Islam... There cannot be a single city in Maharashtra in the name of such an Aurangzeb. This is not fanaticism, but can call it Shiv Bhakti, or pride of Maharashtra, or call it sense of history; but if such an Aurangzeb is dear to someone, then prostration to them from the corner! This behaviour is not 'secular'!".Raut later reporters that the issue of renaming is "over" for Maharashtra after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray referred to the city as Sambhaji Nagar."I have written [the column] on what Aurangzeb was. No one should fall in love with Aurangzeb. Those who have the slightest of affection for Aurangzeb will not have it after reading today's Saamana. Aurangzeb was a cruel ruler, a fanatic, and he had no love for other religions. The Shiv Sena's stand is clear that nobody should be insistent on keeping any monument or any city named after Aurangzeb," Raut said.He also added that there is no question of "Hindu or Muslim vote bank" on the issue, but called it a question of "pride of the country", and a matter of "good and evil".BJP leader Ashish Shelar, meanwhile, cornered the Shiv Sena on the issue and said that the party is treating Congress with kid gloves on the matter. Shelar, in a video statement on his Twitter handle said the Sena is helpless in its quest for power."The sentiment of the people over the renaming is clear and strong. Today, we saw how the language of Saamana changed for the sake of power. When it comes to the ego of their leaders, they use the language of 'Ukhaad dia' (referring to Saamana headline for BMC action against actor Kangana Ranaut). In a matter of pride of Chhatrapati, they say "prostration to them from the corner'. We ask the Shiv Sena why they are not using 'ukhaad dia'-tone with those opposing the renaming?" he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-and-congress-in-war-of-words-over-renaming-of-aurangabad-101610883515663.html

17-01-2021||India||‘I think the agitation will continue’: Farmers' leader Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait warned the government on Sunday that farmers will continue their agitation until the three farm laws are repealed. The farmers' leader also asked the government regarding its reluctance towards a total rollback of the laws even after witnessing massive protests for the last eight weeks at Delhi’s borders. “If a few lakh farmers are camping at the borders of Delhi, why is the government not repealing the farm laws? I think the agitation will continue,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Farmers’ unions' representatives and the Centre had held the ninth rounds of discussions on Friday to resolve the concerns raised by farmers regarding the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Both sides failed to mitigate the issues and will once again meet on January 19 to discuss their concerns.Farmers are demanding a total repeal of the laws but the Centre has clarified its position saying that they are here to stay and the government is ready for the long haul. Farmers’ unions' representatives have also declined to take up their grievances to the Supreme Court-appointed four-member committee. The top court had on January 12 formed a panel of four members to help the Centre and the farmers’ unions representatives reach an amicable agreement concerning the farm laws. Following the meeting with Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal, who have represented the Centre in all the nine rounds of discussions, Tikait had announced that no farmers’ unions representatives shall discuss the issues with the panel.The panel consisted of Bhupinder S Mann, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, president of Maharashtra's Shetkeri Sangthana, Anil Ghanwat; Pramod Kumar Joshi, the director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati. Two days after the panel was formed Bhupinder S Mann, BKU president, recused himself from the panel citing that his duties lie with farmers of the nation and the farmers of Punjab.Agriculture minister Tomar continues to remain hopeful that only discussions can pave the way for the implementation of the laws and resolve differences. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he said that the government is ready to bring amendments to the laws and asked farmers unions’ to take an alternative approach rather than demanding a total rollback of the laws.“We had sent a proposal to farmer unions in which we agreed to address their apprehensions regarding mandis and traders' registration among other things. The government has also agreed to discuss laws on stubble burning and electricity but unions only want the repeal of the laws,” Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Farmers are demanding a rollback of the farm laws passed during the monsoon session as they believe that these laws will affect the procurement of crop yields under government schemes like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system. They also highlighted that the laws will aid corporate farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-think-the-agitation-will-continue-farmers-leader-tikait-101610882178842.html
17-01-2021||India||Will farmers be allowed to hold tractor march on January 26? SC to hear plea||A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Monday will hear the Centre's plea seeking an injunction against the tractor rally proposed by the protesting farmers on the Republic Day.Farmers who have been protesting against three farm laws since November 26 had earlier announced their plan of a major tractor rally at Republic Day celebrations. Farmer leaders earlier said that on January 26, there will be Republic Day parade on one side and the tractor march on the other. But later, they said they won't march to the Red Fort and will only take out tractor march at Haryana-Delhi borders where they have been camping since November last week.The Centre moved the apex court through Delhi Police against the proposed tractor march, which the Supreme Court agreed to hear on January 18.This is a separate plea than the one which the Supreme Court was hearing regarding farmers' protests. On January 12, the top court passed an interim order and stayed the implementation of the new farm laws. It has also set up a four-member panel to suggest solutions to the impasse. The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana. The committee was given eight weeks' time for consultation. However, Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself from the committee. It is likely that the court may take note of this and suggest another member for the panel.Parallel to this, consultation between farmers and the Centre is going on with the 10th meeting scheduled on January 19.Meanwhile, a farmer union moved the Supreme Court on Saturday requesting to remove the remaining three members of the committee.Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Balbir Singh Rajewal has claimed that rumours are being spread about the proposed tractor march. In an open letter to farmers, he reiterated that the march will be conducted at borders, and will be a peaceful protest, though it has been rumoured that the protesters will head towards the Red Fort or Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-supreme-court-hearing-on-january-18-tractor-march-rumours-101610882100948.html

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha condemns act of serving these notices. In the coming days, legal action will also be taken against these notices,” the unions said in a statement.The farm unions representing tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have launched a mass agitation around the national capital, are demanding that the government scrap three laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws are aimed at freeing agricultural markets from government restrictions, which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Tomar on Sunday said most farmers are in favour of laws. “A majority of farmers in the country support the laws. We will find a solution through talks,” he told reporters.As HT had reported first, the NIA had issued summonses to over two dozen people associated with farmers’ protests on January 15, asking them to appear before it in Delhi in connecting with its probe related to funding of Khalistanis abroad for organising on-ground campaigns and demonstrations outside Indian missions in the UK, the US, Canada, Germany and other countries.The probe also focuses on use of several NGOs for funding the Khalistani campaigns, particularly spearheaded by banned outfit Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).The agency officials say the persons called for examination have been issued notices as “witnesses” to clarify certain aspects regarding the probe. HT had first reported about the new case regarding Khalistani conspiracy registered on December 15, 2020 in the midst of farmers’ protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-using-nia-to-harass-us-with-notices-nobody-will-appear-before-nia-farm-unions-say-101610878603911.html

Hike StickerChat's chief executive officer Kavin Bharti Mittal had announced the shutdown of its operation on January 6. "Today we're announcing that we will be sunsetting StickerChat in Jan'21. We thank you all for giving us your trust. We wouldn’t be here without you. All your data will be available to download in the app," Mittal had tweeted.On January 14, the artificial intelligence-powered Indian unicorn had also tweeted about the shutdown of the app and had said, "The time has finally come for us to bid farewell to Hike Sticker Chat. Thank you for your love, trust and support. Our relationship with you means the world to us, and so we are looking forward to seeing you on our new and exciting apps."The company had also issued a statement to its users asking them to export their chats from the platform by 11:59pm on January 14, 2021. "You can continue to reach us on care@hike.in for any issues till 15th Feb 2021," the statement said.The Bharti Enterprises-owned homegrown app had been a rival of WhatsApp in the Indian messaging ecosystem. The news of its shutdown comes amidst the privacy row concerning WhatsApp that has driven users to other apps like Signal and Telegram. Mittal had also said Indian messaging apps can't compete with the likes of Telegram and Signal unless the country bans western companies.India won’t have its own messenger. Global network effects are too strong (unless India bans Western companies)@telegram UX, Groups better than @signalappBoth are very good. As entities they have the right incentives (more aligned with consumers) unlike FB products.While the reason for the shutdown is not known, Mittal has introduced Hike's new products for 2021 - Rush and Vibe (earlier known as HikeLand). Rush will be a bite-sized gaming platform that will have games like carrom and ludo, whereas HikeLand has evolved to Vibe that is now an approval only community platform, that means users will have to apply to join the service.Mittal also credited Hike StickerChat for being the launchpad of its various platforms with million users actively using the app for an average of 35 minutes per day.Also Read | WhatsApp defers new policy on info sharingThe users of the app have been upset with the latest development and expressed displeasure by writing reviews on Hike's other products on PlayStore.

This is applicable in every sector. Around 7,37,000 foreign tourists visited the monument in 2019 while only 1,82,000 visited in 2020. In case of domestic tourists, around 48,35,000 people visited the monument in 2019 while merely 11,34,000 visited in the year 2020," told Vasant Kumar Swarnkar, Superintending Archaeologist.While explaining the reasons for a reduction in the number of tourists visiting Taj Mahal, he said: "The monument remained closed for a long time- March 17, 2020, to September 21, 2020. Later on capping and suspension of international flights due to pandemic led to a loss of tourism. However, I think that 24 per cent of tourists still visiting the place in such adverse conditions is a positive aspect."The livelihood of people who are dependent on the Taj Mahal has also hit hard."Our business which is majorly dependent on foreign tourists has been hit hard.

"These bikes will be more useful in areas like Bijapur, Sukma, Dantewada etc., as it is tough for the force to take big vehicles or ambulances inside the jungle," a CRPF official said.The bike has been developed after the CRPF noticed a need for such bikes to reach fast to the narrow roads in tensed areas, especially in the Naxalite zones. There have been instances where medical facilities couldn't reach on time and a delay in medical assistance ended up making the patients' situation more critical.The INMAS works in the area of biomedical and clinical research with reference to radiation, neurocognitive imaging and research.

This assurance was conveyed to Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali during his visit to New Delhi for the Joint Commission Meeting with external affairs minister Subramanyam Jaishankar.While the political detractors of Nepal Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli has portrayed Gyawali’s visit as a damp squib, fact is that interlocutors of Nepalese foreign minister in New Delhi were impressed by his professionalism and sobriety with which he approached the bilateral relationship. Gyawali could not meet PM Modi as the Indian PM was totally involved in the launch of Covid-19 vaccines on January 16, according to top government sources. It was only due to PM’s prior commitments that Gyawali was received by defence minister Rajnath Singh, who is number two in the Modi government.It is understood that India will be taking care of emergency requirements of its friends by supply vaccines for restricted use to priority neighbourhood countries like Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Maldives apart from Nepal with supply schedule being worked out now.According to government interlocutors, Gyawali briefed EAM Jaishankar about the preparedness in Nepal to receive the Indian vaccine with Nepal regulator granting approval during the foreign dignitary visit. The two countries are now on way to discuss training of medical modules, who will vaccinate Nepalese front line workers during the restricted use period. Nepal has a total of 2,67,056 Covid-19 cases with as many as 1,954 persons losing their lives to the pandemic, which had origins in China.During Gyawali’s visit the two sides agreed to gradually open the air and land route connectivity, which had been hit by the pandemic. The two countries agreed to expedite the field location survey related to the Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line.While India-Nepal decided to deepen defence cooperation by closer military to military cooperation, Rajnath Singh also offered to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training and capacity building to the Oli Government.“There were no acrimonious notes during Gyawali’s visit with the visitor taking a very responsible view of the bilateral relationship,” said one of the officials present in the bilateral meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-gives-nepal-iron-clad-commitment-on-covid-19-vaccine-101610875404714.html

Among the four questions were issues regarding the prices of the Covishield and Covaxin doses and the Centre's decision to allow the exports of one of the vaccines before immunising everyone in the country."Vaccine Development & Mass Immunization were neither Events' or Publicity Stunts but important milestones in the service of the people'. While the country stands united in providing immunization against Corona Virus to our Frontline Corona Warriors' i.e. Doctors, Health Workers, Police Personnel & others, let remember that vaccinations are an important Public Service and not a Political or Business Opportunity," senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a statement released on Twitter.While India stands united in providing immunisation against Corona Virus to our Frontline Corona Warriors i.e. Doctors,Health Workers,Police Personnel & others, lets remember that vaccinations are an important Public Service & not a Political or Business Opportunity!Statement-: pic.twitter.com/qKnV46lHHQThe opposition party has been critical of the government with senior Congress leader Manish Tewari and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan sparring on Twitter on Saturday, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the country's mammoth inoculation drive. Tewari had raised questions over the emergency use approval given to the indigenously-developed vaccine Covaxin and Vardhan hitting back alleging that the Congress leader was only passionate about spreading rumours.Before that, senior Congress leaders Anand Sharma, Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor had also raised concerns over India's drugs regulator's nod to the restricted use of Bharat Biotech's vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In response to the criticism, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had then hit out at Congress with party president JP Nadda alleging that whenever India achieves something commendable the opposition party comes up with "wild theories" to "ridicule" the accomplishments.Also read | 10 Indian states with the highest Covid-19 vaccine beneficiariesOn Sunday, Surjewala said PM Modi and the government need to answer important questions. "Who will get Free Corona Vaccine? How many people will get Free Corona Vaccine? Where will you get Free Corona Vaccine?" he asked as he pointed out the government's order for the vaccine doses will be inadequate.The Congress party's general secretary also asked why should the government pay ₹95 more to Bharat Biotech for a vaccine that has been "developed with the expertise & experience of scientists of Govt owned ICMR". "Why should Modi Govt pay more for a vaccine that has only been tested on 755 individuals & is yet to be cleared after Phase II trials. Should the price of such a vaccine not be cheaper than the AstraZeneca-Serum Institute?" he questioned.Surjewala then came to the price of Serum Institute's vaccine in the open market as he cited the chief executive of the Pune-based company Adar Poonawalla saying that they will sell Covishield for ₹1,000/dose in the open market or "2,000/dose for 2 doses required for every individual." "Isn't Modi Govt duty bound to ensure purchase of all "Covishield Doses' at 200/dose and enable the people to purchase at this price rather than 1,000/dose? When AstraZeneca has promised supply of vaccine "at no profit", why is Serum Institute being permitted to charge 1,000/dose, when they are supplying to Govt at 200/dose? he asked further.Also read | In India, the story of Covid-19 vaccinesThe last question was on the government's permission to SII to allow the export of its vaccine "without immunisation of India's population".

"It is a pleasant coincidence that today is the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna MGR. His life was dedicated to the service of the poor," Modi said. “We all are working towards fulfilling his dreams.”Modi had announced at a public meeting in Chennai in March 2019 that the Chennai Central railway station would be renamed after MGR following a request by the AIADMK-led government.Modi also tweeted his wishes in Tamil and English today, on MGR’s birth anniversary. "Bharat Ratna MGR lives in the hearts of several people. Be it the world of films or politics, he was widely respected. During his tenures as the CM, he made numerous efforts towards poverty alleviation and also emphasised on women empowerment. Tributes to MGR on his Jayanti," his tweet read.Meanwhile, political leaders in Tamil Nadu, including chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, AMMK chief TTV Dhinakaran and MNM founder Kamal Haasan paid tributes to MGR's statue in the city.

Issuing a statement, the party said Covishield, as the vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India is known, costs ₹200 per dose. However, Belgium is getting the vaccine at ₹158 per dose, the party said, quoting an article of The Guardian."Astrazeneca earlier said that it would supply the vaccine at no profit. Then why is the government of India paying ₹200 for Astrazeaca vaccine to Serum Institute of India?" party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked.Will the Modi govt tell the nation why India is paying a higher price than other countries for the same vaccine? A vaccine that has been produced in India. #FreeVaccineforAll pic.twitter.com/WWY1X6S85gThe Congress has also questioned the government why it is paying more to Bharat Biotech which developed the vaccine, Covaxin, with the expertise and experience of the scientists of Indian Council of Medical Research."Why should the Modi government pay ₹95 more to Bharat Biotech for a vaccine that has only been tested on 755 individuals and is yet to be cleared after Phase III trials? Should the price of such a vaccine not be cheaper than the AstraZeneca-Serum Institute?" the party asked.Also Read: 10 Indian states with the highest Covid-19 vaccine beneficiariesOpposing the government's plan to allow the export of the vaccines, the Congress said the government should not export vaccines without immunising the entire population of the country.Congress also sought clarification on how the rest of the people would be vaccinated. Several states, including Bihar, Kerala, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, have announced free vaccines to its people, while the Centre is sponsoring the vaccination of the priority groups. The Centre is yet to spell out any modality for the procurement of vaccines for common people. Asking whether the common people will have to pay ₹2,000 for two doses of the vaccines, Randeep Surjewala said, "If 100 Crore people end up paying ₹1,600 extra for the vaccine, the cost would come to a whopping ₹1,60,000 Crores. Has the Govt even considered this as also other questions being raised in the public domain?"The Drug Controller General of India granted restricted, emergency use authorization to Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. Both the vaccines are at the third stage of the trial. Covishield's efficacy data is available, while Covaxin still doesn't have efficacy data, which already triggered a political battle of barbs.India is procuring 110 lakh doses of Covishield at the cost of ₹200 per dose. But this is a special price for the government, the Serum Institute of India has said. Though it has not yet declared any final price of the vaccine at which the doses will be available for common people, the price will definitely be more than ₹200, somewhere around ₹400-500, CEO Adar Poonawalla had hinted.As it comes to Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, the Centre is procuring 38.5 lakh doses at a rate of ₹295. But as Bharat Biotech is providing 16.5 lakh vaccines doses free, the cost per dose comes at ₹206. For common people, it is likely to cost ₹295 per dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-claims-india-is-paying-more-for-covishield-doses-opposes-export-plan-101610872666822.html

So we expect precipitation of lower intensity compared to the previous one," said Lotus.Many parts of the UT received widespread and heavy snowfall from January 3 to January 8, resulting in the closing of the Srinagar-Jammu highway and affecting air traffic for days together.After the precipitation, the Kashmir valley has been reeling under intense cold, leading to the freezing of water bodies and snowed roads and fields.Lotus said that Srinagar, the summer capital of J&K, recorded a minimum temperature of -8.4 deg C on 14th January which broke the previous record of -8.3 deg C registered 25 years ago in 1995."There was complete freezing of the Dal Lake with kids playing on the frozen lake, which happened after almost three decades," he said.The weather office said that the coldest place in the valley on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday was Qazigund in south Kashmir, where the mercury plunged to minus 9 degree Celsius, around 5.7 notches below normal.The ski resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir recorded minus 4. 2 degrees C while the temperature went to minus 8.7 degrees C in the tourist resort of Pahalgam.“The summer capital of Srinagar froze at minus 7.6 degree C, some 5.5 degrees lower than the normal,” said Mohammad Hussain Mir, a meteorologist of MeT centre in Srinagar.Jammu division’s Bhaderwah and Batote regions recorded temperatures of 1.5 degrees C and 4.2 degrees C, respectively.In the union territory of Ladakh, Leh registered a temperature of minus 12.1 degrees C while Kargil was even colder at minus 17.4 degrees C.

17-01-2021||India||Shah to Cong: 'Why didn't you give ₹6,000 per year to farmers when in power?'||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday continued his attack on the Congress over the farm laws and asked why didn't the party give ₹6,000 per year to farmers when it was in power."I would like to ask Congress leaders who are talking in favour of farmers, why didn't you give ₹6,000 per year to farmers or made Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana or amended ethanol policy when you were in power? Because your intention was not right," Shah said while addressing a public rally in Bagalkot district of Karnataka.Shah said the Narendra Modi government is committed to working for the welfare of the farmers."The three farm laws will help farmers' income increase manifold. Now farmers can sell agriculture produce anywhere in the country and the world," he added.The farmers who have been protesting against the Centre's farm laws for more than seven weeks, have said the government is dragging things so that they get tired and leave the protest site."For almost two months, we are suffering and dying in cold weather. The government is giving us 'tarikh pe tarikh' and are dragging things so that we get tired and leave the place. This is their conspiracy," said Hannan Mollah, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS).The government has sent a proposal to protesting farmer unions in which it has agreed to address their apprehensions regarding mandis, and traders' registration among other things, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said earlier in the day."We had sent a proposal to farmer unions in which we agreed to address their apprehensions regarding mandis and traders' registration among other things. The government has also agreed to discuss laws on stubble burning and electricity but unions only want the repeal of the laws," Tomar told ANI.He reiterated that the government is ready to bring amendments in the laws, and added that laws are enacted for the whole country and many people in the country are happy with the laws."The farmer unions are not budging from their stance, they are constantly asking to repeal the laws. When the government enacts the law, it is for the whole country. Most of the farmers, scholars, scientists, and people working in the agriculture sector agree with these laws," he stated.Tomar added that with the Supreme Court's intervention there is no point in farmers' demand about repealing the laws."If the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of laws, then I think the question of repealing ends. We expect farmers to discuss the laws clause by clause on January 19 and give us options about what amendments can be brought in the laws other than repealing," he stated further.On January 12, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Centre's three farm laws and asked the committee formed by it concerning the laws to submit its report within two months.The committee has been directed to hold a dialogue with farmers and submit its recommendations pertaining to the farm laws within two months from the date of its first sitting.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-to-cong-why-didn-t-you-give-rs-6-000-per-year-to-farmers-when-in-power-101610870677717.html

She is native to Mahbubnagar in Telangana. After marriage, she was living in Ras Al Khaimah in the UAE and later moved to Fujairah in the UAE where she is forced to work as a housemaid for her livelihood," he added."She cannot come back to India as her agent-husband did not give her passport or any other identification proofs.

He also accused Pakistan of instigating the youth from Kashmir valley into terrorism by various means.ALSO WATCH | 'Terrorists' strength in Kashmir...': Army officer on Pakistan, drones, tunnelsLieutenant General BS Raju, the General officer in Command of the Chinar Corps in Kashmir, said on Sunday that the present strength of terrorists in the Valley is lowest in the last decade. He also accused Pakistan of instigating the youth from Kashmir valley into terrorism by various means."Terrorists' recruitment in 2020 was fairly in control, especially when compared to 2018. The present strength of terrorists in the Valley is 217 which is lowest in the last decade," Lt Gen Raju told news agency ANI."Pakistan remains the key instigator to push youth towards terrorism by various means. It has attracted many youths for studies. But along the way, a few have been indoctrinated. Some of them have trained and sent back through the Line of Control (LoC) as part of infiltrating columns as well as through the international border. Terrorists from Pakistan target our security forces and civilians within the Valley in crowded areas," he further said.The Army officer said that India has been able to reduced infiltration by over 70 per cent in comparison to last year. "On the LoC, we remain in full control and are prepared for all contingencies," Lt Gen Raju said.He said that the Pakistan's desire to send weapons and drugs through drones and tunnels is definitely a challenge. On Wednesday, Indian security forces discovered a tunnel built by Pakistani security officials - second such tunnel to be discovered since November - in the Kathua district near the Zero Line.The three-feet wide tunnel was constructed at a depth of 25 to 30 feet.On Army Day on January 15, Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane had said that 300 to 400 terrorists were present in terror training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and waiting to sneak into India.He said the army’s operations along the LoC not only caused heavy losses to the enemy but also thwarted a large number of infiltration attempts. He said the army killed a total of 200 terrorists at the LoC and in counter-terror operations in the hinterland.He also gave a blunt message to China, saying India was committed to resolving the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) through talks but no one should test India’s patience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strength-of-terrorists-in-kashmir-valley-lowest-in-decade-top-army-commander-101610869898580.html

We welcome the corona vaccination drive. However, we must remember that India has a population of over 125 crores and 50 per cent of the people live around the poverty line.

There should be no distinction in this matter," Bhadoria stated.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday rolled out the world's largest vaccination drive against the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused 1,52,093 deaths and affected millions of lives in the country.The Union Health Ministry on Saturday said no case of post-vaccination hospitalisation has been reported so far and the drive was successful.

These firms are exempted from filing EPF returns to the EPFO. These are regulated by the EPFO.During the pandemic, the EPFO came out with innovative measures like auto-settlement mode and multi-location claim settlement to ensure settlement of Covid-19 claims within three days despite restrictions on full deployment of staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/epfo-settles-56-79-lakh-covid-19-advance-claims-releases-over-rs-14-000-crore-till-december-101610867531236.html

17-01-2021||India||Orissa HC asks woman to hand over baby to his father||The Orissa High Court has allowed a man to take custody of his 15-month-old son observing that continuance of the custody of the toddler with the mother, who is now staying separately, would be detrimental to the child's mental and physical development and may also affect his psychology negatively.The court direction came after watching a video in which it is seen that the mother was repeatedly torturing and beating the child mercilessly.A Division Bench of Justices S K Mishra and Savitri Ratho on Friday while allowing a writ of Habeas Corpus filed by one Chakradhar Nayak of Puri district directed his wife to hand over the baby boy to his father within seven days."In case of her failure to do so, the police shall take appropriate steps in taking the child from the physical custody of the mother and handover the child to the father", the high court directed."We found from the video that the mother was mercilessly beating the infant on several occasions. Finding the cruelty, torture and assault to the small boy, we directed the police to secure the attendance of the mother along with the child", the high court said.Married for over five years now, Chakradhar and Rosalin of Paika Sahi under Gop police station have a disturbed marital life and on one previous occasion, the man was imprisoned briefly after his wife brought dowry charges and domestic violence allegations. The case was, however, closed and they were reunited following a court-initiated compromise.The marital discord once again surfaced after the child was born and the woman has since been staying with her parents along with the baby.Later when Chakradhar learnt that Rosalin is torturing the baby and beating the infant with an aim to settle scores with her estranged husband, he approached the high court with a habeas corpus writ petition seeking to take possession of his son. Having a retail shop at Bhubaneswar, Chakradhar is now staying with his sister and brother-in-law in the capital city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/orissa-hc-asks-woman-to-hand-over-baby-to-his-father-101610866236517.html

If you choose to set up an industry here, you will be provided with all necessary assistance from our government. We will facilitate availability of land. We will also ensure that all issues flagged by you are promptly resolved," he said.The chief minister sought to highlight the changes in society which have been caused by initiatives such as free bicycles to school-going girls."When we took over in 2005, a girl riding bicycle in Patna was a rare sight. Now hordes of school-going girls can be seen on the streets of virtually every village. The enrolment of female students has gone up and last year they outnumbered boys in the matric examinations," Kumar said.He also spoke about his ambitious 'Jal Jeevan Hariyali' drive aimed at combating climate change, recalling that it was appreciated by no less a luminary than Bill Gates when he visited Bihar two years ago."He (Gates) came and saw our efforts and, at a media interaction outside the state, expressed his profuse admiration. He was amazed by the zeal shown by a poor state in addressing issues which, normally, only the developed world appears to be concerned with," he said.The chief minister also told the delegates about efforts made by his government in giving a facelift to various tourist spots, especially those associated with the Buddha."Please do plan a tour. We will be delighted to host you. You will return with memories to cherish," he added.Kumar also said that he valued the interaction with members of the diaspora, since they brought with them a wealth of experience."I am instructing officials attached to the CM Secretariat to hold such sessions regularly. I would like to listen to your suggestions even when it might not be possible (for me) to take active part," he said at the interaction which lasted over an hour.The CM was accompanied by former cabinet colleague and key aide Sanjay Kumar Jha. Among others who took part in the interaction was Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-seeks-help-from-state-s-diaspora-for-industrial-growth-101610862718455.html
17-01-2021||India||'When I used to take narrow gauge line': PM Modi flags off trains to Kevadia||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged off new eight trains connecting Gujarat's Kevadia, which houses Statue of Unity, to several other destinations of the country and said this is a beautiful picture of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat'. "This is probably for the first time in the history of railways that so many trains from different locations of the country get flagged off to the same destination," PM Modi said."More visitors are coming to the Statue of Unity than the Statue of Liberty. Kevadia is not a small place any more. It will become one of the most attractive tourist spots of the world," the Prime Minister said. In future, over 1 lakh people will come to visit Kevadiya every day, PM Modi said quoting a survey.Also Read: PM Modi flags off 8 trains to boost connectivity to Statue of Unity. See listPaying his tributes to Bharat Ratna MGR on his birth anniversary, PM Modi said, "One of the trains flagged off for Kevadia today originates at Puratchi Thalaivar Dr MG Ramachandran Central Railway Station. His life was dedicated to the service of the poor."Taking a journey down memory lane, Modi said once he used to take a narrow-gauge train, which was so slow that one could get off the train at any time and then again ride the train. "If you walk along with the train, sometimes you will be faster. I used to enjoy this too when I was a regular passenger; I spent a lot of time at Narmada for a considerable period of my life. That line is being converted into broad gauge now," he said.Terming the railways' modernisation projects taken up in the last few years as 'significant', PM Modi said, "After Independence, the railways worked only to update the older system. Hence modernisation work was not taken up."The new trains will connect Varanasi, Dadar, Ahmedabad, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Reqa, Chennai, Pratap Nagar to Kevadiya. Apart from these, PM Modi on Sunday inaugurated several other railway projects in Kevadiya, including Dabhoi-Chandid gauge converted broad gauge rail line, Chandod-Kevadita new broad gauge rail line, Pratapnagar-Kevadiya newly electrified section, new station buildings of Dabhoi Junction, Chandod and Kevadiya.Jan Shatabdi Express between Ahmedabad and Kevadia will have Vistadome coaches.Railways minister Piyush Goyal congratulated PM Modi on the beginning of the vaccination drive and said PM Modi's leadership has added speed to India's development."For us, the Statue of Unity is not just a statue. It symbolises unity and the new trains will connect Kevadia to all corners of the country," Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said adding that the new projects will also help uplift the lives of the tribals living in Kevadia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-flags-off-new-trains-to-kevadia-mgr-statue-of-unity-101610861819192.html

17-01-2021||India||Opposition clamour to investigate Arnab Goswami’s leaked chats grows||Opposition party leaders are demanding a high-level probe into journalist Arnab Goswami’s alleged leaked chats, suggesting it pointed to collusion and leak of classified security information. The official channels of the Bharatiya Janata Party, however, have so far remained silent on the issue.The latest salvo against Goswami came on Sunday morning from former Union minister P. Chidambaram and Congress party MP Manish Tiwari, with the latter calling for a joint parliamentary committee probe into the issue. “If what a section of Media is reporting is correct then it points towards a direct linkage between Balakot air strikes and 2019 General elections. Was National Security milked for electoral purposes? Needs a JPC investigation,” Tiwari wrote on Twitter.Tiwari told Hindustan Times that while one's private chats should not be investigated, Goswami's were a matter of public record in a court of law. "If there is any linkage between the strike and the elections, it must be investigated," he said.Chidambaram tagged defence minister Rajnath Singh on the issue. "Did a journalist (and his friend) know about the retaliatory strike on Balakot camp three days before the actual strike? If yes, what is the guarantee that their ‘source’ did not share the information with others as well, including spies or informers working for Pakistan? How did a “For Your Eyes Only” decision find its way to the government-supporting journalist? @rajnathsingh," he said.Even Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra has raised the issue. “Nation Needs to Know: Transcript of WhatsApp chats shows clearly government gave prior information about both Balakot strikes & abolishing Article 370 to TV anchor,” she tweeted. “What is going on? Am I the only one who thinks ModiShah owe us answers?”An over 500-page long transcript of a purported WhatsApp conversation between Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) CEO, Partho Dasgupta, went viral earlier this week, inviting allegations of collusion and illegal access to highly classified information.Some Congress leaders are advocating that the issue is taken up in a big way. Party leaders, on the condition of anonymity, told Hindustan Times that the issue was discussed in the Congress’ Lok Sabha MP group, but generated a lukewarm response. Leaders familiar with the matter said that the issue was raised by Congress Lok Sabha MP Karti Chidambaram Friday evening.“The party must demand answers from the BJP,” a party leader said on the condition of anonymity. “This is not the time to soft-pedal the issue.”The Congress has not officially taken up the issue yet but party functionaries say they are studying the documents closely and will respond in time.Senior party leaders such as Jairam Ramesh, Jitendra Singh, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Karti Chidambaram posted publicly about the issue on Saturday.“Does the @BJP4India have any comments on the #ArnabGate chat details, or is it too trivial to merit a response?,” Karti wrote on Twitter.“Arnab's chats dated 23.02.2019 refer to sharing of Intel re: action along the Pak border. It means someone very senior in Govt is leaking highly confidential info which may endanger the lives of our soldiers & so that mercenary considerations can add to TRPs,” Singhvi said.Jairam Ramesh added that BARC was aiding “weapons of mass destruction”. “Since 1967 BARC has stood for Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. Thanks to Arnab Goswami, another self-styled BARC —Broadcast Audience Research Council is in news now. The first BARC built a strong & scientific India. The other BARC is aiding & abetting weapons of mass disinformation,” he posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-clamour-to-investigate-arnab-goswami-s-leaked-chats-grows-101610861105800.html
17-01-2021||India||Courts must be open to public scrutiny, criticism: Harish Salve||Senior Supreme Court lawyer Harish Salve has said courts must be open to public scrutiny and criticism as "institutions of governance".Addressing a lecture organised in Ahmedabad through video-conference on Saturday, Salve said criticism of judges, judicial overreach and the manner of functioning is not scandalising courts, and the language in which such criticism is addressed should be treated with a grin."We today have accepted that judges, or rather courts, and especially constitutional courts, have become institutions of governance. As an institution of governance it must be open to public scrutiny and public criticism," he said."We have always accepted that the decisions of courts can be criticised, including in language which may be impolite. So the decisions can be criticised. Can we criticise the decision-making process? Why not?" Salve said.He was addressing the 16th Justice P D Desai Memorial Lecture on'Criticism of judiciary, contempt jurisdiction and its use in the age of social media'."Governance has to be under the sharp blaze of sunlight...in fact, I think a time may come when the Supreme Court may seriously consider a very large number of provisions of the Official Secrets Act, how far do they square with democracy," he said.Most of them have fallen into disuse, said Salve, who was last year appointed the Queen's Counsel for the courts of England and Wales.To say an institution has lost its independence, to say that an institution is acting at the behest of someone, to allege corruption--that, if it is established to be untrue, is clearly undermining public faith, Salve added."This residue of power to deal with those who are capable of influencing public opinion...you may be in public life, influencer."Those are cases where courts must retain with itself this slender jurisdiction of addressing any rupture in public faith which may be caused," he said.Salve further said "if we do need the principles of contempt, where do we draw the lines?"The lines must be drawn in a way that the overall system of governance--the institutions and the criticism of the institutions--helps everybody march forward in this march of democracy."There is one area where I think judges need to be protected. And that area is casting aspersions on an institution in consistent with its character as an independent institution," the former solicitor general of India said.He said courts need not pay heed to tweets by those who have nothing better to do but to sit with a mobile phone in their hands and pass judgments, specially on things which they do not understand.At the same time, criticism by a politician or those who can influence public opinion raises a different issue, he said.These are the cases "where the courts must retain with itself this slender jurisdiction of addressing any rupture in public faith which may be caused," he said.He also said the Bar must act against judges and courts being criticised, and must deal with ill-informed criticism as a part of the system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/courts-must-be-open-to-public-scrutiny-criticism-harish-salve-101610861282978.html

It is alleged that the Balmiki Samaj created a disturbance by giving speeches saying that the police are inactive. It is further alleged that the petitioner has said that the chief minister is a "man of thick skin". The FIR further disclosed that the petitioner had a criminal history and his arms licence had already been cancelled.The FIR was lodged against the petitioner on December 11, 2020, under sections 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code at Patiyali police station of Kasganj district.During the court proceedings, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that in a democratic country, agitation against a ruling party is the constitutional right of leaders of the opposition and, therefore, agitation of the petitioner, on the issue of rape of a girl of Balmiki Samaj cannot be termed as hatred or ill-will between followers of different religions. Hence, no offence under Section 153B and Section 505 IPC is made out.While observing that “the matter requires consideration”, the court stayed the arrest of the petitioner but made it clear that it has not stayed the investigation, hence it would go on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-relief-to-man-accused-of-name-calling-cm-101610860870976.html

The government is giving us 'tarikh pe tarikh' and are dragging things so that we get tired and leave the place. This is their conspiracy," said Hannan Mollah, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS).Nine rounds have taken place to resolve the deadlock between the farmers and the government, but no resolution has come out yet. While the farmers want repeal of the law, the government has categorically ruled that out and want farmers to suggest amendments to the existing laws which can be discussed.Mollah had said on Saturday that the protesters have never said no to dialogue but did not have much hope as the intention of the government is "anti-farmer"."If the government wants to engage in further dialogue, we will go. But, we don't have much hope. The intention of the government is anti-farmer, negative and there is a mindset to cater to the corporates. Our issue will not be settled by amendments. We are against the objectives of the laws," he had said.Rashtriya Kisan Manch Shekhar Dixit said on Saturday that the government is giving "step-motherly treatment" to the protesting farmers."Step-motherly treatment being given to farmers may become counterproductive as the farmers know how to withdraw support to the BJP-led government," he said while talking to reporters.Thousands of farmers have been protesting near Delhi against three farm laws since late November and have held nine rounds of talks with the government so far.

Our prime ministers speak regularly and Prime Minister Johnson has said he will visit India ahead of the G7,” the statement said.Prime ministers and presidents from the world’s leading democracies will come together in the UK to address shared challenges, from beating Coronavirus and tackling climate change, to ensuring that people everywhere can benefit from open trade, technological change and scientific discovery.The G7 – made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the European Union – is the only forum where the world’s most influential and open societies and advanced economies are brought together for close-knit discussions.The UK invited the leaders of India, Australia and South Korea to attend as guest countries to “deepen the expertise and experience around the table”, the statement said.The invitation to India, Australia and South Korea is also “testament to the UK’s commitment to ensuring multilateral institutions better reflect today’s world”, it said.The UK was the first P5 member to support a permanent UN Security Council seat for India and the first G7 member to invite India to a G7 Summit in 2005. As the current president of Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) forum and G20 president in 2023, “India will play a key role driving in multilateral cooperation helping to build back better around the world”, the statement said.Johnson plans to use the G7 Summit to intensify cooperation between the world’s democratic and technologically advanced nations. Between them, the 10 leaders represent more than 60% of the people living in democracies around the world.The UK will also host several meetings throughout the year between government ministers from the G7, both virtually and in different locations across Britain. These meetings will cover economic, environmental, health, trade, technology, development and foreign policy issues.Johnson said: “As the most prominent grouping of democratic countries, the G7 has long been the catalyst for decisive international action to tackle the greatest challenges we face. From cancelling developing world debt to our universal condemnation of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the world has looked to the G7 to apply our shared values and diplomatic might to create a more open and prosperous planet.“Coronavirus is doubtless the most destructive force we have seen for generations and the greatest test of the modern world order we have experienced. It is only right that we approach the challenge of building back better by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future,” he added.This is a crucial year of international leadership for the UK. In addition to the G7 Summit, during February, Britain will assume the presidency of the UN Security Council, and later this year, it will host COP26 in Glasgow and a global education conference aimed at getting children in the developing world into school.Johnson was invited as the chief to this year’s Republic Day celebrations but cancelled his visit recently in order to stay at home to oversee Britain’s response to a surge in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-invites-pm-narendra-modi-to-attend-g7-summit-101610857012527.html

If you exhaust all these categories, it means there are no farmers among the thousands of protesters. If there are no farmers, why is the government talking to them?"However, he had welcomed Supreme Court's intervention in the matter and said, 'the concern expressed by the Supreme Court over the farmer's protest is justified and the decision to form Committee to help find a solution is well-intentioned.The farmer protest has been going on since August 9 between farmers and the centre regarding three farm acts that were passed in September 2020.

They were administered the vaccine at the Child PGI in Noida Sector 30 in the presence of District Magistrate (DM) Suhas L Y and Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Deepak Ohri, according to an official statement.The DM handed over a vaccination card to Shamim, who will get the follow-up dose of the vaccine after 28 days, according to the guidelines.BJP MP Sharma, who is also a doctor, got vaccinated at his Kailash Hospital in Noida Sector 27 at 11 am, hospital spokesperson V B Joshi told PTI.The 61-year-old former Union minister was kept in observation for 30 minutes at the hospital after he was inoculated, Joshi said."The beginning of the end for Covid-19 has started today with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching the world's largest vaccination programme. As a doctor, I have also got vaccinated for the coronavirus. I am feeling absolutely fine. The vaccine is completely safe and all of you should get vaccinated," Sharma said in a tweet in Hindi.The vaccination drive started in Gautam Buddh Nagar at six centres across Noida and Greater Noida, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, District Immunisation Officer, told PTI.The centres earmarked for the purpose were the Child PGI in Sector 30, the Kailash Hospital in Sector 27, the CHCs at Bhangel and Bisrakh, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and the Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida.While the target was to inoculate 600 healthcare workers, 393 were vaccinated on the first day, the CMO said.Gautam Buddh Nagar has received 28,840 doses of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), for the first round of vaccination, according to officials.The DM said it was "a historic day" and lauded the role of the frontline workers, including health department officials, for their service on a "war-footing" over the last one year to help people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/393-health-workers-vaccinated-in-noida-mahesh-sharma-among-first-mps-to-get-jab-101610840780158.html
17-01-2021||India||Laws for self-regulation of news, OTT platforms on anvil||India is planning to draft and legislate an overarching statute for OTT (over the top) platforms and news websites that will define a framework for their self-regulation, and address the issues of sensitive content and fake news — a move that is aimed at creating a level playing field in the business.There are at least 40 OTT platforms including global ones such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and HotStar (Disney Plus) and hundreds of news content websites. While news on sensitive content on some of the larger OTT platforms makes the headlines — Netflix’s Sacred Games and A Suitable Boy have both come under fire from various groups — a bunch of home-grown platforms that largely air soft-porn have managed to stay under the radar.According to government officials familiar with the matter, the issue of self-regulation in digital media was taken up at the highest levels this month and ministry of Information and Broadcasting has decided to frame an overarching statute under which digital media can regulate itself.HT learns that this could be on two dimensions. One, the creation of a self-regulating body, such as the Press Council of India, according to one of the officials, who asked not to be named. Two, a law; “TV channels are broadly regulated under The Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, the digital media which has been unregulated till now, will soon has an overarching regulation.”OTT platforms in India reach around 40 million customers and make up a market worth around Rs.3000 crore.Conscious about not trampling on any freedoms, the I and B Ministry has been talking to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, which speaks on behalf of OTT platforms, for more than a year on self-regulation. An initial self-regulation framework suggested by the body has been rejected, government officials said, because it favoured the OTT companies.The ministry is also worried that viewers upset with content on OTT platforms do not have a body they can appeal to — much like they do with TV companies.The ministry, the officials added, has received complaints about language and nudity.As for digital news websites, the officials said the ministry has received complaints about fake news, but again, is handicapped by the absence of a body that can take these up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/laws-for-self-regulation-of-news-ott-platforms-on-anvil-101610835914795.html
17-01-2021||India||PM Modi targets Pakistan for Covid-19 crisis management||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday took a veiled dig at Pakistan as he inaugurated the country’s Covid-19 vaccination drive.Recounting India’s journey through the Covid-19-induced lockdown and the process of evacuating millions of Indians stranded abroad, the PM said, “When countries left their citizens stuck in China amid the pandemic, India stepped up. We evacuated not only Indians but also people from other countries under Vande Bharat Mission.”The PM’s remark was a veiled attack on Pakistan which had initially refused to airlift its people from China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. Authorities in Pakistan had cited “larger interests” to defend its decision to not evacuate Pakistani citizens who were working or studying in China when the Covid pandemic broke out.Reports Pakistani students appealing to Air India to evacuate them from Wuhan were widely circulated early last year.Pakistan repatriated 270 of its students from Wuhan in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-targets-pakistan-for-covid-19-crisis-management-101610835427609.html
17-01-2021||India||Over 3,000 personnel get Covid vaccine||The armed forces on Saturday kicked off the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccine drive at multiple locations across the country including Ladakh, Delhi, Mumbai and Visakhapatnam, where thousands of “Covid warriors”, including military doctors, nurses and paramedics were vaccinated against the coronavirus on a day India rolled out the biggest vaccination campaign in the world, officials familiar with the development said.No adverse events were reported on the opening day of the drive in the armed forces. In the army alone, a total of 3,129 health care workers were vaccinated on the first day, the officials said.While top priority is being given to Covid warriors who are at the at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, frontline soldiers including those deployed in the Ladakh theatre are among the military personnel who will get the vaccine ahead of others, the officials said. Other frontline soldiers, including naval personnel deployed on submarines, will also be administered the vaccine on priority.Military doctors, paramedics and frontline soldiers deployed in eastern Ladakh, where India and China are locked in a tense border standoff, will be among the set of armed forces personnel to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, Hindustan Times reported on Friday. More than 12,000 doses of the vaccine have reached Ladakh of which around 4,000 have been earmarked for armed forces personnel to protect them against Covid-19.“The vaccination drive has begun across India including Ladakh where military medical personnel were vaccinated today. Frontline soldiers will also be vaccinated soon,” one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.All earmarked military hospitals have been supplied with the first consignment of doses and the vaccination drive will gather momentum in the coming days, said a second official. Sepoy Sunil Das from the Army Medical Corps was the first one to receive the shot in Leh, he said.In Delhi, Covid warriors, including senior military doctors, received shots at the Army’s Base Hospital, Army Hospital (Research and Referral) and the Armed Forces Clinic, the Indian Army said on Twitter. The Base Hospital is the military’s largest Covid hospital.In Mumbai, the first phase of the vaccination drive was rolled out at the naval hospital Asvini with its commandant Rear Admiral Sheila Mathai receiving the first dose of vaccine, officials said. Other healthcare workers (HCWs) were also vaccinated against the disease.“A total of 100 HCWs including Medical Officers, Nursing & paramedical staff were vaccinated on Day 1. The session was concluded without any adverse events reported. The next phase will target frontline workers & personnel deployed on operational platforms,” the chief defence PRO in Mumbai said in a statement on Twitter.In Visakhapatnam, the Eastern Naval Command chief Vice Admiral Atul Kumar Jain launched the vaccination drive at the naval hospital Kalyani. The vaccine was given to 40 Covid warriors at the hospital, officials said.The vaccination campaign, marking the final phase in India’s long battle against the pandemic, will be held daily from 9am to 5pm, barring the days earmarked for routine immunisation programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-3-000-personnel-get-covid-vaccine-101610833540853.html
17-01-2021||India||‘Not the time to lower your guard’||Cardio thoracic surgeon Dr Jose Chacko Periappuram, 63, known for performing the first heart transplant surgery in Kerala, received the vaccine in an Ernakulam centre on Saturday, as India rolled out one of the world’s biggest Covid vaccination programme.At least 300 million people will receive one of two vaccines approved by the drugs regulatory authority for emergency use in India: Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech Ltd and Covishield, developed by Oxford-Astra Zeneca and manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune. Covaxin is in the third phase of the clinical trial and its efficacy results have still not been released.Periappuram, a Padma Shri recipient, received the shot at the Ernakulam government hospital, one of the 3,351 sites earmarked to vaccinate the recipients.“I am really proud of our scientists and health workers. Happy health workers were given the first preference,” he said.“It is just like any other vaccine or injection. There is no need of any apprehension or fear. I think doctors and health workers taking shot in the first phase will give confidence to others,” he said.Periappuram, who works in a private hospital in Ernakulam, heads a charitable organisation which helps heart patients who are unable to afford treatment.“It is a good beginning. But it is not the time to lower our guard,” he said. The government has warned recipients of the vaccine to continue to wear masks and practise physical distancing, as well as hand hygiene to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread before the second dose of the vaccine is given.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-the-time-to-lower-your-guard-101610832678504.html
17-01-2021||India||Vaccine drive held smoothly, no serious side effects: Govt||There were no serious side effects on the first day of the vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union health ministry said on Saturday, as India launched the world’s largest immunisation exercise that aims to vaccinate 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase.However, as opposed to the target of vaccinating about 300,000 people on the first day, according to the health ministry’s data, 191,181 health care workers were vaccinated at 3,351 centres. There were 16,755 personnel involved in the vaccination programme. Additionally, 3,429 people were vaccinated in defence institutions.Later in the day, an official at the AIIMS-Delhi said a security guard developed an allergic reaction after receiving Covid vaccine. “He is kept under observation of doctors at the hospital,” the official was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Some glitches were observed in the functioning of the Co-WIN app, the digital platform deployed for the drive, which the ministry said were resolved later. “Since this was the first day of the vaccination drive and it was our first real-time experience, there were observed some minor glitches that were resolved immediately,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, who is also the nodal officer at the ministry for vaccine delivery.The Serum Institute of India’s Covishield was supplied to all states and Union territories, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was supplied to 12 states and Union territories.A total of 11 states received Covishield and Covaxin both. The states that got both the vaccine supplies were Assam (65), Bihar (301), Delhi (81), Haryana (77), Karnataka (242), Maharashtra (285), Odisha (161), Rajasthan (167), Tamil Nadu (160), Telangana (140), and Uttar Pradesh (317).Union health minister Harsh Vardhan interacted with officials of the states and UTs through video conferencing to review the drive. “Today is a very important day for us. The vaccination drive, for which preparations were being done from the last five months under the unwavering and dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has finally started. We have got encouraging and satisfactory feedback results on the first day. This indicates that we are moving towards victory in the fight against coronavirus,” he said.“India has achieved significant progress on the COVID containment front. The cooperation of scientists, researchers, doctors and all the citizens who have volunteered for the clinical trial have ensured that we have two vaccines ready for administration in a span of 10 months,” he added.The minister also urged the states to make effective strategy to counter the myths and misinformation and use all communication channels to disseminate the right information. “We need to be vigilant against the rumours being spread on social media which are raising doubts in the mind of the public regarding the vaccine side effects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-held-smoothly-no-serious-side-effects-govt-101610832304145.html
17-01-2021||India||Experts warn against partial immunity, mutation risks||As India begins its Covid-19 vaccination drive, it must protect against leaving its population with partial or subpar immunity to the coronavirus that may ultimately risk triggering mutations, experts who have tracked the launch of immunisations in the US and the UK have said, advising careful focus on speed as well as accuracy.Viruses mutate due to what is known as selection pressure and – in addition to evolution within immunocompromised people — this could also happen in case of vaccines if the doses are given in a manner does not to lead to highest efficacy, or if they offer inadequate protection. “We know that the virus mutates... A subpar immune response may give immunological advantage to the virus and it may induce more genetic diversity within the virus,” said Maria Elena Bottazzi, the associate dean, National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, in an interview to HT.Bottazzi was speaking in the context of a debate in the US and the UK on whether to delay the second doses to ensure that vaccine inventories are used up to inoculate as many people as quickly possible – a strategy that may not be scientifically sound.India has decided not to follow this model, and to give the vaccine at the 28-day intervals recommended by the manufacturers. “Scientifically, it is very clear that you need the doses at the right time to really get a robust immune response with good neutralising antibodies. So if we don’t vaccinate people on time, they might end up with a subpar level of immune response and that could be complicating because we know the virus mutates,” Botazzi said.“I understand the anxiety of trying to have as many people vaccinated but I think it should be on the basis of how much inventory we have. Yes, vaccinate as many people as possible but you have to make sure that each individual has the required second dose.”A similar threat is also posed if the vaccines are not as effective. “A partially effective vaccine could drive the evolution of new variants, which would be a serious problem,” said John P Moore, leading virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine in an interview over email. Concerns over efficacy have surrounded one of the vaccines that India rolled out on Saturday since Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, is yet to reach the clinical trial threshold where it can be determined if and by how much the vaccine is able to offer protection from disease.At the time of its approval, authorities said that it is likely to be a better option in fighting mutations that have been seen in several countries since it uses a whole virion to train the body to recognise the pathogen, instead of just the Spike protein that most other vaccines mimic for an immune response. “There is no reason why an inactivated virus vaccine would automatically be superior to an adenovirus vector vaccine. Only data can show which is better,” said Moore, while adding that such remarks by administration members could be “based on the national origins of the vaccines”. “That has happened in the UK too, where the British government speaks very, very highly of the Oxford vaccine,” he added.The two experts also said that it is important to ensure that immunisation programmes avoid controversy that could fuel vaccine scepticism. For instance, the approval to a vaccine without efficacy data “was not a good idea”, according to Moore. “It would not happen in the US, or in Western Europe. The Russians and Chinese have done this. I don’t think it’s a good idea, as it could harm public confidence in what they are being asked to take,” he said.The concerns surfaced on Saturday, when at least two doctors groups – the Tamil Nadu doctors’ association and a group of doctors in Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia hospital – indicated they were reluctant to take Covaxin.Like Covaxin, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (called Covishield in India), dose also elicited some controversy after its trials were found to have been conducted with unplanned dosing and threw up varying efficacy numbers. However, both vaccines have in early clinical stages have proven safety and an ability to trigger an immune response.When they cleared the Oxford-AstraZeneca dose, regulators in UK said second doses can be delayed by up to 12 weeks in order to focus on reaching as many people as possible for first shots since even those can provide some immunity. The approach, however, was not part of clinical trials.The authorities were partly driven by the fast spread of the B.1.1.7 variant of the coronavirus (also known as VOC202012/01), which has been linked to higher infectivity. Following its discovery, several other variants have been found – some of which have raised fears that vaccines may be rendered obsolete.“We are concerned with any mutation that occurs in the spike or particularly in the RBD (receptor binding domain – the portion of the virus responsible for entering a host cell). There is initial data that is giving us optimism that some of this may not alter the ability of producing neutralising antibodies with the vaccines,” said Bottazzi, whose team at Baylor is also developing a DNA recombinant vaccine with Hyderabad-based Biological E. The vaccine candidate is in Phase I/II trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-warn-against-partial-immunity-mutation-risks-101610831529993.html
17-01-2021||India||PM Modi unveils ₹1k-cr fund for startups||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced the launch of Rs.1,000 crore-Startup India Seed Fund to provide capital to entrepreneurs for innovative business plans.“This fund will help in the launch of new start-ups and their growth,” the PM said at Prarambh, the startup India international summit jointly organised by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) and the industry. “India is one of the largest ecosystems in the world. Today, more than 41,000 startups are engaged in India and involved in different types of initiatives. Out of that more than 5,700 are engaged in IT sector, over 3,600 in health sector and about 1,700 in agriculture sector,” PM Modi said.Reacting to the announcement, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal tweeted, “India now has the 3rd largest Startup ecosystem in the world, with over 41,000 Govt recognised startups spread across 590 districts since the launch of ‘Startup India’ in 2016 by PM @NarendraModi ji.” The government will soon notify the scheme along with details such as eligibility criteria and interest rates, two government officials said requesting anonymity. “This is in addition to the Rs.10,000 crore Fund of Funds (FFS) for startups announced about five years ago,” one of the officials said.FFS, managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), was set up in 2016 with a total corpus of Rs.10,000 crore.As of December 1, 2020, SIDBI had committed Rs.4326.95 crore to 60 alternative investment funds (AIFs), which have raised a total corpus of Rs.31,598 crore, the first official said. FFS provides support for development and growth of innovation driven enterprises and startups facing the challenge of access to the risk capital. The two-day startup India international summit was inaugurated on Friday. It was also attended by Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-unveils-1k-cr-fund-for-startups-101610830530395.html
17-01-2021||India||Technical glitches with Co-WIN app: Process goes manual at several locations||Health care workers administering the Covid-19 vaccine in at least five states faced minor hurdles on the first day of India’s immunisation drive while Maharashtra suspended its campaign for two days due to technical glitches with the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) app that forms the backbone of the country’s immunisation plan.Due to difficulties in uploading data on the app, which has been developed by the central government to monitor and track the inoculation process, health care workers in some districts had to put up information about the vaccine recipients on the digital platform manually, according to people aware of the developments.The world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination programme was launched on Saturday in India with the aim to cover 300,000 recipients. Of these, 191,181 recipients were administered the first shot of the two-dose vaccines.The Co-WIN app is meant to facilitate real-time information of vaccine stocks, storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries, besides assisting programme managers across national, state, and district levels.Maharashtra’s state health department announced on Saturday that the vaccination campaign in the state will be temporarily suspended till Monday due to issues with the CoWIN app.The next session will be held on Tuesday, said a statement by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, after officials reported a slowdown in app functioning.In West Bengal, government officials said the app slowed down since Friday, and many health workers could not operate it or add information about vaccine recipients.“There were some technical glitches and the app had slowed since Friday. Not all messages were going to health workers who were supposed to receive the vaccine on Saturday morning. The persons concerned were individually called up and informed over phone,” said a senior official of the state health department.Issues were also reported in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand’s nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination Kuldeep Singh Martoliya said slowdown in the app was reported from multiple districts in the state. “Our technical team is looking into this,” he said.Health department officials from Rajasthan said that the CoWIN app was slow in some places in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Barmer districts, and a government official in Madhya Pradesh said glitches were reported from districts such as Morena, Indore and Seoni.According to the Union health ministry, Saturday’s issues were resolved quickly. “Since this was the first day of the vaccination drive and it was our first real-time experience, there were observed some minor glitches that were resolved immediately,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, who is also the nodal officer at the ministry for vaccine delivery.On Saturday, Odisha government officials said they will pause the vaccination drive for a day to observe beneficiaries who received the first dose.(With inputs from Mumbai, Dehradun, Kolkata, Bhopal and Jaipur,)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/process-goes-manual-at-several-locationstory-101610826824371.html
17-01-2021||India||Manish Kumar first to take shot in Delhi||While 34-year-old Manish Kumar, a sanitation worker at Delhi’s AIIMS, was vying to be among the first to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, his mother, Laxmi Rani, was dead against it. She didn’t want him to even be in the first batch to receive the jab. She even offered to trade places with him, given that she is employed as a sanitation worker at the same hospital.But in the end, Rani relented. At 11.10am on Saturday, Kumar became the first resident of the national capital to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease.Kumar on Saturday emerged as the face of a months-long global effort against time to develop an inoculation against the infection that has killed over two million people. He said he always believed in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.“I have narrated my experience to over 50 journalists so far. Do you see any adverse impact on me?”Kumar said it wasn’t a coincidence that he was a part of the first batch of frontline staffers at the premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to be vaccinated, all of whom received a jab of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.“When I found out that members of my team were to be vaccinated, I volunteered to be on that list. My immediate supervisor wasn’t very excited about my confidence, but I wanted to serve as an example to my family and colleagues,” said Kumar, who has been a machine operator in AIIMS’ sanitation department for eight years now.And when Kumar received a confirmatory text message on Friday, he approached his boss once again, with another request. “I urged my supervisor to let me be the first person from AIIMS to receive the vaccine, though I didn’t think I would be obliged,” he said.Among those he encouraged to take the vaccine shot was his childhood friend Shaukat Ali, also a sanitation worker at the hospital. “I have had three surgeries and was very scared to take the vaccine,” Ali said, even as he stood on his toes to record a video of Kumar getting the jab.In fact, like Laxmi Rani, Ali too urged him against taking the shot till as late as 9am on Saturday, for fear of any potential adverse effects. But like Laxmi Rani, Ali relented too.“I told him to watch me receive the vaccine and get inspired,” said Kumar.Early on Saturday, Ali became one of the recipients of the Covid-19 vaccine as well.Kumar said he hid the vaccination plan from his family till Wednesday, when his announcement met with mixed responses.Apart from his mother, his wife also took some cajoling to give in to his plan. “Eventually, she said she would stand on the sidelines and watch me receive the vaccine,” said Kumar. However, they changed their minds later, and decided she would worry too much if she came to the vaccination centre.Kumar’s Saturday began like any other working day over the past eight years. He caught a bus from Najafagarh, where he lives with his family, and arrived at AIIMS for the vaccination, as well as his regular duties.He didn’t know that within hours though, he would be making news and even trending on Twitter.His mother, too, was unaware of the fanfare that would eventually surround his vaccination. While Kumar was flanked by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, his mother continued with her housekeeping work at the hospital.Kumar kept himself masked while he was administered a dose of Covaxin, even as the gathering around him cheered. Soon after, he was whisked away to a room, away from the media’s glare and questions.“There were three doctors around me for 30 minutes after the injection. They kept asking me about any reactions I might have been having.”He was confident the vaccine was safe. But, he said, he knew the media’s glare would keep him in good stead.“I knew the media was there. The Prime Minister was live just minutes before my vaccination. And the health minister was by my side. Even if a problem were to occur, they would ensure I was taken care of.”He said him volunteering to be among the first to get the jab should dispel fears about the vaccine. “There are rumours on social media about the vaccine. I am fortunate to play a part in dispelling those rumours. There are no rashes on my body, no nausea, no pain, nothing.”Despite Kumar and his mother working at AIIMS, and more relatives working at different hospitals in the city, neither he, nor anyone in his family, was touched by the virus. “But the fear of the virus was always there. We had witnessed deaths by this disease,” said Kumar.Now, Kumar will go back to his daily duties at the hospital, even as several more get vaccinated there, as in the rest of the country. He will be back for the second and final dose of the vaccine 28 days later, at which point, doctors said, he can breathe easy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manish-kumar-first-to-take-shot-in-delhi-101610826383493.html
17-01-2021||India||Concerns over Covaxin as some cite ‘lack of data’||Doctors from a prominent Delhi hospital and Tamil Nadu raised concerns over being administered the homegrown vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech as the nationwide vaccination programme kicked off on Saturday.The Bharat Biotech vaccine, called Covaxin, is currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials, which are crucial to determining the efficacy of the shot. India’s drug regulator gave emergency authorisation to the vaccine — along with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India — on January 3The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi on Saturday requested the medical superintendent of the facility to administer SII’s coronavirus vaccine, Covishield, amid apprehensions about Covaxin.The resident doctors were “a bit apprehensive” about Covaxin and may not participate in the immunisation drive in large numbers, the association said in a letter.“We have come to know that the COVID-19 vaccination drive is being conducted by the hospital today. Covaxin manufactured by Bharat Biotech is being preferred in our hospital over Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute.“The residents are a bit apprehensive about the lack of complete trial in case of Covaxin and might not participate in huge numbers thus defeating the purpose of vaccination. We request you to vaccinate us with Covishield, which has completed all stages of trial before its roll-out,” the letter stated.The controversy escalated during the day as reports said those receiving Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin were asked to sign consent forms before being inoculated because the jab had been allowed by the government in “clinical trial mode”.“...the clinical efficacy of COVAXIN is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trial,” said the form.Spokesperson for Bharat Biotech said the company was misquoted and that they never claimed they would compensate all Covaxin recipients for any adverse reactions.However, under the clinical trial mode condition, the screening and consent form mentions that in case of any adverse events or serious adverse events, recipients will be provided medically recognised standard of care in the government designated and authorised centres/hospitals.“The compensation for serious adverse event will be paid by sponsor (BBIL) if the serious adverse event is proven to be causally related to the vaccine,” said the form.No comments were made on the reports that many doctors expressed apprehension about taking the Covaxin shot.“No comments from the company on this,” said a Bharat Biotech spokesperson.The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) also reportedly recommended its members to get vaccinated, but preferably with the Covishield shot.“There was some hesitation among the doctors in receiving the vaccine, but if I did not believe that the vaccine was safe why would I take it. I will speak to the doctors and try to allay concerns,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, where 31 people were vaccinated and some resident doctors asked the hospital for Covishield vaccine.Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College said: “Vaccine hesitancy had a major role to play when it came to the low vaccination rate on Saturday. Many people were comparing the two vaccines, many people wanted to wait and see what happens, and others wondered whether they needed it, having recovered from the infection recently. When people were asked to sign the consent forms, that also led to a lot of anxiety. But, with no major adverse events reported, I think more people will come forward in coming days.”Urging people to have faith in India’s researchers, scientists and regulatory authorities, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Singh Guleria reassured the nation that Covaxin was safe.Dr Guleria along with NITI Aayog member VK Paul were administered the Covid-19 vaccine shot at AIIMS Delhi on the inaugural day of the nationwide roll-out of vaccination. Paul, too, said Covaxin was safe to be administered.Bharat Biotech has received a government purchase order for the supply of 5.5 million doses of Covaxin. In Tamil Nadu, 99 people received the Covaxin shot, and in Delhi at least 152 health care workers received Covaxin shot, on Saturday.According to Union health ministry, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield was supplied to all states and Union Territories, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was supplied to 12 States and Union Territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-covaxin-as-some-cite-lack-of-data-101610825998981.html
17-01-2021||India||Shielded and vaccinated: India begins mammoth immunisation drive||Doctors, paramedics and hospital workers — who for most part of 2020 were on the frontlines of the battle against the rampaging coronavirus, often ceaselessly even when they saw their colleagues fall — became the first to receive Sars-Cov-2 vaccines as India kicked off a colossal immunisation campaign on Saturday.Between 10.30am, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the exercise with an address to the nation, and late evening, roughly 191,181 people received doses at 3,351 vaccination sites, preliminary data by the Union health ministry showed.According to data compiled from states by HT, 200,297 people were vaccinated. The number was shy of the 300,000 that was being estimated but still far higher than what was recorded by any country on its first day.“We are launching the world’s biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,” Modi said in his address, imploring citizens to keep their guard up and not believe any “rumors about the safety of the vaccines.”Modi also described India’s vaccine allotment formula as humanitarian and recounted the time when the outbreak was peaking in India. “As much as we think about those days, we become sad. But in those days of crisis there were people who put their lives in danger to save us: our doctors, nurses, paramedic, ambulance drivers, police, ASHA, and other frontline workers. They gave priority to their duties. Many of them stayed away from their families didn’t go home. There are many friends who will never return home. They sacrificed their lives to save us,” Modi said, before adding that these have been prioritised.Among those who got doses on Saturday, there were no serious side effects requiring hospitalisation, Union health ministry said. In all, there were 16,755 personnel involved in the immunisations on Saturday.Authorities hope to give shots to 300 million people, roughly the population of the US, by the end of summer.The recipients include 30 million doctors, nurses and other frontline workers such as police and firefighters, who will be followed by 270 million others, who are either aged over 50 or have illnesses that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.The drive began simultaneously across dedicated vaccination centres set up across the country, where doses of Covishield – the manufactured-in-India version of UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – and indigenously developed Covaxin were administered to people. In Delhi, the first person to receive a dose was All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) cleaning staff Manish Kumar. “I wanted to serve as an example to my family and colleagues,” said Kumar, minutes after he received Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin shot, flanked by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and AIIMS director Randeep Guleria.Staff who were vaccinating people used a mobile phone app called Co-WIN where they fed in preset lists of people and updated their vaccination status – records that will be crucial since these people will require their second doses in four week’s time.Staff in several states reported glitches in using the tool, but the health ministry said these were addressed soon. “Since this was the first day of the vaccination drive and it was our first real-time experience, there were observed some minor glitches that were resolved immediately,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, who is also the nodal officer at the ministry for vaccine delivery.Ironing out issues identified on Saturday will be crucial before vaccinations resume next week. Till Saturday, almost 17 million doses of vaccines have been delivered to states and experts believe the clock is ticking as the world faces threats of new variants of the coronavirus that could make the pandemic harder to control, like B.1.1.7 first identified in UK, and mutation spreading in Brazil that is feared to make existing immunity in those who have recovered from the disease and even those who have gotten doses less effective.In wealthy countries including the United States, Britain, Israel, Canada and Germany, millions of citizens have already been given some measure of protection with at least one dose of vaccine developed with revolutionary speed and quickly authorised for use.India is second to the US with 10.5 million confirmed cases, and ranks third in the number of deaths, behind the US and Brazil, with 152,000. Over 35 million doses of various Covid-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World In Data’s vaccination tracker.Experts said the exercise will need India to build on its massive immunisation infrastructure. “To be able to effectively reach the target population for vaccinating people of this scale, India needed to utilize its existing national immunization network, including the infrastructure (production, storage, transport, delivery facilities) as well as the human resources (vaccinators, supervisors, etc),” said Anant Bhan, researcher, global health, health policy and bioethics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shielded-and-vaccinated-india-begins-mammoth-immunisation-drive-101610820997898.html
17-01-2021||India||Nation receives a shot in the arm||From frontline army camps in Ladakh to sparse primary health care centres in the rural heartland, loud applause and cheers rang out in vaccination sites across the country on Saturday as roughly 190,000 frontline workers were inoculated against Covid-19 in what is billed to be the world’s biggest immunisation programme.The workers were administered shots of either the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, made by Serum Institute of India (SII) and locally known as Covishield, or the Bharat Biotech-manufactured Covaxin. They will need to return for the second dose in 28 days. “This is a historic day. Every heath worker has given their hundred percent during this pandemic. Today we are happiest,” said Tulsa Tandi, a 51-year-old sanitation worker who was the first person to get the vaccine shot in Chhattisgarh.Union Health ministry figures showed that roughly 191,181 people received doses at 3,351 sites. This was short of the 300,000-plus target but still well above numbers recorded by any other country on the first day of inoculation.Among the first to receive the vaccine in various states included sanitation worker Saroj Bala in Haryana’s Panchkula, Dr Sudhir Bhandari in Jaipur, primary health care centre medical officer Mridul Das in Tripura, and hospital security guard Haridev Yadav in Bhopal. Vaccination rooms were decorated with flowers and balloons, the first beneficiaries were welcomed with ‘aarti’, garlands and sweets, and people posed with victory signs after receiving the shots as a sense of hope prevailed over the months of anxiety and uncertainty. Sweets and gift hampers were offered to people in several places. “I was a bit tense before the vaccination. But, now I am feeling good. People can trust the vaccine,” said Das.Yadav said he felt lucky to get vaccinated. “When I was asked on Thursday morning, I said yes without thinking twice,” said Yadav, a contractual employee who is the sole bread-earner for a family of four.Many people said family members tried to dissuade them due to fears of side effects, but added that they went ahead to dispel rumours, especially in rural areas. “I am very happy. I felt no trouble and no side effects after the vaccination. I am going to join duty for the rest of the day,” said 29-year-old Mariyam Guria, a sanitation worker in Ranchi’s Sadar Hospital who was Jharkhand’s first person to get the vaccine.Across India, a common protocol was followed. Officials verified a beneficiary’s identity before allowing him/her into the room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nation-receives-a-shot-in-the-arm-101610823320163.html
17-01-2021||India||Razdan furnishes details of hiring fraud||Former NDTV anchor Nidhi Razdan on Saturday provided a detailed account of an elaborate online fraud that prompted her to resign from her job and accept a non-existent teaching position at Harvard University in the United States but the journalist’s blog left some unanswered questions about the alleged scam.In a blog on her former channel, Razdan said she was invited in November 2019 to speak at an event by the Harvard Kennedy School, the public policy institute of Harvard University, and one of the alleged organisers separately told her of a teaching vacancy. “A few weeks later I was ‘interviewed’ online for 90 minutes. It all seemed legitimate, the questions were thorough and professional,” she wrote.Razdan said she googled and found a journalism degree programme offered by the Harvard Extension School. “Contrary to what many are tweeting, Harvard has a school called the Extension School offering a Journalism Degree Programme. The actual programme is called the Master of Liberal Arts, Journalism degree. The Extension School lists 500 faculty of whom 17 are categorised as journalism faculty. A number of these people are working journalists. I believed I fit this profile.”On Friday, Joshua Benton, a former journalist who founded the university’s news website, Nieman Lab, had said there was no journalism department or journalism professors at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. “She (Razdan) was apparently under the impression she was joining the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), which is the main faculty [for Harvard College and the Graduate School]. FAS definitely doesn’t have any journalism professors or offer any journalism degree,” he tweeted.Razdan said in January last year, she got an email from an “alleged Harvard human resources person” from what appeared to be an official Harvard email ID, with an offer letter and agreement.“The offer letter and the agreement appeared to be on a genuine letterhead with the University insignia, and contained the “signatures” of all senior Harvard University officials who actually do hold those positions even today,” she wrote. The unidentified people separately emailed her employers at NDTV and others for recommendation letters. Razdan said no one at NDTV thought anything was amiss.Later, her former colleague Sonia Singh said she gave Razdan a recommendation. “I gave Nidhi a recommendation as well and received an extremely genuine seeming university link to upload this,” Singh tweeted. It was unclear whether any questions were raised at the lack of a formal interview or her apparent lack of academic qualifications or publishing to be recruited as an associate professor. In June 2020, Razdan quit NDTV.“I had been told a work visa had been issued in the US for me which would be sent to me only when travel was required. I would have also needed a visa from Delhi but it never reached that stage since no travel was on the cards immediately,” she said.Work visas are usually issued by the consulate in the applicant’s home country and need the applicant’s passport. There was no clarity whether Razdan submitted her passport for the visa procedure, or how a work visa could be issued in the US without her visiting the country, or in the absence of a genuine job offer, or communication to the embassy confirming the same from Harvard.In December, Razdan said she wrote to the head of human resources at the university but didn’t hear back. In January, she said she wrote to the office of the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “It was only earlier this week that I heard back from them telling me there was no record of my appointment and that the people claiming to be their HR staff do not exist!” It was not clear why Razdan waited until December to communicate officially with Harvard, or why official insignia and designation of the university was used in events and conclaves attended by the journalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/razdan-furnishes-details-of-hiring-fraud-101610822822826.html
17-01-2021||India||BMC begins mass inoculation as healthcare workers queue up for first vaccine jab||Almost ten months after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, a glimmer of hope hung over designated hospitals on Saturday morning as officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began the nationwide mass inoculation programme.At around 8.30am, as the ‘Vaccine Van’ carrying 500 units of Covishield made its way into Cooper Hospital at Vile Parle, staffers clapped for the vaccine carriers with the hospital’s nursing staff holding 'arti thalis’ and sweets as a welcome gesture. After the vaccines were unloaded, they distributed sweets and cheered..All ten vaccination centres across the city sported colourful curtains and were decorated with flowers. Some centres at BYL Nair hospital and Covid-19 jumbo centre at Bandra Kurla Complex also placed selfie spots with ‘I got my Covid-19 vaccine’ message in the backdrop.Wearing masks, hundreds of healthcare workers (HCWs) – some anxious, others impatient – queued up to get their first vaccine shots. Though BMC had placed a target of vaccinating 4,000 HCWs on the first day, around 48.15% healthcare workers received the vaccines.Despite last minute delays in informing registered HCWs about the timing and place of the vaccination, 1,926 HCWs including doctors, nurses, ASHA and anganwadi workers reached the centres.After a low turnout in the first few hours, footfall of HCWs started increasing post noon. Many senior HCWs above 80 years also visited vaccination centres to get their first shot. Dr Devadhvala Dilnazj, 75, a retired anaesthetic reached BYL Nair Hospital by 9.30 am and was the first to take the vaccine shot at the hospital.Beneficiaries were asked to show their identity card mainly PAN card following which they were given token numbers. Later, they were asked to wait in the waiting areas and were called for vaccination according to the number. However, this led to overcrowding and social distancing was compromised. The beneficiaries were forced to wait in a long queue at vaccination centres like Dr RN Cooper, Shatabdi hospitals and BKC jumbo centre.Though no case of adverse effects was reported, some beneficiaries reported dizziness after taking the vaccine and were immediately taken to the ‘adverse reaction’ room where they rested. But soon, they were stabilized and sent back home.At Sion Hospital, before starting the vaccination programme, dean Dr Mohan Joshi gave an emotional and inspirational lecture to staffers about their journey in the last ten months. He thanked all medical staffers for their tireless contribution during the pandemic.“Since it was the first day of vaccination, some centres reported crowding but the system will be gradually channelized better to stop the gathering of beneficiaries,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-begins-mass-inoculation-as-healthcare-workers-queue-up-for-first-vaccine-jab-101610822116856.html
17-01-2021||India||Farmer union seeks removal of 3 committee members alleging bias, appeals to SC||In a vote of no confidence against the Supreme Court-appointed four-member Committee to resolve farmers’ concerns over the three farm laws, one of the protesting farmers' groups has asked the Supreme Court to remove the three members who remain in the Committee after one of the members, Bhupinder Singh Mann refused to be part of the Committee proceedings.The demand was raised by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), Lokshakti in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on Saturday alleging bias against the three members in favour of the farm laws. The affidavit came in response to an application moved by the Delhi Police seeking a stay on any disruption of the Republic Day proceedings by the protesting farmer unions. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had issued notice on this application last Tuesday and posted the same for hearing on January 18.In its response, BKU-Lokshakti through its advocate AP Singh told the Court that the Delhi Police application was unnecessary as Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code is already in place in central Delhi which restricts gathering of five or more persons.The affidavit then proceeded to address its concerns over the composition of the Committee. It said, “The principle of natural justice is going to get violated by forming these persons as members of the Committee. Members appointed by the Supreme Court, how they will hear all the farmers on equal parameters when they have already supported these three farm Law.” Instead, the farmer union has requested appointment of a former Supreme Court judge along with farm leaders of protesting farmer unions.The Court had on January 12 formed a four-member Committee to hear out the protesting farmers and submit a report to the Court after eight weeks. The members were Bhupinder Singh Mann (National President, BKU and All India Kisan Coordination Committee), Pramod Kumar Joshi (Agricultural Economist, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute), Ashok Gulati, Agricultural Economist and Former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President, Shetkari Sanghatana. The Committee was to hold its first sitting by January 22. The Court directed the Committee to listen to the grievances of the farmers on the farm laws as also the views of the Government and make recommendations.Two days later, Mann refused to join the Committee proceedings in solidarity with the farmer protests leaving just three members. The response by BKU-Lokshakti referred to news clippings where the three members had openly supported the farm laws and criticized protesting farmers of being misled by political parties.“When all committee members appointed by the Supreme Court are already in favour of these three farm laws and already support the laws made and passed by the Central government without enough discussion with farmers, then how can they make fair report without any bias before the Court,” the BKU-Lokshakti said.The union requested the Court to “remove all three members from the committee” and appoint persons who would prepare the report on basis of “mutual harmony” and who can “think about the interest of farmers with impartiality, trust and goodwill.” The union requested the Court to appoint independent, impartial persons such as former Supreme Court judge and include within the Committee the President of BKU-Lokshakti among other farmers’ organization leaders participating in the protests.The apex court on Tuesday had stayed the implementation of the three laws in question, namely Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.While passing the order, the bench, also comprising of Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “While we may not stifle a peaceful protest, we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-union-seeks-removal-of-3-committee-members-alleging-bias-appeals-to-sc-101610821563534.html

17-01-2021||Today's||India must lead in regulating Big Tech||It’s obvious now. The internet, once the promised land of free and open interactions for all, is now controlled by a few gigantic technology companies — often referred to as Big Tech. These companies include Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Paypal, and some others.Efforts to rein in the fast-growing power of these platforms has waxed and waned over the last few years. As a result, we have allowed media and economic power to be consolidated stealthily into the hands of a few Big Tech firms. But recent events in the United States (US), when these same companies shut down a sitting US president, without due process, have alerted us to their unchecked power.We are all ardent users of Big Tech goods and services. Big Tech companies provide citizens powerful platforms to transact, express themselves, seek out information, and consume entertainment. Social media has democratised communications, weakening the power of traditional media gatekeepers and breaking the hold of prima donna editors who long held unchallenged power to influence public opinion. Big Tech has brought us doorstep delivery of an extraordinary range of goods, services, and entertainment. It would be no exaggeration to say that it is Big Tech that enabled us to conduct our lives near-normally through the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, modern life would not be possible without Big Tech.While providing us these benefits, Big Tech has also been accumulating vast, unregulated powers. For instance, social media platforms have the power to shape narratives and, therefore, incite public behaviour. When used by bad actors, social media platforms become a dangerous force multiplier for fomenting hate and violence. Conversely, these platforms also have the power to silence opinions by playing the role of censor and publisher. But this power is firmly in the hands of Big Tech barons with no corresponding accountability and compliance requirements.Similarly, e-commerce platforms have the ability to make or break millions of small merchants. Their pricing and promotion decisions can be managed subtly to favour some merchants and their own private label products. Once platforms start certain promotional schemes, their financial clout and consumer knowledge make it impossible for other retailers to compete. Big Tech companies have also been avid acquirers of smaller, fast-growing companies — thereby snuffing out competition before it gets a chance to establish itself.Big Tech firms have acquired extraordinary amounts of data on individuals. How we browse, what goods we covet, where we shop, what shows we watch, what music we listen to, where we travel, who our friends are, who we follow — all this information is now sitting in vast server farms around the world. At a click, Big Tech barons can summon up this information and sell it to whoever they want. Moreover, this transaction happens outside the country beyond the reach of our tax authorities. So Big Tech takes full advantage of a country’s prosperity yet makes limited tax contributions.As Big Tech has become pervasive, its conduct has to be evaluated across multiple dimensions. First, are markets contestable and fair? Big Tech often engages in competitive practices that require detailed scrutiny by the Competition Commission of India. These practices include tying or bundling different products and services together, acquisition of competitors, predatory pricing, and exclusive arrangements with the trade. Second, how do we best tax these digital services? Economic activity that is based in India should be taxed appropriately in terms of transactions, income, and other earnings. Third, what is the best way to protect data? We need to ensure that data is appropriately localised and that individuals are provided full privacy protection. The joint parliamentary committee working on the data protection bill is evaluating all these issues.Finally, we need to evaluate how to enable the right to free speech on social media platforms as per Article 19 in the Constitution of India. Note that our Constitution has clearly defined free speech and the limits that can be put on that right to free speech. The takedown policies, community standards or algorithms of all platforms must be compliant with and not go beyond Article 19(2) exceptions. Moreover, this standard has to be equitably applied as per Article 14. In effect, by applying these principles, platforms have become publishers.Our current legal and technical framework has to evolve to regulate all these emerging Big Tech powers. Our framework must be integrated, flexible, and dynamic to stay ahead of fast-evolving technologies and competitive conduct. We will need to ensure that we close gaps across laws such as the Telegraph Act, the TRAI Act, the Information Technology Act, IT intermediary guidelines, the proposed Data Protection Act, various competition laws and rules, and the Indian Penal code (to deal properly with issues such as defamation). We are the world’s largest democracy and will soon be the largest digital nation. We cannot allow foreign powers to manipulate narratives and distort public opinion. Technology-driven economic activity will soon be close to a fifth of our economy. China has already fractured the internet to build up its national strength. Therefore, it is imperative that we take the lead globally in regulating Big Tech. We must also harmonise our regulatory framework with the US and the European Union. India will then emerge as a true leader, a Vishwa Guru.Jayant Sinha is a Lok Sabha MP from Jharkhand.

In a memo, Mr Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, noted that the US is facing “four overlapping and compounding crises; the Covid-19 crisis, the resulting economic crisis, the climate crisis, and a racial equity crisis,” which “demand urgent action”. The Biden administration’s decision to return to PCA (the US issued a formal exit notice on November 4, 2019, which took effect on November 4, 2020) reverses one of the most controversial — and damaging — decisions of Mr Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, a climate sceptic. In the run-up to the election, Mr Biden had promised that one of his priorities would be to build a more resilient, sustainable economy — one that will put the US on an irreversible path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050, and also lead an effort to get every major country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets.The 2015 Paris agreement is the first truly legally binding global treaty to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. Mr Trump’s decision to withdraw the US, one of the world’s largest economies and emitters, cast a shadow on the deal because the US has a historical responsibility to not just reduce its own emissions but also provide financial resources to developing countries to deal with the crisis, their adaptation requirements and green technology. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic elbowed out the climate crisis from the global agenda, but, at the same time, it underlined the urgent need to take stronger measures to offset the debilitating impact of the climate crisis on the environment and humans. The return of the US to the accord (and the arrival of the vaccines to deal with the pandemic) will hopefully help the world reset its focus on the crisis. With Mr Biden in the saddle and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to the issue — India has done well on its Paris commitments — the US must support India on mitigation, capacity-building in renewable energy, financing, data-sharing, Indian Ocean monitoring, and phasing out hydroflu-orocarbons. A green partnership between two of the world’s biggest economies is not just critical for both nations, but can also become a template for the world to “build back better” after the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/washingtons-return-to-the-paris-climate-accord-is-a-significant-step-build-on-it-101610890146334.html
17-01-2021||Today's||What the farm stir can learn from Gandhi||The consensus reached after the ninth round of talks between the protesting farmers and the government was that they would meet again on January 19. Neither party is willing to move the needle an inch despite various related agreements being hammered out. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has postponed the implementation of the three contentious laws. Both sides have adopted different strategies to gain the upper hand. The government hopes that it can hold out till the farmers give up. The farmers’ organisations, meanwhile, are exploring various ways to engage the agitators. A huge tractor rally has now been planned for Republic Day on January 26. The farmers hope to keep up the pressure on the government this way, but this is not a solution. We can only hope that this prolonged agitation does not spiral into some sort of turbulence. This protest has been unique in that thousands of agitators are present at the four entry points to the capital and seem steadfast in their conviction that these laws must be repealed. They have held fast for more than 50 days now. They have weathered unseasonal rains and the bitter winter so far. It is difficult to manage such a diverse and large crowd but the farmers seem resolute.However, during the course of the agitation so far, some organisations have made attempts to hijack the movement. Some objectionable posters were put up and some provocative speeches made. But the farmers’ leaders identified these interlopers and neutralised them swiftly. The protest has brought together people from different religions and various socio-economic and cultural backgrounds in a harmonious blend. The farmers’ organisations say that more than 75 people have died at the dharna sites so far. Normally such tragedies cause people to lose heart, but this has not been the case here. Some farmers have reportedly died by suicide but this has not been glorified in order to prevent this becoming a trend. Religion has been a unifying factor in this protest, which explains why a mobile gurudwara has been set up at the Singhu border. The police and security forces have displayed sensitivity in keeping a respectful distance from religious places during their operations. When the Guru Granth Sahib is placed on a site, it is considered holy and this has been a rallying point for the agitators.A sizeable number of women and children are also present at the site of the protests. This has attracted a lot of media attention. The farmers’ leaders have also been careful not to disturb normal life in surrounding villages and volunteers have been deployed in full force to ensure that the peace is kept. This has earned the movement public support. If the crowds had been unruly, the government could well have gained the advantage. These are commendable achievements, but is this enough?Every agitation has a window of effectiveness. As the struggle gets prolonged, people’s goodwill decreases. Mahatma Gandhi, who pioneered the non-violent movement in India, was astute enough to judge the duration of an agitation. He managed to keep his demands and issues alive despite stepping back at the right time. The farmers must learn from his example. Perhaps the absence of a single leader or organisation is the reason that this has not happened so far. Farmers’ organisations should also consider the fact that such a prolonged agitation affects surrounding industries and hinders mobility on the highways. All these have a detrimental effect on the lives and livelihoods of people. They may persist with the demand for the continuation of the minimum support price (MSP), but they should not forget that despite this system, more than one lakh farmers have died by suicide in the last 10 years. Every day, between 2,000 to 2,500 farmers are forced to leave their villages to seek employment elsewhere. If the current system was so effective, then the situation in our rural areas would not be so dire. Every system needs to be upgraded and amended in keeping with the changing times. Today, if farmers feel compelled to leave their villages because agriculture is unremunerative, then surely this suggests that agrarian reforms are necessary. Such reforms are bound to be contentious which is why the Constitution gives people the right to protest. The farmers have done so in a constructive way so far, but now they have to consider finding a middle path. The government must walk the extra mile to convince farmers of its good intentions. It should not allow this agitation to spin out of control. Remember the railway strike of May 1974. It led to Indira Gandhi feeling cornered enough to impose the Emergency. This is not likely to happen again but such prolonged displays of dissatisfaction could well end in chaos. The government must now act decisively to make a sincere effort to break the deadlock and the farmers must be receptive to well-intentioned proposals to resolve this issue.

17-01-2021||Today's||Building a stronger scientific ecosystem to fight future crises||The year 2020 was marked by challenges posed by Covid-19, and the pivotal role science played in responding to these challenges. India has been at the forefront of the global fight against Covid-19 to deliver innovative solutions at scale not just for itself, but also the world. The learnings and successes from the year, such as ramping up indigenous testing capacities and collaborating across sectors and communities for innovation and development, have helped us build a stronger ecosystem to fight health crises in the future. During the initial days of the outbreak, it was unimaginable that in less than 12 months we would have a vaccine ready for use. However, India’s scientific community delivered. India began its vaccination drive on January 16. We have been the world’s foremost producer of vaccines, contributing to the immunisation of about 60% of the world’s children; our success in developing vaccines for Covid-19 has further strengthened our reputation as a global leader in the field even as six to eight other candidates are in advanced stages of development.In March 2020, when widespread testing began, India was reliant on imported kits. With supply chain disruptions and a global demand for diagnostic kits, it was important for us to develop indigenous capacity for their production. The challenge was taken up by start-ups and researchers and within 60 days, RT-PCR kits were developed. Today, we have over 100 indigenously manufactured antibody, antigen and other novel technology-based diagnostics in the market.As part of the effort to address the shortage of critical healthcare technologies and move towards self-sufficiency, the DBT-AMTZ COMManD (Covid Medtech Manufacturing Development) Consortia was formed. Among its successful initiatives was building India’s first I-Lab (infectious disease diagnostic lab), a mobile testing facility to conduct testing. The state-of-the-art facility was made in a record time of eight days. In addition to the kits, it was also important for us to be self-reliant when it came to the components, reagents, and resources across the product development chain. For this purpose, the National Biomedical Resource Indigenisation Consortium was launched by the department of biotechnology and Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council. The objective was to provide a platform to build indigenous biomedical resources towards a self-reliant biotech ecosystem. Today there are more than 30 reagent manufacturers who are collectively delivering indigenous components.To support India’s scientific and medical community for the development of vaccines and other solutions during the pandemic, the government created a strong ecosystem — setting up 11 clinical trial sites; creating five Covid-specific bio-repositories; a network of bioassay and immunogenicity study laboratories; developing animal challenge models; shared infrastructure for virus characterisation, sequencing and culture; notification of guidelines for specimen-sharing for research purposes; and putting in place a rapid response regulatory framework to ensure transparency and efficiency without compromising on the quality of data. Today, we are developing vaccines for the world, exporting diagnostic kits, and looking at building and strengthening clinical trial capacities in our neighbouring countries.The department of biotechnology in the ministry of science and technology — working with its 16 autonomous research institutes, its large network of research laboratories, its vibrant start-up ecosystem across the bio-incubators and other institutes, and Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council — created a strong Covid Research Consortia, which will now pave the path to move beyond Covid-19. To advocate the importance of prevention, preparedness and partnership against epidemics, the first-ever International Day of Epidemic Preparedness was held on December 27 by the United Nations. The year 2020 put a spotlight on the capability, resilience and adaptability of the Indian scientific ecosystem. In 2021, we are confident of having a much stronger science-based response to any challenge we may face in the future.Renu Swarup is secretary, department of biotechnology, Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal Renu Swarup is secretary, department of biotechnology in Government of IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/building-a-stronger-scientific-ecosystem-to-fight-future-crises-101610889608096.html
