01-01-2021||News||Covid-19 highlighted the ‘the tyranny of experts’||The year 2020 will be described in evocative terms — a year of reckoning for humankind, societies, democracies, economies and so on. But it is also the year that suffered from, what the American economist William Easterly once described as, the “tyranny of the experts”. On January 23, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the coronavirus outbreak was not a global emergency and saw no necessity for countries to panic. At the time, China had reported 800 cases and 25 deaths from Covid-19. Just seven weeks later, epidemiological experts at the Imperial College in the United Kingdom (UK) estimated that 2.2 million people in the United States (US) and half-a-million people in the UK could die from Covid-19. Some of the world’s most credentialed experts came to diametrically opposite conclusions at around the same time using the same set of information about the same problem, both of which proved to be disastrously wrong. These experts’ advice formed the basis for some big decisions that nations and their leaders took. President Donald Trump paid a heavy price. He lost his presidency due to his handling of Covid-19. Ostensibly, the experts at WHO and Imperial College carry on with their lives with no substantial change. As the coronavirus was spreading rapidly, in April, experts at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) declared that the world economy would shrink by 3% in 2020, but that India’s economy would still grow, albeit much slower, at 1.9%. Just eight weeks later, they decreed that India’s economy would not grow but shrink by 4.5%. By October, they pronounced that the world economy would shrink by 4.4% and India’s by a whopping 10.3%. In just six months, IMF experts shaved $350 billion off India’s economy.When IMF claimed in April that India’s economy would still grow, it was understandable that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman chose the option of a meagre and conservative Covid-19 fiscal aid package for India, unlike other nations. At the time, bureaucrats in the finance ministry acknowledged that since experts projected India’s economy to still grow, they would rather conserve government relief for the future, if needed. It is now clear that early diffidence in fiscal spending has caused India’s economy to spiral downwards and shrink enormously to become one of the world’s most adversely-impacted economies. It is no exaggeration to impute that the policy misjudgement of a minuscule fiscal aid package in April has devastated the livelihoods of millions of Indians. Presumably, the experts at IMF carry on with their lives unperturbed, while India’s policymakers have to now deal with the wreckage.In April, the New York Times ran a detailed graphical story titled “How long will a vaccine really take?” in which the opinions of dozens of academic experts in the field of medicine were taken to construct a timeline for vaccine availability. They concluded that if everything moved at “pandemic speed”, then the vaccine could be available by August 2021 for the first person to be jabbed and if things moved at typical speed, then a vaccine would be available only by November 2033! Ninety-one-year-old Margaret Keenan received the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine shot in London on December 8. Half the world may be vaccinated by August 2021, the earliest that experts had predicted would be the first shot of the vaccine. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies driven by the lure of opportunity embarked on a race to develop the vaccine at breakneck speed and achieve an astounding outcome for humanity and and for their businesses. It is not hard to see the pattern across all these incidents. In each of these cases, the experts had little to lose should they be fantastically wrong and lots to gain should they be right. But decision-makers such as politicians, policymakers and businesspeople stood to gain or lose equally by their actions. The incentive structures for expert advice and opinion are skewed and asymmetric. To be absolutely clear, this is not to suggest that these experts had any mala fide intent or to even cast a shadow of doubt on their expertise. This is to merely highlight the issue of asymmetric incentives and raise the question — if experts were held more accountable, would it lead to better advice and opinions?In 2018, the Lebanese American mathematician Nassim Nicholas Taleb postulated a philosophical idea called “skin in the game”. To illustrate, he cited a law from Hammurabi’s code of laws of society in Babylon 3,800 years ago, which stated that “if a builder builds a house and the house collapses resulting in the death of the owner, then the builder shall be put to death”. The idea is not one of revenge, but of symmetric incentives. The notion that in an adverse consequence, only if the builder stands to lose equally as the owner, will it strengthen the incentive structure for both and lead to better housing for all. The larger idea is that only an equal sharing of rewards and losses among participants will lead to more robust outcomes and eliminate issues of “moral hazard” where one participant has little or nothing to lose vis-à-vis the other. It is neither a radically new postulation nor one that is difficult to comprehend. Academics, think tanks, journalists, anchors, analysts, and historians suffer the most from this malaise, dishing out advice and sermons from the outside on how a political party should run its affairs, what economic policy the finance minister should adopt, and the ideal response to a public health crisis and various such things, with “no skin in the game”. Ideas and opinions play an inordinately important role in a liberal democracy and should flourish freely. But the weight of such ideas and opinions rise only when incentives are aligned and symmetrical. “Listen to the experts” was the most common refrain in 2020. Yet, as we move into a New Year, it is clear that the perils of “advice without accountability” are far more dangerous. The next time you read a moral sermon or a prescription by an expert in these pages, ask yourself: What does this person lose if his advice is wrong or misplaced?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-highlighted-the-the-tyranny-of-experts/story-sOjhNAfKAP7G67mxrC8III.html
01-01-2021||News||The climate crisis needs a vaccine too||It has been estimated that countries around the world may have spent a total of $6 trillion to deal with the economic consequences of Covid-19, not counting the billions spent in laboratories around the world to fast-track an effective vaccine. The existential nature of the threat from the pandemic justified this extraordinary response even though nations failed to pool their scientific and financial resources to enable a collective and collaborative response. This is the second time during this millennium that we have witnessed an international response on this scale. There was a massive deployment of economic stimulus packages by G-20 countries to respond to the global financial and economic crisis (GFEC) of 2007-08. This was successful in averting a meltdown of the global trading and financial system. Both during GFEC and the current crisis we hear the same exhortation — that countries should engage in a green recovery from the crisis, that they should rebuild their economies in an ecologically-sustainable manner, that these crises are urgent intimations of the threat to planetary survival, which are ignored at our collective peril. But if current indications are anything to go by we are witnessing the revival, even intensification of the ecologically-damaging production and consumption patterns, which have landed us in this predicament. Carbon emissions are rising once again as economies begin to revive. Environmental safeguards are being relaxed on the plea that industries badly hit by the pandemic cannot bear the burden of such regulation at least for some time. The United Nations (UN) recently convened a virtual Climate Ambition Summit at which the secretary-general called for member-states to declare a Climate Emergency and take drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable climate adaptation. While several states committed themselves to achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century they gave little evidence of their willingness to come together to deal with what the incoming United States (US) President Joe Biden has described as an “existential threat of our time”. Should not there be an urgent mobilisation of world’s top scientists to deliver climate-friendly technologies with the same urgency as they have created effective vaccines against Covid-19 within just a year? Should not countries deploy large economic recovery funds to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to non-fossil and cleaner sources of energy? The climate challenge will unleash a crisis of a scale and severity before which the current pandemic will pale into insignificance. Are the lessons of the pandemic going to be left unlearnt?The chairperson of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Hoesung Lee, had this to say in his brief remarks at the summit: “We are currently on a path risking serious, pervasive and irreversible impacts.” Do we need any more convincing?The pandemic has generated a welcome debate on what constitutes true value and how may this be measured? Our accounting systems, on the basis of which we calculate business risks and profits and losses, are biased towards demonstrable, quantifiable and immediate effects. They undervalue effects which may manifest over longer periods or for which we have not yet developed measuring tools. Not everything that counts can be counted and not everything which can be counted counts. There is an added problem of measuring feedback loops among inter-related domains. For example, food, water and energy security are closely inter-linked and intervention in one domain has knock-on effects in other domains. Our current accounting systems can only handle linear effects in single domains. It was loss of biodiversity that shrunk wildlife habitat, bringing unfamiliar viruses carried by wild species into contact with domesticated animals and human beings. What may have been justified by arguments of food security and expanding human settlements had no means of assessing the serious health risks this generated. This is related to the classic problem of dealing with external economies where it is not possible to relate individual cost incurred to individual benefit received as the latter is socialised. Challenges such as climate change and public health require such socialisation of costs and benefits and because they are global in dimension, they can only be dealt with through multilateral processes.The Covid-19 pandemic has starkly exposed the perils of the rampant degradation of our planet’s fragile ecology. Linked to this is the industrialisation of food production, based on mass-breeding of beef, cattle, sheep, pork and poultry in conditions that make the spread of infections and contamination of the food chain all but inevitable. Plastics may be convenient to use but they are now clogging our rivers, lakes and the ocean. These are all cross-domain issues and need to be treated in a comprehensive frame and through global efforts. Could India take the intellectual lead in pioneering new methods of measuring value?The Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is scheduled to be held in Glasgow at the end of 2021. This gives Indian diplomacy a year in which to mobilise the international community in favour of a path- breaking outcome based on science and the principle of equitable burden-sharing. On this, India’s interests are fully aligned with the world at large.Shyam Saran is a former foreign secretary and senior fellow, CPR He was Prime Minister’s Special Envoy for Climate Change 2007-2010 The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-climate-crisis-needs-a-vaccine-too/story-wudoJsZtM3mgDJj2fYv4yM.html

01-01-2021||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Readers’ Take: A great New Year resolution is to get vaccinated against negativity||No looking backThe year 2020 has left behind many issues for humans to introspect on. I was one of those people shut inside my home, watching the world pass through the trauma. My resolutions for the New Year are to adhere to the precautions for keeping the Covid pandemic at bay till all is well, to shed fears and insecurities that weaken me and make me feel isolated. I resolve not to spend hours and days delving into the past to relieve minor glories and wallow in regrets over what couldn’t be achieved. I shall try to live in the present and take each day as it comes. The best thing year 2020 has taught me is to help people in distress within my capacity and resources. Subhash PuriTaking care of animals and birdsDue to the fear of the pandemic I had stopped myself from stepping outdoors and could not take care of animals and birds. So, in the year 2021, I resolve to feed them and look after them.Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhWill work on writing skillsMy New Year resolution will be to pursue my passion for writing more vigorously and for improving my writing skillsRajinder ParshadI plan to help women as much as I canAs we step into 2021, we are still affected by the consequences of the past year. So much has changed. There is a shadow of fear and uncertainty looming over us. Throughout the lockdown I have been an online grief counsellor for Haryana, Panjab, Delhi ad Chandigarh. Having dealt with the sudden increase in cases of domestic violence and assault and issues related with menstrual hygiene, I have made a very specific New Year 2021 resolution. I will continue my efforts to teach more women to be self-sufficient by teaching them to stitch sanitary pads. I will also work on the mindset of people and educate them against patriarchy and assaults of various kinds.Renu Mathur, PanchkulaGet people to think positiveMany people are anxiety ridden due to Covid 2019, but though many of them are aware of safety measures they are still not following it. My 2021 resolution will be to create positivity in minds of people. We should not be afraid of contracting the virus but we should definitely follow all the precautions to avoid it. Sandeep Gupta, ChandigarhGuiding others will be my mantraApart from keeping myself healthy and happy, I want to serve society through my knowledge of astrology, numerology and tarot card reading. It would be nice if I could listen to other people’s problems and make them smile. I want to help and guide people who have faced failures and lost hope in life by counselling them. People should focus on their emotional and mental health as well as physical fitness. Abhilasha Gupta, MohaliReach out to othersI am looking forward to 2021 as a year of renewal. First and foremost, I want to become socially useful. For this, I am looking forward to doing a course in first aid and connecting with the Red Cross. Besides, I shall assist the neighbourhood in taking up civic issues with the municipal corporation. Reading and writing have been my hobbies. My endeavour will be to sharpen these skills, learn gardening and cooking as hobbies. My wife is very fond of gardening. So much so, we didn’t have to buy a lot of vegetables from the markets or street vendors. I helped her water the plants etc. I want to do more of it this year. YouTube is a great teacher for cooking. My wife learnt the art of making jalebis and besan ki barfi, which we enjoyed during the pandemic. I have been teaching mathematics for classes 9 and 10 to our gardener’s son for the last two years. I found it highly satisfying and want to continue doing so this year.The best thing that happened during the pandemic was that my wife and I grew closer. Watching TV, news, drama and movies together became the routines of the day. I plan to spend more time with her this year.Lt Col GS Bedi (Retd).Nothing but masks and sanitisers for meMy resolutions for 2021 are Covid-specific since the hue and cry over the virus is continuing into the next year.1. I will not venture out without mask and sanitiser and wash my hands as prescribed 2. I will not leave home , make social visits or encourage others to visit my place unless it is absolutely necessary3. I will take utmost care to improve my immunity4. I will encourage others to follow my resolutionsAK Sharma, Chandigarh. Attract positivityThe coronavirus is not finished yet. We should resolve though to never give up hope, make positivity the motto of our life and in case faced with no solutions take heavenly help and pray to God from the core of our hearts to help the suffering humanity. Avoid negative thinking and remember, positivity attracts positivity. Ensure you eat and live healthy and remember to save money for the future. Also, don’t be dependent on domestic helpers for doing household chores. Understand the value of home made food and keep yourself healthy. Suman Kansal, PanchkulaTo pray hard for a healthy worldMy first resolution for 2021 is to pray to God Almighty to protect humans, bio-diversity and environment to make this planet healthy and happy. I resolve to do everything possible to end this hatred of caste, creed, religion and governance; make concerted efforts to negate the effects of pollution by planting more eco-friendly trees and manage garbage judiciously. I also will be helping the needy, especially birds and animals who need our help but can’t speak. Last but not least, I intend to keep my cool while driving and adhere to traffic rules. I will salute and smile at anyone who offends me because life is more precious than ego and frustration. I will also resolve to bow with respect to all service providers who make my life comfortable and worth living.Capt Amar Jeet Kumar, MohaliUpgrade tech skills as a seniorThe resolutions this year are: a. Home is paradise, so there’s no going out to hotels/restaurants or clubs for that matterb. Pay special attention to health, eat home-made nutritious food, do yoga and exercise to maintain and enhance immunity c. Follow Covid-19 protocols even if I am vaccinated d. Not to go out unnecessarily e. Life goes on, therefore enjoy it but with due precautions. There is no age bar for learning and community service after retirement from service. Seniors can play a very useful role by learning new skills such as writing, singing, dancing, yoga, walking, nature cure and meditation. Community service for the needy people and digital literacy is the need of the hour and this is my goal for 2021. One must change with times and adapt to new technology. Always remember, time does not stop, people don’t stop ageing, and learning never stops. So my humble request to seniors is to continue learning till the end. This will keep you physically and mentally fit. Col TBS Bedi (Retd), Mohali No procrastinatingI have decided that from now on I will not put off today’s work tomorrow. Also, I will live in the present without thinking about future outcomes. I will try to stay more fit by regular jogging and remain focused on my goals. Jassica, ChandigarhBeacon of strength and courage to othersMy resolutions for 2020 are:Illuminate myself: To be a beacon of strength and courage, a clear pool of wisdom and understanding, and a flame burning the truthNo fake promises: Instead of making a promise that will ultimately be broken, I will commit myself to simply being vigilant and awareBe awakened: I will try to be awakened every day to each new opportunity to share, to love, to be the temple of peace in my lifeAdapt to peace: I will definitely align myself with the spirit of peace and goodwill toward myself and others.Abhishek Kumar, Chandigarh Have faith in AlmightyMy resolution and wish is to do everything possible to make 2021 a peaceful and trouble free year. If any unthinkable and unpredictable event occurs, let the Almighty give us the necessary clues to come out of it unscathed. Dr Devinder Garg, ChandigarhBe cordial with neighbours, helpers, friendsHere are a few things I and others have to keep in mind this year: Always maintain cordial relationships with your next door neighbours, domestic helpers and friends as they are the ones usually who step up and help you during emergencies. Make sure you have enough savings to fall back upon in case you don’t have a running income and keep yourself updated on digital skills to deal with the digital world, for online transactions and to be socially connected to friends and well wishers with your handy smartphone.SC Luthra, ChandigarhGrowing plantsWhile saying goodbye to 2021 I want to salute all the healthcare workers, police officers, garbage collecters, Army, print media and electronic media who kept working to keep us safe and informed about the goings-on in the world. For the New Year I have resolved to focus on my hobbies, which are writing and cooking. I am going to focus on my studies too, maintain my immunity by exercising daily and grow as many plants as I can. This year we learnt that health is truly our real wealth so I request everyone to look after their health. This is a list that everyone should follow:1. Build a better budget.2. Quit addictive habits3. Less alcohol4. Eat healthy food5. Exercise regularly6. Take the stairs instead of elevators7. Grow more plants8. Keep homes and surroundings clean9. Donate10. Help the needy.Ishita NaraEnd casteismAll of us should understand the difficulties of others and try to resolve them cheerfully. I resolve to cooperate and support every Indian to end casteism, language and regional barriers. All Indians should try to resolve the disputes between the government and public. We should live peacefully as good friends.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliThe best thing while WFH is to exerciseThe work from home culture has its own unique set of problems. Backache due to incorrect posture and lack of exercise impacted me the most. In the pre-pandemic situation , walking from home to office and office to home was something that happened by default. It was really an eye-opener in terms of helping me understand the importance of exercise. My resolution is to make exercising a priority. Even if it is a short evening walk or a quick yoga session. Not one day in 2021 should go without me taking some time out for some physical activity.Shruti Mittal, ChandigarhStarting a journal The year 2020 brought many lessons with it. It taught us about the fragility of life and the beauty of basking in the warmth of love by being with the family during the lockdown. My resolutions include treasuring every single moment of my life by writing a journal, so I can remember the moments forever and expand my mind and not get miffed by trivial problems. And most importantly, I have to learn to be a seeker of everyday magic. Aditi Malhotra Helping others Resolutions are made on the first day of a New Year and all of us tend to forget them by the end of the first week of the New Year. The year gone by was never a year which any of us had expected but it taught us many lessons of survival. It gave us plenty of opportunities for introspection. So taking a cue from the disastrous 2020 my New Year resolution will be to help people, do some social work for the needy who may have been affected by the pandemic. I will also work towards improving my health and look at how I can protect the environment. Finally, however, what matters is executing our resolutions, which again will depend on how the new strain of the virus is going to affect our country. All of us have a role to play in protecting mother earth and so our collective resolution should be to nurture it more passionately. Anil Kumar Yadav, Chandigarh Focus on the simple life During 2021 my only priority will be to maintain good health and educate others to do so because during epidemic only those with strong immunity recovered quickly. Yoga is the best alternative. Online yoga camps got tremendous response. People have to change their priorities in life and focus on living a simple and disciplined lifestyle. RR Passi, Chandigarh Teach others yoga and pranayam I feel the best thing is doing yoga daily for at least 30 minutes and give more importance to pranayam, anulom and vilom (breathing exercises) for instance. For more details look out for Baba Ramdev’s YouTube channels. Change over to pure vegetarianism, consuming fresh giloy, five tulsi and neem leaves daily and giving up alcohol and tobacco in any form. If you don’t get neem, buy ayurvedic neem tablets. I am 82-plus years of age. I follow the routine and I do not suffer from any disease and have an eyesight of 6/6. I would want to guide others who come to me for help. Dr Harnam Singh, Chandigarh Enjoy the present The year 2020 has taught us the value of friends, family and neighbours who stood by us in times of need and will always do so. It taught us to hold on to these relationships and nurture them with love and care. Unlike all the other years when New Year resolutions meant becoming fitter, travelling more etc, for 2021 I want to be appreciative of the little joys in life, spend more time doing things I enjoy and that allow me to be closer to my loved ones. Kohima GoyalUnderstanding AyurvedaGaining more knowledge of Ayurveda is my resolution for 2021. The lockdown gave me a chance to watch Ramayana and Mahabharata on TV, which piqued my curiosity about ancient texts and science. So I started researching Ayurveda and realised that our ancestors knew a lot about medicines and natural treatments. Now I want to learn more about this science.Krrish Madaan, Ambala||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-chandigarh-readers-take-a-great-new-year-resolution-is-to-get-vaccinated-against-negativity/story-eoK68UJ0knzPnHpdnHfzlN.html

Places like Masunda Lake, Upavan Lake and Hiranadani Meadows in Thane, Khadakpada, Durgadi, Ghadhari of Kalyan and Phadke Road in Dombivli wore a deserted look owing to heavy police presence at all these locations.Police officials claimed that for the first time in decades, they have seen hardly any persons on the roads in the city. Kasarvadavli police who are on duty every year near Gaimukh, Hiranandani area, claimed that there were no people on the road.Kasarvadavli police inspector AE Kaldate said, “We started patrolling since early evening and asked people to shut establishments by 11pm. For the first time in all these years, there were no youngsters or families loitering on the road. Every year, there are hundreds of people crowding the eateries in the area. Many preferred to stay indoors for celebrations. There were no complaints of nuisance or disturbances from any society members or citizens regarding any issues or problems on the day.”Read more: Only 35 drunk drivers arrested in Mumbai on New Year’s EveThe story was the same along Upavan Lake, infamous for late night bike stunts and other illegal activities.

But this time, apart from drink-and-drive cases done by traffic police, there was nothing in the area. It was quiet for a major part of the night.”There was no crowd in the hotspots of Kalyan, Dombivli and Bhiwandi too as per the local police stations of these areas. Since most shops were closed by 11pm, people chose to stock up and celebrate indoors.

While 2,944 people tested positive and 62 succumbed to the virus in December, the numbers stood at 3,140 and 42, respectively, in November.Mohali city continued to account for the bulk of cases, with 2,502 (85%) in December . Meanwhile, recovery rate improved in December, going up to 92% from 87% in November. In October, it stood at 93.7%. “The reason for high number of deaths is that people are not taking precautions,” said Dr GB Singh, who took over as the Punjab health director on Friday after his tenure as the Mohali civil surgeon ended on New Year’s Eve. “People are not approaching hospitals and prefer to take medicine at home. They turn up at hospital only when their oxygen level goes down, making the case complicated. Also, most patients who died were having comorbidities,” he said.Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar, nodal officer for Covid-19, raised concern over people not wearing masks in public places, especially in Mohali city. Aashika Jain, additional district commissioner, said sampling has been increased in the district with round-the-clock availability of a team at the district hospital.Chandigarh faring much betterSeeing a decline in the impact of Covid-19, the number of virus-related fatalities and infections in Chandigarh remained at a five-month low in December 2020.The UT had recorded its first case on March 18 last year following which strict curfew and lockdown was implemented. As the restrictions eased, the number of cases as well as deaths started increasing in August and reached a peak in September. The numbers decreased marginally during the festival season in November, declining further in December.In December, 40 deaths were reported, a decrease of around 25% with respect to November when 51 positive patients had died. September witnessed the highest (106) deaths.“Proper supervision and alertness is essential when one tests positive irrespective of age. However, extra caution is essential for elderly residents. To stop the disease from worsening, one should keep monitoring the oxygen saturation level and immediately reach out for help when the oxygen saturation level falls below 95%,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, director of UT health department.She said that the declining trend is expected to continue if proper precautions are undertaken in the wake of the new variant of Covid-19.The stress on health institutions has also decreased with only one Covid care centre functional nowadays. On the other hand, hospitals are seeing less admission as well. At Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, only 26 residents are currently admitted.The positivity rate has also seen a declining trend with the number of cases decreasing with a corresponding increase in tests conducted. December reported around 6% positivity rate which was among the lowest in the past few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohali-saw-48-rise-in-covid-deaths-in-december/story-sPOoQ7rvuEHB6q6Nff6v0J.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Air quality remains poor in Mumbai; IMD predicts cloudy skies for Saturday||The New Year kicked-off with very poor air quality and reduced visibility owing to hazy conditions on Friday.The air quality in Mumbai and its surrounding areas continued to remain in the very poor category for the second consecutive day as the inflow of air from the land (continental air), instead of from the sea persisted.According to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), an overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator- of 307 (very poor) was recorded. Of the 10 stations where the air quality was measured, Bandra Kurla Complex had the worst air quality with an AQI of 358, followed by Mazagaon where an AQI of 347 was measured. A spokesperson from SAFAR said that the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category on Saturday as cold wave continued to hit the city. Haze, too, is likely to continue for one more day as cloudy conditions persist, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).Minimum temperatures rose further on Friday at both Colaba and Santacruz stations of IMD. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 22 degrees Celsius, which is 2.7 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature at Santacruz was 20.6 degrees Celsius, a whopping 3.5 degrees above normal and 2.1 degrees above Thursday’s minimum temperature.The maximum temperature at Colaba was 31.6 degrees Celsius, 1.1 degrees above normal and 0.4 degree below Thursday’s maximum temperature. At Santacruz mercury touched 33.6 degrees Celsius, which was 2.6 degrees above normal.For Saturday, the IMD has predicted partly cloudy skies with maximum temperature touching 34 degree Celsius and minimum at 22 degree Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-quality-remains-poor-in-mumbai-imd-predicts-cloudy-skies-for-saturday/story-4qUYtTBU0aBYYwSwFgtg2O.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||50% Covid-19 tests in city in December were using rapid antigen kits, says Mumbai civic body||The monthly share of less-dependable, but quick-result rapid antigen tests in the city is on the rise, compared to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the gold standard in detecting the presence of the novel coronavirus, the pathogen responsible for Covid-19, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data. The antigen tests give results in 30 minutes, whereas RT-PCR tests take eight hours. Of the 4.48 lakh tests conducted in Mumbai in December (until December 30), 2.21 lakh (49.37%) were using rapid antigen kits, while 2.27 lakh (50.62%) were RT-PCR tests. In November, 1.68 lakh (45%) of the 3.71 lakh tests were using antigen kits, while in October, of the 4.07 lakh tests, 1.64 lakh (40%) were using antigen kits. The BMC conducted 3.51 lakh tests in September, of which 1.09 lakh (31%) were using antigen kits. Conversely, the ratio of RT-PCR tests dropped from 69% in September to 60% in October and 55% in November. Experts from the state-appointed Covid-19 task force say the scenario is not ideal and the government should rely more on RT-PCR tests to control the pandemic. Civic officials, however, say that every symptomatic citizen testing negative via rapid antigen kits is made to undergo RT-PCR test for confirmation of the infection. While the positivity rate (the number of people that test positive out of every 100 tested) of RT-PCR tests is between 10% and 12%, the positivity rate of antigen tests is only 3% or 4%. Mumbai is testing anywhere between 12,000 to 19,000 samples every day. The BMC, however, maintains its RT-PCR testing capacity is around 15,000 samples a day. The BMC has maintained that the usage of rapid antigen kits has not affected the positivity rate. In December, the city reported only 9,245 cases and 223 deaths, compared to 25,062 cases and 566 deaths in November, and 50,006 cases and 1,281 deaths in October. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “We can’t conclude that the positivity rate is going down due to increased use of rapid antigen kits, however, RT-PCR test remains the gold standard. We are very near 50:50, and this is not ideal. I would say the ratio of RT-PCR to rapid antigen tests should be 80:20.” Dr Joshi added, “Use of rapid antigen kits has also increased because of more unlocking, as we need quick results. But this can also be done by using advanced technology to get results of RT-PCR tests. Rapid kits are a good screening tool, but RT-PCR is better for diagnosis.” Dr Rahul Pandit of Fortis Hospital, another member of the task force, said, “Ideally, 70% tests should be conducted using the RT-PCR method, while 30% using the rapid antigen kits. The current ratio of 50:50 is not ideal…We can confirm that use of rapid antigen kits is increasing due to unlock only when we have segregated data of how many times the rapid antigen kits were used for screening and how many times for diagnosis. If not, we should not simply assume unlocking to be the reason.” Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “I can’t comment without going through the data. However, we are conducting sufficient RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-covid-19-tests-in-city-in-december-were-using-rapid-antigen-kits-says-mumbai-civic-body/story-yZEXGz7MLr5wTbUsnIUlrL.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan: Devgandharva music festival only for a day||The renowned Devgandharva music festival of Kalyan city will be held only for one day this year rather than the regular three days, and entry will be free for the music lovers.The organisers have requested the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) to give them the Acharya Atre play theatre in Kalyan for the same concessional rates that they offer for Marathi plays.The festival, which has seen performances by many stalwarts like Zakir Hussain, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, Ustad Rashid Khan, Begum Parveen Sultana, Hariharan and Pt Niladri Kumar among others in the past, is in its 19th year. Kalyan Gayan Samaj, the organiser of the festival, has decided to cut short the usual three days’ event to one and not to charge for the tickets. It is scheduled on January 24.Prashant Dandekar, representative, Kalyan Gayan Samaj, said, “We have kept it free this time thinking about the hardship everyone has faced throughout 2020. We just want people to come and enjoy the musical night with their families. Also, we as organisers did not want to cancel the event as it is one of the most-awaited events of the city.”The organisers, however, lamented that while the KDMC has announced concession in rent for drama events held in their civic-run theatres, on the backdrop of the pandemic, the musical events have not been included in this concession.“The civic body should not just consider drama and theatre events for concession in rent but also the local musical festivals. Not just Devgandharva but other musical events too. We will be meeting the KDMC commissioner regarding this,” added Dandekar.The KDMC decided to reopen its two civic auditoriums on November 26, with an exemption of 75 per cent discount on its basic rent for those organisers charging ticket fare ₹300 or less. The Acharya Atre and Savitribai Phule auditorium were shut since March 23 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.An officer from KDMC who did not wish to be named said, “There is no decision for musical events by the civic body yet regarding allotting concession.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-devgandharva-music-festival-only-for-a-day/story-OJWGqd58TqzkAt4f9QGzlL.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Drop in use of tocilizumab; Mumbai doctors rely on remdesivir||As Maharashtra enters the eleventh month of the Covid-19 pandemic, the dependency on immuno-modulator—tocilizumab, which was once considered the ‘miracle drug’, has increasingly diminished. Now, as most of the patients are mild to moderately infected, the doctors are mostly relying on antivirals—remdesivir. The oxygen demand has declined by almost 40% since December 2020, due to better clinical outcomes in Covid-19 care.“In May, when the state had the highest number of Covid-19 cases, the demand for tocilizumab went up high. We instructed all the manufacturers to speed up their production. But now, the demand has fallen by almost 70-80%,” said JB Mantri, former joint commissioner (drugs) in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who retired on December 31, 2020.Doctors cite several reasons behind the change in trend. Tocilizumab is prescribed to seriously Covid-19 infected patients who develop ‘cytokine storm’ when the body’s immunity starts working against its cells and damages organs which can be fatal. However, remdesivir is provided to mildly and moderately-ill patients in the early stage of their treatment. In the last eleven months, due to early diagnosis, the number of severely infected patients has decreased drastically in the state which has limited the usage of tocilizumab.“The demand for tocilizumab has come down. Firstly, due to the early diagnosis, the condition of the patients aren’t deteriorating to an extent to use tocilizumab. Secondly, the early use of remdesvir and steroid treatment has made a huge difference. Convalescent plasma therapy is also effective,” said Dr Arpita Dwivedi, head of critical care unit at LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai.Other than this, doctors have observed that the repurposed drug—tocilizumab doesn’t prove effective in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. On October 21, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study on 243 patients that found tocilizumab did not reduce the risk of intubation or death as of four weeks in moderately ill Covid-19 patients.“Now that we are almost one year since Covid-19 outbreak, several significant researches have been done into it (tocilizumab). But it has failed to show mortality benefits in Covid-19 patients. The increased risk of superadded bacterial and fungal infections is also one of the major reasons to avoid tocilizumab,” said Dr Prashant Borade, head, critical care unit, Global Hospitals, Mumbai. Dr Dwivedi also said that she avoids the usage of tocilizumab for elderly patients given the increased risk of infections. The state Covid-19 task force has also removed the usage of tocilizumab from their treatment protocol.Fall in oxygen demand due to lesser patients:The oxygen demand has gone down from around 900 metric-tonne to around 400 metric-tonne recently due to the decrease in Covid-19 case and early diagnosis.“Due to the sudden rise in the demand for oxygen in the middle of last year, we doubled up the production rate. Now, the manufacturers have so much oxygen in stock that they are wanting to sell those,” said Mantri.Hospitals which had to refill the oxygen cylinders daily are now refining the cylinders thrice a week.“The demand has gone down by 70% to 80% as the number of patients has reduced. Also, the patients coming in with severe disease have reduced as early diagnosis and medical attention have improved. In general, awareness of preventive health care benefits has increased,” added Dr Borade.“Due to early diagnosis, the admission in an intensive care unit (ICU) has also dropped significantly in the last two weeks. Overall, there has been almost a 60% drop in patients who require oxygen,” said Dr Dwivedi.The severity of the infection has reduced with early diagnosis and close monitoring. The state’s fatality rate has dropped down to 2.56%. Out of the 52,902 active Covid-19 patients, over 85% are mostly either asymptomatic or mildly and moderately symptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-drop-in-use-of-tocilizumab-mumbai-doctors-rely-on-remdesivir/story-QM1NEeRrmlO0qxiRBjftaJ.html

Police officials said that the family did not opt for post-mortem and his body was sent in an ambulance to his hometown. The deceased, identified as Galtan Singh, had joined the protest two days ago and occupied a roadside space below the UP Gate flyover. The man had come along with his two brothers and a son who said that they will perform the last rites in Baghpat and rejoin the protest. “He came along with others from our village Nangal Bhagwanpur two days ago. Today morning, he complained of breathlessness and his son rushed him to a nearby hospital but he died before he could reach the hospital,” said Azad Singh, elder brother of the deceased. “We are taking his body to our village for the last rites. We don’t want to leave UP Gate and have told our leaders that we will rejoin the protest after completing the last rites,” he added. Thousands of protesters from western UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab are part of the ongoing protests at the UP Gate and have occupied the area since November 28 for their demand of repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. During the recent sixth round of talks with the government, the government representatives had told the farmers’ leaders that women, children and elderly should be sent back home as the weather conditions are adverse. “There has been a proposal to this effect from the government and we told them that this will be placed before our core committee. Meanwhile, we told people to go back but none of them is ready to go. So far, about 40 persons have died during the ongoing agitation at different protest sites. Friday’s was the first death at the UP Gate,” said Rakesh Tikait, national spokesperson of BKU. Following the death, farmer leaders paid tributes and also arranged for an ambulance to send the body to Baghpat. Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said, “The family did not opt for post mortem of the deceased and we sent the body in an ambulance to Baghpat. People at the site told us that he suffered breathlessness and died soon thereafter.” Meanwhile, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary on Friday arrived at the UP Gate protest site and urged the farmers to continue their agitation. “I am here to uplift the morale of the protesters and support them. I have urged them to carry on their protest peacefully and the government will succumb to their demands. Anyone who supports farmers should come out and support them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/57-year-old-bku-supporter-from-baghpat-dies-at-up-gate/story-WZzHaGvwlC81wnZIkAXZeK.html

01-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, Noida to conduct dry run for Covid vaccine on January 5||Ghaziabad: As part of the nation-wide drive to check readiness of its protocols to administer the Covid-19 vaccine when it arrives, both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar will conduct their dry runs on January 5 as will the rest of the state. The national health mission (NHM) director in Uttar Pradesh told all districts’ chief medical officers to report their feedback on the same day. During the drill, all steps will be tested and assessed to find and fix any gaps in the process or report any difficulty. Aparna Upadhaya, NHM director (UP), directed that the dry run be conducted at six sites in each district, which will include three each in rural and urban centres. These centres could be hospitals, schools or other private and government institutions.Gautam Buddh Nagar has 73 sites and its district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY said they may test more than six sites.“We are yet to decide upon the number of sites where we will test our preparedness. We may take up the dry run at all the centres so that we may understand the actual preparedness of our staff and infrastructure,” he said. The district has come up with 13 cold storage points for the vaccine, besides a main vaccine depot. A list of about 21,543 doctors and medical staff who will be inoculated in the first phase has also been drawn up. Similarly, Ghaziabad has also identified about 44 sites, including 30 private healthcare facilities. It has drawn up a list of about 21,800 health care workers. “During the dry run, about 36 staff will be roped in. We have identified 29 cold chain points and one depot. We will be co-ordinating the activities from the Covid control and command centre and will identify gaps for improvement,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “During the dry run, our teams will carry vaccine boxes (with ice packs) to the vaccination facility. So, they will get attuned to the process when actual vaccine arrives.” The Uttar Pradesh government has already issued guidelines for Covid-19 vaccination and identified three categories of people who would be vaccinated in first, second and third phases. In his directions, UP’s additional chief secretary has stated that the health care workers (HCWs) which includes staff of government and private health care facilities, will get the vaccine in the first phase. The second phase is scheduled for frontline workers such as police personnel, home guards, jail staff and employees of Nagar Palikas, among others. The third category includes people aged over 50 years and also those aged below but having issues like diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure, will get the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-noida-to-conduct-dry-run-for-covid-vaccine-on-january-5/story-q45xb9uimvc6nJpHCPFWlL.html
01-01-2021||Noida||Rains likely, cold wave to end||The six-day spell of cold wave is likely to end in Noida and adjoining regions and rain is likely to fall in the next four days and keep the temperature relatively low, said officials from the weather department.On Friday, the minimum temperatures fell to 1.1 degrees Celsius across the national capital region (NCR), based on the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Safadarjung observatory, six degrees below the season average, against 3.4 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature was 19.2 degrees Celsius, against 20 degrees a day earlier.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or lower and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree Celsius in the plains.“The minimum for Noida could not be calculated but we expect the mercury to be around 3 to 4 degrees Celsius and on Saturday it could hover around 6 degrees Celsius, which may pull the region out of cold wave but would still be lower than season’s average,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to IMD, due to the western disturbance -- a phenomenon that causes snowing in the Himalayan regions and rains in NCR – Noida and surrounding areas could see drizzling over next two days, with light rain on January 4 and 5. This would lead to dissolving the dense fog layers over the region, officials said. “The wind directions have changed from north-westerly to easterly. While the north-westerly are icy cold, the easterly are warmer, thus the mercury will rise. Also the cloudiness is set to increase over next three days. The clouded sky leads to rise in mercury as the earth radiates at night and clouds help in trapping the heat,” Srivastava added. The region would however see dense to moderate level of fog on January 2 that would reduce to moderate levels towards January 3 morning due to the rains. “The rains would lead to rise of the minimum temperatures due to the easterly winds and clouded sky however the maximum may drop slightly be a few degrees,” an IMD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rains-likely-cold-wave-to-end/story-0AcQUcLUaoCMgDxuJPRrQI.html
01-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, Noida begin year with worst air in country||The new year began with Ghaziabad and Noida breathing “severe” category air and grabbing the first and second spots of most polluted cities in the country as weather turned unfavourable.In “severe” air, even healthy people may show symptoms of respiratory distress. The cold, dense fog and low wind speed kept pollutants, mostly from local source, trapped in the air, said weather analysts. They expect ventilation to improve slightly over the next 24 hours, but it may take until January 3 to pull the two cities out of the “severe” category. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the western disturbance (moisture laden winds that originate from the Mediterranean, which is responsible for snow in the northern states, led to a change of wind direction from the northwesterly to the weaker Eastely.“The pollution levels spiked because the dispersion of pollutants stopped. There are also cold wave conditions that makes air heavy and traps pollutants further making dispersion difficult. The wind speed on Friday was around 8-10 kmph, there are chances of slight rise in mercury on Saturday leading to slightly better ventilation,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on a scale of 0 to 500, on Friday was 455, Greater Noida’s was 434 and Ghaziabad was 470. An AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Particulate matterThe concentration of fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively) exceeded the CPCB’s safe limits.PM2.5 levels in Noida was 382 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³), whereas the safe limit is 60 µg/m³. In Greater Noida, this was 310 µg/m³ and in Ghaziabad it was 477µg/m³. These fine particles are understood to be able to go into organs and is also a known carcinogen. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is set to improve to the very Poor category by Saturday January 2 and further improve to ‘poor’ category by Sunday January 3. “Surface winds became extremely calm as forecasted and the low dispersion condition led to accumulation and trapping of pollutants near-surface. The radiative fog mixed with high PM levels are making it Smog and reducing the visibility. However such extreme situation is short lived. The condition is likely to improve marginally by tomorrow and thereafter the fresh Western Disturbance is very likely to affect the region by 3rd January to improve surface winds speed, ventilation and some rainfall that are likely to bring significant improvement to the current AQI condition,” said the SAFAR statement on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-noida-begin-year-with-worst-air-in-country/story-8A8xoeRqeldtFYaJgZmubO.html
01-01-2021||City||Delhi: 26 people fined for drunk driving, total 1336 traffic challans issued on New Year’s eve||New Delhi: The Delhi Police fined 26 people for drunk driving, 174 for dangerous driving, and 706 for unauthorised parking as it reported 1,336 traffic violations across the city amid muted New Year celebrations because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Police also issued 144 challans for mask and social distancing violations from 4pm on December 31, 2019 to 4pm on the New Year day. So far, 5,13,529 people have been issued challans for not wearing mask while 38,256 people were fined for not following the social distancing rules.The total traffic violations were nearly 32% more than 2019, when 1,012 people were fined for various traffic violations. The prosecutions were done between 11pm on Thursday and 6am on Friday, when restrictions were imposed in Delhi to prevent large gathering in public places for New Year celebrations due to the pandemic. Similar restrictions were in place from 11pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday.The drunk driving challans were issued after a gap of nearly nine months, as the Delhi Traffic Police had stopped using alcometers due to Covid-19 fears. Unlike the previous years, when police would use alcometers to measure the alcohol content in breath samples, the police carried out manual checking of vehicles and used blood samples to ascertain drunk driving.As per the Delhi Traffic Police data, the drunk driving prosecution was almost 87% less than the fines issued in 2019. While 203 people were caught driving under the influence of alcohol during the New Year’s eve in 2019, this number came down to 26 in 2020. In 2018, a total of 274 people were prosecuted for the same.Senior police officers attributed this decline in drunk driving prosecution to the fact that the motorists were not being stopped for measuring alcohol content in breath samples using alcometers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-26-people-fined-for-drunk-driving-total-1336-traffic-challans-issued-on-new-year-s-eve/story-CcNJT4lJc4KMxD6Mbg0IJL.html

There are complaints from 45 identified people against Umesh Verma, 60, at the EOW police station for decamping with R2.5 crore, said OP Mishra, joint commissioner of police (EOW). According to the joint CP, Verma’s modus operandi involved alluring people to invest in a crypto-currency known as Coin Zarus. “He would promise the victims a fixed monthly return on 20-30% on their investments in this bogus crypto-currency, as well as commission on bringing in more customers,” said the officer. He said that these virtual crypto-currencies had already been banned by the Reserve Bank of India. Verma had allegedly opened an office in Connaught Place to carry out this business and was being aided by his son and some other people in the fraud. “He had registered the victims on two fake websites and even carried promotional videos on YouTube,” said the officer, adding that the crime dated back to 2017.When the customers would ask him for returns on their investments, he would give them postdated cheques which would bounce, said Mishra. Meanwhile, he allegedly withdrew all the money deposited into his account. Within months of having started his con, he shut his Connaught Place office and moved to Dubai. The EOW had registered a case of cheating against him in September 2020.“On Wednesday we got to know that he was returning to Delhi by flight. We arrested him from the airport itself,” said Mishra. A graduate from Delhi University, Verma was earlier arrested in 2017 by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence for gold smuggling, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crypto-currency-fraud-kingpin-arrested-from-igi-on-return-from-dubai/story-GGt3zQs2CELldufVGVJPRO.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||Dense fog hits flight operations at IGI, 100 flights impacted but none cancelled||The season’s worst fog spell disrupted flight operations at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport early on Friday morning, affecting close to 100 departing flights and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded. However, no incoming flights had to be diverted and no cancellations were reported. Officials said arrangements have been put in place inside the terminal buildings to minimize inconvenience to passengers and they are better prepared to fight the fog menace this season with 100-metre visibility metre— a newly installed equipment that will help them read the vertical profile of the fog, helping in much more accurate prediction.According to the officials from the airport, CAT III low visibility procedures were implemented around 4am on Friday as the runway visual range dropped to as low as 125 meters. The low visibility affected flights scheduled to depart from the airport between 4am and 7am. The delays caused a ripple effect, impacting close to 100 fights, including those scheduled later in the day. However, officials said, none of the incoming flights needed to be diverted to any other airport because of poor visibility in Delhi. “No flights were cancelled due to fog on Friday. The delay that was caused because of poor visibility, normalized by the afternoon as the visibility improved. The fact that the airport is yet to operate at its full capacity owing to the Covid pandemic helped in passenger management,” said an official from the Delhi airport.Fewer flights a reliefOfficials say that fog is expected to be less of a bother for Delhi flyers this year as the airport has only been operating at about 60%-65% of its capacity after the Covid-19 lockdown. An officer from Delhi ATC said the airport used to handle 1,400 flights (departures and arrivals) every day, on average, before the lockdown came into force in March.“At present, we handle about 850-860 flights daily. International flights are also not operating at full capacity. With fewer number of flights, there will be less contest for slots and parking at the airport during a dense fog, so it will also be easier for the ATC to slot them. The end result is less hassle for passengers this year,” the official said.However, he added, that it remains to be seen how many airlines have sufficient number of aircraft and pilots certified for low visibility operations this season.Tech to fight the fog menaceStarting this winter, the meteorological department at the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) has started using a radiometer to read the vertical density of the fog. The whole exercise, senior officials say, will lead to better planning, causing fewer last-minute flight cancellations and delays. The results, they said, will be seen probably by the end of January.The radiometer, installed atop the new air traffic control (ATC) tower, is also known as the “100-metre visibility metre”. A senior official from the Delhi airport, who is aware of the development, said this instrument needs to be installed at least 100-metre above ground level for accurate readings.“As our Delhi ATC tower is 101.9 metres tall, the instrument has been installed atop the tower. Its readings are used to study the vertical profile of the fog, according to which low visibility procedures are implemented. It will also help us decide more efficiently whether to implement Cat III or CAT IIIB operations (in low visibility) during the dense fog,” the official said.The instrument was installed before winter and will contribute to the fog analysis starting this year. “This will directly help authorities in determining on what level, low visibility measures need to be implemented and for what duration. Airlines and airport operators can use such information effectively to ensure minimum inconvenience to flyers,” said a second official.Arrangements for social distancingThe Delhi airport operator, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) has also made arrangements to minimize inconvenience to the stranded passengers and ensure social distancing inside the terminal buildings.“We are currently handling 83,000 passengers a day. In view of the pandemic, Terminal 3 is at present is handling 18 flights every hour while Terminal 2 is handling nine flights an hour. This is in conjunction with other safety measures in place to provide a safe environment to flyers. DIAL is abiding by all social distancing protocols and progressively enhancing terminal capacity,” a DIAL spokesperson said.At present, only two of the three terminals of Delhi airport are functional. In order to accommodate more passengers when fog hits, the airport operator is planning to reopen Terminal 1 that is closed for ongoing expansion work.DIAL said while T2 and T3 have already been recommissioned, plans to recommission T1, to meet the growing passenger footfall, is in progress.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) that secures the Delhi airport has also started to mobilise its force for when Terminal 1 resumes functioning. Sachin Badshah, deputy inspector general (IGI airport), CISF, said they are ready to make the T1 force operational as and when told to. “Our security arrangements are in place for when the terminal resumes operations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dense-fog-hits-flight-operations-at-igi-100-flights-impacted-but-none-cancelled/story-0X809GMFb4p7tOztesD6eP.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||Nagar Kirtan, dance performance mark otherwise muted New Year celebrations at Singhu Border||A seven-kilometre-long Nagar Kirtan attended by hundreds of farmers marked New Year at Singhu Border on Friday as protesters rung in the new year amid muted celebrations. This is the first Nagar Kirtan — a religious procession meant to mark a special occasion — organised at the border protest site by the Sikh farmers, after they had to give the ritual a pass during Guru Nanak Jayanti on November 30.The procession was headed by a tractor pulling a large customised trolley that was heavily decked with flowers and carried at least six people chanting hymns and distributing prasad. The tractor was followed by hundreds of devotees on foot, some Nihang Sikhs riding on horses, followed by other devotees riding modified vehicles. “If we were in Punjab, we would have had the Nagar Kirtan on the New Year day. Since we are settled here now, we thought it would be feasible to have the Nagar Kirtan on this day,” said one of the organisers, Jagdeesh Singh, who is from Jaldiyala in Jalandhar district of Punjab.The procession began around noon on Friday and slowly crawled its way through the maze of vehicles and people gathered at Singhu Border.Among the vehicles which were a part of the procession was a Maruti Alto modified into an open-air vehicle and a 1958-make modified Villy Jeep, which carried eight devotees.“Our New Year celebrations will happen when the government agrees to our demand. Until then, we will keep any festivities limited to religious rituals and speeches,” said Khushwant Singh Sidhu, who belongs to Jagraon village in Ludhiana. Apart from the Nagar Kirtan, another smaller function included a dance performance by a Haryana farmer. “No one wanted to celebrate the New Year here. So, I decided to put up a performance for my farmer friends from Punjab and my state,” said the performer Chand Singh, a farmer from Kathura village in nearby Sonepat, amid hookah puffs. Farmers at the borders said call dropping had been a big challenge for them on Thursday night as they tried calling back home to wish their families for New Year. Paramjeet Singh, from Rampursunra village in Phagwara, said that the five Wi-Fi points arranged by the Delhi government recently were not enough to cater to the huge number of farmers present in the area. “We usually go to sleep here by 10.30-11 pm. But last night we stayed awake until 2 am just to wish our families. I could connect to them only around 2am after repeated attempts,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nagar-kirtan-dance-performance-mark-otherwise-muted-new-year-celebrations-at-singhu-border/story-yquqwv7Me7ZlTWOGL1d6WO.html

Complainant Altaf Khan, a resident of Jewar, had got himself operated for removal of stone in his right kidney on March 24, 2018, at a private hospital in Greater Noida. However, even after the operation his abdomen pain continued, Khan told the consumer commission. Two days later, he got his X-ray done in the same hospital and it was revealed that stone was still present in right kidney. However, doctors at the hospital did not inform him about the report, Khan said. After a few days, besides abdomen pain, blood stains were noticed in his urine and he again went to the hospital where doctors advised him for stent. He got the stent fixed and was discharged on April 9, 2018. Khan said that he was asked to come on May 15, 2018, for removal of the stent. He went to the hospital on that day and got the stent removed.Next day on May 16, Kahn again had pain in abdomen and blood stains started coming in urine. He then got his ultrasound done on May 20 at another private hospital at Jewar. In the ultrasound report, two stones of 11.5mm and 18mm were reported, beside several small stones, he told the consumer forum.He then went to the hospital at Greater Noida and showed the ultrasound report. Doctors said fresh stones have been developed and another operation has to be done to remove these new stones. He was told that he would have to pay for operation, tests and medicines afresh. Then Khan approached the district consumer commission which gave several notices to the hospital but did not get any response from there. The district consumer commission comprising its president Anil Kumar Pundir and member Daya Shankar Pandey observed that the hospital has committed a deficiency of service by not providing proper treatment.“The hospital has been directed to refund the treatment amount paid, along with 6% interest. Besides, ₹1 lakh towards physical and mental harassment and financial loss, and ₹1,000 towards legal expenses too has to be paid by the hospital to the complainant in 60 days,” said Pundir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-district-consumer-commission-directs-pvt-hospital-to-pay-1-lakh-to-patient-for-deficiency-of-service/story-QRYLhPnZ1cBuTM45gu8lGJ.html

01-01-2021||Noida||At Chilla border, farmers vow to continue fight, welcome New Year with folk dances||Noida: A group of farmers protesting at the Chilla border (Noida-Delhi link road) on Friday vowed to continue their protest against the Centre’s new farm bills amid the bone-chilling cold. The farmers also organised folk dances to welcome the New Year. Tarun Sharma, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu), said, “We have been on protest for over a month against the farm bills. The government is adamant on its stand while the farmers are also ready to continue their fight. The temperature has fallen in the last few days but we have resolved to continue our struggle. On January 1, we offered red roses to police personnel and media people. We also organised a Ragini (folk dance) programme to entertain the protesters.” The supporters and members of BKU (Bhanu) have been protesting at the Chilla border since January 1. On Friday too, the Noida-Delhi road remained close due to the protest. The protesting farmers at Dalit Prerna Sthal distributed ‘kheer’ on the occasion of New Year, and continued with their struggle. Dr SK Giri, general secretary of BKU (Lok Shakti), said that our farmers continued protest at Dalit Prerna Sthal. “We heard that a farmer died due to heart attack at the UP gate on Friday. The farmers’ health and well being is important as the temperature is falling. On Friday, we called a doctor to check up on protesting farmers. The doctor advised farmers to observe precautions,” he said. The farmers were seen keeping themselves warm with bonfire and hookah at the Dalit Prerna Sthal. A group of street players also performed there to entertain the protesters. BKU (Lok Shakti) president Master Shyoraj Singh said that the protest will continue till the government withdraws all the three farm laws and gives in written about MSP. The farmers are protesting against the three farm laws --The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act -- for over one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/at-chilla-border-farmers-vow-to-continue-fight-welcome-new-year-with-folk-dances/story-yNFNA1HRbFsGA6oMpNtbWM.html
01-01-2021||Noida||UP Gate gets first ‘women only’ camp, more help arrives as weather goes adverse||Ghaziabad: Arshdeep Kaur, a second year law student studying in Bengaluru, is nowadays managing the first “women only” camp at the UP Gate. The facility set up recently at the protest site can accommodate over 100 women and children, said Arshdeep. She said that there were major issues for women protesters and her sister Ravneet Kaur initiated the process with help from various voluntary organisations. The UP Gate protest site is an open area away from localities, markets and other facilities. Hundreds of women are taking part in the protest and even helping out preparation of food at ‘langars’ (community kitchen). However, Ravneet found that the women are facing issues such as lack of washrooms and bathing area. “So, we came up with the special camp which now has the capacity for stay of over 100 women who can stay here along with their children. There are all arrangements of daily use items which include bedrolls, blankets, sweaters, slippers and even shoes. The women from our camp also go for having food at a langar which is just located outside,” Arshdeep, a native of Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, said, adding that she has to skip her studies to come to UP Gate. “We have also arranged for cabin bathrooms and the keys are given only to women occupants who wish to use the facility. So, with the help of exclusive camp and bathrooms, the women also have privacy and stay comfortably in adverse weather conditions here,” she said. Over the past one month, the UP Gate has evolved in a small self-sustaining township with hundreds of camps, tractor-trolleys and other makeshift tents being stationed at the site for stay of protesting farmers. The site also has dozens of langars and medical camps running which never run out of supplies. Many farmers have also taken shelter in their tractor-trolleys which serve as a safe house in the chill. In this connection, United Sikhs, a UN affiliated international non-profit organisation, has come up with a major stock room where essential items, along with washing machines and fire extinguishers, are available for the needy protesters at the UP Gate. “Initially, we set up the facility at Singhu Border, and now it has been set up at the UP Gate too. Here, we have stocked items like fire extinguishers, blankets, slippers, shoes, ready-to-cook food items, tents, sleeping bags, and bedrolls. Besides, we have a small physiotherapy centre who takes care of farmers who come with complaints of pain, etc,” said Praminder Singh, the in-charge of the stock room. He said that the idea is to keep up with the availability of items in case anyone needs it any time of day or night. The organisation has also made available some common medicines which come in handy for basic treatment, he said. The protesters at the UP Gate site are battling odds in adverse weather conditions while different organisations have come forward to provide basic items to them. Delhi on the New Year’s eve experienced the lowest temperature in 15 year which plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said that their “key demands” of rollback of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price will be taken up in the next meeting scheduled on January 4 with the government. “The farmers are staying despite all odds and adverse weather conditions. Only two of our demands have been met, but the key demands of repeal of laws and new law on MSP are still pending. These will be taken up on January 4. We already have plans for march to Delhi on January 26 and will also tie up cattle at police stations if our volunteers are stopped by police from coming here,” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and BKU spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-gate-gets-first-women-only-camp-more-help-arrives-as-weather-goes-adverse/story-kpZKaJWf6ewXoeEcSntWTO.html

Dr Kakkar said ensuring the Covid vaccination process is carried out smoothly will be his top priority.Dr Kakkar, who is an eye surgeon, was earlier posted as civil surgeon in Barnala. He is not new to the city and was also posted at Ludhiana civil hospital and later served as senior medical officer (SMO) at civil hospital, Jagraon.He said that the mock drill of the vaccination process has already been carried out successfully. “Residents of Ludhiana have shown caution and managed to plug the second wave of Covid. However, I will urge them to continue wearing masks, maintain social distancing and wash hands,” he added.The civil surgeon said upgrading the infrastructure of civil hospital and other health centres is also a priority. Earlier, four ventilators that were allocated to civil hospitals were being operated by Christian Medical College and Hospital, as there was not enough staff to monitor them.

The civic body is also involving residents by conducting awareness drives,” Sabharwal said.The civic body has also been struggling to impose a complete ban on plastic carry bags since the state government banned them in 2016. Sabharwal said that working on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a complete ban on use of plastic carry bags in the city will be imposed strictly from this year and residents will be apprised of the alternatives. Awareness drives will be conducted and hefty challans will be issued against violators.Sabharwal said that apart from polluting the environment, plastic carry bags also choke the sewer system especially during monsoons. “Completing the ongoing development works, especially those being taken up under Smart City Project, and taking up more development works as per the needs of residents is also a priority,” said Sabharwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cleaning-buddha-nullah-banning-plastic-carry-bags-on-ludhiana-mc-s-agenda-for-2021/story-i1B5DgHbd5HfvHcLjUFMdN.html

01-01-2021||Gurugram||Manesar civic body starts mechanised sweeping of roads||A week after its formation, the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) started its first-ever on-ground operations on Friday with mechanised cleaning of roads across Manesar.Three mechanised sweeping machines of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) were launched from IMT Manesar Chowk for sweeping the roads in the Manesar area.The MCG also launched four mechanised sweeping machines of its own on Friday to provide better coverage. These were launched from Daultabad and Bhondsi villages respectively.All the seven sweeping machines were launched as part of MCG’s Swachhata Abhiyan.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the three machines covering Manesar areas will operate in the daytime and return to Gurugram in the evening.So far, the MCM has only 22 staff members. All of them are already posted as officials in the MCG and have been given additional responsibilities of the MCM. This also includes MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, who has also been appointed as the commissioner of the Manesar civic body.With the MCG already stretched in terms of manpower and resources, the additional responsibility of executing civic services in Manesar may lead to a major impact in civic projects across Gurugram.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, until 2022, MCM will continue to remain heavily dependent on MCG for its daily operations.Singh was appointed MCM’s first chief on Monday, while the other 21 senior MCG officials including the additional municipal commissioner, deputy municipal commissioner, chief town planner, senior medical officer, and officials from the engineering, electrical, taxation, and sanitary wings were given additional charges of MCM on Wednesday.As per MCG officials, the timing of this could not have come at a worse time for the civic body,which itself is reeling under a major staff crisis. Currently, charges of five out of ten executive engineers of the MCG have been withdrawn following allegations of corruption, discrepancies, and negligence. This has resulted in the remaining engineers holding multiple posts.Further, charges of many assistant engineers and junior engineers of the MCG have also been withdrawn on similar grounds.As per MCG officials, the commissioner himself is overburdened. Besides heading two municipal corporations, Singh is also the chief administrator of the Sheetla Devi Shrine Board, and the district municipal commissioner of Gurugram. Under the district municipal commissioner’s role, Singh also heads the municipal bodies located in Sohna, Farrukhnagar, Hailey Mandi, and Pataudi.Furthermore, MCG’s own area has also expanded. A total of 16 villages located along Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) and Dwarka Expressway has been added last week, stretching the MCG’s limited resources even further.“MCM’s dependency on the MCG will remain only for a short period of time until the transition period is over. The MCM will then become a completely independent body. It is important to understand that the experience and learning which MCG officials possess will be vital in the formative period of MCM as they can ensure that the new civic body does not make the same mistakes as the MCG did,” said Vinay Pratap Singh.Singh acknowledged that the multiple charges and sharing of resources may affect the progress of MCG initially. However, he stressed that the long-term benefits will yield higher returns.“Two strong civic bodies adjoining each other will have long-term benefits. Especially at times of crisis, such as flooding, the two bodies can jointly make preparations and share their resources to tackle the situation similar to the arrangements the MCG and GMDA have. Further, they together can also execute projects together, such as hypothetically creating a new drainage channel,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/manesar-civic-body-starts-mechanised-sweeping-of-roads/story-IkR8MCuH0z9mpcCMcmJXRM.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers gather in Rewari, plan Delhi march on Jan 4||Over 2,000 farmers from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana and members of trade unions on Friday gathered at Bawal in Rewari. The farmers at Bawal were seen asking their counterparts in Shahjhanapur to join them so that they could hold a meeting and proceed towards Delhi on January 4.On Thursday, farmers had broken the barricades at Shahjahanpur and they had entered Rewari on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, crossing the Shahjahanpur interstate border in Rajasthan, as the police were not letting them enter Haryana.Hundreds of commuters were stuck on both carriageways of the highway for around two hours on Thursday before the police removed the barricades and let commuters move towards Delhi, and then towards Jaipur.Gurugram Police on Friday put in place tight security at the border with Rewari to ensure no protesters cross the border to enter the district. The arrangements could lead to traffic snarls until January 4, said police.The police said they have received information that protesters intended to block the expressway to Delhi on January 4, due to which they have deployed over 700 personnel in two shifts at all checkpoints with the national capital and another 700 at borders with Rewari and Nuh. The Haryana Police have tightened security at 13 border points with districts neighbouring Gurugram, officials said.All police personnel have also been given instructions to check vehicles heading to Delhi from other districts for protesters.Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “We are coordinating with our counterparts in Rewari district and will not let anyone block the carriageways or cross the border. We have started checking at all borders. Patrolling vehicles are taking rounds on the expressway and borders and special teams have been formed from Sirhaul border to Bilaspur, to keep a check on vehicles.”Five police control room (PCR) vans and six motorbikes have also been stationed at the Sirhaul border, Kherki Daula toll plaza, Sohna Road and Bilaspur crossing to deal with any situation that may arise, Modi said.Also, crime units have been deployed to keep a tight vigil to maintain the law and order, police said, adding that additional forces are also on the standby.Modi said that they have deployed extra forces on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway as farmers might take this route as well. “All routes leading to Gurugram and Delhi have been barricaded and deployment at all checkpoints is increased,” she said.Haryana Police allegedly lathi-charged the protestors on Thursday and used water cannons, mild force and released tear gas to stop them. However, more than 20 tractors and hundreds of farmers were able to cross the border and enter Bawal in Rewari.The community leaders have requested the police to let them cross the stretch peacefully and have tried to pacify the protestors but police at the borders have set up barricades and have refused to allow movement of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-gather-in-rewari-plan-delhi-march-on-jan-4/story-G7VulXiLuvZQEqzoIMke3J.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||City schools welcome CBSE schedule for exams||Schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) across the city have welcomed the board exam schedule for classes 10 and 12 that was announced on Thursday. Most schools said that the schedule will allow them to hold practical sessions for students and they will also get sufficient time to prepare for the exams. Schools have been holding online classes since last March, when they were closed amid the coronavirus disease. Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday announced that CBSE class 10 and 12 board exams will be conducted between May 4, 2021, and June 10, 2021. The practical examinations will begin on March 1 and the results will be announced by July 15, 2021. Routinely, CBSE board examinations are conducted between February and March every year. However, this year, due to the closure of schools in view of the pandemic, the examination schedule has been delayed. Schools across the country were closed last March and classes are being held remotely to contain the spread of Covid-19. While schools in Haryana reopened for physical classroom sessions in October, some states are yet to restart schools for in-person sessions. Ramanjit Khinda, school headmistress, Kunskapsskolan International, said that while the school had been preparing students keeping in view the routine exam schedule, it was more comfortably placed now. “We were not lagging behind earlier either. However, practical sessions were a concern. Now, we think we will be getting enough time to take things forward comfortably with the students,” said Khinda. She added that the school is currently amid a winter break and decisions pertaining to the practical sessions would be taken before the school reopens. “We are on a break right now. We will discuss and take decisions in view of the board schedule that has been announced. We will be thinking about giving some practical hands-on learning to students even though we have been conducting virtual sessions till now,” she said. Nidhi Kapoor, the principal of Euro International School, said that the board had given sufficient time and children were happy with the examination schedule. “Students are happy since there is clarity on the schedule now and they will get a bit more time to prepare. We will also be starting physical classroom sessions for board classes from January 15, thrice a week, so that they are able to clarify doubts and get writing practice,” said Kapoor. She said that students who were lagging behind would get additional support through these classes. Aditi Misra, principal, Delhi Public School, Sector 45, said that the school had not conducted pre-board exams so far and would be able to plan the same now that a timeline for the board exams has been announced. “We were waiting for the board to declare the timeline for the exams. We will be able to plan our pre-board exams while taking cognisance of the timeline. Until now, we were only having tests,” said Misra. Yash Handa, a class 12 student at KR Mangalam World School, South City-1, said that while some students are apprehensive over holding exams in a pandemic year, most were happy with the schedule since they would get sufficient time to prepare. “Some students are happy because the schedule gives plenty of time to prepare for exams. Others are worried that the exams might get delayed again due to a new wave of Covid-19. Largely, we are satisfied since there is sufficient time to prepare. However, since exams are happening late, we might have issues applying to colleges since entrances start early,” said Handa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-schools-welcome-cbse-schedule-for-exams/story-OPlsc0CuYpIkdQcDHhrcyO.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||1,400 people to help administer Covid-19 vaccine, says health department||An estimated workforce of over 1,400 people will be required to carry out the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Gurugram once the vaccine is rolled out, according to the senior health officials. These are in addition to 286 vaccinators who will be administering the Covid-19 vaccine shots. The health department has also sought help from officials of the district administration, Gurugram police, women and child development, and education departments to provide their staff for deploying them as vaccination officers at the 181 vaccination sites that have been finalised.At the state-level too, preparations are in full swing. In Panchkula, for example, a vaccination trial run will be held on Saturday as a part of the pan-India dry run.For the appropriate management of vaccination sites in district, teams of vaccinators and vaccination officers are being formed to address a wide range of issues — from crowd management and document verification to data entry on Co-Win platform and keeping a record of vaccine beneficiaries, said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) during a Covid-19 vaccine task force meeting held on Friday.According to him, every session site will be managed by a five-member team, involving vaccinating officer one, who will be in-charge of pre-checking the registration status and photo identity verification before entering the waiting room. After that, vaccinating officer two will authenticate documents on the Co-WIN system. After the vaccination, vaccinating officers three and four will ensure a 20-minute waiting period to look for adverse events in the beneficiary. Besides, a supervisor for every three to five vaccination sites will be deployed.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “We already have 286 vaccinators. These vaccinators will be accompanied by five people. Based on that additional workforce of 1,430 will be required to carry out vaccine jab. For this, we have asked Gurugram police, women and child development department and district administration to provide the required workforce.”He said, “For vaccination officer one, we have asked Gurugram police to provide the work force. Likewise, district administration has been asked to provide data entry operators of Saral centres to be stationed as vaccinating officer two. For vaccination officers three and four, women and child development department will support with Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs).” According to him, education department have been asked to appoint teachers for the supervision of the sites.Once the vaccine is rolled out, it will be administered three times in a week – Monday, Thursday and Saturday – without disturbing the routine immunisation programme. Currently, the cold chain facility at Pataudi can have a stock of over 250,000 vaccine vials. According to Yadav, the beneficiary will be informed about the vaccination through an SMS providing date, time and location of vaccination. After getting the vaccine jab, the beneficiary will receive a message regrading date and time to get the next booster, which is likely to be after 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/1-400-people-to-help-administer-covid-19-vaccine-says-health-department/story-cuhoKSD6rNW7T5hsBrhxLP.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||Gang had planned 10 abductions to make a quick buck, says police||Fifteen days after an eight-year-old boy was rescued from kidnappers’ clutches in Palwal and two persons were arrested, the police revealed that the gang had pinpointed 10 boys to kidnap to pay off their debts.The eight-year-old was kidnapped from Ullawas in Sector 65 and a ransom of Rs 50 lakh sought. The police said the suspects had planned to target other children from the area, one by one.According to the police, the four suspects, of Palwal and Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, had allegedly agreed to the abductions as the mastermind was under a debt of Rs 5 lakh, said police.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (Gurugram), identified the kingpin as Jagdish Kumar (38), of Mirpur Korali, and his nephew, Mohit alias Bholu (22), of Rasulpur in Palwal.Kumar used to drive an auto-rickshaw to make a living and was finding it difficult to make ends meet due to decreased demand during the lull caused by the pandemic. “He approached Mohit, who used to work at a private clinic near his village, and discussed plans to earn money. After several rounds of discussion, they finally planned to kidnap a minor for ransom,” said Sangwan.The police said that they involved two more relatives and conducted reconnaissance of areas in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram. The gang finally planned to take up a room on rent in Gurugram and zeroed in on Ullawas village, as the rent was low, said police.Sangwan said the suspects started doing rounds of the village and targeted 10 minor boys and started checking the routines of their family members, playtime, number of family members and their financial condition. “They thought of targeting one after another. For luring their target, they roped in a juvenile who was around the same age as their target to play with him and to lure him,” he said.Kumar used to ferry the victim’s mother in his auto-rickshaw regularly to get fresh vegetables from the field and tried to paint a good picture in front of them to gain trust and entry into their home, the police said. This was the only house where there was no CCTV camera installed and they had the money to pay the ransom, the police said.On December 17, the boy was playing outside his house, when he was lured for a ride in the auto-rickshaw. The auto was covered with side curtains and two more suspects boarded the auto while they were moving out of the village.Sangwan said they drove towards village Rasulpur in Palwal, nearly 93 kilometres from the city, in the auto. “As the victim tried to raise the alarm, Mohit injected a drug that rendered him unconsciousness. It took almost two hours to reach the village where they kept the victim inside a private clinic where Mohit used to work,” he said.The suspects were yet to ask for ransom and were planning to visit a local telephone booth, but were traced by the police. Two of them were arrested from the clinic and the boy was recovered.During questioning, the suspects revealed that they targeted the boy as his father drove an SUV and seemed to have a good business. They had also learned that he had recently received a big payment and it was kept at home, the police said.The police have urged residents to stay alert and not to allow their children to step out without informing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gang-had-planned-10-abductions-to-make-a-quick-buck-says-police/story-6LwyLhmXMrmOBvjDtvRYTO.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||Speeding accounts for 43.5% of accidents since 2016, plans afoot to decrease speed limits||With 43 percent of road accidents in the city attributed to speeding, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has proposed a blanket reduction in speed limits across all highways, arterial, sub-arterial and connecting roads in Gurugram. This comes after the GMDA recently finalised the comprehensive mobility management plan (CMMP) for the city. As per the data provided in the CMMP, a total of 5,192 accidents occurred on Gurugram roads between 2016 and August 2020. In 2018, Gurugram also reported the highest number of road accidents in the state. “While the total numbers of accidents are declining from 2016 to 2019, with an annual growth rate of 3.7%, it has to decrease a lot to reach the Haryana vision zero policy (sic),” the CMMP states.Of these total accidents, speeding was found to be the cause of 43.5 percent of accidents, while another 39.8 percent of the accidents were attributed to “careless driving”. In comparison, drink driving and overtaking only constituted a fraction of the total number of accidents. Moreover, “about 62% of the accidents occurred during 6pm to 6am where the road users can achieve the maximum speeds on the network and that could be one of the major reasons for over-speeding in the city,” the CMMP states.Pataudi Road, Sohna Road, NH-48, Delhi-Jaipur Expressway and Golf Course Road were found to be the most dangerous stretches in the city with Pataudi Road and NH-48 recording the highest number of fatalities, as per the CMMP. The most dangerous blackspots, each with at least 20 fatalities recorded since 2016, include the Sidhrawali exit in Bilaspur, IMT Manesar Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Pachgaon Chowk, Farrukhnagar Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk. Four of these locations fall under NH-48.Faced with such a scenario, officials said there is an urgent need to “rationalise” the present speed limits in the GMDA’s areas of jurisdictions. “The baseline for what is an acceptable speed needs to be lowered. The data is quite clear about this. The highest permissible speed limits will be imposed on access controlled stretches where lane discipline is better observed, such as highways. On streets,which provide access to mixed land use sectors, speed limits will be more stringent. Sensitive zones, such as around schools and hospitals, will also be marked out,” said an official with the GMDA’s mobility department, preferring anonymity.Gurugram’s current speed limits apply to state highways, national highways and all roads within municipal limits. While national highways have a maximum speed limit of 90kmph for cars, 50kmph for motorcycles and 50kmph for trucks, state highways cap the speed limit at 80kmph for cars, 50kmph for motorcycles and 50kmph for trucks. Within municipal limits, the speed limit for cars and two wheelers is 50kmph, while it is 30kmph for two-wheelers.As part of the GMDA’s rationalised speed limits, the upper limit for cars will be capped at 70kmph on access-controlled arterial highways, such as the NH-48 and the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway. On access*controlled arterial roads, where there are graded pedestrian lanes, the upper limit is proposed to be capped at 60kmph. On partially access-controlled arterial streets in areas with medium built-up density, the proposed speed limit is 40kmph, while connector roads which pass through residential areas will have an upper speed limit of 30kmph.However, it remains uncertain when these new speed limits will be enacted. “We first need to conduct detailed speed studies on key road stretches, which should commence as part of Phase-1 of the CMMP’s implementation. The proposed speed limits need to be tested and refined. At the moment, only observational studies have been done which revealed that speed limits are not only flouted, but also poorly implemented. A dedicated traffic and road management cell under the GMDA has been proposed. Once these cells have been constituted under the GMDA Act they will take the matter forward,” said the GMDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/speeding-accounts-for-43-5-of-accidents-since-2016-plans-afoot-to-decrease-speed-limits/story-sGr5yah0sX4t4jLnx7CPcM.html
01-01-2021||Gurugram||Cold wave conditions to abate as city expected to see a rise in temperature: MeT||The city might get some reprieve from the cold with the temperature expected to rise from Saturday onwards, as per the India Meteorological Department(IMD). As per the IMD’s forecast, the minimum temperature is expected to hover between 5 degrees and 6 degree Celsius on January 2 and 3 respectively. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the relief from the cold was on the cards with the temperature expected to rise from Saturday. “We will see a rise in temperature starting from tomorrow (Saturday). In the next 4-5 days, cold wave conditions will abate,” said Srivastava. The city’s minimum temperature settled at 4.1 degrees Celsius on Friday — three degrees below the normal, according to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory in Delhi. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the city’s temperature on Friday. The Palam observatory, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The maximum temperature was recorded at 17.2 degrees — two degrees below the normal. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, light rain is likely on Saturday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 19 degrees Celsius and five degrees Celsius respectively, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.Air quality in the city deteriorated to its worst in at least two weeks, with a reading of 376 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, indicating “very poor” air. This is up from 317 (also ‘very poor’) the previous day. Gurugram did, however, remain the least polluted city in the NCR, with Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Delhi all recording “severe” air on Friday. Manesar, as has been the case throughout this winter season, reported cleaner air than Gurugram on Friday, with 329 on the AQI bulletin (up from Thursday’s ‘poor’ reading of 252). As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain in upper end of Very Poor to Severe category on 01.01.2021 owing to extremely unfavourable ventilation conditions for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to improve on 02.01.2021 and reach from Severe to Very Poor category (sic).” However, with another bout of rain and strong winds predicted on January 3, the region may see a significant improvement in air quality early next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cold-wave-conditions-to-abate-as-city-expected-to-see-a-rise-in-temperature-met/story-GTvbIXCORBtUIcNziLY0YK.html

The family members have alleged that the man is responsible for the suicide and that the woman was depressed since Diwali after he refused to marry her. The woman’s family also claimed that some members of the suspect’s family were behind the suicide and that they had mixed poison with tea or juice that was offered to the woman. On the basis of a complaint filed by the woman’s family, a case has been filed under sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at the Sector 29 police station. The woman, according to police, was working at a beauty parlour for the last year and had befriended the man six months ago. The suspect had initially promised to marry her but allegedly refused to do so two months ago. “She becomes friends with the man, who had promised marriage. On Diwali, she was at home when she informed us that he was refusing to marry her and that she was very disturbed,” said a relative, adding that she wanted to return to their home town in Uttar Pradesh. The family members alleged on December 23, the man’s sister called her on the pretext of helping her and poisoned her. The woman was found dead on December 24 and a case was registered on December 31. Aman Kumar, the station house officer (SHO) of Sector 29, said it seems like the woman had consumed poison after the man refused to marry her. “Initial investigation suggests that the deceased committed suicide due to relationship issues. However, the police are investigating all aspects of the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/25-year-old-woman-dies-by-suicide/story-MoqMautZiYnnGw9q78FcHN.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Residents rue lack of safety measures at construction sites in Ludhiana||At a time when multiple development projects are being taken up the municipal corporation (MC) including Pakhowal Road ROB/RUB project, reconstruction of BRS Nagar canal bridge and transformation of Malhar Road into a smart one, residents have raised concern over improper safety measures at the construction sites which may be dangerous for commuters, especially during foggy nights. Residents said that lives of commuters are being put at risk in absence of three-layer barricading and reflective tapes and LED lights at the construction sites. While Pakhowal and Malhar Road projects are being taken up by MC under Smart City Project, the reconstruction of the BRS Nagar canal bridge is being done by the irrigation department, but the funds have been allocated by the civic body.Rahul Verma, member of the Punjab Road Safety Council, said that the construction company has even failed to install early warning boards and lives are being put in jeopardy despite the company charging the department to create traffic diversions. ”There should be three-layer barricading at all construction sites wherein plastic barricading is placed at the first point, iron barricades at second and then concrete boulders are kept. On moving towards the construction site, the commuters should first hit the plastic barricading and stop. If one directly hits the boulder or iron barricades, it might prove fatal. Further, no early warning boards have been installed in the city to alert commuters,” Verma said.He added that sand bags have been kept at BRS Nagar canal bridge with no reflective tape or LED lights installed. Similar violations are also seen at Malhar Road where a motorcyclist fell into a pit dug by the authorities to install pipelines recently. Karandeep Singh, a resident of Karnail Singh Nagar, said, “A lot of accidents take place when conditions are foggy and the authorities should take note of the issue before any accidents takes place at the construction sites. The residents of the city might be aware of the construction works, but outsiders are not, and they might end up in fatal accidents” Despite several attempts, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-proper-safety-measures-at-construction-sites-puts-the-lives-of-commuters-in-jeopardy/story-0GfGrgalfZMcfvRod2B3jL.html

01-01-2021||Delhi||Venturing out? Night curfew is on Jan 1 as well||It’s known that there was a night curfew on New Year’s Eve in Delhi, just like some other states such as Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan. But, if you are planning to venture out today, to party till late on the first day of the New Year, or just to get weekend vibes right at the start of 2021, then must know that the order for night curfew as issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority, also imposed a night curfew in the Capital on January 1, 2021. As part of this, no public gatherings are allowed in Delhi today as well starting 11pm until 6am of January 2. “A detailed assessment of the situation in Delhi has been made and considering the threat posed by the mutant UK strain of Covid-19 virus and after observing the local incidents of Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi, it is apprehended that gatherings, congregations, and public celebrations of New Year pose a considerable threat of the spread of the virus and may cause a setback to the appreciable gains made in the suppression of chain of transmission of Covid-19 cases in Delhi,” the statement read. The order ruined plans for many a party lovers yesterday, and same will be the case tonight as well. Pankaj Gupta, a Dwarka-based entrepreneur, says, “For the last three years, our after party place has been India Gate. This time we also planned to visit India Gate together in a group after having a party in local pub in our area, but the curfew has totally ruined our plan. Now, it seems that we will be going back home after dinner.” Sharing a similar sentiment, Ojasv Tyagi, a Gurugram resident, says, “Earlier my plan was to roam around in Delhi on New Year’s Eve, but those got postponed. I didn’t know I wouldn’t be able to do than on Jan 1 as well! I’ll limit myself to Gurugram now. In fact I’ve asked my friends in Delhi to join me here in Gurugram for the long weekend.” Restaurateurs in Delhi have also chalked out a different plan, after this announcement. “We understand the zeal, but keeping in mind the guidelines laid down by the government, little changes have been implemented. Our managers personally called up everyone yesterday to inform them about this order. Everything for the New Year’s Eve remained the same, but plans were advanced by an hour.

01-01-2021||Kolkata||Visva Bharati administration stopped from building wall along road connecting Satiniketan, Sriniketan||The administration in West Bengal’s Birbhum district on Friday issued an order, asking Visva Bharati authorities to immediately stop the construction of a wall along a road - which connects the twin towns of Santiniketan and Sriniketan.District Magistrate Vijay Bharti, who inspected the area on Thursday, said the wall, if built, could hinder people’s movement along the route.Locals had long been using the route, and no restriction can be imposed all of a sudden, he said, adding that problems need to be solved amicably through discussions.Visva-Bharati authorities, however, refused to comment on the matter.The administration has also taken over another road -- connecting Upasana Griho to Kalisayar More -- from Visva- Bharati, which was inaugurated in 2017.Several heritage buildings, including the Rabindra Bhavan museum, and monumental sculptures -- the ones built by artist Ramkinkar Baij -- dot the 2.9-km road.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, during her recent visit to Bolpur, had said that the Public Works Department would take back the possession of the road from the varsity.Authorities of the central university had recently drawn the ire of Banerjee, after media reports suggested that vice chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty accused Nobel laureate Amartya Sen of illegally occupying land.Last year, the state had locked horns with Visva- Bharati officials over erection of a wall around the Poush Mela ground, in the vicinity of the varsity campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/visva-bharati-administration-stopped-from-building-wall-along-road-connecting-satiniketan-sriniketan/story-8AMpGBZWPO95Y7y3uXTZWL.html
01-01-2021||Bangalore||‘Yediyurappa’s assertion on completing term indication of worry’: Congress||Congress Karnataka president D K Shivakumar on Friday said Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s self-certification about completing his tenure was an indication about the “danger” that is worrying him.“What was the need for a Chief Minister to say that he will remain in the post for remaining two-and-half years? Did any of us question? Let him be there for two years or one year...,” Shivakumar said.Speaking to reporters here, he said maybe some worry is troubling him and that’s the reason why the Chief Minister is making such statements. “His (Yediyurappa’s) own MLAs (from (BJP) are saying that a new leader will come after January 15.If a time has come for the Chief Minister to give certification to himself, it is then evident that somewhere something was dangerous,” he added. The KPCC President was responding to a question on Yediyurappa’s assertion that he would complete his term.There has been intense speculation in some quarters that the BJP high command is mulling leadership change in Karnataka in the days to come considering Yediyurappa’s age (77), which the party has dismissed.Stating that he was satisfied with the Congress’ performance in the Gram Panchayat polls, Shivakumar claimed the party and workers despite pressure, also misuse of money and power from the ruling party, worked efficiently and got a “good result”.“Despite being in opposition we have got good numbers,” he said, adding that from January 5 to 18 he will be touring across the state and 2021 will be the “Year of organisation” and “Year of Struggle” for Congressmen.Hitting out at the government for its “failure” in containing the UK variant of coronavirus, Shivakumar wanted to know what was the difficulty in checking travellers at the airport itself.“It is basic common sense.This shows how much the administration has failed,” he said as he blamed the Central and the state governments for the spread of the virus alleging they failed in implementing control measures in the early stages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/yediyurappa-s-assertion-on-completing-term-indication-of-worry-congress/story-s6xhbGjKyxMBWlcbx6cJzK.html

01-01-2021||City||Children join farmers on Delhi’s borders to ring in New Year||Tikri Bhagat Singh, 12, of Buwana village in Haryana’s Jind is among hundreds of other children, who have joined the farmers’ agitation on Delhi’s borders to celebrate the new-year with parents and other farmers.On Thursday, around 1035pm, Bhagat, along with Aditya Kumar, of Bahu Akbarpur village, and a couple of elderly protesters were using firewood to keep themselves warm near the main stage of the protest site. The celebrations had been done and dusted in the morning, with young farmers and elderly protesters driving their tractors around the site of their stir, while playing Haryanvi Ragnis (folk songs), with hookah in hand. Some youngsters were seen dancing, while standing on tractor-trolleys. Farmers from Punjab danced near their tents on Punjabi songs.Bhagat arrived at the Tikri border on Wednesday and says his father Balwant, who owns 3 acre of their ancestral land, has been camping here for 16 days.“Our family used to celebrate new-year at our village, but this time, my father and I are here. I know little about these laws, but our elders are saying that these will wipe-out the farming community and some businessmen will snatch our land. My father told me that this year, we suffered a huge loss in paddy, because prices have fallen. The government should accept farmers’ demand, otherwise we will also not go back,” Bhagat added.Kumar, a Class-8 student, said he was proud that as a farmer’s son that he had joined the agitation on eve of the new year. “We (kids) helped protesters by offering them tea, water, milk, medicine and by doing errands like folding carpets every morning and evening. I have not joined online classes for the past five days. If farming and land is snatched from our parents, from where we will get money for education and food. We have learnt a few slogans here. These are Modi-Khattar Kisan Virodhi (Modi-Khattar Oppose Farmers), Sadda Haq Ethe Rakh (Hand over our rights) and a few others,” he added.Kumar said it was difficult for them to spend cold nights in tents, but the enthusiasm of the elderly inspired them to stay put. Balbir Singh, a farmer from Jhajjar, said farmers had decided not to celebrate new-year function at night, as they feared miscreants would gain entry and malign their image of protesters. Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda also visited the Tikri border on Friday to celebrate the New Year with protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/children-join-farmers-on-delhi-s-borders-to-ring-in-new-year/story-s2FW0kpESxP0ng19jjNQTP.html

01-01-2021||Mumbai||CM Thackeray says nobody can question Mumbai Police’s efficiency||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday praised the Mumbai Police saying nobody can raise a question mark over their efficiency, and added that he would never allow anyone to malign their image.He also said that the police force led from the front during the coronavirus pandemic in order to ensure the safety of people.Thackeray was speaking during a programme held at the Mumbai Police Commissioner’s office here, in which people were returned their stolen belongings, recovered by the police.“There is no end to the accomplishments of the Mumbai Police and the tradition of policing dates back to 150 years.With this long tradition and their efficiency, no matter how much one tries, he will not be able to malign their image andI promise that if anyone attempts to do so, I will not allow that to happen,” he said. “The mouths of those who tried to defame the Mumbai police were shut as the police’s accomplishments are huge,” he said.“During the pandemic, police worked hard, due to which thousands of these personnel contracted the infection, with some of them getting martyred in the line of duty,” he said.It is only because of police and other frontline workers that the Covid-19 situation came under control, the CM said.“During the lockdown, we had asked everyone to work from home. But imagine what would have happened if the police were also allowed to do so,” Thackeray said.“The threat of COVID-19 still persists. The pandemic is far from over yet. But some people criticise us for keeping some places shut. People should at least understand their responsibility while police, doctors, nurses are performing their duty in such difficult times,” he added.Citizens can celebrate their festivals only because of the police, who remain alert all the time and keep the common man safe, he said.During the programme, the CM felicitated some Covid-19 warrior police personnel. Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and other senior officials were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-thackeray-says-none-can-question-mumbai-police-s-efficiency/story-SFD4N8BT4YE92lF3UlhzyK.html

01-01-2021||Pune||Slam Dunk: Minicourts in ballroooms; NBA teams on Cov offense||The NBA was one of the first major sports leagues to organise a “bubble” format leading to successful completion of its season, and giving other leagues a roadmap to follow. Despite the success of this bubble in Orlando and the current rapid rise in Covid cases in the US, the recently started 2020-21 NBA season will not be played in a bubble. This presents a litany of challenges to NBA teams, as staffs and coaches aim to prepare their teams to be in the best possible shape to win games. One of the biggest current changes to the NBA season this year, in comparison to others, has been the logistics of organising and completing daily Covid testing for all players and staff members of every team. A rigorous testing protocol ensures that players are not in contact with any staff members or coaches until they have tested negative every morning. This heavily impacts training schedules and sleep schedules of players. In an interesting display of ingenuity, a lot of teams have resorted to converting hotel ballroom spaces into mini-courts to walk through game plans and strategy coverages for team defences. Staff members utilise tape to tape down an exact replica of an NBA court (from the 3-point line and inside) on the hotel ballroom carpet, which coaches then utilise to assist players, walking through team strategic schemes on offense and defence. With the shortened offseason, compressed schedule, and rising player salaries, the importance of the physical preparation of players has been heightened even more than usual. With the NBA league revenue likely being drastically lower due to empty arenas without fans, this has made teams even more determined not to lose any money on players missing games due to injuries. In the 2020 NBA season, over $600M in player salaries was lost due to players missing games with injuries. It is critically important in the current season, for close collaboration to exist between coaches and medical staffs in managing player minutes throughout the season, along with practice schedules to ensure players are at their peak for games. Performance and medical groups have placed a large focus on recovery methods with such a short time between games for teams this season. Most teams are facing a 72-game schedule spread over approximately 145 days, which leaves teams with precious little time between games. The usual daily schedule for teams involves morning Covid testing for players, followed by physical preparation and lifting weights prior to practice. Due to restrictions on player numbers and space, teams are required to be very creative with workouts that keep players at low risk of Covid exposure, while keeping them strong for the duration of the season. Post practice, players fuel with specific nutrition designed to promote recovery and prepare them to be in optimal condition for the upcoming game schedule for the season. Finally, another component players and coaches have to adjust to this season is the presence of no fans in the stadiums, and how it influences game flow and gameplay. Fans provide a critical element and energy to ‘live’ sporting events, and the lack of fan interaction and energy can eliminate the home court advantage that is sometimes a deciding factor in a lot of NBA regular season and the playoff games. The reality of no fans means that teams are more intimately familiar with coaches play calls, can hear coverages much more easily and in advance, and this can influence game play due to players being able to anticipate and identify offensive and defensive formations, much more easily than in crowded arenas.

For the last one year, development work has been at the mercy of the Covid-19 pandemic, but 2021, given the civic elections on the horizon, may see several projects in Pune move into overdrive, in terms of completion. The eastern part of Pune city has been facing a water scarcity with many housing societies paying huge bills for water tankers. This scenario is expected to be eased as the Bhama Askhed project is to be launched today. The Metro in Pune city is likely to kick off this year. Work on the tunnels, linking to key routes has been completed with the metro tunnel boring machines doing their job.Pune city has only one government medical college government-backed, B J Medical college, attached to Sassoon Hospital. Now, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is starting its own medical college from the next academic year. This will be based at the Naidu hospital.The five-year tenure of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going to end. Though elections are slated in January 2022, municipal elections are likely to be announced by November 2021. The ruling BJP party will try to get maximum projects inaugurated before the municipal elections. BJP won with a record majority in the 2017 municipal elections. Now, the Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) is in power at the state. Pune district guardian minister and chief minister, the NCP’s Ajit Pawar has his eye on Pune.The ruling BJP would like to finish maximum projects to have any chance of ensuring that does not happen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2021-year-for-project-completion-in-pune/story-o8l2hGbMgabhPrZso5zmGN.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Honey trap gang busted in Kullu was active for 15 years||The money trail of the honey trap gang that was busted at Bhunter in Kullu on December 3 shows it had been active for the past 15 years and targeted affluent people in the district to acquire property. Kullu superintendent of police Gaurav Singh said the members of the gang were already booked in five cases and faced charges of extortion, assault on public servant, house trespass, voluntarily causing hurt, provoking breach of peace, criminal intimidation and wrongful restraint. These cases were registered between 2014 and 2020. So far, seven members of the gang, including two women, have been arrested. The women would lure the targets to their houses and get intimate with them before other members would reach posing as their relatives or villagers. “They would create a ruckus and threaten the victim with a rape case and then demand money,” Singh said. The gang members would often bring the victim to their house on the pretext of selling land, obstruct the way and then enter into a quarrel before threatening to lodge a rape complaint. LAID TRAP ON SOCIAL MEDIA Singh said that a 37-year-old woman was the kingpin, the other woman was aged 27. They would forge a friendship with the target on social media and trap them, claiming they were in trouble. The police found that the gang had trapped one such person who then demanded money from his wife to pay the accused. His wife reported the matter to the police and a case was registered at Bhunter police station that led to the arrest of six members of the gang. Another case of extortion of ₹1.23 lakh was registered against the accused. The main accused woman, who had taken anticipatory bail from the Himachal Pradesh high court in another case, was also arrested. HUGE TRANSACTIONS BUT NO SOURCE OF INCOME The police impounded two cars bought with the extorted money that were registered in the name of the two women. Singh said that the accused accumulated huge wealth in 15 years despite no known source of income. “The woman kingpin had done transactions of more than ₹25 lakh from her account. She has more than ₹14 lakh balance in her account,” the SP said. Transactions amounting to ₹11 lakh were done from the joint account of the main accused and a co-accused. The other woman did transactions of ₹6 lakh and has a balance of ₹1.6 lakh in her account, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/honey-trap-gang-busted-in-kullu-was-active-for-15-years/story-aToaG8DbohYE4JMWB6KQEP.html

He is a good officer but he was frustrated due to the continuous interference from the government, particularly the state home ministry.”“Though the police department falls under the home ministry, we should provide some independence to such a crucial department for its day-to-day function,” added the Bharatiya Janata Party leader.Fadnavis alleged over interference in the police department by the Maha Vikas Aghadi-led state government and of transferring the DGP without taking him into confidence.“In any department, people come and go but the department keeps running. At the same time, it is also true that the officer of such calibre should go to another department like this. It is unfortunate,” reiterated the former chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ex-cm-fadnavis-says-maharashtra-dgp-faced-interference-from-state-govt/story-C9DWMaUi6aSDlrX0TfO0LJ.html

September recorded the highest number of cases in a single month since March— 576,140. Authorities had partly attributed this to the unlock plans in the city, which began from June 5, along with Ganesh Chaturthi.Also Read: Only 35 drunk drivers arrested in Mumbai on New Year’s EveThis was followed by August’s tally, which has been the second-highest so far, with 360,882 cases.

Maharashtra has been recording fewer than 5,000 Covid-19 cases daily for the past 27 consecutive days, and officials from the government believe the situation is under control. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said on Thursday, “The situation in the state is under control, despite our expectations that cases will surge. Strengthened surveillance, public participation, and herd immunity have helped the state bring down its numbers considerably in the past three months.” Maharashtra has conducted 12,747,633 tests so far. Maharashtra recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 9, 2020, in Pune, wherein a couple returning from Dubai had tested positive. Following this, Maharashtra crossed the 10,000 cases mark on April 30, the 100,000 cases mark on June 12, the 1,000,000 cases mark on September 11, and the 1,500,000 cases mark on October 9. On Thursday, Awate said, “At its peak in mid-September, Maharashtra’s positivity rate was 24.6% on an average day, which means every 4th sample that we tested was positive. Now, the positivity rate is about 7% per day.” Positivity per cent is the total number of cases that have tested positive for Covid-19, as a percent of the total tests done. Maharashtra’s positivity rate as of Thursday is 15.16%, in comparison to December 1, when it was 16.75%. In November, Maharashtra’s positivity rate hovered around 18%, in October and September it was around 20%, in August it was 18%, and in July it was 19.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-19-cases-decline-by-82-from-september-to-december/story-qzNqHQk3CIdJG4V9cdA6ML.html

UP police officer was using it||The owner of a car, stolen two years ago, could hardly believe it when he received a call from an auto service centre seeking his feedback. He was equally shocked to be told by the centre that the vehicle had been returned to station officer, Bithoor police station, Kaushlendra Pratap Singh, after servicing. Singh, one of the cops injured in the Bikru ambush, in which eight policemen were killed by gangster Vikas Dubey and his men on July 3 last, would have continued using the stolen car had he not taken the car for the service.Omendra Soni, the owner of the car, said his vehicle was stolen from Barra area from a car washing centre on December 31, 2018. He said he had lodged an FIR with the Barra police but the vehicle could not be found.On Wednesday, he got a call from KTL service centre enquiring if his vehicle was running fine after the service a few days ago.“I was surprised at the query. I was told my details were with the centre due to a previous servicing of my Wagon R, that is why the call was placed for feedback,” he said.“I went to the service centre and I was told that the vehicle was returned to SO Bithoor, Kaushlendra Pratap Singh on December 22 after servicing,” he said, wondering why the police had not informed him about having recovered his stolen vehicle.Also Read: UP govt to transfer Rs 12K each to labourers selected for religious travelSingh, in his defence, claimed he had found the car abandoned after which it was seized.

As per the procedure, Bithoor police should have informed Barra police about the recovery of the car. However, Barra police confirmed that it did not receive any intimation from Bithoor police.Left red-faced, the police brass has ordered an inquiry into the case.

01-01-2021||Lucknow||UP govt to transfer Rs 12K each to labourers selected for religious travel||The Yogi government will provide Rs 12,000 each to a selected number of labourers, employed in close to 6.5 lakh commercial establishments and 20,500 factories and workshops in Uttar Pradesh, to undertake religious travel said officials. The process would begin from January 24, the state’s foundation day, when the state’s labour welfare board would invite applications from nearly 1.5cr labourers, enrolled with the board, to avail the benefit under Swami Vivekananda Etihasik Paryatan Yatra Yojana. “For travel, the board has identified places like religious cities of Ayodhya, Mathura, Prayagraj and Varanasi, along with Hastinapur in Meerut, Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur, the temples of Shakumbhari Devi and Vindhyavasini Devi. We will also allow travel to Agra. Apart from these, there would be some more places for which the beneficiaries would have to make an application,” said Sunil Bharala, the board chairman who has a minister of state rank.The scheme was conceptualised on November 10— the birth anniversary of Dattopant Thengadi, the RSS ideologue, who founded the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), a trade union organisation, which acts as a pressure group to enforce pro-labour policies. “We have decided to transfer Rs 12,000 each, directly into the accounts of the beneficiaries, who get selected,” Bharala said. He said the scheme named after Swami Vivekananda would be the first-of-its-kind and was aimed at ensuring that labourers not only get time off from their daily grind but were also able to acquaint themselves with the country’s rich cultural and religious heritage.“To my mind, there is no such scheme anywhere that funds religious travel of labourers,” Bharala added. The board has written to lawmakers across the state seeking their help in popularising this scheme among labourers.Also Read: PM Modi, UP CM Adityanath to lay foundation of Light House Project today“This scheme is of course unique but we have several other initiatives going for the labourers,” Bharala said adding that they were seeking help of MPs and MLAs to popularise them.“We have a scheme for marriage of daughters of labourers, named after social reformer and Dalit icon Jyotiba Phule. There is another scheme named after former President APJ Abdul Kalam aimed at helping labourers’ children pursue technical education, an incentive scheme named after freedom fighter and journalist Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi, financial compensation for kin of labourers named after Raja Harishchandra. There is another scheme to provide financial assistance for completing the last rites of labourers that is named after Dattopant Thengadi,” he said.From 2021, the labour department would launch three more schemes—the religious travel one named after Swami Vivekananda, another one to encourage sporting activities among labourers, named after former India cricketer and UP minister the late Chetan Chauhan and a scheme to help the poor purchase books, named after famous litterateur Mahadevi Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-to-transfer-rs-12k-each-to-labourers-selected-for-religious-travel/story-KYX2CiHvQB7tgdNFNG6rNK.html

Even though no restrictions such as night curbs were imposed, the state health department came up with a series of Dos and Don’ts for the New Year celebrations. “People were advised to wear masks and use sanitiser after touching objects on public places, avoid partying in closed places and cultural programmes to avoid crowds and not to burn firecrackers,” said a senior health official. Authorities were directed to ensure that no person enters shopping malls and other public areas without a mask, to install self-dispensing sanitiser and put up additional counters to prevent long queues. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier directed government officials to remain prepared for a new strain of Covid-19 which has surfaced in the UK and a few other European countries. At least one person in Kolkata has been detected to be infected with the new Covid-19 strain, that has surfaced in the UK. He is presently admitted in a state-run hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-around-200-booked-for-violating-covid-19-safety-protocols-on-new-year-s-eve/story-ilQkAPAyLP5HCs9t89QDHM.html

This year, however, senate elections were not held despite its term ending in October; the vice-chancellor (V-C) had cited the pandemic as the reason.It was a PU tradition that its executive body would meet once a month; the last meeting of the syndicate was held in July.Earlier this month, the Punjab and Haryana high court had refused to pass any directions on a plea by seven former Panjab University (PU) senators who were demanding continuation of the terms of the present varsity bodies, including the syndicate, till the senate elections were not held.The HC had taken note of the submissions by the varsity counsel, who had told the court that there was no need to issue any interim directions, referring to Regulations of Panjab University Calendar that said “whenever there is an urgency, the vice-chancellor (V-C) may take such action as he deems necessary, and report the matter at the next meeting of the syndicate for approval.”According to the PU Calendar, the executive government of the university will be vested in the syndicate, which has powers to consider and make recommendations to the senate as it deems fit in the matters that include the appointment of officers of Class A, affiliation and disaffiliation of colleges, recommendations of the board of finance relating to the annual budget, supplementary grants, and others.Terming it as an unprecedented situation, syndicate member Rabindra Nath Sharma said, “It is a blot on the democratic structure of the Panjab University which the authorities are hell-bent on destroying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-syndicate-s-term-ends-v-c-to-take-all-decisions-now/story-EUBLhSUorJ8EsChooXbHbP.html

Without delaying, the government should accept the farmers’ remaining demands and end this deadlock,” she added.Hitting out at the BJP, Choudhry alleged the ruling party was making all attempts to divide people on the issue of SYL amid farm agitation.“Who had stopped the BJP from bringing SYL water in Haryana in the last six years of their rule?” she questioned. Meanwhile, a group of farmers agitating on Delhi-Jaipur highway on Thursday removed two-layer barricading at Shahjahanpur-Khera border in Rajasthan to move towards the capital.The police tried using tear gas to deter them.

01-01-2021||Chandigarh||One-stop facility for property registration in Haryana this year: Khattar||Come April 1 and property registration in Haryana will become convenient for the citizens. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday said the state government was working towards facilitating one-stop registration within a district. This means that citizens will have the liberty to get the property registered at any tehsil in the district. Khattar said the government also plans to have a statewide one-stop registration mechanism where citizens can get the property registration executed in any district. “However, the statewide facility will take some time to get implemented,” the chief minister said while addressing a press conference on Thursday. Khattar announced that a special campaign will be launched to provide skill training, employment and financial assistance to uplift economic status of around one lakh families having least or no income source from March 31. The objective of this special campaign is to strengthen economic status of such families. “Emphasis will be on skill development of members of such families and providing employment opportunities besides financial assistance. If any family needs help to promote their ancestral business, then efforts will be made in that direction as well,” Khattar said. The state government, he said, has also decided to extend special parole period of 2,471 prisoners till February 15 and that of 2,117 till March 31. He said parole will be extended for those sentenced for seven years or undertrials who are accused of offences punishable up to seven years. The chief minister said in a bid to ensure delivery of public welfare schemes at doorsteps, as many as 30 portals and various digital programmes have been started. People are taking benefit of all public welfare schemes through Atal Seva Kendras, Antyodaya Saral Kendras and e-Disha Kendras, he added. Referring to the declining number of coronavirus cases in the state, Khattar said the recovery rate was 97.4% and there were about 3,600 active cases. “But it is essential that we don’t lower our guard,” he said. Giving relaxations for gatherings, the state government recently allowed a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity with a ceiling of 200 persons (i.e. 200 persons in the hall capacity of 400) in closed spaces. In open spaces, it allowed gatherings with a ceiling of 500 persons with strict observance of social distancing and safety norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/one-stop-facility-for-property-registration-in-haryana-this-year-khattar/story-AVskitEvhqpiyCYoTe2g6L.html

He was upset with her behaviour and advised her not to take such a step. We have launched a manhunt to nab the son of Kuldeep Singh, who is at large,” the SHO added.“We have conducted their Covid-19 test. We have handed over Pooja’s body to her maternal uncle and Rohit’s body was given to his parents. Rohit’s brother Mohit, who received bullet injuries, is stable now.

Though the police claimed that there was a dip in rape cases, which were 123 in 2019, the rising incidents of child abuse pose a major challenge for the law enforcement officers.The number of murders logged a slight increase in 2020 as compared to the previous year when Karnal witnessed 62 such cases. The triple murder in Gagsina village over a land dispute earlier this month had sent a shock wave through the district. Three persons have been arrested for their involvement in the case. Also, the district has reported 164 cases of kidnapping of which, 150 have been solved with the arrest of 28 people, the police said. Incidents of forgery and cheating saw a rise as 470 FIRs were registered in 2020 against 2019’s 298. The district witnessed 708 cases of vehicle theft, 296 cases of burglary and over 100 cases of snatching. Karnal superintendent of police (SP) Ganga Ram Punia said curbing organised crime was the top priority of police and further efforts will be made to put a check on crimes against women in the coming year with intensive patrolling. He said the overall crime rate of the district has come down as compared to last year and several gangs were busted by the police. “Karnal police are committed to ensure the safety and security of people,” the SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/209-cases-of-sexual-assault-69-murders-shocked-karnal-in-2020/story-kdlNZADiNQCh3VPRB8id1H.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi shows its heart: How acts of kindness touched our lives amid pandemic||From Delhi Police’s efforts to curb the pandemic to people taking feeder passes to tend to strays during the lockdown, there are many a incidents that were reported in 2020, which gave us hope that humanity and generosity still prevails in dilwalon ki dilli. As we ring in 2021, here’s a glimpse of gestures that made us smile in the year gone by.Cops turn Covid warriorsFrom working round the clock to donating plasma to those who need it, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi Police was lauded for most of their efforts to curb Covid-19.There were many instances wherein Delhi Police helpeded senior citizens. This included a case in April 2020, when a diabetic patient suffering from severe body pain called Station House Officer (SHO) North Rohini. The SHO directed constable Manoj to provide help to the senior citizen, by delivering medicines at his place. Not shying away from donating plasma, the cops have risen above their call of duty. Until November 2020, Delhi Police had saved the lives of more than 300 coronavirus patients. In fact, one Head Constable Krishan Kumar, working with Kapashera Police Station in Delhi donated plasma five times, after recovering from Covid-19. There were also videos on Twitter, such as this one where Delhi Police officials could be seen surprising two young girls with a small birthday celebration, during the lockdown. There was also this time when the staff of Fatehpur Beri Police Station arranged a birthday cake for a four-year-old daughter of a labourer; the birthday was celebrated with the girl’s friends in the community kitchen at the Covid camp.Help from all quarters poured in for Baba ka DhabaThe pandemic has been hard, especially on people with small businesses, but Delhiites sure know how to be large hearted! A video, by a food blogger, went viral, showing an elderly couple running out of business due to customers not turning up at their roadside eatery. And the rest, is history since this place was Baba ka Dhaba. An 80-year-old Kanta Prasad and his wife Badami Devi, had been running a small stall in south Delhi, for decades, to sell small meals. But, due to the pandemic, their sales dwindled, and Prasad was captured crying while stating his plight in the video. As soon as this video was uploaded on social media, it spread like wildfire and so many people came forward to donate money and help that the couple is today not only financially stable, but has now reportedly opened a concrete Baba Ka Dhaba in a popular Delhi market! A helping hand to homebound migrantsDuring the initial months of the pandemic and the lockdown, no work lead to migrant workers face difficulty in sustaining themselves. When a swarm of labourers started walking back to their home towns, on the outskirts of Delhi-NCR, locals turned up to help those in distress by distributing food, ration and other essentials. Denizens from all walks of life came forward for this cause. Many restauranteurs came together to provide meals for those migrants who were stuck in the Capital as well as those who were walking back home empty stomach. Some went on to feed thousands of families! The National Restaurant Association of India rolled an initiative #FeedTheNeedy, and asked its member restaurants to come forward and help the poor and the homeless. Migrant Travel Support, an initiative by four Delhi residents, also made arrangements of food, and help migrants reach their hometowns.To provide hygienic, reusable sanitary napkins to migrant women who were among labourers walking back home, seven Gurugram-based teenagers started a campaign We Stand by Her, and raised funds. Strays didn’t go unnoticedThe pandemic has been hard to us, and also to our furry friends on the streets. During the lockdown, many availed feeder passes to step out and feed the strays in whatever capacity they could. Many NGOs such as 4dogsake and Jeev Shakti Foundation, and a number of individuals also stepped up to distribute food to the strays. A Delhi-based veterinarian student, Vibha Tomar was among those whose single-handed efforts to help the canines got applauded on social media. In fact, even some cops such as Sandeep Ghai, SHO, Kalkaji and his team fed birds and monkeys at Maa Anandmayee Marg and Kabootar Chowk, to help them survive the pandemic.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-shows-its-heart-how-acts-of-kindness-touched-our-lives-amid-the-pandemic/story-vMJsu7685g0yKozAVekBAJ.html

01-01-2021||Delhi||Ringing in New Year with slogans and songs of resistance at Delhi’s Singhu border||The traffic takes longer than usual on Thursday as hundreds of people drive in their trucks, buses and cars to celebrate the New Year Eve at the Singhu border in Delhi which has become an epicentre of the ongoing farmer agitation against the new agriculture laws. At sunset, several stalls start serving hot tea and coffee, yellow sweet rice, jalebis and bread pakodas to the farmers and others gathered there on the last evening of the year 2020. A long queue winds up its way to the pizza stall that of late attracted a flurry of criticism from those against the protests. People in vehicles as well as those on foot move around singing songs of resistance and raising slogans. Also, a few cusswords are directed at the powers that be. In a short while, members of the Kendri Punjabi Lekhak Sabha march to the main stage with flags in their hands. Malkit Singh, a senior office-bearer of the sabha says, “Punjabi writers have always been conscious about supporting social and political struggles of the people. We will raise our voices until the anti-farmer laws are withdrawn.”Also, there are singers, performers and painters from different parts of Punjab and Chandigarh to show their solidarity with the protesting farmers. Well-known theatre personality Anita Shabdeesh is with her troupe from Chandigarh to stage her play ‘Je Hun Na Bole!’ (If we don’t speak now!). The play will be staged on Friday evening as part of the New Year celebrations.In a tent, activists discuss the next course of action and are contemplating how to intensify the protests. Bir Singh, a popular singer from Amritsar says, “I will be travelling through Punjab creating awareness through songs about the farmers’ hardships.” As the night descends, some groups gather around bonfires to ward off the biting cold as the langar is being served to one and all. Navpreet Singh, a class 9 student from Kaithal, talks to the visitors from her small tent set up for the women volunteers.”It is an amazing experience to be here and I am learning so much about helping and serving people,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ringing-in-new-year-with-slogans-and-songs-of-resistance-at-delhi-s-singhu-border/story-WH1J7FRy2AfvaiR27FpmfM.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh saw driest December in five years, showers likely from Jan 2||With only 9.7mm rain recorded all through the month, 2020 saw the driest December in five years, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials revealed. The previous low was in December 2015 when only 2mm rain was recorded the whole month. IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said, “This year, due to lesser western disturbances, the conditions for rain didn’t form and dry winds blew over the city.”The La Nina effect, which causes oceans to remain cooler, also contributed to lesser rains this December, he added. The IMD director, however, said that from January 2, residents can expect some showers due to the western disturbances. “Light rain is likely from January 2, and it is expected to intensify on January 4 and 5 with chances of thunderstorms,” he said. Paul said that the rain will help keep the minimum temperature from falling too low. “However, if it rains during the day, the maximum temperature may fall down 1 to 2 degrees below normal. Foggy conditions will also abate from January 2, only to rise again from the night of January 6. January is the coldest month of the season for the city and it’s likely that the lowest minimum temperature of the season will also be recorded in the days that follow.”The maximum temperature of the city went up from 11.5°C on Wednesday to 16.3°C on Thursday. At 4.4 degrees below normal, it was the first day without cold wave conditions in the city since December 27.The minimum temperature went down from 4.6°C on Wednesday to 2.7°C on Thursday, classifying it as a cold wave, as per IMD. A cold wave is declared when the minimum temperature falls below four degrees. Below two degrees, a severe cold wave is declared.Visibility remained affected on Thursday morning and it was below 50 metres around 8:30 am, however, by 11:30 am it went up to 1,500 metres and 4,000 metres by the afternoon. On Thursday evening, visibility was below 2,000 metres.In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 16°C and 18°C while minimum temperature will remain between 4°C and 7°C.9 flights delayed, 1 cancelled due to fog Due to foggy weather conditions, one flight was cancelled while nine were delayed, said Chandigarh airport officials.

01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House: Congress declares Babla its mayoral candidate||Even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) remains undecided over its choice of candidate for MC mayoral elections, the Congress on Thursday named Devinder Singh Babla as its contender. Babla, who is serving his second term as a councillor, is currently the leader of opposition in the House, and also holds the post of general secretary in Chandigarh Congress. In the mayoral election scheduled to be held on January 8, the Congress candidate for senior deputy mayor post will be Ravinder Kaur Gujral and for the deputy mayor’s post, Satish Kainth has been chosen. The prospects of a Congress candidate getting elected are negligible as the party has only five councillors in the House of 26. The BJP has 20 councilors, while the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has one. The sitting MP of the city – who is currently a leader owing allegiance to the saffron party– also has one vote in mayoral elections. In 2020 election, Raj Bala Malik had polled 22 votes out of the total 27. This time around, the SAD is likely to be absent from voting in the election. BJP has prevailed in the last four mayoral elections. With MC elections due in November-December 2021, this will be last mayoral election before the term of current MC House ends. The BJP is set to declare its nominees for the posts of mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor on January 4, the last date for filling nominations. On December 30, BJP national general secretary and state party in-charge Dushyant Gautam met all 20 BJP councillors at the party’s city headquarters, Kamalam, in Sector 33. During their one-on-one meeting with Gautam, the councillors were asked to suggest two names each for the three posts - mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Their resumes were also taken. Gautam also met party workers, former BJP MP Satya Pal Jain and former president Sanjay Tandon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-house-congress-declares-babla-its-mayoral-candidate/story-ybBxaAGky0XerddU4TBwfI.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Proposal to hand over Sector-25 waste plant to private contractor approved||Amid repeated disruptions by Congress councillors, the municipal corporation (MC) General House on Thursday approved the proposal to hand over the controversial waste processing plant in Sector 25 to a private operator. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors passed the agenda with a voice vote without debate after Congress councillors stormed the well of the House while thumping thalis. The Congress councillors, led by leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla, were protesting against the hiked water bills received by city residents. With the plan to hand over the plant receiving House approval, the MC will now be inviting expression of interest for the upgrade and maintenance of the plant on “as is where is basis.” The MC had taken over the plant around six months ago from the Jaypee Group after a bitter dispute over its management. The plant is currently working at around 10% of its capacity, adding to the challenges of processing solid waste in a city that produces nearly 470 metric tonnes of waste daily. Like Jaypee, MC too has been disposing of unprocessed waste at the Dadumajra dumping ground. The agency hired for the purpose will upgrade or replace the existing machinery and manage the plant. A monitoring committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) visited the plant on December 7 and reviewed its functioning. The committee had directed that the plant be upgraded in order to increase the processing capacity of the plant. The plant was built in 2008 in accordance with the Municipal Solid Waste 2000 (MSW) guidelines. All machines are already 12 years old, at the end of their life. Primary and secondary shredders are not in working condition. Notably, the National Institute of Technical Teachers Training and Research here, in a report earlier this year, had said that “complete replacement of the machinery to process municipal solid waste with new technology” was required. The civil engineering department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (IIT-R), in its status report of 500 TPD (tonnes per day) solid waste processing plant, Chandigarh, had something else to say. The machinery required immediate repairs and maintenance and after that, it could “be run at 40% of its capacity”. IIT-R had advocated setting up “a new modern 500 TPD plant for dry and wet waste treatment in the given plot. For the wet waste stream, biological treatment will be required to meet Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016, the report said. Other important decisions of the day *The MC House also approved the ₹75 crore proposal for strengthening and re-carpeting of city roads and parking lots for the financial year 2021-22. The MC will carry out recarpeting work in the new financial year as per the recommendations of NITTTR. Notably, the MC is yet to start the road recarpeting work for the current financial year (2020-2021), which it plans to start in February-March 2021. Even the road works sanctioned for 2019-2020 are yet to be completed. *House waived off interest on property tax for the period between November 22, 2004 to March 31, 2006 in temporary sheds at Industrial Area, Phase I and II *The proposal for exemption of property tax for institutional/charitable trusts was also approved. *House sanctioned ₹74 lakh for cattle pound and ₹50 lakh for dog pound at Raipur Kalan for providing public health services and fire fighting. Ugly scenes for over outgoing mayor’s performance The Congress and BJP councillors clashed repeated over the performance of the outgoing mayor Raj Bala Malik. This was the last House meet under her mayorship. Tempers particularly flared when Congress leader Devinder Singh Babla used the word “bekar” (useless) while describing the tenure of Malik. Responding to him Malik said, “You are bekar”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-proposal-to-hand-over-sector-25-waste-plant-to-private-contractor-approved/story-MS61TM8iih6javrN5Ce1lN.html

Against 492 flats, the CHB had received only 178 applications. Under the scheme, a 3BHK flat was priced at Rs 1.5 crore, and a 2BHK was available for Rs 1.28 crore.Project launch in April 2021UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had already given a go-ahead to its design in July 2020, but due to the pandemic, the project could not take off. The CHB plans to launch the project in April 2021.CHB will develop the project on two plots, measuring 10.51 and 6.43 acres. In all, there will be 728 flats of three categories in seven-storey towers. The towers will have two basements with a provision for parking two cars for each flat in addition to surface parking for visitors.The project land is part of 123 acres that CHB got back from Parsvnath Developers after a long-drawn legal battle.CHB had decided to launch the scheme on its own after it failed to sell 18 residential and commercial sites at an e-auction in 2018. Due to the high reserve prices, not many developers showed interest in the auction. High-end flats for government officials of the Chandigarh administration, Haryana and Punjab are also planned in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chb-s-it-park-project-to-be-costliest-scheme-in-city/story-EoznDPnO8Pyt7N0yl802PM.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Look into plaints of mangrove destruction in Uran, Maharashtra CM tells authorities||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has directed the urban development to look into the allegations of mangrove destruction in Uran, allegedly by different project proponents. The development comes a day after environmentalists had alleged that the Raigad district administration was downplaying the destruction of mangroves and had ignored a series of spot inspections earlier.  Navi Mumbai-based green organisations Ekvira Aai Pratishthan and NatConnect Foundation, along with the traditional fishing community forum Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti had on Wednesday sent an e-mail to Thackeray, drawing his attention to the mangrove destruction across Uran without the high court and Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearances. The reply to the complaint was received on Thursday. “We received a mail from the CMO (chief minister’s office) stating that the complaint has been referred to Dr Nitin Kareer, principal secretary, revenue, and Mahesh Pathak, principal secretary, urban development department-2,” said BN Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation. Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, alleged that the Raigad collector had declared that there are no wetlands in Uran at the recent meeting of the high court-appointed committee. “Now the collector has written to the additional principal conservator of forests (APCCF) that no mangroves have been destroyed in Uran in several cases that we brought up. The inspection by the collector’s office, without the presence of the complainants, gave a clean chit virtually to the project proponents concerned, even as there has been an irreparable damage done to wetlands and mangroves,” said Pawar. The 400-acre Dastan phata wetland (in Uran) was allegedly turned into a dust bowl in less than six months in 2019 despite the mangrove committee halting the work amid protests by environmentalists. The green groups have alleged that the collector appears to have ignored the fact that as many as 4,500 mangroves have been destroyed by Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as tidal water flow was blocked. The mangrove committee had also imposed a penalty of Rs1 lakh on JNPT over the issue. JNPT constructed Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s memorial on the wetland without any permissions for either digging or landfilling, as confirmed by the district administration in its response to a Right to Information (RTI) application. Yet, the collector’s latest report side-tracks the wetland issue and says there was no mangrove loss at Dastan.The groups have also blamed the National Highway Authority of India for the alleged mangrove destruction at Uran. The clearance by Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for container terminal-4 stated that there should be no mangrove destruction and the fishing community’s movements should not be interfered with during the construction and operation of the project. Through their letter, the environmentalists had appealed to APCCF and requested the Konkan divisional commissioner and head of the mangrove committee to not close these cases till the truth comes out.“We’ve filed an FIR on mangrove destruction and the matter is pending before the court. As far as wetland issue is concerned, there is no notified wetland in Uran. The activists’ demand for verification of Panje wetland can be ascertained after seeking opinion of Wetlands Authority of India,” said Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/look-into-plaints-of-mangrove-destruction-in-uran-maharashtra-cm-tells-authorities/story-84ncfBY29jBQUSkZt6OogK.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government begins drive for conveyance deed; step won’t help, say experts||The state government has initiated a special drive to help housing societies obtain conveyance deed. The drive will be held from January1-15. However, the experts and activists point out that the government policies pass on the onus of compliance on society to shield the builders.There are more than 30,000 housing societies in Mumbai and over a lakh in Maharashtra are without conveyance deed. Housing society activists also claim that the drive is just a ‘stunt’ and will not serve any purpose. Conveyance means that society becomes the owner of the land on which the building is located. In 2012, the state government brought in the concept of deemed conveyance, where the society can bypass the builder who fails to execute conveyance deed and get it from the registrar.Advocate Vinod Sampat, who deals in real estate matters questioned the very basis of this drive. “It is mandatory on the builder to transfer the land and the building to the society within four months on the completion of the project. Ideally, the builder should be taken to task for their failure, but here we have the flat owners who are put in the dock. There are provisions in MOFA (Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act) to imprison the builder and that should ideally be applied,” said Sampat.Ramesh Prabhu, chairman of Maharashtra Societies and Welfare Association (MSWA), put the onus on the procedure, which he blamed is still cumbersome. “The residents will have to run through four different departments and fill multiple forms. It will take a minimum of one year to scrape through the entire process,” said Prabhu.The builders are reluctant, as they lose rights over the land, and all benefits like extra floor space index (FSI), transfer of developmental rights (TDR) once the conveyance deed is transferred to the society. Conveyance deed allows the society to mortgage its land for obtaining loans to carry out repair works in society.A senior official of the cooperation department, on conditions of anonymity, has justified the drive. “We have simplified the procedure to obtain conveyance deed and residents need to take advantage of this. We agree that it is cumbersome, but then residents should cooperate. It will be advantageous for them in future,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-begins-drive-for-conveyance-deed-step-won-t-help-say-experts/story-QbhBXD68vjIP9b5HAc3GjJ.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro car shed row: ‘Developer, leaseholder had agreed to build on the plot’||While the Uddhav Thackeray led-Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is keen on building an integrated Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg, a series of details that have emerged, reveals complexities involved in doing so. According to a 2017 written reply by the ministry of commerce and industry to the then member of Parliament from Mumbai North-East and BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, the Centre had received a complaint about a private builder of agreeing with the Garodias (the said leaseholder) to develop salt-pan lands at the Arthur and Jenkins Salt Works, which spreads across 500-acres on both sides of the Eastern Express Highway (EEH).The state government is keen on building an integrated Metro car shed in 102-acres of this land. Further in 2019, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), in an undertaking to the ministry of commerce, had also stated that it requires 37.32 hectare of Kanjurmarg for the Metro car depot and “MMRDA undertakes to pay the market value fixed by the department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DIPP),” for that land. The reply by the Centre also states that the said lease was terminated in 2004, post which, it challenged in the court. The reply further states, “A representation was received in December 2016, wherein, it was indicated that 1,700 acres of land situated mainly in eastern suburban Mumbai, could be made available for affordable housing and infrastructure projects.”The salt-pan tussle between the Centre and the state dates back to the 1980s. A reply in the year 2000 by the government also states that the “Ministry of industry, department of industrial development issued orders dated January 9, 1986, December 30, 1987, and February 22, 1990, transferring 5,378 acres (approximately) of lands in Greater Bombay, on `as is where is` basis with all the assets and liabilities, to the ministry of urban development, for use as considered appropriate.” Further communication also reveals that between 2000-2003, both the Centre and the state were also looking at jointly developing these lands for mass housing projects, development of public amenities, resettlement of slums and tourism in Mumbai. Shapoorji Pallonji said that in 2009, Maheshkumar Garodia had approached the company for jointly developing the 500-acre land. It also states that it had submitted proposals to the state and central government for necessary approvals in 2013 and is also continuously following-up with the proposals. It also states, “The Government of India and the government of Maharashtra have in principle agreed to utilise the salt pan lands for urban development. Moreover, the subject lands have been reserved for housing in terms of the development plan for Greater Mumbai, for the years 1967 and 1991.” The Garodia group said, “The concerned person who is the lessee of the subject property is travelling and our office is also closed till January 3, due to the holidays and pandemic. (We) Would therefore request you to kindly give us 2-3 days to revert in the matter.” In 2014, however, the state government issued an order in respect of 2,978 acres of the salt pan as belonging to Maharashtra, which was challenged by the salt commissioner before the Konkan divisional commissioner. In 2018, the then revenue minister had also issued an order declaring various salt-pan areas as belonging to the state, which was challenged by the Centre in the court.“The Fadnavis-government knew the legal and technical complexities involved in building a car shed at Kanjurmarg. Therefore, to avoid any delays to the project, Aarey was considered appropriate. The MVA government must immediately re-start works at Aarey to avoid further delays to the project,” said Kirit Somaiya, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. A 2015 reply by the Central government also states that as per a 2010 report of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, 1206 hectares of salt pan lands comes under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), of which 867 hectares is in the eastern suburbs of Nahur, Mulund, Kanjurmarg and Bhandup. A senior official from MMRDA said, “The Kanjurmarg land should be handed over for public good as it will be catering to four different Metro lines.” “The Fadnavis-government knew the legal and technical complexities involved in building a car shed at Kanjurmarg. Therefore, to avoid any delays to the project, Aarey was considered appropriate. The MVA government must immediately re-start works at Aarey to avoid further delays to the project,” said Somaiya.

A senior official from MMRDA said, “The Kanjurmarg land should be handed over for public good as it will be catering to four different Metro lines.” Zoru Bhathena, an environmental activist said, “The Fadnavis-government created these legal complexities. The depot land does not come under salt-pan land and belongs to the state government. There is no complication involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-car-shed-row-developer-leaseholder-had-agreed-to-build-on-the-plot/story-qeAh0GrW2dShuFNQ1ZbvBN.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Hits and misses of Maharashtra’s 2020 politics||The year 2020 – the first year of the five-year term of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra – was overshadowed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which not only posed health challenges, but also left the state in an economic crisis, which will have a cascading effect on at least the next two years. After 2019, which saw an unprecedented political development, an alliance of three parties with different ideologies – the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – to form the government in the state, political uncertainty loomed over 2020. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) kept issuing veiled threats to pull down the MVA government, keeping the Thackeray government busy on two fronts – battling the Covid-19 challenge and keeping the government floating. On November 28, as the government completed a year, it got a sense of stability, but not without the newer challenges. While the possibility of an alliance between the Sena and BJP is ruled out, the forthcoming elections to the civic bodies may see a better camaraderie between the Sena and NCP, leaving the Congress, the junior partner in the MVA government, fuming. New alliance, newer equations The New Year will see mini Assembly polls to five major municipal corporations, 10 more corporations (of the total 27) and 27 (of the total 34) district councils. During its five-year term in power, the BJP had emerged as the single-largest party in local bodies, winning more than half of the corporations and district councils that govern the city and district administrations, and jumping from the fourth to the top slot. Repeating the success may be tough for the BJP this time, given the change in the equations at the state level, and what was seen from the results in the recently held elections for six Council seats for teachers, graduates and local body seats. “However, all is not well within the alliance too. Although the three ruling parties have decided to fight all elections together, differences have started to emerge at local level. The Shiv Sena and NCP are coming together in many corporations and districts to keep the Congress away. This may lead to more fighting within the alliance over the next two years,” a Congress leader said, requesting anonymity. The Shiv Sena’s recent attack on the Congress leadership and demand for a change of guard in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was seen as an attempt by the former to woo the NCP leadership, creating a rift between the two ruling parties. Shiv Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut batted for Sharad Pawar for the post of the UPA chief. “In the state, the Congress is a junior partner at all levels – from the Assembly to corporations and councils, in terms of its strength. If the Sena and NCP share cozy relations, they should not have any objections,” said a senior Sena leader. The challenges ahead After the initial havoc over the outbreak of Covid-19 in the state, the Thackeray government got a pat on the back for its handling of the situation. The Dharavi model and transparency in record-keeping was praised by World Health Organization and even a few international publications. However, the pandemic has paralysed the economic sustainability of the state. Against the estimated revenue receipts of ₹2.56 lakh crore in FY 2020-21, the state is staring at a shortfall of about ₹1 lakh crore. This has badly affected development projects and spending on assets generation. The state has so far borrowed more than ₹65,000 crore, most of which has been for salaries, pensions and interest payment. “The state has the Herculean task of bringing the economic growth on the track. The setback in the GDP growth will show its effect for the next few years and will hamper the development works, ” said an IAS officer in the state government, requesting anonymity. “Of the 12 months, 10 have gone fighting the pandemic, which shrunk our resources too. In 2021, the development works initiated by us will be visible. From infrastructure projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to job generation and foreign direct investment, the results will be significant,” said minority welfare minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik. Covid-related challenges The state spent around ₹1,300 crore a year on health services and it is less than 1% of the state GDP and much less than many other states, including Delhi (₹3,145 crore), Andhra Pradesh (₹2,150 crore) and Kerala (₹1,985 crore) in 2019-20. The total bed capacity of public health institutions in the state has been 103 beds per 1 lakh people, from 88 beds per lakh people in 1971. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced to erect a 5,000-bed hospital in Mumbai to fight contagious diseases. The project has reeled under controversy over allegations of corruption in acquiring the land for it. The Opposition has also alleged large-scale corruption in jumbo Covid facilities. “There was no proper planning while erecting these facilities and most of them were erected for the benefit of contractors,” said Pravin Darekar, leader of opposition in the legislative Council. Friction between Sena and BJP The two former allies – Sena and BJP – were at loggerheads over various issues, including alleged ideological shift, joining hands with the Congress and NCP to form a government, row over the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, bills related to CAA and farm laws and shifting of Metro car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg. The BJP played the role of a combative Opposition over the past 13 months. The BJP’s attempt to take the rivalry to personal level by raising questions over state minister and Uddhav Thackeray’s son Aaditya hurt the Sena the most. Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari joined the BJP in taking on the state government on multiple occasions. His denial to appoint Thackeray to the Council from the governor’s quota had posed a question mark on his continuation in office in April-May. The CM was later elected to the Upper house. A similar face-off between the CM and governor was witnessed later, when the latter shot a letter to Thackeray questioning his Hindutva. The CM wrote back in a similar fashion and made the letter public. “The rift between the Sena and BJP has widened not only in the state, but also on Central level. It will affect the welfare of the state as the funds given by the Centre during the BJP-led government rule in Maharashtra were much more than what were released to the Thackeray government,” said Hemant Desai, political analyst. Darekar said the BJP was not interested in pulling down the government. “The performance of the Thackeray government has been dismal on all fronts. The state has gone back by 10 years in every field be it agriculture, industrial growth or overall development,” he said. Discontent The MVA government also faced public wrath on some of its decisions. Its retraction over the announcement of waiver to consumers from the inflated electricity bills issued during Covid-19 lockdown led to discontent among citizens. Energy minister Nitin Raut expressed his inability to extend the waiver, which could have cost the exchequer more than ₹1,000 crore. The Marathas, too, are not happy with the way the state handled the reservation issues. The community leaders blamed it for the interim stay by the apex court. Insiders in the government and within ruling parties believe the decision of shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg from Aarey Colony was hasty, without proper study. A section of the Sena leadership, too, has admitted that the high court decision of staying the work of the car shed at Kanjurmarg has been a major setback for the government. “The BJP is politicising the issue by involving the issue of ownership of the Central government. We are hopeful that Pawarsaheb will resolve it at the earliest,” said minority welfare minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik. Malik said that after the electricity waiver setback, the ruling parties have decided to not make any announcement before due consultation within the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hits-and-misses-of-maharashtra-s-2020-politics/story-SoB6PkdcRkXNpmXHOl9nOK.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Air quality drops to very poor category in Mumbai for first time this year||The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city rose slightly as the year drew to an end on Thursday.Meanwhile, the air quality in and around Mumbai deteriorated from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ on Thursday for the first time in 2020. Experts attributed the very poor quality of air to the inflow of air from the land (continental air) instead of that from the sea.An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator – of 307 (very poor) was recorded. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) had the worst AQI (363) among all the 10 locations, followed by Navi Mumbai and Mazagaon where an AQI of 349 and 342 was measured.“AQI in Mumbai will continue to remain in the poor category due to the inflow of continental air with low ventilation and slow dispersion of accumulated pollution, mainly from biomass burning areas of Mumbai, owing to favourable wind direction,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Meanwhile, the Colaba station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), which represents south Mumbai, recorded a maximum temperature of 32 degrees Celsius, which was 1.3 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature rose to 20 degrees Celsius, which was 0.2 degrees Celsius above normal and 3 degrees above the lowest temperature of the season recorded on Tuesday.The Santacruz station, representative of Mumbai and the suburbs, recorded a maximum temperature of 34 degrees Celsius, which was 2.7 degrees above normal. Minimum temperatures also rose significantly on Thursday, with the mercury touching 18.5 degrees Celsius, a 1.1 degree rise above normal. This was 3.5 degrees above the lowest minimum temperature of the season (15 degrees Celsius) recorded on Tuesday. In 2020, the lowest recorded temperature was 16.4 degrees, while in 2018, it was 14.4 degrees Celsius.“The rise in temperatures is mostly due to the southeasterly winds over northwest and central India,” KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-quality-drops-to-very-poor-category-in-mumbai-for-first-time-this-year/story-y9ceSsTTBh5lXebe6JZ10J.html

01-01-2021||City||Dip in demand for MBA, BTech courses; rise in applications for MCA: Maharashtra CET cell||Pre-admission registrations to most of the first-year professional courses ended on Thursday. While MBA and Bachelors in Technology (BTech) courses witnessed a dip in demand despite the delay in admissions, most other courses such as architecture and computers managed to attract more applications compared to 2019.As per figures shared by the state common entrance test (CET) cell, registrations for MBA stood at 41,259 in 2020 as compared to 42,586 the previous year. Similarly, first-year engineering course applications for institutes across Maharashtra stood at 94,087 in 2020 – almost 4,500 lower than the 98,676 registrations seen in 2019. While the demand for engineering courses has been on a decline in the past few years, experts believe the delay in admissions in 2020 could have discouraged more students from opting for admissions to BE/BTech courses. “In all probability, the first-year batch will have their first lecture only by the end of January and that will follow a condensed academic year. I’m sure many students must’ve opted to appear for their entrance exam again in 2021 and seek admission for the first-year course in the next academic year,” said the dean of a private engineering institute.Registrations for admissions to the courses began last month.Meanwhile, Masters of Computer Applications (MCA) witnessed 5,706 registrations in 2019, which rose to 10,027 in 2020. “Most courses have managed to retain the number of applicants and some have even attracted more students, especially courses such as MCA, for which the pre-admission registration is almost double compared to 2019. Architecture and some other courses have also attracted many students,” said an official from the state CET cell, adding that the cell will share the admission schedule for all courses soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dip-in-demand-for-mba-btech-courses-rise-in-applications-for-mca-maharashtra-cet-cell/story-YMSIhCYFCP3ETCXAcQj8NI.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drop in sterilisation amid Covid-19 fears; doctors worry||With non-emergency and elective medical procedures being halted during the initial months of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a drastic drop in the number of sterilisation procedures that were carried out this year. These procedures have since resumed in city hospitals, but experts are concerned about the possible consequences of fewer tubectomies in women, vasectomies in men, and interruptions in the distribution of contraceptives. According to data provided by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in 2019, there were 17,680 tubectomies and 106 vasectomies carried out on women and men respectively. However, as of November this year, only 116 women underwent tubectomy and 11 vasectomies were performed.Tubectomy, also known as tubal sterilisation, is a permanent method of birth control in which a woman’s fallopian tubes are either permanently blocked or removed to prevent fertilisation of eggs. Vasectomy is minor surgery in which by cutting and sealing the tubes that carry sperm, fertilisation is prevented.Dr Mangla Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said the numbers for these family planning procedures have fallen drastically this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “In the initial months of Covid-19, hospitals were only allowed to perform emergency services. So other non-emergency and elective procedures were halted. The number of tubectomies and vasectomies fell drastically,” she said.With widespread fear of contracting and transmitting Covid-19, family planning service providers had to reduce their fieldwork this year. However, since the gradual relaxation of the lockdown, sterilisation procedures have resumed at many hospitals. “We are trying to increase awareness among people through different campaigns. We are hopeful that soon people will start coming forward for sterilisation,” said Dr Gomare.Dr Gomare added that in addition to fears of contracting Covid-19, there was an anxiety among many men that getting a vasectomy will affect their masculinity in some way. ”To encourage sterilisation, we provide incentives to men. We have even started no scalpel vasectomy (NSV) technique, which is more advanced and involves the most minimal bleeding. Despite this, men get scared and always push their wives for tubectomy,” she said.“People are always sceptical about the sterilisation process, especially men. Every year, we witness a 1:20 ratio of male-female sterilisation ratio in the city. So we have to sensitise people about their needs and safety. But now, as it has been stopped since March, NGOs [non-governmental organisations] couldn’t sensitise the public and so the procedure rate has gone down,” said Sunaina Majhi, a social worker who works with BMC’s family planning department.The low numbers have raised concerns among health activists and doctors who worry about unwanted pregnancies during the lockdown. “Due to the pandemic, abortion services have also been impacted, so the number of live births will increase. Women may be forced to carry their unintended pregnancy to full term,” said VS Chandrashekar, chief executive officer, Foundation for Reproductive Health Services India.Another side effect of the lockdown for women has been the that many will not have had access to contraceptives of their choices. “The distribution of condoms and oral contraceptives has taken a hit during the lockdown. So alternative birth control measures [to sterilisation procedures] have also suffered a lot in the pandemic. This will certainly push up the population of already-overcrowded Mumbai,” said activist Dr Abhijit More. “Unplanned pregnancy can also increase health complications among women,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-drop-in-sterilisation-amid-covid-19-fears-doctors-worry/story-KGUL1TjHP2HVNIcAguYBQK.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Over 1.38 lakh seats vacant after 4 rounds in Mumbai||More than 1.38 lakh first-year junior college (FYJC) seats in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) remain vacant after four admission rounds this year, data shared by the education department has revealed. The second special round for admissions will begin on January 1 and the second special merit-list will be declared on January 5.At the end of the special admission round which concluded on Thursday evening, of the 59,322 students who were allotted seats in the round, 44,359 confirmed their seats. The state education department will upload a list of final vacancies on Friday. After the seats under various quotas including management, minority and inhouse were surrendered post third round admissions, cut-offs in prominent colleges fell for the special list which was declared on December 28. Meanwhile, several colleges have decided to start classes from this week as more than 90% seats are filled after the special round.This year, the department had declared that there will be no first come first served (FCFS) rounds for admissions. Instead, special rounds would be conducted for students who do not get admission in regular rounds. FCFS rounds usually follow regular admission rounds wherein students can claim seats against vacancies across colleges in a particular city or district and are allotted seats based on who claims them first.

He also recorded a video of the act and posted it online. Earlier, he had even tweeted to the ministry of labour complaining about non-payment of salary for the last four-five months. He was later hospitalised in Central Hospital.“ I had no other option than taking the step as my family is solely dependent on me. I tried to meet the authorities several times for the payment but they did not respond. It is not just me who is facing this problem but around 200 like me,” said Venkatesh.“When others learned about my state, they decided to call off their duty and went on strike. I get paid ₹12,800 monthly. The agency people also threatened me, asking to withdraw my complaints.”On Thursday, the announcers thronged the Central Hospital in Ulhasnagar and began a strike. They further travelled to CSMT to meet the authorities and raise their complaints. The strike also affected the manpower for the daily announcement at the railway stations.“We will continue the strike till our demands are met. The railway has now asked the ticket collectors to do the announcements due to our absence,” Venkatesh added. Chief public relations officer of CR, Shivaji Sutar, said, “ We have done the alternate arrangements at certain stations to avoid inconvenience to the passengers.”Meanwhile, the CR officials and the contract agency refuted the allegations claiming that the payment was done.“No payment to the outsourced agency has been withheld by Central Railway. The contractor has been advised to take appropriate action,” said Sutar.The agency, in a written letter to the CR, mentioned that the said contractor was making false allegations and trying to defame the agency.Dhumketu Dharamshi, admin manager of the agency, said, “ I personally met Venkatesh and heard his problems. We have already given a cheque of ₹18,967 to him but he refused to accept it. This clearly proves that he has fabricated the story to defame the agency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-railway-announcers-in-mumbai-go-on-strike-after-one-attempts-suicide-over-non-payment-of-salary/story-UCDxn5R0yZJ76HqOsZXAAI.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||Ashram chock-a-block as border stirs worsen traffic||The Ashram intersection, already the capital’s biggest traffic choke point, has been thrown completely haywire as the public works department has extended the barricades put up for the construction of a 750-metre underpass connecting it with the Nizamuddin railway bridge on to Mathura Road towards India Gate.As other Delhi-Noida border points are closed in view of the farmers’ protest, the volume of vehicles using the Ashram route to reach UP via the DND flyway and Kalindi Kunj has increased significantly, leading to a complete breakdown of traffic management at the critical intersection.A Hindustan Times spot check on Thursday showed vehicles stuck in long traffic jams even during non-peak hours. Before the lockdown, the intersection used to handle nearly 300,000 vehicles during peak hours. The figure is now down to 250,000 but the PWD extension of the barricades carried out last week has left commuters with barely half-a-lane of motorable space, which proves woefully inadequate.“Along with the (Covid-19) pandemic, there has been a shortage of labourers, which has affected some of the work but on the other hand the Delhi government is completely prepared to deal with the situation and is trying its best to meet all the necessary timelines,” Delhi PWD minister Satyendar Jain said about the delay in the underpass project.Read more| Night curbs imposed in Delhi on December 31 and January 1 from 11pm to 6amTraffic and road design experts said the only solution to clearing the congestion on the stretch was to dedicate more resources and manpower to complete the project before the set deadline of March. The underpass had to be completed in December 2020. More efficient site management is required to streamline traffic, they said.S Velmurugan, chief scientist, traffic engineering and safety division, Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), said, “Things have been slow because of unforeseeable events this year but authorities should have made arrangements such as additional manpower at least towards the end of the year to make up for the time loss so that the traffic chaos could be avoided.” Another expert, Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said technology for construction has advanced immensely over the last few years, which means that construction sites can be managed more efficiently to cause minimal disruption.With the new arrangement, commuters going from New Friends Colony side towards east Delhi via Ring Road have to make their way around the roundabout of barricades, which leads to vehicles from all sides getting gridlocked at the intersection.Rishi Ranjan, a regular commuter on the stretch, said over the past week the situation had become worse than ever.“There are alternative routes to reach Noida but those are either shut off or have restrictions. There is no option but to use the Ashram intersection. I did not think traffic could get any worse when the work was limited to the NFC side of Mathura Road, but I was wrong, this extension is a nightmare for commuters,” Ranjan said.Read more| India Gate open today, Covid conditions applySudheer Trehan, another commuter, waiting at the traffic signal on Mathura Road to take the left turn towards Lajpat Nagar, said even during peak hours there weren’t enough police personnel to manage traffic.“Come here in the evening and you will find this place to be an absolute mess. Vehicles are literally standing in their spot for 15-20 minutes. Can you imagine any other road in Delhi where a driver would have the time to sit in his car and talk to you? But here I am because I know I am going to be here for another few minutes at least,” Trehan said.Other issues afflict the area too. The carriageway on Mathura Road towards Sarita Vihar from Ashram, after taking a left turn near CSIR Apartments is being used for repairing a drain pipe damaged during construction work. A little further, construction material and debris are piled onto the divider — spilling over to the road — creating another bottleneck.A senior PWD official, who wished not to be named, said over 50% work on the underpass had been completed and they hoped to finish the remaining by March.“Construction work on the ramps of the underpass has almost been completed. Now we have started the digging process underneath the Ring Road portion at the intersection. This process is likely to take one-two months to complete,” he said.After being cleared in 2016, work on the Ashram underpass was delayed for want of financial approval. On December 24, 2019, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal laid the foundation stone of the project with a deadline to complete it by December 2020, which has been extended. PWD officials said construction moved slowly initially due to the protest at Shaheen Bagh and later stopped due to the lockdown. Even though work resumed towards the end of May, progress remained slow because of labour shortage and then due to pollution-related restrictions. Traffic police officials said they had installed a temporary traffic signal for vehicles coming from the Lajpat Nagar side on to Ring Road so that they do not come on to the intersection all at once. “We are working with the PWD to manage traffic in a way that does not affect commuters. The restrictions at the borders because of the farmers’ protest were not something that we could foresee while granting permissions,” a senior traffic official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ashram-chock-a-block-as-border-stirs-worsen-traffic/story-4O6atvcKSg8yRmeVgt57eL.html

However, the people will be asked to disperse a little before 11pm, in accordance with the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order on Thursday, which barred the assembly of more than five persons on December 31 and January 1 after 11pm in the capital.Thousands of people gather at India Gate lawns on the New Year’s day every year. Police said teams would deployed around India Gate so that there is no crowding. In an order early on Thursday, the DDMA said the restriction on gatherings after 11pm was being imposed as “it is apprehended that gatherings, congregations and celebrations of New Year pose a considerable threat of spread of the virus...”The non-licensed restaurants and roadside eateries at prominent market places too will have to begin wrapping up their businesses by 10pm on Friday so that the restrictions on gatherings from 11pm to 6am on Saturday are ensured, said the Delhi Police on Thursday. “We will follow the DDMA order as per the book. So, visitors to India Gate won’t be stopped on Friday until 11pm. After that, we will ensure that there are no gatherings until 6am,” said Eish Singhal, deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi), who is also the Delhi Police spokesperson.By late Thusday evening, Delhi police had started setting barricades at the entry points to Connaught Place and were ensuring the unlicensed vendors shut shop Read more| Delhi records 574 Covid-19 infections in last 24 hours, one of the lowest in monthsThe police said they will ensure that there are no queues outside licensed restaurants and bars -- which have been exempted from the restrictions -- on Friday. “We have informed these businesses that their customers should be ushered in as soon as they arrive. No gathering outside such places will be tolerated,” said another senior police officer. The police have also held meetings with market and residents welfare associations to ensure a strict compliance of the restrictions. “Through the day, we will be using our public announcement systems to make people aware of the restrictions. But a little before 11pm on Friday, we will start requesting people to disperse,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP of South district, where several popular malls and markets are located. Thakur said that mall authorities are aware of the restrictions and will ensure action on their own.A second police officer requesting anonymity said that special attention will be paid to unlicensed eateries and roadside vendors which are expected to witness substantial gathering on Friday as well. Read more| UK Covid-19 variant growing rapidly, affecting more people under 20: Study“Such eateries have been asked to take their last order by 10pm and deliver them by 10.30pm so that the 11pm deadline is adhered to. The police in all districts will be armed with a list of unlicensed restaurants so that they can follow up,” said the officer.The police officer said legal action will be used only as a last resort and they largely aim to persuade people to adhere to the restrictions. “We don’t want to play a spoilsport, so we will use discretion in booking violators,” said the officer. The police have also formed teams in important markets to visit the licensed restaurants and bars to count the number of visitors, if the need be, to ensure that the occupancy is not over 50%. If the restaurants are not found to be adhering to the prescribed Covid-19 rules inside, the police will book the owners under sections of Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Jaspal Singh, joint commissioner of police (New Delhi range), said that while it will be a challenge for the police to curb the new year celebrations on Friday, the police are well equipped to disperse gatherings.The traffic police, meanwhile, will decide whether or not to allow vehicles on the C-Hexagon on Friday. Manish Kumar Agrawal, joint commissioner of traffic police, said that if the pedestrian movement is high, then vehicles could be diverted from 10am on Friday, from points before the India Gate. In recent years, the India Gate lawns have got a footfall of tens of thousands on the first day of the year. Such gathering of visitors were also common on New Year’s eve, when vehicles would completely clog the C Hexagon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/india-gate-open-today-covid-conditions-apply/story-s6xNrpYbOC9d30c093854I.html
01-01-2021||Mumbai||Hemant Nagrale, Param Bir Singh top contenders for the post of Maharashtra DGP||With director-general of police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal being appointed to head the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Hemant Nagrale and 1988-batch officer Param Bir Singh and Rashmi Shukla are top contenders for the post.Central government’s department of personnel and training issued an order on Wednesday appointing 1985-batch Jaiswal as director-general of CISF. Jaiswal is expected to be relieved early next week, with additional charge handed over to one of the director generals. The state government, at the same time, will begin the procedure for the new appointment to replace Jaiswal.Though Sanjay Pandey (1986-batch) is the senior-most officer, according to the officials from the home department, he is unlikely to be considered for the post, because of his number of litigations against the administration. Pandey is director-general (DG) of home guards. Followed in the seniority are Bipin Bihari and Surendra Pandey (both 1987 batch) and serving as DG, Police Housing Corporation and DG, prisons respectively. The officers, however, are out of the zone of consideration as they are retiring in January and February respectively.After Sanjay Pandey, Hemant Nagarare (DG, legal and technical), Param Bir Singh (Mumbai Police commissioner), Rashmi Shukla and Rajnish Sheth (all 1987 batch) are the senior-most officers to be considered for the post.“We will send names of the officers who have completed 30 years of the services to the UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) for the empanelment. Based on the seniority and the confidential reports during service tenure, the UPSC sends back panel of three officers to choose from. The chief minister and home minister take a final call on the appointment,” said an official from the home department.The Opposition has, however, slammed the state government for losing a senior and efficient officer. “Jaiswal opted for the central deputation as he was fed up with the style of working of the state government. He was not being taken into confidence while dealing in many administrative decisions including transfers of senior officers. Upset over this, Jaiswal opted for the central deputation,” said leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hemant-nagrale-param-bir-singh-top-contenders-for-the-post-of-maharashtra-dgp/story-WqlSY1OAYTmZybLIE90ZzI.html

01-01-2021||Chandigarh||NHAI to build new link to Kurali-Chandigarh road||After scrapping the project to widen the 40-km long Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has come up with an alternate greenfield alignment, a 32km road from IT chowk ( PR-7) near Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh road from the villages of Nagiari and Devi Nagar here.A greenfield road is built in an area where there is no construction.NHAI, it is learnt, issued a notification recently asking the farmers of around 60 villages for objections and acquisition of land within 21 days.The new road will decongest Chandigarh and Zirakpur by providing an alternate route to traffic coming from Delhi and going to Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.“We have issued the notification and around 400 acres land will be acquired in around 60 villages of Mohali district,” said NHAI project director Pradeep Atri.NHAI will also widen the existing road to six lanes of 40 km from IT city chowk to Ambala via Banur and Tepla.The matter of an alternate route had been taken up in February, 2020, by member of Parliament Manish Tewari with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, following which the ministry in its letter had stated that NHAI was checking the feasibility of the greenfield section.Bids for appointment of a consultant to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) had been received and was under evaluation, the letter said.After issuing the notification for widening 40-km-long Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in 2018, the NHAI had scrapped the project in July 2019 owing to high costs.Inderjit Ghai, managing director, General Highway and Infracom Private Limited, who prepared the detailed project report for the scrapped project said, NHAI had decided to explore the possibility of a new greenfield alignment. “I feel that the proposed project is also viable under Build Operate Transfer (BOT) as traffic is huge on the road and its cost can be recovered in a decade’s time. In addition, there are other benefits like reduction in pollution level, reduction of road accidents and congestion in Chandigarh city and Zirakpur, he said.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nhai-to-build-new-link-to-kurali-chandigarh-road/story-EswLxuHdE0rHXXUWgKR2xL.html

The state has decided to take action against employees and officials who are tardy more than twice a month. Those who have a habit of reporting late will start losing their leaves against the delay of each day.The state government has already provided flexibility in timings for those posted at Mantralaya, the state headquarters, considering that most of them stay far away and have to travel for hours to reach the island city. The reporting time at Mantralaya is 9.45am, but they are allowed to clock in by 10.45am.“From now on, those reporting at Mantralaya after 11.15am twice in a month won’t face any action but will start losing one casual leave for every consecutive late day. If casual leaves are utilised, then earned leave or unpaid leave will be deducted as punishment. The above rule is applicable for an employee or official for up to nine days in a month. In case the concerned employee or official repeats the same for the tenth day in a month, he or she will start losing paid leaves as punishment,” states the government resolution issued by the state general administration department on Thursday.Earlier, staff members were marked present for only half the day if they arrived late and did not work overtime to match the time of delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-issues-strict-rules-for-latecomers-at-office/story-UubkicumYNP0uWR9Rs4UPP.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM dedicates Kharar flyover to citizens||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday dedicated the Chandigarh-Kharar elevated corridor to the citizens as a New Year gift, saying it was the fulfilment of a long pending need of the region to ease traffic congestion on the route.With the third phase of the corridor project, from the Sector-39 roundabout in Chandigarh to Khanpur, opening on December 28, the work is now 96% complete. The road at Khanpur is expected to be completed by mid January 2021. The highway is critically important as it connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab, besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Kharar used to earlier be a major traffic bottleneck as 50,000 vehicles were crossing the stretch on an average before the lockdown. The CM on the occasion also congratulated the civil administration for ensuring peaceful acquisition of land and resettlement of land owners, praising the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for completing the project, often delayed due to what he said were bottlenecks created during the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party rule. Govt inherited ‘messy legacy’Capt Amarinder Singh said when his government took over, it inherited the messy legacy of the erstwhile regime. Traffic was not diverted, high tension wires were not removed by the Electricity Board and acquired structures not vacated by land owners due to non-payment of land compensation amount, along with multiple court cases and stay orders. Notably, the project was started on June 9, 2016, and the first phase from the Sector-39 roundabout-Verka Chowk to Balongi Underpass was opened on September 25, 2020; the second phase (Desu Majra to Khanpur) towards Ludhiana on December 12, 2020, followed by the third phase from Daun to Desumajra on December 28, 2020. Later, in an informal interaction with the media, the CM thanked Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari for undertaking the national highway project in Punjab. Rs 27 crore sanctioned for Landran projectOn other such projects, Capt Amarinder Singh said the Katra-Delhi 16-lane expressway and other projects were in the pipeline with the land acquisition process underway. He also said Rs 27 crore had been sanctioned for the project at Landran. Earlier, speaking at the event, Punjab cabinet minister and Mohali MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Chandigarh to Khanpur project comprising a 3.2 km long, six-lane elevated corridor supported over a single pier, with three underpasses (Balongi, Daun and Airport Road), and major interchange at Khanpur connecting to Ludhiana and Ropar road would bring to an end the frequent traffic snarls. Commuters travelling daily to and from the tricity would benefit the most, he added. Those present at the inauguration included Jagmohan Singh Kang, chairman market committee, Kharar; inspector general, Ropar Range, Amit Prasad, additional deputy general, Mohali, Aashika Jain, and senior superintendent of police, Mohali Satinder Singh with subdivisional magistrate, Kharar, Himanshu Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-dedicates-kharar-flyover-to-citizens/story-GvbyQBw3UbvvDsnCKyO9KM.html

Most parts of Chandigarh were deserted and though a small crowd had gathered at Sector 17 to raise pro-farmer slogans, people dispersed by 10 pm as police had declared that the inner roads of the sector would be vehicle free zones.Few cars were on the road and a few small groups were seen heading for Sector 26 and Elante Mall. PCR vehicles patrolled the roads with police personnel using flashlights to check vehicles at nakas. Breathalysers, however, were not being used till this report was filed.Though only 50% occupancy capped off at 200 was allowed in clubs and hotels, many of them cancelled parties in the UT area. Chandigarh Club president Sandeep Sahni said they were open for dining in for members as on normal nights without celebrations. Chandigarh Press Club too cancelled events because of the hardships faced by journalists due to Covid-19,according to a release. Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC) held a small members only event with a live saxophonist, said Ravibir Singh, former CGC president, who will again take charge in January 2021. Hotels and restaurants too did not plan anything out of the ordinary. “Celebrations planned by hotels and restaurants were similar to other years, only smaller gatherings were allowed in line with Covid protocols,” said Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association.The hoteliers, Gupta added, would definitely follow all the guidelines of the UT administration, and adviser Manoj Parida, who had supported them throughout the lockdown days.The head of the National Restaurant Association (NRAI’s) Chandigarh Chapter Sunveer Sondhi added that all restaurants closed their gates once 50% occupancy was reached. “Since New Year’s eve parties were not allowed in Mohali we were on our toes to ensure that the social distancing rules were followed,” he said. The Sector 17 shopkeepers also kept celebrations low key with Neeraj Bajaj, president of the Business Promotion Council, Sector 17, saying, “Shopkeepers decorated the markets block wise but no celebrations were held in the Sector 17 plaza or near the water fountain there.” Elante was offering deals for up to January 18, said Nishank Joshi, chief marketing officer of Nexus Malls.Everything shut after 9pmMohali was deserted after malls, clubs and restaurants closed down by 9 pm sharp. Yograj, the manager of Casba, a popular New Year hotspot, said no events were organised and the resort closed down at 9 pm after dinner.Another senior official of Virtuous Retail South Asia Ltd or VR Punjab in Kharar said only discounts on clothing brands and food were being offered.The Forest Hill Golf and Country Club Resort in Nayagaon too shut down by 9 pm after dinner, said manager Satish Kumar.Barricades, checksAt Panchkula, police took precautions to keep revellers off roads by putting up barricades at 12 points, including one at Morni T-point.According to the deputy commissioner of police, personnel patrolled in their beat areas and kept a check on miscreants. Police were also present near pubs, bars, hotels, resorts with barricades put up at 41 places late at night.Among party hotspots here, the Gymkhana Club cancelled all events for the first time since 1994. “Usually 800 to 1,000 people come for celebrations on New Year’s eve,” said a worker at the club. However, most hotels had 60% occupancy. An official at Bella Vista said: “We have made arrangements to ensure safety of guests. However, no party was organised here,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/subdued-new-year-s-eve-celebrations-in-chandigarh-tricity-due-to-covid-cold/story-8socSX3uZMRYGo9Uh2JoRP.html

State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the drive will be conducted at three health centres in each of the districts. According to the minister, 25 people at each centre have been chosen for the mock drill of the vaccination drive.The health centres will be equipped with a waiting room, vaccination room and examination room apart from facilities such as electricity connection, internet connectivity and security arrangements, Tope said.After conducting a dry run of vaccination in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat on December 28 and 29, the Centre has now planned to extend the drill to the rest of the country as part of the preparedness for the actual vaccination. In the vaccine dry run, the entire process of transporting the vaccines from storage to the site, administering them to participants and feeding data on the Co-WIN app is practised. The drive in the state was announced after a meeting between the state and the centre on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-hold-covid-19-vaccine-dry-run-at-pune-nagpur-jalna-and-nandurbar-districts-on-january-2/story-Yg7ynw0KQLjP9GwxOnU5mM.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||Mercury falls to 3.3°C, may go up from Jan 2: IMD||Delhi’s average mean minimum temperature this December was the second-lowest in the last 15 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. The minimum temperature on Thursday also dipped to the season’s lowest, at 3.3 degree Celsius. IMD scientists said the cold wave will continue in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) on Friday, but the minimum temperature will start increasing, and is expected to touch 7°C by Sunday. Data released by the IMD on Thursday showed that the mean minimum temperature (MMT) this December was 7.1°C, lower than 8.3°C — the normal for this month. In 2018, this had dipped to 6.7°C, according to IMD data. Before that, the average MMT for December was lowest in 2005 (6°C) and in 1996 (5.9°C). Delhi also recorded eight cold wave days this December, the same as in 2018. The city had recorded nine cold wave days in 1965, the most so far on record, the IMD said. Delhi on Thursday also recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season, with the mercury at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker of the city, dipping to 3.3°C, four degrees below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 17.4°C, two below normal. Dense fog also reduced the visibility at the Palam observatory to 50 metres. Fog hits flights at IGIASeveral flyers were stranded at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday morning as fog disrupted operations, forcing two incoming flights to be diverted and delaying the departure of other flights. But no flight was cancelled, airport officials said adding that the impact was lower because all three runways were operational. Read more| 2020: A year of strange weather eventsAccording to officers, CAT III low visibility procedures were implemented around 2am at the airport, as the runway visual range recorded visibility below 200 metres. The lowest visibility was recorded at 175m, because of which two incoming flights, one from Kolkata and another from Dubai, had to be diverted to Jaipur as they could not land in Delhi. The fog also disrupted departure of scheduled flights during the early hours of Thursday. “Some departures were delayed when the visibility dropped drastically. This caused delay to the following flights also, affecting 50-60 flights scheduled on Thursday. However, the situation improved in the afternoon and also because the air traffic at the airport is less as compared to pre-Covid times,” said an officer from the airport who wished not to be named. In order to accommodate more passengers, the airport operator also plans to reopen Terminal 1, which is currently shut due to ongoing expansion work. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said clear skies over Delhi-NCR, multiple western disturbances affecting the Himalayan region and the global impact of La Niña were the major reasons behind such low minimum temperatures. La Niña is characterised by below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a result of shifting wind patterns in the atmosphere. “Delhi recorded “near-normal” minimum temperatures till December 12 as a result of clouds and rainfall in the plains under the influence of western disturbances affecting the region,” he said. Read more| Farmers’ protest: Consensus on two issues, says Tomar; next meeting on January 4Clear skies also pushed the temperature below normal this season. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground, he added. “After December 12, western disturbances mostly affected the western Himalayan region, leading to significant snowfall and rain over Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh,” Srivastava said. He, however, said that from Friday the temperatures will start rising again as an impact of another active western disturbance crossing over Delhi-NCR. On Friday, the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 4 degree Celsius, and by Sunday it is expected to increase and reach up to 7 degree Celsius. Meanwhile, with the low temperature and slow wind speed, pollution levels also spiked on Thursday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Thursday was 347, in the ‘very poor’ category. On Wednesday, the overall AQI of the city was 290, in the ‘poor’ zone. The CPCB on Thursday reiterated its order from December 23, asking the agencies to step-up enforcement and keep stone-crushers and hot-mix plants shut till January 2. IMD scientists said that with an approaching western disturbance, the wind speeds are expected to improve, bringing pollution down. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that the AQI is expected to improve from Saturday significantly from Saturday. “There will be marginal improvement on Friday, but from Saturday there would be a significant improvement because of improved wind speed,” Soni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mercury-falls-to-3-3-c-may-go-up-from-jan-2-imd/story-CCuE9SGrr4ym8Cdd9t5aAN.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||BJP launching planned attacks on AAP leaders: Raghav Chadha||Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha on Thursday alleged that ever since his party has extended support to the protest by farmers against the three new farm laws, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had been launching “planned attacks” on AAP leaders. The BJP, however, dismissed the allegations as “baseless”. The AAP has come out in support of the thousands of farmers who are camping on Delhi’s borders, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that seek to open up agricultural trade. The party had voted against the bills in Parliament when they were enacted in September.“Ever since Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal spoke up in support of the farmers and their rights, there have been repeated attacks on the elected representatives of the Aam Aadmi Party. These are all planned attacks. They made the police put the CM under house arrest. Then, BJP supporters and leaders attacked the residence of deputy CM and later the office of the Delhi Jal Board,” said Chadha, who is an MLA from Rajendra Nagar and vice-chairperson of the jal board. Chadha said, “It was not just physical attacks, they are trying to exert psychological pressure on us, picking and choosing different members of the AAP to attack at will......Last night, two suspicious cars were parked outside Kalkaji MLA Atishi’s residence… It is clear that the BJP is carrying out pointed attacks on us.” Read more| ‘Support historic movement’: AAP leader Raghav Chadha sets up free WiFi at Singhu border for farmersAtishi on Thursday tweeted that a “BJP leader and his aides” were trying to intimidate her and family.

Commissioner of police, Delhi, is responsible for law and order of the whole of Delhi. He is at present engaged in the law and order arrangements for the farmers’ agitation and New Year’s eve.” “The law and order situation in Delhi is very sound and well under control. The concerned can seek an appointment with concerned joint commissioner and deputy commissioner of police, who have been directed to look into their grievances,” Mittal said in a statement.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. They are trying to divert attention from their failures. The AAP government in Delhi owes Rs 13,000 crore to the BJP-ruled municipal corporations. They have not paid the money and thousands of municipal employees are suffering. They are not getting salaries on time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-launching-planned-attacks-on-aap-leaders-raghav-chadha/story-kcimEJRITMOGoeKIMuYbLO.html

They BJP workers held protests, pasted posters and flew banners at flyovers and roads at ITO, Raja Garden, Dhaula Kuan, ISBT Kashmere Gate, near AIIMS flyover, Khanpur, Vasant Kunj, Wazirabad, Vivek Vihar and Laxmi Nagar among other places.Leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramveer Singh Bidhuri, along with party MLAs Mohan Singh Bisht, OP Sharma, Anil Bajpai, Abhay Verma led protests in their constituencies. Read more| Night curbs imposed in Delhi on December 31 and January 1 from 11pm to 6amJai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, who participated in the campaign at ISBT, said the Delhi government was “wilfully not releasing” the dues of Rs 13000 crores to make civic bodies “financially crippled”.“They (government) are doing it so that corporations can neither do any development work nor can pay salaries to their employees on time. It (the dues) is our constitutional right and we will take it. We will continue the fight till the Delhi government releases it,” Prakash said.The mayor added that the Aam Aadmi Party was “playing politics” by not releasing the funds so that they could take advantage in the 2022 municipal elections.Delhi BJP spokesperson, Naveen Kumar said on January 3, about 300,000 workers from 13,750 booths along with RWA members, and BJP leaders would join the campaign.In a statement, the AAP said that due to the rampant corruption in the BJP-ruled MCDs for the past 15 years, they have no other way to hide their failures than spreading a lie regarding the AAP government. “The claim that AAP government owes an imaginary sum -- Rs 13,000 crore -- to MCDs is a mere drama by the BJP. The BJP leaders are trying to distract the attention of people from the issue of non-payment of salaries to MCD employees. These claims are completely orchestrated and to defame the Aam Aadmi Party government. In court orders of November 5 and December 16, it was never noted that the Kejriwal government owes any money to the BJP-ruled MCDs. More importantly, the standing counsel of the BJP-ruled MCDs also never mentioned such pending funds during the hearing in the court,” the statement said.Read more| Ashram chock-a-block as border stirs worsen trafficThe AAP added that as elections to the municipal bodies are nearer, the BJP is enacting a drama of Rs 13000 crore dues to divert the attention of the people of Delhi from its failures. “Today, teachers, doctors, nurses, safari karamcharis, etc. working under the municipal corporation are protesting, agitating and even going on hunger strike to get their salary. The MCD is involved in a corruption case of Rs 2,500 crores, which is the biggest scam in the history of Delhi. In PM (Narendra) Modi’s own survey, it was noted that the BJP has transformed Delhi into the dirtiest cities of India,” the AAP said in its statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-runs-campaign-to-demand-dues-from-delhi-government-aap-calls-it-drama/story-gsBr7ahdTlk6JxgPmFDThO.html
01-01-2021||Delhi||As cases fall, Delhi govt orders 115 hospitals to scale down Covid beds||The number of beds reserved for the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in the city may drop by 14,000 beds as the Delhi government ordered 108 private hospitals and seven of the hospitals run by it to de-escalate the number of Covid-19 beds in view of fewer cases being reported. Delhi has, as on Thursday evening, reported fewer than 1,000 cases for seven days in a row. At present, only 11% of more than 18,700 beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection across the city were occupied. Just 19% of the 5,048 intensive care unit (ICU) beds — both with and without ventilators — were occupied as on Thursday evening, according to the state government’s Delhi Corona app. “The occupancy of Covid-19 beds has gone down and has reached a comfortable level. With over 85% of the beds vacant, the government has decided to convert the GTB and Lok Nayak hospitals that were completely Covid be made partially Covid. All other services will be restarted soon,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 pandemicThe Delhi government on Thursday decided to reduce 2,140 beds earmarked for the treatment of patients with Covid-19 across seven of its hospitals, including Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals, both of which will now start treating non-Covid patients as well. As for private hospitals, five that were completely converted into Covid-19 facilities have been asked to retain all the beds, whereas 108 others were directed to de-escalate them. Currently, the 108 hospitals account for 15,096 of all Covid-19 beds available in the city. Of these, hospitals were asked to keep a minimum of 3,077 beds. Additionally, 32 hospitals that had 1,080 beds were asked to reserve Covid-19 beds as per their discretion. PRIVATE HOSPITALS FOR THOSE WITH NEW VARIANTThe Delhi government on Thursday also ordered four private hospitals in the city were ordered to create a special isolation ward for international travellers who might have the mutant variant of the Sars-CoV -2 virus first spotted in the United Kingdom. The hospitals include Max Smart Superspeciality hospital-Saket, Batra hospital, Fortis Superspeciality hospital-Vasant Kunj, and Sir Ganga Ram City hospital. “In order to create institutional isolation facility in private sector for international passengers who have travelled from or transited through United Kingdom in the past four weeks (November 25 to December 24, 2020) and tested positive, the authorities of the following hospitals are directed to establish separate isolation unit for such passengers on payment basis with immediate effect,” read the notice by Dr RN Das, the medical superintendent of the nursing homes in Delhi.So far, beds had been designated in Lok Nayak hospital to isolate Covid-positive persons likely to be carrying the new variant of the virus. The hospital so far has 39 such persons admitted to its special isolation ward.Read more| Delhi records 574 Covid-19 infections in last 24 hours, one of the lowest in months“Consequent upon reduction in reporting of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the competent authority has decided to de-escalate the number of dedicated beds reserved for Covid in the following hospitals,” read an order by the special secretary (health) SM Ali. Both Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals will reduce their Covid-19 beds by nearly 1,000, which is the highest among the seven hospitals, as per the order. Following them will be the Rajiv Gandhi Super speciality hospital in Tahirpur that will reduce the number of beds by 150, the extra ones that were added for Covid-19 patients during the third surge in the number of cases in November. “We will take a couple of days to rearrange the facilities. We have 121 Covid-19 patients at the moment. All of them will be moved to a single block, and the other services will be started in other buildings and a plan will be made to reduce contact between the patients and the staff working in the two areas,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. Another senior doctor from the hospital said Lok Nayak will likely restart outpatient clinics January 4 onwards and admissions of patients from among them will start in the rest of the 1,000 beds at the hospital. “This is a step in the right direction. However, there is still significant challenge for the surgery students – all anaesthesia residents are involved in the care of the Covid-19 patients and no surgeries can take place without them. Also, we have requested the administration to start the college for the undergraduate students,” Dr Keshave Singh, president of the resident doctors association of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-cases-fall-delhi-govt-orders-115-hospitals-to-scale-down-covid-beds/story-wnl2awm6kvrOuh5I3eZBeI.html
01-01-2021||Chandigarh||Mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee’s killing in Punjab arrested at Delhi airport||Punjab gangster Sukhmeetpal Singh, alias Sukh Bhikhariwal, who is also the mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu’s killing at Bhikhiwind near Tarn Taran on October 16, has been arrested from Delhi airport. Bhikhariwal, who had been traced to Dubai since December 8, was arrested upon his arrival at the airport by the special cell police of the national capital on Thursday morning, Punjab Police officials said. They have been in constant touch with Delhi Police. Bhikhariwal’s name emerged during the interrogation of the five men arrested by Delhi Police on December 7 after an encounter. Two of the five —Sukhdeep Singh alias Sukha and Gurjeet Singh alias Bha —were from Gurdaspur district. While the other three were from Kashmir and linked to a terror outfit based in Pakistan. Bhikhariwal was rounded up by Delhi Police with the help of Dubai police on December 7 and the process for his deportation had been underway since then. MURDER MOTIVE YET TO BE ASCERTAINED Punjab Police said Sukha and Gurjeet had arrived on a motorcycle at Sandhu’s house on October 16 and shot him dead at point blank range. Eleven people, including two jailed gangsters, were arrested for the murder in November. Sandhu’s killing was orchestrated by the two jailed gangsters, Ravinder Singh Gian and Sukhdeep Singh, from Patiala and Ferozepur prisons at the behest of Bhikhariwal. The police, however, didn’t disclose the motive behind Sandhu’s killing, saying: “Only Bhikhariwal knows the reason.” Tarn Taran Police have been working on various theories, while Sandhu’s family members have been terming the killing an act of terror. Sandhu and his wife Jagdish Kaur had got bravery awards for fighting terrorism during its peak in Punjab. Tarn Taran police said they will bring Bhikhariwal on production warrant once the investigation of Delhi Police is completed. On Tuesday, a local court turned down the plea of Tarn Taran police seeking a production warrant of Sukha and Bha, citing the coronavirus pandemic. WANTED IN 10 CRIMINAL CASES IN PUNJAB Tarn Taran SSP Dhruman H Nimbale had said efforts were on to bring the duo on production warrant as the custodial interrogation of them is vital in the Sandhu murder case. Bhikariwal is wanted to the Punjab Police in around 10 criminal cases, including those of murder, attempt to murder, robbery, kidnapping, dacoity, drug smuggling, and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Bhikariwal, who is an accused in the Nabha jailbreak case, is also wanted in connection with the attack on a Shiv Sena leader in Gurdaspur last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mastermind-of-shaurya-chakra-awardee-s-killing-in-punjab-arrested-at-delhi-airport/story-M2IzNTD7C7YU7HaNqn2PlK.html
01-01-2021||World||Trump extends ban on H1-B visas by three months||US President Donald Trump has extended the freeze on the most sought-after H-1B visas by Indian IT professionals, along with other types of foreign work visas and green cards through March 31 to protect American workers, saying that the reasons for which he had imposed such restrictions amidst the pandemic have not changed. The freeze on various categories of work visas was ordered by Trump through two proclamations on April 22 and June 22 last year. Hours before the freeze was set to expire on December 31, Trump issued another proclamation on Thursday to extend it until March 31, ensuring that his sweeping limits on legal immigration will remain in place when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on January 20. He said that the reasons for which he had issued such a restriction have not changed. The continuation of the restrictions, which comes with just 20 days left in the Republican President’s term, is the latest effort to bar the entry of immigrants to the US. Restricting immigration has been a focus of the Trump administration since its first days when it issued the travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries, and it has continued into Trump’s final year in office as the White House uses the coronavirus pandemic as cover. Biden, a Democrat, has promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump’s immigration policies are cruel. US media commented that Trump’s decision was yet another example of how the his administration is trying to box Biden in on challenging policy matters. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. They would now have to wait at least till the end of March before approaching the US diplomatic missions to get stamping. It would also impact a large number of Indian IT professionals who are seeking renewal of their H-1B visas. President Trump said that the effects of COVID-19 on the US labour market and the health of American communities are a matter of ongoing national concern, and the considerations present in the two previous proclamations have not been eliminated. “The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to significantly disrupt Americans’ livelihoods. While the November overall unemployment rate in the United States of 6.7 per cent reflects a marked decline from its April high, there were still 9,834,000 fewer seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs in November than in February of 2020,” Trump said in his proclamation. The current number of new daily cases worldwide reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, is higher than the comparable number present during June, and while therapeutics and vaccines are recently available for an increasing number of Americans, their effect on the labour market and community health has not yet been fully realised, he said. “Moreover, actions such as States’ continued imposition of restrictions on businesses still affect the number of workers that can be hired as compared with February of 2020,” Trump said, adding that his latest proclamation may be extended if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-extends-ban-on-h1-b-visas-by-three-months/story-Iqky7WQTs59lnG1uv8nrfK.html
01-01-2021||World||Biden’s pick to lead Treasury, Janet Yellen, made over $7 million in speaking fees||President-elect Joe Biden’s choice to be treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, collected more than $7 million in speaking fees over the past two years from major financial firms and tech giants including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Google, according to disclosure forms filed as part of her nomination.Yellen’s was among three financial disclosures turned in by Biden transition officials that were made public on Thursday by the Office of Government Ethics. In a separate filing, Yellen listed firms and banks where she had received speaking fees and said she intended to “seek written authorization” from ethics officials to “participate personally and substantially” in matters involving them.Yellen was the Federal Reserve chair from 2014 to 2018. Her term was not renewed by President Donald Trump. She took in the speaking fees in 2019 and 2020.Her selection by Biden to lead the Treasury Department has been cheered by progressive Democrats, who support Yellen’s work as a labor economist who has long prioritized combating economic inequality. Since her nomination was announced, Yellen has pledged to work to fight systemic racism and climate change.But receiving steep payments from Wall Street bankers and other powerful corporations could become an issue as her nomination works its way through a closely divided Senate. Hillary Clinton faced criticism from the left wing of the Democratic Party while running for president in 2016 for having received lucrative speaking fees at Wall Street firms.A Biden transition spokesperson said Friday that, since leaving the Fed, Yellen has “spoken at economic conferences, universities and to business groups and financial institutions about her experiences and her views on what we can do as a country to build a stronger economy and increase our competitiveness.” He added that “this is not someone who pulls punches when it comes to bad actors or bad behavior.”Also released Thursday were disclosure forms from Biden’s choice to be secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who detailed his work at a consulting firm he co-founded, WestExec Advisors, LLC. They show that Blinken was paid more than $1.1 million and has entered into an agreement, negotiated in October, to sell his equity interest in the firm, where he advised clients including Bank of America and Facebook.Avril Haines, Biden’s choice to be national intelligence director, disclosed being a consultant at WestExec Advisors and collecting around $55,000 in fees between October 2017 and last summer. In a separate letter to ethics officials, Haines promised to recuse herself for one year in issues involving WestExec as well as her other past employers, including Columbia University, Syracuse University and the Brookings Institution think tank.Some advocacy groups began warning just after Election Day that Biden, who was a senator from Delaware for 36 years and served as vice president for two terms, could rely too heavily on officials with strong ties to past Democratic administrations. Many of those left public sector posts for jobs in the private sector and are now seeking to return to government, raising concerns about the “revolving door” between policy and corporate and financial influence.Biden, however, has largely shrugged off such concerns, saying he’s not afraid to rely on advisers with deep governmental experience. He’s pledged to assemble a Cabinet well versed in the workings of government and full of members from across the racial and ideological spectrum who look like the diverse country they will represent.Biden’s transition team says it expects to announce more Cabinet picks next week, ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Among those positions yet to be filled are the president-elect’s selection for labor secretary and attorney general — a choice that could be complicated by federal prosecutors investigating the finances of Biden’s son Hunter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-pick-to-lead-treasury-janet-yellen-made-over-7-million-in-speaking-fees/story-aSUWxmNUuKjGXdZge4jygN.html
01-01-2021||World||Iraq explosives experts working to defuse mine on oil tanker||Iraqi explosives experts were working to defuse a large mine discovered on an oil tanker in the Persian Gulf and evacuate its crew, authorities said Friday.The statement came a day after two private security firms said sailors feared they had found a limpet mine on the MT Pola, a Liberian-flagged tanker in the waters off the Iraqi port of Basra. A limpet mine is a type of naval mine that attaches to the side of a ship, usually by a diver-member of special forces. It later explodes, and can significantly damage a vessel.The Iraqi statement said the mine had been attached to a tanker rented from Iraq’s Oil Marketing Company SOMO that was refueling another vessel. Iraq’s naval forces were making “a great effort to accomplish the mission” safely, said Iraq’s Security Media Cell, which is affiliated with the country’s security forces.It was the first official Iraqi confirmation that a mine was discovered on an Iraqi tanker transferring fuel in the Persian Gulf to another vessel. It did not identify either vessels or provide more details.The discovery came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US in the waning days of President Donald Trump’s administration.Already, America has conducted B-52 bomber flyovers and sent a nuclear submarine into the Persian Gulf over what Trump officials describe as the possibility of an Iranian attack on the one-year anniversary of the U.S. drones strike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian general and a top Iraqi militia leader.Iraq is marking the anniversary with a series of events this week.On Thursday, the United Kingdom Marine Trade Operations, an organization under Britain’s royal navy, said on its website that an “unknown object” had been attached to a ship’s hull in the vicinity of Iraq’s Khor Al-Zubair Port, without providing further information.The Pola serves as floating fuel oil storage of Iraq’s State Organization of Marketing of Oil, said Sudharsan Sarathy, a senior oil analyst at the data-analysis firm Refinitiv. Smaller vessels carry the fuel oil to the ship, which then conducts ship-to-ship transfers in the Persian Gulf to clients.Sarathy said the Pola was conducting a ship-to-ship transfer with the MT Nordic Freedom, a Bermuda-flagged tanker.Friday’s statement said an explosives-handling team from Iraq’s Interior Ministry was airlifted to the scene after a “foreign body” was observed attached to one of the ships in the waiting area in Iraq’s international waters, 28 nautical miles from Iraqi oil ports.Despite high waves, the vessel receiving the fuel was evacuated while the Iraqi team was still working on neutralizing the mine and evacuating the refueling ship, it said.In 2019, the US blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all the world’s oil passes. Iran denies being involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-explosives-experts-working-to-defuse-mine-on-oil-tanker/story-cHcbmhCt7HOvbFF0qagceK.html
01-01-2021||World||India seeks ‘urgent, time-bound’ assistance for 39 sailor stuck in Chinese waters||India on Friday called for “urgent, practical and time-bound” assistance to 39 stranded Indian sailors on board two ships in Chinese waters considering the “grave” humanitarian situation developing in the vessels. Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Indian bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand has been on anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province of China since June 13 and it has 23 Indian sailors. Another vessel, MV Anastasia, with 16 Indian nationals as its crew is on anchorage near Caofeidian port in China since September 20, he said. Srivastava said both these vessels have been waiting for discharge of their cargo and there is a growing stress on the crew members on account of the long delay. “Given this and our concern for the increasingly difficult conditions for our crew members, these two cases are being pursued vigorously,” he said responding to a media query on the matter. Srivastava said the Indian Embassy in Beijing continued to remain in close and continuous touch with the Chinese authorities in Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin, adding the MEA is also following up on the matter through the Chinese Embassy here for “an early resolution”. “We have noted the statements of the Chinese side, expressing their willingness to extend their assistance in this matter. We expect that this assistance will be provided in an urgent, practical and time-bound manner, given the grave humanitarian situation that is developing on board the ships,” Srivastava said. He said the Indian Embassy has repeatedly taken up the issue with both the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs and the local provincial authorities, requesting that the ships be allowed to dock and/or the crew be allowed to be changed. “They have been following up this matter for the last few months. The Indian Ambassador has personally taken up this issue with the Vice Foreign Minister. The Ministry has also been following this issue with the Chinese Embassy,” Srivastava said. He said the Chinese authorities have conveyed that on account of various COVID-19-related restrictions imposed by the local authorities, change of crew is not being permitted from these ports. “While the shipping companies are examining the logistics of sailing the ships away from their current points of anchorage, our embassy is liaising with relevant authorities in Tianjin for berthing approvals to facilitate the crew change,” Srivastava said. He said the shipping companies have been requested to ensure that they submit their plans for crew change at the earliest for approvals by the local Chinese authorities. “We also understand that MV Anastasia is exploring the possibility of a crew change at sea at its current point of anchorage in Caofeidian. Our Embassy has yesterday written to Chinese authorities proposing this alternative and sought approval for the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-seeks-urgent-time-bound-assistance-for-39-sailor-stuck-in-chinese-waters/story-I4T0MVhkLKQrN7WYbEubUN.html
01-01-2021||World||US vice president Mike Pence seeks dismissal of suit aiming to overturn election||The Justice Department has asked a federal judge to dismiss a last-gasp lawsuit led by a House Republican that seeks to give Vice President Mike Pence the power to overturn the results of the presidential election won by Joe Biden when Congress formally counts the Electoral College votes next week.Pence, as president of the Senate, will oversee the Wednesday session and declare the winner of the White House race. The Electoral College this month cemented Biden’s 306-232 victory, and multiple legal efforts by President Donald Trump’s campaign to challenge the results have failed.The suit names Pence, who has a largely ceremonial role in next week’s proceedings, as the defendant and asks the court to throw out the 1887 law that spells out how Congress handles the vote counting. It asserts that the vice president “may exercise the exclusive authority and sole discretion in determining which electoral votes to count for a given State.”The Justice Department is representing Pence in a case that aims to find a way to keep his boss, President Donald Trump, in power. In a court filing in Texas on Wednesday, the department said Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Republican electors from Arizona “have sued the wrong defendant” — if, in fact, any of those suing actually have “a judicially cognizable claim.”“It is the role prescribed for the Senate and the House of Republicans in the Electoral Count Act to which plaintiffs object, not any actions that Vice President Pence has taken. ... A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction.”Trump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud. But a range of nonpartisan election officials and Republicans has confirmed there was no fraud in the November contest that would change the results of the election. That includes former Attorney General William Barr, who said he saw no reason to appoint a special counsel to look into the president’s claims about the 2020 election. He resigned from his post last week.Trump and his allies have filed roughly 50 lawsuits challenging election results, and nearly all has been dismissed or dropped. He’s also lost twice at the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-mike-pence-seeks-dismissal-of-suit-aiming-to-overturn-election/story-O7tP3hbCHBmUjwshoPU88J.html

The attack on the temple in Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) Karak district on Wednesday drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders.Khan vowed to protect the religious sites of minorities and said the police has arrested several suspects involved in the temple attack.Over 45 people, mostly members of a radical Islamist party, have been arrested for destroying the temple. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam leader Rehmat Salam Khattak was among those arrested.On Thursday, Chief Minister Khan’s Special Assistant for Information and spokesman for the KP government Kamran Bangash said that the provincial government has ordered authorities to reconstruct the damaged temple. Deputy Commissioner and District Police Officer Karak have been issued directives to take immediate steps for reconstructing the temple, Bangash said.The government is bound to give protection to the minorities and their worship places, he added.The temple was attacked by the mob after members of the Hindu community received permission from local authorities to renovate its decades-old building, according to witnesses.The mob, led by a local cleric and supporters of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party (Fazal ur Rehman group), demolished the newly constructed work alongside the old structure, they said.The Supreme Court on Thursday took notice of the attack and ordered the local authorities to appear before the court on January 5.According to a statement by the apex court, Hindu lawmaker and the Pakistan Hindu Council chief Ramesh Kumar Vankwani called on Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed in Karachi to discuss the issue.“The chief justice of Pakistan showed grave concern over the tragic incident and informed the member of parliament that he has already taken cognisance of the issue and has fixed the matter before court on January 5, at Islamabad,” according to the statement.The court has issued directions to one-man Commission on Minorities Rights, KP chief secretary and KP inspector general of police to visit the site and submit a report on January 4.Meanwhile, a commission on rights of minorities headed by Dr. Shuaib Suddle along with lawmaker Ramesh Kumar and Chief Secretary Dr. Kaazim Niaz on Friday visited the temple, which was vandalised by the mob.The delegates held meeting with the members of the local peace committee and the Hindu community and condemned the unfortunate incident. The peace committee members disowned the tragic incident, saying the attackers were not from the local community or resident of Karak district.Chairman of the commission Dr. Suddle and Member of National Assembly Ramesh Kumar expressed confidence in the steps taken by the KP Government to pacify the situation.The commission head and MNA Ramesh Kumar also met Chief Minister Khan in Peshawar and exchanged views over the incident. The commission condemned the incident in strong words.Chief Minister Khan has assured the commission that strict action would be taken against culprits involved in the incident. Leader of Hindu Community Peshawar Haroon Sarab Diyal said that a samadhi of a Hindu religious leader exists at the temple site and Hindu families from across the country do visit the samadhi on every Thursday.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.The controversy over the samadhi erupted many decades ago.According to the details submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014 in a case about it, the Hindus had been visiting the shrine till 1997 when it was dismantled by the locals.The apex court in 2014 ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to restore and reconstruct the Hindu shrine.The order was issued over a petition of a Hindu lawmaker who had claimed that the shrine had been occupied by an influential cleric of the area.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country. The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.

01-01-2021||World||Pak parliamentary panel orders fresh probe into minor Christian girl’s abduction||A Pakistani parliamentary committee has ordered a fresh inquiry into the abduction of a minor Christian girl in Punjab province’s Faisalabad city after being convinced that police mishandled the case. The 13-year old was freed five months after some Muslim men allegedly abducted her, forcibly converted her to Islam, and then one of them married her, the Dawn News reported.A meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights was held on Thursday and it discussed the issues of forced conversion and marriage. Faisalabad police officials told the committee that they had received a complaint from the family of the girl that a man named Khizer Hayat allegedly abducted the girl. But the girl’s recorded statement said otherwise.The police maintained that the girl in her statement recorded before a magistrate said she had left her home voluntarily and embraced Islam and got married. The police officials told the committee that the girl had also undergone a medical test and according to the doctor’s report she was between 16 and 17 years old.However, during the committee meeting, the girl’s father presented a certificate issued by National Database & Registration Authority (Nadra) which showed her as 13 years old.The members of the committee raised questions over the investigation process and declared that the certificate issued by Nadra was authentic proof of the girl’s age, rejecting the doctor’s report. As a proof, the family members also presented her twin brother’s Form “B”, the daily said.The girl’s father also registered a complaint with the committee about the behaviour of the police over which the committee expressed its regret.The chairman of the committee apologised to the family of the minor girl and demanded that legal action be taken against those responsible and proper protection be provided to the family.The committee also directed the senior superintendent of police (SSP) Faisalabad to investigate the whole matter and submit a report to the committee on January 6. The SSP assured the committee that the matter would be investigated and a charge-sheet would be issued to the concerned investigating officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-parliamentary-panel-orders-fresh-probe-into-minor-christian-girl-s-abduction/story-67IWfQ9zZnj67EtH0IrxFN.html
01-01-2021||World||UK in ‘eye of the storm’ amid surging new Covid-19 cases||British medics warned Friday that hospitals around the country face a perilous few weeks amid surging new coronavirus infections that have been blamed on a new variant of the virus.A day after the UK posted a record 55,892 new infections and another 964 coronavirus-related deaths, concerns are mounting about the impact on the overstretched National Health Service. Field hospitals that were constructed in the early days of the pandemic but that were subsequently mothballed are being reactivated.The Royal College of Nursing’s England director, Mike Adams, told Sky News that the UK was in the “eye of the storm” and that it was “infuriating” to see people not following the social distancing guidance or wearing masks.A leading physician also warned of burnout among health workers on the front line of the outbreak in hospitals, while also urging people to follow the rules.“I am worried,” Adrian Boyle, vice president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, told the BBC. “We are very much at battle stations.”New infections have more than doubled in recent weeks after a new variant that is said to be around 70% more contagious was found to be behind a big spike in cases around London and the southeast of England.Given the lags between new cases and hospitalizations and subsequently deaths, there are huge concerns about the path of the pandemic over the coming month or two in a country that has Europe’s second-highest virus-related death toll at nearly 74,000.As a result of the spike, which has spread around the country and seen lockdown restrictions tightened, the strategy around the rollout of vaccines has been changed to get more people an initial jab as soon as possible, with a scheduled second one delayed.In a joint statement Thursday, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the first vaccine dose offers “substantial” protection.Currently, two vaccines have been approved for use in the UK.Just under 1 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech, with a small minority also getting the second dose as planned after 21 days.Alongside the approval earlier this week of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, a new dosing regimen was outlined, aimed at providing a speedier rollout. This means the second dose of both vaccines will be within 12 weeks of the first.The four medical officers said they were “confident” the first dose of both vaccines would provide “substantial” protection.“In the short term, the additional increase of vaccine efficacy from the second dose is likely to be modest; the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine,” they said.The new plan has faced widespread criticism, with the UK’s main union for doctors warning that delaying the second dose causes huge problems for thousands of partially vaccinated elderly and vulnerable people.“It is grossly and patently unfair to tens of thousands of our most at-risk patients to now try to reschedule their appointments,” said Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-in-eye-of-the-storm-amid-surging-new-covid-19-cases/story-E0IPCiiMNC3yChyHE4MNbM.html
01-01-2021||World||Murakami urges politicians to speak sincerely about Covid-19||Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami says politicians need to help reduce public uncertainty and fear over the coronavirus and gain people’s support by speaking sincerely about the pandemic.Murakami, in a two-hour live New Year’s Eve radio show, urged political leaders to “talk honestly from the gut” to the people to encourage their participation in slowing an upsurge in infections, which are on the verge of getting out of control.His comments came hours after Japan’s capital announced its new daily cases soared to a record 1,337 on Thursday, up sharply from the previous high of 949 on December 26.“I think an essential problem with the coronavirus is our uncertain future, which is triggering a sense of fear, anger and escapism among people, which I think is the biggest danger,” Murakami said in a conversation with one of two guests, Nobel physiology prize winner Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University.“It would be difficult for the people to squarely cooperate with the (anti-virus) measures when politicians are not communicating with messages” in words that can reach people’s hearts, Murakami said, without identifying any politician by name.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, have been criticized for reading carefully scripted statements prepared by bureaucrats at news conferences, often repeating the same phrases in response to questions asked by reporters.Japan so far has avoided an explosive growth in infections, but its recent upsurge has many people worried.Suga took few pandemic measures until mid-December, when he suspended a state-funded discount travel promotion campaign. He has also been criticized for joining a steak dinner for eight people when the government advised against parties of more than five.Known for bestsellers such as “A Wild Sheep Chase,” “The Wind-up Bird Chronicle” and “1Q84,” Murakami said during the show that issues raised by the coronavirus seem to be part of developments such as globalism, climate change, rise of populism and widening social disparity.Murakami has hosted “Murakami Radio” shows almost every two months since August 2018 on Tokyo FM. Thursday’s program was his first live show. In May, he hosted a pre-recorded show from his home to cheer up people who were under stress during a state of emergency in place in parts of Japan, including Tokyo.Murakami began writing while running a jazz bar in Tokyo after graduating from university. Following his 1979 debut novel “Hear the Wind Sing,” the 1987 romance “Norwegian Wood” became his first bestseller, establishing him as a young literary star.He has written stories inspired by events that have shaken society, including the 1995 Tokyo subway gassing attack by an apocalyptic cult and a deadly earthquake in Kobe, where he grew up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murakami-urges-politicians-to-speak-sincerely-about-virus/story-SzIH9M8qVpfK9ayBQEkJNL.html

All you need to know||Ahead of the certification process of the Electoral College and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, some of the Republican lawmakers are planning to object to the certification in their last attempt to overturn the results. US President Donald Trump and his allies have been trying to overturn the election results on the basis of unproven claims of large-scale electoral fraud. According to a CNN report, at least 140 House Republicans are planning to vote against the counting of electoral votes on January 6. Missouri Senator Josh Hawley has also announced that he will object to the Electoral College vote, reportedly prompting Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell to ask him about the rationale behind the decision.Republican leader explains the motiveHowever, several Republican leaders, including McConnell, have been warning their GOP colleagues to not disrupt the certification process. Republican Senate Ben Sasse wrote in a Facebook post that he has been urging his colleagues to reject the “dangerous ploy” to overturn the election. Sasse said that he hasn’t heard a single Congressional Republican allege in private that the election results were fraudulent.“Instead, I hear them talk about their worries about how they will “look” to President Trump’s most ardent supporters,” he wrote.Sasse explained that there are a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there’s a quick way to “tap into the president’s populist base without doing any real, long-term damage.” He warned that Trump and his allies are “playing with fire”, adding that the president and his “arsonist members of Congress” have no evidence to prove voter fraud.

Biden had earlier singled out the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), accusing the office of obstructing the incoming administration’s efforts to prepare for the presidency. Trump’s budget chief Russ Vought said that the Biden transition team has been making “false accusations” about Office of Management and Budget. In a letter to Biden’s transition chief Ted Kaufman, Vought said that OMB has fully participated in transition efforts, including more than 45 meetings. He further added that redirecting staff and resources to draft “your team’s budget proposals is not an OMB transition responsibility.”“OMB will not participate in developing policies that will weaken border security, dismantle the President’s deregulatory successes, and draft budgets that will bankrupt America,” the letter read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-allies-prepare-for-final-attempt-to-overturn-poll-results-all-you-need-to-know/story-AAr16S1Gq4zkYd0FI7ifmJ.html
01-01-2021||World||BioNTech founders warn of Covid-19 vaccine supply gaps||BioNTech is working flat out with partner Pfizer to boost production of their Covid-19 vaccine, its founders said, warning there would be gaps in supply until other vaccines were rolled out.The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union (EU) due to relatively slow approval from the bloc’s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.The delays have caused consternation in Germany, where some regions had to temporarily close vaccination centres days after the launch of an inoculation drive on December 27.“At the moment it doesn’t look good - a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel in an interview.A shot from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Jan. 6.German Health Minister Jens Spahn has urged the EMA to also quickly approve a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that Britain cleared this week. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain.Sahin said the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with a variant first detected in Britain that appears to be more contagious. “We are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant, and will soon know more,” he said.Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals.New production line planned Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Oezlem Tuereci, who is the company’s chief medical officer. Both faulted the EU’s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be quickly approved.The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order of half that size.“At some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,” Tuereci told Spiegel. “By then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.”BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg, Germany, in February that could produce 250 million doses in the first half of the year, said Sahin.Talks are under way with contract manufacturers on boosting output and there should be greater clarity by the end of January, he added.Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine, which requires storage at around minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), easier to handle. A next-generation vaccine that would keep at higher temperatures could be ready by late summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-founders-warn-of-covid-19-vaccine-supply-gaps/story-oxMID8AyAEAl91TU6EfFuK.html

Washington had accused him of masterminding attacks by Iranian-aligned militias on US forces in the region. Days after the US drone strike, Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on an Iraqi air base where US forces were stationed, and Iranian forces on high alert mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner taking off from Tehran.Esmail Ghaani who succeeded Soleimani as head the elite Quds force, said on Friday Iran was still ready to respond.“From inside your own house, there may emerge someone who will retaliate for your crime,” he said at a televised event to mark the anniversary at Tehran University.“American mischief will not deter the Quds force from carrying on its resistance path,” he added.Two US B-52 bombers flew over the Middle East on Wednesday in what US officials said was a message of deterrence to Iran ahead of the first anniversary.On Thursday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused US President Donald Trump of attempting to fabricate a pretext to attack Iran, and said Tehran would defend itself forcefully.Representatives of Iran’s regional allies and movements in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Gaza also spoke at Friday’s anniversary event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-commander-vows-resistance-a-year-after-soleimani-killing/story-untes6pxRibfWpVL4wUx0M.html

The US blocked USD 342,000 in funds of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), USD 1,725 of the Jaish-e Mohammed (JeM) and USD 45,798 of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen-al-Islami, the US Department of Treasury said in an annual report released on Thursday. All the three groups are Pakistan-based terror outfits. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen-al-Islami is a jihad group operating primarily in Kashmir. Another Pakistan-based Kashmir centric terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen has USD 4,321 blocked by the US in 2019 as against USD 2,287 the previous year, the report said. For the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, the US blocked USD 5,067 in 2019 as against a paltry USD 318 in 2018. The Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the leading US government agency responsible for implementing sanctions against the assets of international terrorist organisations and terrorism-supporting countries. The federal body implements these sanctions as part of its general mission to administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals. According to the report, in 2019 the US blocked USD 63 million in funds of nearly 70 designated terrorist organisations, with the highest being USD 3.9 million of the al-Qaeda group. While the total blocked funds in 2018 was USD 46 million, that of the al-Qaeda was USD 6.4 million that year. The list includes the Haqqani network (USD 26,546). It is a significant increase from USD 3,626 in 2018. The US continues to block USD 580,811 in funds of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has remained the same for two years -- 2018 and 2019. The report indicated a significant drop in Taliban funds being blocked by the US from USD 296,805 in 2018 to USD 59,065 in 2019. According to the report, the combination of sanctions programmes targeting international terrorists and terrorist organisations with those targeting terrorism-supporting governments constitute a wide-ranging assault on international terrorism and its supporters and financiers. The US also blocked USD 200.19 million in funds of countries designated as sponsors of terrorism -- Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea.

Recently, the Indian Ambassador’s Group said brutal terrorist attacks in France by Islamic fundamentalists have implications for all democratic countries based on pluralism and rule of law and India stands with Paris at “this difficult moment” and fully supports the French government on this issue.They said India has been a victim of state-sponsored terrorism for decades and is especially sensitive to issues of terrorism.Moreover, France is the first country with which we initiated a strategic dialogue after our 1998 nuclear tests when France refused to impose any bilateral sanctions on us and displayed a far greater understanding of India’s security compulsions compared to other countries.The induction of Rafale fighter jets in Indian Air Force is a glaring example of this strategic tie.

01-01-2021||World||Australia changes word in anthem to honour Indigenous people||Australia has changed one word in its national anthem to reflect what the Prime Minister called “the spirit of unity” and the country’s Indigenous population. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on New Years Eve announced that the second line of the anthem, Advance Australia Fair, has been changed from “For we are young and free” to “For we are one and free.” . The change took effect Friday.“It is time to ensure this great unity is reflected more fully in our national anthem,” he said, adding that Australia was the “most successful multicultural nation on Earth.” “While Australia as a modern nation may be relatively young, our country’s story is ancient, as are the stories of the many First Nations peoples whose stewardship we rightly acknowledge and respect,” Morrison said.“In the spirit of unity, it is only right that we ensure our national anthem reflects this truth and shared appreciation.” Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said in a statement that he had been asked about the change and had given it his support.Wyatt, the first Indigenous Australian elected to the federal Parliament’s lower house, said the one-word change was “small in nature but significant in purpose.” “It is an acknowledgement that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures date back 65,000 years,” he said.The change comes less than two months after New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed support for Indigenous Australians who said the national anthem did not reflect them and their history. University of South Wales law professor Megan Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman from the Barrungam nation in southwest Queensland state, criticized the lack of consultation with Indigenous people about the change.“This is a disappointing way to end 2020 and start 2021. Everything about us, without us,” she wrote on social media.

01-01-2021||World||In dueling New Year messages, Trump reflects while Biden looks ahead||President Donald Trump in a New Year’s Eve message reflected on his accomplishments in office, calling them “historic victories,” while his successor, President-elect Joe Biden, struck an upbeat tone in looking ahead to 2021.After weeks of vowing to win his fight to remain in office, Republican Trump said in a video posted on Twitter: “We have to be remembered for what’s been done.”Trump, who has yet to formally concede his November election defeat to his Democratic rival, returned to Washington early from his Florida resort amid a fight with Congress over a defense bill and coronavirus aid checks.Also Read: No reason given for Trump cutting short his Florida vacation amid tensions with IranSpeaking from Rehobeth Beach, Delaware, Biden paid tribute to healthcare workers and encouraged people to get vaccinated in a brief appearance with his wife, Jill Biden, on the long-running ABC special “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2021.”“I’m absolutely, positively confident - confident - we’re going to come back and we’re going to come back even stronger than before,” said Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20.He repeated his call for vaccines to be distributed more quickly.Trump, who had Covid-19 in October, frequently played down the severity of the pandemic and oversaw a response many health experts have criticized as disorganized, cavalier and sometimes ignored the science behind virus transmission.But in his remarks he noted that the United States has produced a Covid-19 vaccine in record time and he had correctly predicted it would come before the year ended.The United States has been one of the countries worst-hit by Covid-19 and leads the world in fatalities, with more than 340,000 deaths officially attributed to the virus.Trump was originally scheduled to attend a New Year’s Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort.The White House has given no reason for why he returned to Washington early, but it coincides with Trump’s fight with Congress over his veto of a major defense bill and his demand for increased Covid-19 stimulus checks, as well as a spike in tensions with Iran.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the chamber, dealt a likely death blow on Wednesday to Trump’s bid to boost coronavirus aid to Americans, declining to schedule a swift vote on a bill to raise relief checks to $2,000 from the $600 included in a $892 billion relief package passed by Congress earlier this month.TENSIONS WITH REPUBLICANSTrump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have largely stuck with him through four turbulent years, but he lashed out at them in recent days for not fully backing his unsupported claims of election fraud, rejecting his demand for bigger checks and for moving toward the veto override.McConnell on Thursday again rejected a vote on a standalone bill that would increase the stimulus checks, calling it “socialism for rich people” and “a terrible way to get help to families who actually need it.” The bill was passed by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Monday.McConnell also said there should be nothing controversial about approving the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Trump vetoed because it does not repeal certain legal protections for tech companies.Also Read: Trump aims to fabricate ‘pretext for war’: Iran’s Foreign Minister“We’ve enacted an annual NDAA for 59 straight years and counting,” McConnell said. “In the next few days – the easy way or the hard way – we’re going to do our job once again. This body will fulfill our responsibility to the men and women who protect our country.”The House voted to overturn Trump’s veto on Monday. The Senate will convene again on Friday at Noon EST (1700 GMT) for a rare New Year’s Day session in which lawmakers are expected to cast the first of two procedural votes aimed at overriding the veto. If that succeeds, the Senate is expected to hold a second procedural vote on Saturday followed by a final vote on passage.Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has said he will object to Biden’s victory when Congress convenes to officially tally the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, which could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has no chance of overturning the results. CNN reported that some 140 Republicans in the House are expected to engage in similar tactics.Some Republican senators had supported Trump’s call for an increase in the stimulus payments, notably David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who face runoff elections in Georgia Jan. 5 that will determine which party controls the Senate under Biden.But Perdue’s campaign suffered a setback on Thursday, saying the senator was quarantining after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.U.S.-Iran tensions, meanwhile, have again spiked.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday accused Washington of trying to fabricate a pretext for attacking his country and vowed Tehran would defend itself even though it does not seek war.Two U.S. B-52 bombers flew over the Middle East on Wednesday in what U.S. officials said was a message of deterrence to Iran ahead of the first anniversary of a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-dueling-new-year-messages-trump-reflects-while-biden-looks-ahead/story-OGxEyTDUx391khu7x5DwFJ.html
01-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine update: Pan-India dry run on Saturday, WHO approves Pfizer’s candidate||It’s been almost a month since several countries started vaccinations against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. While the United Kingdom was the first country anywhere to approve a Covid-19 vaccine and begin immunisation drive, several others have joined the list since then. Most countries have approved vaccines of Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE or Moderna, while some are using both. The Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine, too, has received approval, with the UK being the first country to give a nod, followed by Argentina.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the global caseload exceeds 83 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, here’s a look at some latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccination front:1. After conducting a two-day vaccine dry run on December 28 and 29, India will hold a nationwide exercise on Saturday. Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab were the four states where the dry run was held on Monday and Tuesday. Three vaccine candidates, including Pfizer’s, have applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) in India. However, Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin seem ahead in the race to become the country’s first Covid-19 vaccine.Also Read | Key expert panel meet today to review data on Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech Covid-19 vaccines2. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday granted “emergency validation” to Pfizer’s vaccine, its first since the start of the pandemic. The WHO decision will enable UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) to procure the vaccine for distribution to the countries in need.3. The European Union (EU) on Thursday said Germany’s BioNTech SE, which has developed a vaccine with America’s Pfizer Inc, has sought approval for an additional vaccine dose from each vial, instead of the five currently approved. The request, the 27-nation bloc said, will be reviewed by its human medicines committee, “in the shortest time frame possible.”4. Pakistan said on Thursday China has assured of providing it with over a million doses of the vaccine developed by Sinopharm, for emergency use. The vaccine, China’s first homegrown for Covid-19, was, earlier in the day, granted “conditional approval.” Pakistan, according to reports, has decided to “pre-book” the vaccine for its healthcare workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-pan-india-dry-run-on-saturday-who-approves-pfizer-s-candidate/story-GNDGz1lXKq4IrZY0yZwIaP.html
01-01-2021||World||Singapore and Malaysia Terminate High Speed Rail Project||Singapore said a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail link between the city state and Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpurhas been terminated.Malaysia has allowed the high-speed rail project “to be terminated, and has to compensate Singapore for costs that the city has already incurred in fulfilling its obligations,” according to a statement from Singapore’s transport ministry on Friday.The announcement came just after a December 31 deadline for the second and final extension of the suspension of the project, which was first mooted a decade ago and given the green light in 2013. In June, the Southeast Asian neighbours had agreed to put the development, which has already incurred multiple suspensions, on hold again amid a discussion around costs.The on-again, off-again 350 kilometer (218 mile) high-speed rail link would have cut travel time between the centers down to about 90 minutes versus more than four hours by car. Although flying between the two only takes about an hour, that’s a lot longer once airport check-in and security is taken into account. The service was due to start in 2026.Local media in Malaysia reported in November that Malaysia was considering ending the line in its southern city of Johor Bahru rather than in Singapore.The administration of former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who resigned in February, sought to cancel the project as the country grappled with debt and liabilities amounting to more than 1 trillion ringgit ($249 billion), before settling for a deferment and a S$15 million ($11.4 million) compensation fee to Singapore.Mahathir had at one stage estimated the project would cost around 110 billion ringgit for Malaysia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-and-malaysia-terminate-high-speed-rail-project/story-Yjrnkzxbbk9MhZ1Wj1WorN.html
01-01-2021||World||‘Disappointing’: Anthony Fauci on Covid-19 vaccine rollout in US||National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci on Thursday said that the coronavirus vaccine rollout hasn’t gone as he expected adding that it has been ‘disappointing’.“We would have liked to have seen it run smoothly and have 20 million doses into people today by the end of 2020, which was the projection,” Fauci said during an appearance on “Today”, as quoted by The Hill and added, “Obviously, it didn’t happen, and that’s disappointing.”The outgoing US President Donald Trump’s administration had touted a goal of getting 20 million people the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year but it was reported that the actual number will fall far short of that mark.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID data tracker stated that about 2.8 million people have received their first vaccine dose as of Thursday.The US infectious diseases expert hopes that the vaccine distribution will increase in January but that local municipalities will need support in order for that to happen.“There really has to be a lot more effort in the sense of resources for the locals, namely, the states, the cities, the counties, the places where the vaccine is actually going into the arms of individuals,” he said.Fauci continues to remain optimistic even though cases across the United States are rising and most recently a case of the newly strain of COVID was found in the US.“The good news is that science has and will come to the rescue getting us vaccines,” he said. “More than one vaccine, hopefully, five, six, seven or more vaccines throughout the world, that will get us out of this and put this in the rear-view mirror, behind us.”(ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disappointing-anthony-fauci-on-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-in-us/story-y3XjJI0yQu2ZhHC48mW51K.html
01-01-2021||World||‘I will work hard’: North Korea’s Kim thanks people in rare New Year’s cards||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un thanked the public for their trust and support “in the difficult times” and wished them happiness and good health in his first New Year’s Day cards sent to his people.Kim usually gives a televised speech on Jan. 1, but he is widely expected to skip the speech this year since he will address the country’s first ruling party congress in five years sometime in early January.“I will work hard to bring earlier the new era in which the ideals and desires of our people will come true,” Kim said in his letter, according to the Korean Central News Agency.“I offer thanks to the people for having invariably trusted and supported our party even in the difficult times,” he said. “I sincerely wish all the families across the country greater happiness and beloved people, good health.” North Korea is one of the world’s most cloistered countries, and it’s virtually impossible to independently confirm whether its 25 million people received Kim’s cards. The cards reportedly were the first a leader sent to North Koreans since 1995.Kim, who succeeded his father as North Korean leader in 2011, is facing the toughest challenges of his nine-year rule due to the pandemic, several natural disasters last summer and the stalemate over US-led sanctions and his nuclear weapons program.Kim will likely use the Workers’ Party congress as a venue to muster a stronger unity and lay out new development goals for the next few years, experts say.The Congress, the first in kind since 2006, is officially the party’s top decision-making body though real day-to-day decisions are made by Kim and his close associates. The rubberstamp body of delegates to the congress is expected to endorse Kim’s new initiatives without major debates.State media said North Korea planned to hold the congress early this month but didn’t specify the dates. In 2006, the congress was held for four days.Marking the new year’s start, a large crowd of people packed Pyongyang’s main square to watch fireworks, a concert and a flag-hoisting ceremony. State TV showed the people, wearing masks and heavy coats, waved their hands while standing close together.North Korea has steadfastly claimed to coronavirus-free - an assertion doubted by outsiders. But experts also say any outbreak likely wasn’t widespread and so North Korea considered it safe to hold big events like the party congress in Pyongyang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-thanks-people-in-rare-new-year-s-cards/story-wjTI5TlVsRlChVKaXRIbSM.html
01-01-2021||World||Japan’s emperor acknowledges ‘virus hardship’ in video message||Japan’s Emperor Naruhito expressed gratitude to medical professionals and acknowledged the hardship caused by the coronavirus in a New Year’s Day message shared by video instead of the usual public speech in front of large crowds at the palace.The emperor and his wife Empress Masako sat side by side, next to a sculpted bonsai plant in the video.Naruhito expressed his “deep respect and gratitude” to doctors and nurses treating COVID-19 patients and offered empathy to those who lost loved ones, lost their jobs or were struggling with loneliness.“Over this past year, we have all faced many problems and hardships over the spread of this unknown coronavirus that for most of us living in this age have never experienced on such a scale,” he said.He also said he was worried about the discrimination suffered by those who had been sick or worked in the medical field, a phenomenon widespread in conformist Japan.“I look forward with all my heart to be able to meet with all of you again, face to face,” he said, after offering his prayers for world peace.Japan has had more than 3,000 deaths from COVID-19. Worries are growing about another surge in cases, reaching a daily record of 1,337 new infection for the capital Tokyo on Thursday.The Imperial Palace in central Tokyo opens to the public each New Year’s Day and crowds on the grounds cheer the imperial family’s appearance.The Imperial Household Agency said last month a video message will be released instead because of the pandemic. The bigger anticipation in Japan had turned to whether Masako would appear. She has tended to be reclusive, suffering what has been described as a stress-related condition, but has appeared in more public events in recent years.Masako said “Happy New Year,” at the start of the message and spoke for the last 30 seconds of the nearly seven-minute message. Her beige suit matched the color of Naruhito’s tie.“I am praying from the bottom of my heart that this year will be as gentle a year as possible for all of you. This winter has been harsh with heavy snow in some areas earlier than usual, and so please everyone do stay healthy,” Masako said.The video message was Naruhito’s firs. His father Emperor Emeritus Akihito did two, after the tsunami disaster in northeastern Japan in 2011 and when he announced his abdication in 2016.The emperor does not have political power in Japan but holds symbolic significance for many people. Even Naruhito’s grandfather, Hirohito, the wartime emperor, was seen as a gentle man who loved nature in postwar years.

01-01-2021||World||Wisconsin hospital worker arrested for spoiled vaccine doses||Authorities arrested a suburban Milwaukee pharmacist Thursday suspected of deliberately ruining hundreds of doses of coronavirus vaccine by removing them from refrigeration for two nights.The arrest marks another setback in what has been a slower, messier start to vaccinate Americans than public health officials had expected. Leaders in Wisconsin and other states have been begging the Trump administration for more doses as health care workers and senior citizens line up for the lifesaving vaccine.Police in Grafton, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Milwaukee, said the Advocate Aurora Health pharmacist was arrested on suspicion of reckless endangerment, adulterating a prescription drug and criminal damage to property, all felonies. The pharmacist has been fired and police said in a news release that he was in jail. Police did not identify the pharmacist, saying he has not yet been formally charged.His motive remains unclear. Police said that detectives believe he knew the spoiled doses would be useless and people who received them would mistakenly think they’d been vaccinated when they hadn’t.Advocate Aurora Health Care Chief Medical Group Officer Jeff Bahr told reporters during a teleconference Thursday afternoon that the pharmacist deliberately removed 57 vials that held hundreds of doses of the Moderna vaccine from refrigeration at a Grafton medical center overnight on Dec. 24 into Dec. 25, returned them, then left them out again on the night of Dec. 25 into Saturday. The vials contained enough doses to inoculate 570 people.A pharmacy technician discovered the vials outside the refrigerator on Saturday morning. Bahr said the pharmacist initially said that he had removed the vials to access other items in the refrigerator and had inadvertently failed to put them back.The Moderna vaccine is viable for 12 hours outside refrigeration, so workers used the vaccine to inoculate 57 people before discarding the rest. Police said the discarded doses were worth between $8,000 and $11,000.Bahr said health system officials grew more suspicious of the pharmacist as they reviewed the incident. After multiple interviews, the pharmacist acknowledged Wednesday that he removed the vaccine intentionally over the two nights, Bahr said.That means that the doses people received Saturday are all but useless, he said. Moderna has told Aurora that there’s no safety concerns, but the hospital system is closely monitoring the people who received the spoiled doses, he said.Bahr declined to comment on the pharmacist’s motive. He said the hospital system’s security protocols are sound.“This was a situation involving a bad actor,” he said, “as opposed to a bad process.”The number of COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin has been rising in recent days after dipping in early December. The state Department of Health Services reported 3,810 newly confirmed cases on Thursday, marking the third straight day of rising daily infections. The state has now seen 481,102 cases.COVID-19 was a factor in 41 more deaths, pushing the state’s overall death toll to 4,859. The survival rate remained unchanged at 99%.A little more than 47,150 people had been vaccinated in Wisconsin as of Monday morning, according to the latest data from the health agency. The state has been allocated 265,575 doses of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. As of Monday morning, only about 157,000 doses had arrived.Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wrote a letter to President Donald Trump earlier in December asking him to prioritize more doses for Wisconsin due to high case numbers, swamped hospitals and a lack of statewide mitigation mandates.___Follow Todd Richmond on Twitter at https://twitter.com/trichmond||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wisconsin-hospital-worker-arrested-for-spoiled-vaccine-doses/story-Gn08XuPfGyX3zy0VoislsN.html
01-01-2021||World||Covid-19: No crowd allowed for New Year’s Eve celebrations at Times Square||New York City police turned to familiar tactics ahead of Thursday’s New Year’s Eve celebrations, deploying bomb-sniffing dogs and sand-filled sanitation trucks intended to guard against explosions.But the department’s playbook included an unusual mandate this year: preventing crowds of any size from gathering in Times Square.Citing concerns over the spread of COVID-19, police closed the Crossroads of the World to vehicles and pedestrians at midnight and dispersed onlookers venturing into a so-called “frozen zone” — the blocks surrounding the ball that historically draw shoulder-to-shoulder crowds.The result, in the waning hours of 2020, was a Times Square that felt eerily empty. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea described the scene as “surreal.”“It makes me a little bit sad,” said Cole Zieser, who recently moved to New York City. “It’s just not going to be what we wanted, what everyone dreams about in New York.”The coronavirus has upended public life for months, and New Year’s Eve will be no different. This year, police said, revelers headed to Times Square won’t be permitted past police lines.“If you think you’re going to be able to stand there and watch the ball, you’re mistaken,” Chief of Department Terence Monahan said, referring to the glittering, crystal ball that descends down a flagpole in Times Square each New Year’s Eve to mark the stroke of midnight.Still, Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed, “It’s going to be a joyous night, if ever there was one. Goodbye, 2020. Here comes something better: 2021.”“I cannot wait to get started” turning the page on a year when New York became an epicenter of the pandemic in spring, the Democratic mayor said. The city has counted over 25,000 deaths blamed on the virus.The NYPD announced a two-part freeze that will become more expansive at 3 p.m. Even guests at five hotels in the area have been told to stay inside.“It’s dead,” said Ali Jameel, who owns a store a block from Times Square. “We are dreaming for it to come back again like before.”Juanita Holmes, chief of patrol for the NYPD, urged would-be partygoers to ring in 2021 “from the comfort of your home.”“Coming to Times Square is a family tradition for some. It is a bucket list item for others. But this year is different,” she said. “I can’t emphasize enough how important it is for everyone to stay home.”The Police Department will still roll out heavy weapons teams, explosive-sniffing dogs, drones and sand trucks. But it has planned a drastically scaled-back presence in Times Square, including an 80% reduction in its typical workforce assigned to the area.“We always have to prepare for the worst in terms of counterterrorism overlays,” Shea said, “but the crowds will not be like they were in other years.”This year’s celebration will unfold without the usual throngs of cheering, kissing revelers. Indeed, the event’s special guests, first responders and essential workers, were expected to watch the festivities from a private, well-spaced area.“It’s almost like a ‘Seinfeld’ episode,” Shea said, invoking the 1990s “show about nothing.”“This is a ball drop about nothing, where you can’t see,” he said, “so you may as well stay home.”__Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Tom Hays contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-no-crowd-allowed-for-new-year-s-eve-celebrations-at-times-square/story-mtZjqnZyzdNsgzXtl5375J.html

01-01-2021||World||Shutdown, impeachment, virus: Chaotic US Congress winds down||US Congress is ending a chaotic session, a two-year political firestorm that started with the longest federal government shutdown in US history, was riven by impeachment and a pandemic, and now closes with a rare rebuff by Republicans of President Donald Trump.In the few days remaining, GOP senators are ignoring Trump’s demand to increase Covid-19 aid checks to $2,000 and are poised to override his veto of a major defense bill, asserting traditional Republican spending and security priorities in defiance of a president who has marched the party in a different direction.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a top Trump ally, tried to bridge the divide Thursday, saying Congress could try again to approve Trump’s push for bigger Covid aid checks in the new session, which opens Sunday.“I am with President Trump on this,” Graham said on Fox News.“Our economy is really hurting here,” he said. “There’s no way to get a vote by Jan. 3. The new Congress begins noon Jan. 3. So the new Congress, you could get a vote.’’As the Senate grinds through the New Year’s holiday, the one-two rebuke of Trump’s demands punctuates the president’s final days and deepen the divide between the Republican Party’s new wing of Trump-styled populists and what had been mainstay conservative views.The stalemate is expected to drag into the weekend.An exasperated Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said this week, “After all the insanity that Senate Republicans have tolerated from President Trump — his attacks on the rule of law, an independent judiciary, the conduct that led to his impeachment — is this where Senate Republicans are going to draw the line — $2,000 checks to the American people?”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown little interest in Trump’s push to bolster the $600 relief checks just approved in a sweeping year-end package, declaring Congress has provided enough pandemic aid, for now, as he blocked repeated Democratic attempts to force a vote.Opening the Senate on Thursday, McConnell called the House-passed bill matching Trump’s $2,000 request “socialism for rich people” who don’t need the federal help. He prefers a more targeted approach.The refusal to act on the checks, along with the veto Friday or Saturday of the defense bill, could very well be among McConnell’s final acts as majority leader as two GOP senators in Georgia are in the fights of their political lives in runoff elections next week that will determine which party controls the Senate.Trump made an early return Thursday to the White House from his private club in Florida.Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are separately poised to campaign in Georgia ahead of Tuesday’s election as GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.It’s a dizzying end to a session of Congress that resembles few others for the sheer number of crises and political standoffs as Trump’s presidency defined and changed the legislative branch.Congress opened in 2019 with the federal government shutdown over Trump’s demands for money to build the border wall with Mexico. Nancy Pelosi regained the speaker’s gavel after Democrats swept to the House majority in the midterm election.The Democratic-led House went on to impeach the president over his request to the Ukrainian president to “do us a favor” against Biden ahead of the presidential election. The Republican-led Senate acquitted the president in 2020 of the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.When the pandemic struck, Congress rallied with unusual speed and agreement to pass a $2 trillion relief package, the largest federal intervention of its kind in U.S. history.The COVID-19 crisis also shuttered the Capitol and altered the workings of Congress. The House changed its rules to allow proxy voting, a first, so lawmakers could avoid the health risks of travel to Washington. The Senate ultimately halted its traditional daily lunches.The usually bustling halls of Congress became eerily silent most days. Many members tested positive for the virus.The Congress had few other notable legislative accomplishes, and could not agree on how to respond to the racial injustice reckoning that erupted after the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement.Instead, the Senate was primarily focused on filling the courts with Trump’s conservative judicial nominees, including confirming his third Supreme Court justice, Amy Coney Barrett.As the session appeared to be winding down, Trump stunned Washington days before Christmas by delaying his signature on the latest $2 trillion-plus COVID relief and year-end funding package over his fresh demands for additional aid.Trump’s push for $2,000 checks gained sudden momentum when dozens of House Republicans joined Democrats in approving the measure Monday. But the effort fizzled in the GOP-led Senate.Democrats embraced Trump’s demand, a rare alliance with the Republican president, but his own party split between those few joining his push for more aid and others objecting to more spending they said was not targeted to those who need it most.Liberal senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who support the relief boost are blocking action on the defense bill until a vote is taken on Trump’s demand.McConnell offered an alternative aid bill, linking the $2,000 checks with Trump’s other priorities, including a complicated repeal of protections for tech companies like Facebook or Twitter and the establishment of a bipartisan commission to review the 2020 presidential election.But the GOP leader has scheduled no votes on his measure and it would be unlikely to have enough support in Congress to pass.For now, the smaller $600 checks are being sent to households. Americans earning up to $75,000 qualify for the payments, which are phased out at higher income levels, and there’s an additional $600 payment per dependent child.The outgoing president has been berating Republican leaders for the standoff, but he appears more focused on gathering GOP support for his extraordinary Electoral College challenge of Biden’s victory when the vote is tallied in a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6.Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri is among those leading Trump’s challenge to the Electoral College result, but he was rebuked Thursday by GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who warned colleagues off what he called a “dangerous ploy” that could damage trust in elections.The challenge is not expected to change the election outcome, with Biden set to be inaugurated Jan. 20. But it will be among the first votes tallied in the new Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shutdown-impeachment-virus-chaotic-us-congress-winds-down/story-wtGf7GawJI1khVM602ydBL.html
01-01-2021||World||Georgia county cannot stop 4,000 voters: Judge||A federal judge has ruled that local election officials in one Georgia county cannot stop more than 4,000 people from voting in the state’s high-stakes Senate runoffs just because they filed paperwork to change their address.US District Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner’s ruling on Wednesday came amid efforts by the Texas-based conservative group True The Vote to coordinate challenges to the registration of more than 364,000 voters statewide, based on change of address data obtained from the US Postal Service.Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler both face runoff elections Tuesday. Should both Republicans lose to Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Democrats would take control of the Senate.Georgia law allows any registered voter to challenge the eligibility of any other voter within the same county. Local election officials decide if there’s probable cause to accept the challenges.Gardner’s ruling affects only Muscogee County, which includes Columbus, where county election officials had determined there was probably cause to challenge roughly 4,000 voters. That means anyone on the challenged list attempting to vote would have been required to prove their eligibility - as would anyone challenged who mailed in an absentee ballot.Gardner ruled that challenged voters in the county must be given provisional ballots, but those ballots must be counted unless there’s evidence to show a voter is ineligible other than their appearance on the federal change of address registry.A temporary restraining order by the same judge earlier this week had also blocked election officials in rural Ben Hill County from keeping 150 similarly challenged voters from the polls. But that order was dissolved by Gardner’s ruling Wednesday, which imposed no restrictions on Ben Hill County.Election officials in several Georgia counties, including in Fulton and Cobb counties in metro Atlanta, have rejected similar challenges.Attorneys for the Muscogee and Ben Hill county election boards had asked Gardner to recuse herself in the case. The judge is the sister of Stacey Abrams, Georgia’s Democratic nominee for governor in 2018 and founder of the voting rights group Fair Fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-county-cannot-stop-4-000-voters-judge/story-kN5luQdhdpj9H36QhrmO2M.html
01-01-2021||World||Trump budget chief hampers Biden transition with ban on meetings||President Donald Trump’s budget office is blocking Joe Biden’s transition team from meeting with key staff to help prepare the president-elect’s first annual spending plan, a move that could delay major proposals.The director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, has argued internally that the agency needs to focus on finishing new regulations the Trump administration plans to publish before the president leaves office, according to people familiar with the matter.But experts on the federal budget say Vought’s refusal to give Biden’s team access to career OMB officials is unprecedented and could hurt Biden’s efforts to roll out big-picture, forward-looking ideas on everything from health care to climate change to taxes at the start of his four-year term.The career OMB staff could provide Biden’s team information such as cost estimates and details on existing programs.Vought said in a series of tweets and in a letter sent to former Senator Ted Kaufman, Biden’s transition leader, that claims his agency hasn’t been cooperative are false.“We have provided all information requested from OMB about ongoing programs,” he wrote in the letter, dated Thursday.“OMB has fully participated in appropriate transition efforts,” he wrote, including taking 45 meeting with Biden officials “to discuss specific issues, operational questions and more.”“What we have not done and will not do is use current OMB staff to write the BTT’s legislative policy proposals to dismantle this administration’s work,” he added, using an acronym for the Biden transition team. “OMB staff are working on this administration’s policies and will do so until this administration’s final day in office. Redirecting staff and resources to draft your team’s budget proposals is not an OMB transition responsibility.”Biden complained Monday that Trump administration officials at OMB and the Pentagon were hampering his transition, but he didn’t detail what they had done. The people familiar with Vought’s actions asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.“Right now we just aren’t getting all the information that we need from the outgoing administration in key national security areas,” Biden said after a meeting with his national security advisers and transition officials. “It’s nothing short, in my view, of irresponsibility.”No administration from either party has ever prevented its successor from meeting with OMB staff, said William Hoagland, a former top Republican Senate aide who worked on budget policy and appropriations for more than 25 years.“Not having access to OMB and preparing their budget will further delay any actions they want to pursue. There will be a serious delay in the incoming Biden administration’s ability to put forward their budget,” Hoagland said in an interview.The Biden camp has said that OMB’s alleged stonewalling has particularly set back the president-elect’s effort to plan his response to the pandemic.“OMB’s refusal to cooperate impairs our ability to identify opportunities to maximize the relief going out to Americans during the pandemic, and it leaves us in the dark as it relates to Covid expenditures and other gaps,” said Yohannes Abraham, executive director of the Biden transition team.But Vought wrote in his letter that “your team has been briefed by OMB, as well as the relevant agencies, on Operation Warp Speed and other Covid-relief efforts, including the various funding streams in use for these efforts.”Incoming presidential administrations typically begin their budget planning well before the new president is inaugurated on Jan. 20, in order to be able to send the document to Congress relatively soon thereafter. Congress decides how the government spends money, not the president, but the president’s budget is an annual statement of his priorities and is a vital source of information on the government’s activities.The annual document is due to Congress on the first Monday in February, but in recent years has often been delayed.Trump submitted his first budget to Congress about four months after he took office, on May 23, 2017. President Barack Obama submitted an initial budget proposal about one month after he took office, on February 26, 2009, and provided additional detail in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-budget-chief-hampers-biden-transition-with-ban-on-meetings/story-uyNdfZnRKOWXsM96Ef1bSP.html
01-01-2021||World||Trump extends pandemic-related visa ban through March 31||President Donald Trump on Thursday extended pandemic-related bans on issuing green cards and work visas to large groups of applicants outside the United States through March 31.Federal judges limited the impact but the bans, however short-lived, significantly tightened legal immigration, a goal that had eluded Trump before the coronavirus struck. They had been set to expire Thursday.An extension is consistent with Trump’s hardline stance on immigration and passes on the decision over when and whether to lift the bans to President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office Jan. 20. Biden’s immigration platform doesn’t specifically address the issue.In April, Trump imposed a ban on green cards issued abroad that largely targets family members of people already in the United States. After a surprisingly chilly reception from immigration hawks, the administration went much further in June by adding H-1B visas, which are widely used by American and Indian technology company workers and their families; H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers; J-1 visas for cultural exchanges; and L-1 visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations.Trump said the measures would protect American jobs in a pandemic-wracked economy, while business groups said they would hamper a recovery.By contrast, the administration’s edict to immediately expel asylum-seekers and others who cross the border illegally from Mexico was justified on grounds of containing the coronavirus, though reporting by The Associated Press and others found that government scientists saw no evidence for it. A temporary ban on non-essential travel across the Mexican and Canadian borders was also done for public health.In October, US District Judge Jeffrey White of San Francisco, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, ruled that the work-visa ban could not be enforced against groups that sued and their members, who represent much of the U.S. economy: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, technology industry group TechNet and Intrax Inc., which manages cultural exchange programs.In December, US District Judge Edward Chen of Oakland, California, an appointee of President Barack Obama, prevented the green-card ban from taking effect against families of 181 US citizens and legal residents who sued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-extends-pandemic-related-visa-ban-through-march-31/story-uKxpVaiuYSaVP8XJ3YebuJ.html

He was 80.Little had been serving three consecutive sentences of life without parole for the killing of three women in Los Angeles County during the late 1980s, murders to which he was linked through DNA that matched samples found at the crime scenes.He was convicted of first-degree murder by a Los Angeles County jury on Sept. 25, 2014, and began serving his prison sentence about two months later.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Little began confessing to additional murders to a Texas Ranger who interviewed him in his California prison cell in 2018, and ultimately admitted to killing 93 people across the country by strangulation between 1970 and 2005.The FBI said investigators have since verified 50 of those confessions, with many more pending final confirmation, making him the deadliest US serial killer on record.Authorities have said he appeared to have targeted mostly vulnerable young Black women, many of them prostitutes or drug addicts, whose deaths were not well-publicized at the time and in some cases not recorded as homicides.Many of his victims’ deaths were originally ruled overdoses or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes, and some bodies were never recovered, according to an only FBI profile of the killer.Little served two prior sentences in a California state prison, including a four-year term ending in 1987 for assault with a deadly weapon and false imprisonment, and stint of about 14 months ending in April 2014.FBI videotapes made of his jailhouse confessions showed Little, sitting in front of a cinder-block wall in blue prison scrubs and gray knit cap, sometimes appearing bemused or smiling as he recounted the circumstances of the killings.He had been incarcerated at a state prison in Lancaster, California, north of Los Angeles, but died early Wednesday morning at an outside hospital, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement.The agency said an official cause of death would be determined by the county medical examiner’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/samuel-little-us-serial-killer-who-confessed-to-93-murders-dies-in-california-hospital/story-w3pWv2sa7c13gQCETWCOuM.html

Details about the identity, background or race of the man who was shot were not immediately known.“Officers were conducting a traffic stop involving a felony suspect. Initial witness statements indicate that the subject involved in this felony stop fired first at Minneapolis police officers who then exchanged gunfire with the suspect”, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said in a press briefing late on Wednesday.“Subject of the stop was pronounced deceased at the scene by medical personnel. MPD (Minneapolis Police Department) officers were unharmed. An adult female who was a passenger in this subject vehicle was unharmed as well,” Arradondo said.He also said that the officers’ body cameras were turned on and added that the video would be released on Thursday.Protesters gathered outside of a gas station near the shooting, and authorities urged them to avoid any “destructive criminal behavior”.“I know there are several (people) who are out at the scene, who are gathering”, Arradondo said in the briefing.“We want to do everything we can to protect everyone’s First Amendment rights to freely assemble and demonstrate but I say again, we cannot allow destructive criminal behavior. Our city has gone through too much”, he added. Minneapolis saw widespread protests against police brutality and racism that gradually spread across the United States and the rest of the world following the May 25 death of Floyd, an African-American who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-shot-dead-in-gunfire-exchange-with-minneapolis-police/story-IP1TE65bCA5qasgQYyvAHK.html
01-01-2021||World||California becomes the third state in US to pass 25,000 coronavirus deaths||Health officials say California has surpassed 25,000 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic.The grim milestone recorded on Friday comes as the nation’s most populated state faces a surge of COVID-19 infections that has hospitals stretched to capacity and forced nurses and doctors to treat more patients than usual.The state Department of Public Health says hospitals in Southern California and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, which together account for a large majority of the state’s 40 million residents, have no capacity left in intensive care units to treat Covid-19 patients.Hospitals are housing patients in hallways, conference rooms, a cafeteria and gift shops. Makeshift hospitals are being set up in tents, arenas and schools.California was the third state to reach 25,000 deaths, behind New York, which has nearly 38,000 deaths, and Texas, which has more than 27,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.California’s reported its first case of Covid-19 in late January. It recorded it’s 10,000th death from the virus in August.Most of the state is under newly extended restrictions that have closed or reduced capacity of businesses, and people are being urged to stay home as much as possible to try to slow the spread of infections.A mutant variant of the coronavirus that appears to be more contagious has been found in Southern California, where the state’s most populous county recorded more than 10,000 deaths and authorities warned they will be patrolling streets to shut down large New Year’s Eve gatherings that could spread the infection.Los Angeles County reached a “terrible milestone” with 274 additional deaths in 24 hours for a record toll of 10,056 deaths, Los Angeles County Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer announced on Wednesday.The Covid-19 daily death toll over 14 days has averaged about 150 people, or “about equal to the number of deaths from all other causes, which is about 170,” said Ferrer. “Most heartbreaking is that if we had done a better job reducing transmission of the virus, many of these deaths would not have happened.” The county, which has had about 40 per cent of the state’s virus deaths, is one of nearly two dozen in Southern California and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley area where hospital intensive care units have technically run out of room, although ICU patients are being placed in other hospital areas under “surge” procedures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-becomes-the-third-state-in-us-to-pass-25-000-coronavirus-deaths/story-MZ7YGkGy0otcTc0CUDO9DI.html
01-01-2021||World||Thornburgh, ex-governor and US attorney general, dies||Dick Thornburgh, who as Pennsylvania governor won plaudits for his cool handling of the 1979 Three Mile Island crisis and as US attorney general restored credibility to a Justice Department hurt by the Iran-Contra scandal, has died. He was 88.Thornburgh died Thursday morning at a retirement community facility outside Pittsburgh, his son David said. The cause is not yet known. He suffered a mild stroke in June 2014.Thornburgh built his reputation as a crime-busting federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh and as a moderate Republican governor. As the nation’s top law enforcement official, he prosecuted the savings and loan scandal. He also shepherded the Americans with Disabilities Act; one of his sons had been severely brain damaged in an auto accident.After leaving public office, Thornburgh became a go-to troubleshooter who helped CBS investigate its news practices, dissected illegalities at telecommunications company WorldCom and tried to improve the United Nations’ efficiency.“I’ve always had an opportunity to right a vessel that was somewhat listing and taking on water,” he told The Associated Press in 1999. “I wouldn’t object to being characterized as a ‘Mr. Fix It.’ I’ve liked the day-in, day-out challenges of governance.”President Ronald Reagan appointed Thornburgh attorney general in the waning months of his administration. Thornburgh succeeded the embattled Edwin Meese III, who was investigated by a special prosecutor for possible ethics violations, and his appointment in August 1988 was hailed on Capitol Hill as an opportunity to restore the agency’s morale and image.He was asked to stay on as attorney general when George H.W. Bush became president in 1989.Thornburgh ran into trouble with the press and members of Congress who were put off by his imperious manner. He also battled liberals and conservatives in Congress over Justice Department appointments.Despite the difficulties, Thornburgh enjoyed the continued backing of President Bush and won unprecedented increases from Congress in the Justice Department’s budget to fight crime.The prosecution of savings and loan operators and borrowers increased during his tenure as the nation faced a growing crisis in the thrift industry. He set up securities fraud and S&L task forces in several major cities.Also under Thornburgh, the Justice Department pursued the prosecution of deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who was brought to Miami to face drug trafficking charges after a U.S. invasion.Thornburgh tried to halt unauthorized leaks of information about criminal investigations, but he ran into trouble in the spring of 1989 when CBS News aired a story that the FBI was investigating the congressional office of Rep. William Gray, D-Pa. The story produced expressions of outrage among Democrats because it was aired when Gray was seeking to be elected House majority whip.An internal investigation later showed that Thornburgh’s own chief spokesman played a role in confirming the story.As Pennsylvania governor from 1979 to 1987, Thornburgh won a reputation as a squeaky-clean, reform-minded executive who cut the state government’s payroll, but his defining moment came barely two months into office.In March 1979, he was confronted with the worst nuclear accident in American history when a routine equipment failure at the Three Mile Island power plant turned into a partial meltdown, which released radioactive elements.Thornburgh agonized over whether to order an evacuation of the area around the plant. He recalled years later that “some people were telling us more than they knew and others were telling us less than they knew.”He eventually ordered pregnant women and young children to leave an area five miles around the plant, which caused thousands of others near Harrisburg to flee.His cool handling of the 10-day crisis was credited with averting panic.He was praised in later years for recognizing that Pennsylvania’s manufacturing industry was fading and pumping state money into economic development for new businesses.Thornburgh’s career in government services stretched back to the 1960s. He was U.S. attorney in western Pennsylvania from 1969 to 1975, prosecuting drug traffickers, organized crime figures and corrupt politicians.From 1975 to 1977, he was assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s criminal division, where he stepped up federal prosecutions of public corruption in the post-Watergate era.He showed his sense of humor at events during his first gubernatorial campaign in 1978, mocking the state Legislature’s generous compensation to the tune of “My Favorite Things.” “Nice big fat paychecks and liberal pensions / Fringes and perks that we won’t even mention ...” As attorney general, he referred to white-collar crime as “crime in the suites,” as opposed to streets.When Thornburgh left the U.S. attorney general post in 1991, he made a run for U.S. Senate, losing to Harris Wofford in the general election.The election landed Thornburgh in a courtroom in Texas, where Karl Rove, one of George W. Bush’s closest advisers, sued him to try to get back nearly $300,000 in back campaign debts. Thornburgh lost in court, appealed and eventually settled the case.In 1992, Thornburgh accepted a top administrative job at the United Nations to fight bureaucratic excess and corruption. He left the job after his one-year contract ended, expressing frustration at inefficiency and saying the U.N. is “almost totally lacking in effective means to deal with waste, fraud and abuse by staff members.”In recent years, Thornburgh was tapped to investigate wrongdoing in the corporate world.In 2002, the Justice Department tapped Thornburgh to help investigate WorldCom for mismanagement, irregularities and fraud. He described the company, which made the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, as “the poster child of corporate governance failures.”Thornburgh was co-leader of an investigation conducted by CBS when its “60 Minutes Wednesday” program used faked documents to bolster a 2004 story that questioned George W. Bush’s Vietnam War-era military service. The probe’s damning final report led to the firing of three news executives.Richard Lewis Thornburgh was born July 16, 1932, and grew up in Rosslyn Farms, near Pittsburgh. He trained as an engineer at Yale, seeking to follow his civil-engineer father’s footsteps, but went to law school at the University of Pittsburgh.Upon graduation, he went to work as a corporate lawyer, later joining the law firm of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart.Thornburgh married his childhood sweetheart, Virginia “Ginny” Hooton, in 1955. She was killed in an automobile crash in 1960 that left one of their three sons, Peter, severely brain damaged.Three years later, Thornburgh married Ginny Judson, who raised his three sons and bore another, William. (He wrote in his memoir that “Ginny and my first wife shared not only a name but many characteristics that would no doubt have made them fast friends.”)He said the accident was a defining moment that forced him to refocus his life on what his mission and legacy would be.Both he and his second wife became active in programs for the disabled. In 1985, the Thornburghs were named “Family of the Year” by the Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Citizens.Five years later, the Americans With Disabilities Act was signed into law after Thornburgh played a key role in negotiating compromises with Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thornburgh-ex-governor-and-us-attorney-general-dies/story-GAQEevaELaKxWyVU3b6pGO.html
01-01-2021||World||US blocks USD 63 million in funds of global terrorist groups in 2019: Report||The US blocked USD 63 million in funds of designated terrorist groups, including Pakistan-based outfits, in 2019 as part of its crackdown on foreign terrorist organisations, according to an annual report by the treasury department.The report released by the US Department of Treasury on Thursday states the US blocked USD 342,000 in funds of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), USD 1,725 of the Jaish-e Mohammed (JeM) and USD 45,798 of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen-al-Islami. All the three groups are Pakistan-based terror outfits. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen-al-Islami is a Islamic jihad group operating primarily in Kashmir. Another Pakistan-based Kashmir centric terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen has USD 4,321 blocked by the US in 2019 as against USD 2,287 the previous year, the report said. For the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, the US blocked USD 5,067 in 2019 as against a paltry USD 318 in 2018. The Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is the leading US Government agency responsible for implementing sanctions against the assets of international terrorist organisations and terrorism-supporting countries. The federal body implements these sanctions as part of its general mission to administer and enforce economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals. According to the report, in 2019 the US blocked USD 63 million in funds of nearly 70 designated terrorist organisations, with the highest being USD 3.9 million of the al-Qaeda group. While the total blocked funds in 2018 was USD 46 million, that of the al-Qaeda was USD 6.4 million that year. The list includes the Haqqani network (USD 26,546). It is a significant increase from USD 3,626 in 2018. The US continues to block USD 580,811 in funds of the Sri Lanka-based Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has remained the same for two years -- 2018 and 2019. The report indicated a significant drop in Taliban funds being blocked by the US from USD 296,805 in 2018 to USD 59,065 in 2019. According to the report, the combination of sanctions programmes targeting international terrorists and terrorist organisations with those targeting terrorism-supporting governments constitute a wide-ranging assault on international terrorism and its supporters and financiers. The US also blocked USD 200.19 million in funds of countries designated as sponsors of terrorism -- Iran, Sudan, Syria and North Korea.

Restaurants, museums, cinemas, theaters, gyms, and amusement parks remain shut.Two nationwide lockdowns earlier this year severely dented the economy, with the government predicting an 11% contraction in 2020, and a 6% rebound in 2021.Slow StartWhile daily infections remain significantly above its target, the French government chose a slower start to its vaccination campaign than neighboring countries such as the U.K. and Germany, prioritizing the elderly in nursing homes.Macron said he won’t let anyone play around with the safety and proper conditions in which vaccinations are carried out.“Nor will I allow the process to slow down without justification for bad reasons: every French person who wants to must be able to be vaccinated,” he added.Facing criticism for the slow start, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said earlier on Thursday that France will accelerate vaccinations for people most in need.From Monday, medical staff 50 years old or more will be able to be vaccinated in hospitals and centers that are progressively receiving vaccines. Before Feb. 1, elderly people will be able to get shots in towns in vaccination centers, he said.“Hope is there in this vaccine that human ingenuity has brought about in just one year,” Macron said, adding that it will enable France to invent a stronger economy as soon as the spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-sees-tough-months-ahead-before-spring-recovery/story-8L8qSy5c8mMXi8TawoodGN.html

Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officers, described the situation as “grim, depressing and perilous”.The Big Ben will come alive at midnight to herald the New Year, but there will be none of the iconic fireworks around it that would normally be watched by tens of thousands along the Thames and telecast live to millions across the globe.‘Covid loves a crowd, cancel parties’ was the key message on a public information campaign on Thursday, urging Britons to usher in the New Year at home. Millions more Britons moved to the top Tier 4 Covid-19 alert system with the toughest restrictions on Wednesday night.Johnson said, “(As) as the sun rises tomorrow on 2021 we have the certainty of those vaccines. Pioneered in a UK that is also free to do things differently, and if necessary better, than our friends in the EU. Free to do trade deals around the world.“This is an amazing moment for this country.

01-01-2021||World||Deal approved, post-Brexit era begins for UK and EU||Britain was all geared up to enter a new era at 11pm local time on Thursday, emerging out of the European Union to embark on a new, uncertain post-Brexit journey. “Covid loves a crowd, cancel parties” was the key message on a public information campaign on Thursday, the last day of 2020, urging Britons to usher in the New Year at home. For the first time since the April peak, the UK on Wednesday recorded nearly 1,000 Covid-19 deaths in a day and over 50,000 new cases.The post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU struck last week received Britain’s royal nod and became law amid continuing debate about whether leaving the bloc is better for Britain’s prosperity. Several aspects of life are likely to change as new post-Brexit realities unfold. This will include higher prices in supermarkets and changes to Britons visiting EU member states. There will be a 90-day limit to their stay in any 180-day period, using queues for non-EU citizens at airports, and being asked by immigration officials to show return tickets and adequate funds for their stay.The shadow of the pandemic still looms as millions of more Britons moved to the top Tier 4 Covid-19 alert system with the toughest curbs on Wednesday. Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, described the situation as “grim, depressing and perilous”.UK PM Boris Johnson said, “We’ve got two big things happening at once in our fight against Covid. One is working for us; and one working against us. On the plus side, we have two valid vaccines and we are racing, as I say, to get them out.“On the downside, there is a new strain of the virus which is spreading much faster and surging across the country. And we have seen a 40% increase in cases in England in the last week alone, almost 15% more patients in hospital - more than at the peak of the first wave.”The UK PM’s father Stanley Johnson, meanwhile, confirmed plans on Thursday to seek French citizenship as the free movement of Britons in the EU comes to an end under the Brexit pact delivered by his son.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deal-approved-post-brexit-era-begins-for-uk-and-eu/story-KL23Bs1mHGRKjsA5D9ZZxH.html
01-01-2021||India||PMC Bank: ED attaches Rs 72-cr assets of man whose wife transferred funds to Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s spouse||The ED on Friday said it has attached assets worth Rs 72 crore of a Maharashtra-based man whose wife’s alleged transaction with Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s spouse is under its scanner in the over Rs 4,300 crore PMC Bank money laundering case.The central probe agency alleged that the man, Pravin Raut, had “siphoned off” Rs 95 crore worth of funds from the scam-hit bank in the garb of loan, out of which he paid Rs 1.6 crore to his wife, Madhuri Raut, who subsequently transferred Rs 55 lakh in two tranches to Varsha Raut, wife of Sanjay Raut, as an “interest-free loan.” The ED recently summoned Varsha Raut for questioning with regard to this transaction and a few other deals leading to a political blame game between Maharashtra and the Centre with various constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) led state government alleging that the Centre was using federal probe agencies to harass them.Varsha Raut skipped the agency’s notice thrice and is now expected to join probe before the ED in Mumbai on January 5.Sanjay Raut, while holding a press conference in Mumbai early this week, had denied any wrongdoing on the part of his wife and said they were in correspondence with the ED in connection with the case for about one-and-a-half months.Raut, 59, is a Rajya Sabha MP and also a spokesperson of the Shiv Sena, which is in power in Maharashtra and is a former ally of the BJP.He said details regarding the Rs 55 lakh loan transaction have already been submitted to the ED during the correspondence.The ED said it has provisionally attached Rs 72 crore worth of assets of Pravin Raut under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as it explained in a statement the alleged financial links between him his wife and that of Sanjay Raut’s spouse.“Probe revealed that Rs 95 crore has been siphoned off through HDIL by one of the accused Pravin Raut in active conspiracy and connivance with various persons.“The source of the funds were illegal availed loans/advances by HDIL from PMC Bank. There was no document or agreement in support of these payments made to Pravin Raut,” the ED alleged in a statement.It said “as per the ledger of HDIL, the funds were given to Pravin Raut for acquiring land in Palghar area.” The probe found, it said, that Pravin Raut “paid an amount of Rs 1.6 crore to his wife Madhuri Pravin Raut from the proceeds of crime. Out of the said money, Madhuri Raut transferred Rs 55 lakh (Rs 50L on December 23, 2010 and Rs 5L on March 15, 2011) as interest-free loan to Varsha Raut who is the wife of Sanjay Raut”.“The amount was further utilised for purchase of flat in Dadar East, Mumbai,” the ED claimed.The probe found that Varsha Sanjay Raut and Madhuri Pravin Raut “are partners in Avani Construction and Varsha Raut has received Rs 12 lakh from this entity (as overdrawn capital converted to loan) on a contribution of mere Rs 5,625.” “The loan amount of Rs 12 lakh still remains outstanding,” it said.The ED had filed a criminal case of money laundering to probe the alleged loan fraud in the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank in October last year against Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), its promoters Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, his son Sarang Wadhawan, its former chairman Waryam Singh and ex-managing director Joy Thomas.It took cognisance of a Mumbai Police economic offences wing FIR against them that charged them for causing “wrongful loss, prima facie to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore to PMC Bank, and corresponding gains to themselves”.The ED has attached assets of Rakesh Kumar Wadhawan, Wadhawan family trust and others worth Rs 293 crore and had seized jewellery worth Rs 63 crore.A chargesheet had also been filed by it in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmc-bank-ed-attaches-rs-72-cr-assets-of-man-whose-wife-transferred-funds-to-shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut-s-spouse/story-sEWnSc1NvZ1pFGUjwEvHeI.html

But before entering the forest it damaged the earth remover and other equipment which played vital role in saving it,” a senior forest official said.The jumbo which fell into the well in the morning was finally rescued around 9 pm.A rescue team comprising forest, revenue and police officials used an earthmover to break the well and dig a small pathway to make way for the trapped animal.Forest officials had earlier suspected that elephant might have been hurt after it fell into the 50-foot well. Earlier in the day, they had said that the elephant might have to be tranquilised and shifted to a camp in case of injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rescuers-in-kerala-save-elephant-from-well-after-12-hour-struggle/story-iuWddjwt3d6v4qBvQOvF0M.html

DGCA will issue the details shortly,” Puri said on Twitter.The restrictions on flights between the two countries may be extended further till January 31, according to officials aware of the development. “Passengers arriving in these flights from January 8 onward will be asked to take mandatory RT PCR tests on arrival and those found negative will be made to sign undertakings for mandatory home quarantine for a week. We are reviewing the status, our assumption is the restrictions on flights to UK may be extended further till the end of the month,” a senior official said requesting anonymity.On December 21, India had joined a growing list of countries on Monday to seal off access to people who have been to the UK, suspending all flights to and from the country between December 23 and December 31 then later extending the ban till January 7 in order to stop the arrival of a new strain of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 that is feared to spread faster.India’s air bubble agreement with UK covered at least 70 flights per week, according to the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The airlines flying these routes were Air India, British Airways, Vistara and Virgin Atlantic.India has been operating international flights through bilateral transport bubbles with 24 countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA) since calling off scheduled overseas flight operations when it announced the lockdown in March.Speaking at a press conference last Tuesday Puri had said: “I foresee a slight extension of the temporary suspension. I don’t expect that extension to be a long or indefinite extension. In the next day or two, we will find out if any additional steps need to be taken, or when we can start easing the current temporary suspension.”He added that from November 25 the government had begun contact tracing of passengers who had arrived directly or indirectly from the UK.So far, 29 cases of people in India have tested positive for the new and highly infectious strain of coronavirus including four cases that were detected on Friday.Genomic sequencing repository Nextstrain showed the variant found in UK was also circulating in Denmark, and similar mutations – although in a different strain – were seen in some samples from South Africa. Civil Aviation minister in December had also said Centre may decide to impose similar restrictions on other countries if a high number of cases with the Sars-Cov-2 mutation are found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-lift-uk-flight-ban-on-jan-8-allow-partial-flight-operations/story-qs9uJiOBnxtwIbii3jegZN.html

Early this morning, Mufti had written a letter to Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and urged him to initiate an impartial probe into the encounter. In her letter, she said that such incidents bring disrepute to the armed forces and were a grave violation of human rights. In a statement issued here, Gupta said that Mehbooba Mufti should be the last person to talk about violation of human rights. “A terrorist is a terrorist and he should be dealt strictly as per the law. Mehbooba Mufti should not comment on human rights violation. What about the human rights of armed forces and innocent civilians who are martyred in terrorist attack which take place every other day?” asked Gupta. Criticising Mufti, Gupta said that the PDP leader has always taken a pro-terrorists and pro-separatists stand. “If you notice, she has always been vocal for her agenda, which is not in the interest of nation, and its people. PDP as a political party has lost its relevance in Jammu and Kashmir’s political scenario. Many of its leaders are already in the custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA) in hawala cases,” said the former deputy CM. He further said that Article 370 has caused “criminal injustice” to the people in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. Moreover, he asserted that BJP shall not allow the Abdullah father-son duo and Mehbooba Mufti to carry forward their alleged “anti-national” agenda in the Union Territory. He said the people in Jammu and Kashmir want peace and development and communal harmony. “Over the past 70 years, Article 370 has done great injustice with Pakistani refugees, Gujjar and Bakerwal communities, Valmiki and Gorkha communities, women and nationalists and also gave birth to terrorism and separatism in this peaceful land,” Gupta said. He alleged that the Abdullahs and Mufti are conspiring to “bleed Kashmir’ once again but nobody will be allowed to cause harm to the law and order situation in the valley. “They will face serious consequences. They are using the Gupkar Agenda to save their skin and we will not allow them to succeed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-is-pro-separatist-shouldn-t-talk-about-rights-abuse-bjp-leader/story-u8m9C7CmzU3bJGL0QBDexN.html
01-01-2021||India||RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat says patriotism intrinsic in Hindus, cites examples from Gandhi’s life||If someone is a Hindu he will be patriotic and that will be his basic character and nature, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Friday while citing Mahatma Gandhi’s remarks that his patriotism originates from his dharma. Bhagwat was speaking at an event to release the book titled ‘Making of a Hindu Patriot: Background of Gandhiji’s Hind Swaraj’, authored by JK Bajaj and MD Srinivas. Releasing the book, Bhagwat said there is no need for speculation that Sangh “is trying to appropriate Gandhiji, that is not the case, no one can appropriate great personalities like him.” Describing the book as an authentic scholarly research document on Gandhi, Bhagwat said Gandhi had suggested that for him his dharma and patriotism are not different as love for his motherland originates from his spirituality.“Gandhiji had said that his patriotism originates from his dharma,” Bhagwat said asserting that dharma does not merely mean religion, it is wider than religion.“If someone is Hindu he has to be patriotic, that will be his or her basic character and nature. At times you may have to awaken his or her patriotism but he (Hindu) can never be anti-India. But we have to be conscious of the fact that if one loves his country it doesn’t mean land only, it means its people, rivers, culture, traditions and everything,” he said. He underlined that Hinduism believes in the existence of unity. “Difference does not mean separatism and Gandhiji has suggested that Hinduism is the religion of all religions,” he said. Talking about Gandhi’s concept of ‘swaraj’, Bhagwat said by it he means not only changing rulers or becoming self-governing, for Gandhi the struggle for ‘swaraj’ was the reconstruction of society based on civilisational values. Meanwhile, in the book, the authors have quoted Gandhi as having written to Leo Tolstoy that, “… my patriotism is patent enough, my love for India is ever growing but it is derived from my religion and is therefore in no sense exclusive.” Giving an overview of the book, Bajaj said it tracked Gandhi’s life from Porbandar to his visit to England and then to South Africa. Bajaj said there was a time between 1893-94 when Gandhi was pressured by his Muslim employer and his Christian employees to explore converting to their respective religions but he refused. By 1905, he became a devout Hindu and also gave lectures on Hinduism, Bajaj said. He cited instances that while practising law in South Africa, Gandhi quoted Bhagwad Gita and Mahabhrata in his petitions before the courts.

01-01-2021||India||Farmer dies by suicide in Madhya Pradesh, leaves note addressed to PM Modi||A farmer allegedly died by suicide at a village in Chhatarpur district in Madhya Pradesh’s Bundelkhand region, said police. A five-page note addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi was recovered on his person, saying his body should be handed over to the government so that his organs could be sold to realise the hefty electricity bill of about Rs 88,000, said police. The farmer, who died on Wednesday, owned a small flour mill. He is survived by his three daughters and a son.His family members have alleged that the power company had seized his flour mill and also his motorbike.The victim’s brother, who is employed in the power distribution company, said, “My brother ended his life due to harassment by the power distribution company. My brother was highly upset and under stress since his flour mill and the motorbike were seized by the power distribution company.” He said, “My brother was not able to pay the electricity bills as there was no good crop this year. Earlier, there was an average bill of about Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per month but suddenly a bill of about Rs 88,000 was given to him. Without giving any time to pay the bill, the power distribution company officials in Chhatarpur district sent a legal notice to my brother and seized his flour mill and motorbike. A team took away the bike causing harassment and stress to my brother. He wanted some time to pay the bill but the officials refused to listen to his pleas.” The brother demanded strict action against those “responsible” for the death. The note reads, “When there are scams by big politicians and businessmen the government employees don’t take any action. If they take a loan they get enough time to repay it or the loan is waived. But, if a poor person takes even a small amount of loan, the government would never ask him as to why he was not able to repay the loan. Instead, he is insulted in public.” Matguva police station in charge Kamaljeet Singh said, “We have got a note. The deceased’s father and brothers tried to convince him not to get stressed about the power bill. However, when his wife returned from her parents’ house there was an argument between her and the victim over the unpaid bill. Later, he took the drastic step. However, an investigation is going on in the matter.” Congress MLA and ex-minister Harsh Yadav said, “Farmers and others are at the receiving end of the power distribution companies. Either teams of the power distribution company or its recovery agents are harassing the farmers and others like anything. They seize and take away tractors, trolleys, bikes, etc whatever they get from the houses of the farmers in the name of recovery of power bills. That too when kharif crops were not good because of bad weather this year.” Despite efforts, the chief engineer and the superintending engineer concerned of the power distribution company couldn’t be reached for their comments. Collector, Chhatarpur, Sheelendra Singh, said, “The deceased’s father gets pension and he gets the benefit of PM Kisan Kalyan Yojna too. His brother works in the power distribution company. The administration immediately gave ex-gratia of Rs 25,000 to the deceased’s family. An inquiry would be conducted in connection with the incident and action would be taken if anyone is found responsible for the suicide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-dies-by-suicide-in-madhya-pradesh-leaves-note-addressed-to-pm-modi/story-QAqiT88wKIs6n1QnbMBxRK.html

The victim’s husband tried to rescue her, but in vain as the central locking of the car failed. The couple, in their late twenties, was returning to Lucknow after visitng temples at Mathura and Vrindavan, police said. “The matter is being investigated. The husband, Vikas Yadav, from Mohanlalganj in Lucknow said that he was married to Reema from Krishna Nagar in Lucknow on December 2.

The couple began the journey back to Lucknow on Thursday night and had moved 30 km on the expressway from Agra when they saw smoke emanating from the car’s engine. At around 2.30 am, Vikas stopped the car and opened the bonnet and the fire that had started in the engine quickly spread to the cabin. Reema, who was still inside the cabin, was trapped after the central locking system jammed. Vikas also suffered burn injuries while fighting the fire. He also called the police who reached the spot. The fire brigade was called, but it was too late and Reema was charred to death, police said.

When I started this film ‘Omprakash Zindabaad’ that was extensively shot around Lucknow suburbs, my faith in the subject brought in actors like late Om Puri and Jagdeep sir on board. But, due to some reason or the other, it got stuck and then we were in the lockdown delaying the release further. But, all well that ends well,” said director of bilingual film ‘Michel Adhikari.’ Ranjeet assisted known director, Imtiyaz Ali on various projects. “When I was in my 20s, after completing my film making course from Nepal, I started assisting him then Anurag Basu on various projects including a number of TV shows. Later, independent TV direction gave me a firm foot the industry — ‘Manmohini,’ ‘Phulwa’, ‘Beintehaa,’ ‘Sadda Haq’ and many more along with web series ‘Hero Vardiwala’ and ‘Dixit Family.’ Talking about his love for UP locales, Ranjeet said, “I love shooting in UP especially around Lucknow as there are many untold stories and explored characters left to be exposed to the cinema lovers. ‘Omprakash…’ gave me an opportunity to work with legendry actors and shoot in and around Lucknow my favourite city.”Currently, Ranjeet is shooting for the film ‘Mamma Mia’ and an untitled web series to be released 2021. “My hopes are high with the New Year and I can’t wait to tell interesting stories to my audience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/my-hopes-are-high-with-the-new-year/story-IFM75YQ7ypjmMvY9BsxOKM.html

01-01-2021||India||‘Let’s hope flower of positivity blooms this year!’||It was a working first day of 2021 for actor Paras Madaan in Lucknow. Currently, shooting for the OTT series ‘Hastinapur’ he pins lot of hope for his year. “Last year we sowed the seed of positivity for a new start and now we pray and hope that its flower blooms this year. Initially, it was fight for survival as I too was tested positive for corona virus. Thankfully, I survived, both on health front and financially but it was tough phase for all of us,” said ‘Divya Drishti’, ‘Qubool Hai’ and ‘Kis Desh Hai Mera Dil,’ actor. The Delhite is braving ‘Lucknow ki sardi’. “It has been 13 years I left my home town, so I’m habitual to Mumbai conditions. Now, it has been nearly two weeks and I am enjoying it. During, ‘Beyhad-2’ promotions I came here for the first time and had a good look around the city. This time it’s just shoot and shoot!” This is his first professional work in the unlock phase. “As the name suggests its modern-day political drama inspired by Hastinapur of Mahabharat era. Directed by Soumyajit Ganguli, the story is about four friends (Ravi Bhatia, Rohit KP and Manoj) who run a gang and I lead that gang.” On his web debut he says, “As an artiste you get lot of freedom and space to etch your character which is not the case in TV. Besides, OTT has removed the barrier of hero and heroine. Here, every character plays the lead and has scope to carve a niche for themselves.” However, he is looking forward to balance both. He accepts that TV as a medium has its limitation where creativity is compromised at time but he enjoys that as well. The actor started with modelling and theatre in Delhi before shifting to Mumbai. “I also wanted to be in the medium where I can express my creativity. It has been a roller-coaster ride but those tough phases that taught me a lot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/let-s-hope-flower-of-positivity-blooms-this-year/story-A7PypJbdcJzCIFxKhEUmOK.html
01-01-2021||India||‘Not an astrologer’: Tomar on January 4 meeting, farmers to intensify protest if demands not met||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said while he hopes for a positive meeting with the leaders of the protesting farmers’ unions, he can’t say whether the seventh round of talks between the Centre and the farmers will be final. “I cannot say for sure now. I am not an astrologer. I am hopeful that whatever decision would be arrived at (in the meeting) will be in the interest of the country and of the farmers,” the minister told news agency PTI.After five failed attempts to break the ice between the Centre and farmers over the recently passed farm laws, the sixth meeting held on December 30 yielded some positive results as the Centre conceded to farmers’ demands regarding electricity and stubble burning. Farmers have demanded a legal guarantee of the minimum support price system, which the Centre has not agreed to. More discussion will take place on January 4 though there are slim chances that the situation will be solved as farmers are pursuing their demand of repealing the laws which the Centre is unlike to do. The farmers, meanwhile, have decided to intensify their agitation if their demands are not met on January 4. Saying that only five per cent of their demands have so far been discussed, farmer leaders on Friday said they will announce dates for shutting all malls and petrol pumps in Haryana. Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border will also move towards the national capital, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said. Another leader Yudhveer Singh said that a tractor march will be held on January 6 if no concrete decision is taken in the next round of talks.Meanwhile, more than 850 faculty members of various educational institutions, including Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University, JNU, have written an open letter in which they have supported the farm laws, PTI reported. “The Union government has repeatedly assured the farmers that these three bills on farm trade wouldn’t do away with Minimum Support Price (MSP), but rather free the farm trade from all illicit market restrictions, open the market beyond ‘mandis’ and further assists the small and marginal farmers to sell their produce at market/competitive prices,” the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-say-if-january-4-meeting-with-farmers-will-be-final-says-narendra-singh-tomar/story-6e2Qjp1hibjSL9hqLkLqkM.html

On Friday, the minister announced on Twitter that a limited number of flights from four airports would resume.“Operations till 23 Jan will be restricted to 15 flights per week each for carriers of the two countries to & from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru & Hyderabad only,” the minister said.The minister further added that these flights will only operate from New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad only. He said, “It has been decided that flights between India & UK will resume from 8 Jan 2021. Operations till 23 Jan will be restricted to 15 flights per week each for carriers of the two countries to & from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru & Hyderabad only. @DGCAIndia will issue the details shortly.”Flights to and from the United Kingdom were suspended initially on December 21 over fears of a new mutated strain of the coronavirus which is believed to be more infectious was first discovered in the United Kingdom. The initial suspension of flights was till December 31 but on Wednesday the Directorate General of Civil Aviation modified its order to extend the ban till suspension on international flights till January 31. The DGCA also said that international flights to and from the United Kingdom will remain suspended till January 7.The flights were suspended based on recommendation by the union health ministry. The government has launched efforts to track down thousands of people who have entered India from UK in the past few weeks. A total of 29 people have been detected with the new UK variant of Covid-19. The new mutated variant is believed to have the potential to affect younger people which forced several nations across the world to suspend its flight operations. Norway also lifted its flight suspension order with the United Kingdom on Friday. The United Kingdom government on December 30 placed thousands of its citizens under strict lockdown like measures to stop the spread of the mutated variant of Covid-19. The government has strictly warned against travelling during the New Year’s and requested citizens to stay at home.Health secretary John Hancock said, “With our NHS under pressure we must all take personal responsibility this New Year’s Eve and stay at home.

The exercises have been scheduled between 19 and 25 January in the skies over the deserts of Rajasthan, people familiar with the matter said.The French air force’s Rafales will be accompanied by the Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft (MRTT) for aerial refuelling support. The four fighters will also participate in joint exercises with the Australian Air Force before reaching India.The wargames, named Exercise Skyros, will take place over the air force firing range in Rajasthan’s Pokhran that had seen Indian Air Force fighters participate in Exercise Vayu Shakti. The 2019 exercise was designed to let the pilots practise and showcase the IAF’s ability to strike targets including radars and enemy convoys on the ground.The joint exercises are expected to focus on interoperability, low flying over the desert and manoeuvrability of the omni role fighters. The exercises involving the Rafales - which would be India’s frontline fighter in case of conflict in East Ladakh or elsewhere - are being held weeks after Chinese and Pakistani air force carried out joint exercises near India’s western border.Also Read: Rafale’s deep-strike cruise missile gets an upgrade for targets in mountainsExercise Skyros will be the first joint exercise involving the Indian Air Force’s Rafale fighter jets and is cited as another example of the deepening military ties between the two countries, a senior Indian military officer said.The Indian Air Force has inducted 11 of the 36 Rafale jets ordered by New Delhi at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore. Seven more fighters have been handed over to India by Dassault but these are being used for training IAF pilots in France. The third batch of three fighter jets is scheduled to land on January 27.A top Indian Air Force officer said there was a possibility that the three Rafale jets could, logistics permitting, fly together with the French Air Force’s four fighters and the Airbus A300 MRTT.India is also considering a French proposal to acquire six Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker aircraft on a government-to-government basis for expanding the strike capability of the Indian Air Force (IAF). The mid-air refuelers can be turned into purely a tanker or transport or air ambulance or all three at the same time with a total crew of three. Else, it can transport 260 personnel in the cabin and fuel in the cargo hold.The refuelers are crucial to expand the operational envelope of the fighter jets of the air force and the navy by extending range, letting a Su-30 MKI or Rafale flying from Port Blair fly all the way up to Sunda, Lombard and Malacca Straits for freedom of navigation missions.A senior IAF official had earlier described the French proposal as a win-win for the Indian air force and France.The Indo-Pacific is home to 1.5 million French citizens on island territories that give it an exclusive economic zone of more than 11 million sq km, the second largest in the world.France has spoken out for India on several occasions in the context of the stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control. Back in June when 20 Indian soldiers laid down their lives to repel China People’s Liberation Army troopers in Galwan Valley, the French defence minister Parly had made it a point to write to defence minister Rajnath Singh to convey her country’s “steadfast and friendly” support in these “difficult circumstances”.France has traditionally been the most dependable and consistent supporter of India at the United Nations and elsewhere too. Like when India carried out the 1998 nuclear tests, France was the only country among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council that did criticise or back sanctions against India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-19-jan-iaf-s-rafales-to-participate-in-1st-wargames-with-french-air-force/story-yZOYMvNjaANZ7DacxGssTP.html

The order - the first defence contract in the New Year - has been placed with a domestic shipyard as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign to boost self-reliance in the defence sector. The army will begin to accept deliveries of the boats this year. “#IndianArmy has inked a contract with M/s Goa Shipyard Limited for 12 Fast Patrol Boats for surveillance and patrolling of large water bodies, including those in #highaltitude areas. Delivery would commence from May 2021,” the Indian army tweeted on Friday. Also Read: India sends high-powered boats to match heavier Chinese vessels in Ladakh lakeBoth the Indian army and the Chinese PLA patrol the Pangong Lake using boats. Experts said the army needed the new boats to match the Chinese. “The Chinese have been using superior boats and there have been instances of the PLA operating the boats at high speeds, creating big waves and pushing the lighter Indian patrol boats onto their side (China controls two-thirds of the lake). The army needed more sophisticated and powerful boats, which have now been ordered,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). The Indian Navy had last year sent a dozen high-powered, bigger and top-of-the-line boats to Ladakh so that the Indian army could patrol Pangong Tso and match the heavier Type 928 B vessels of the Chinese Army lake fleet, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. Heights on both banks of the lake have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries. While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers. The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29. The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity. The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-orders-fast-patrol-boats-for-surveillance-of-pangong-lake-in-ladakh/story-oGRBenE1RtBqTzqN3jiP8J.html
01-01-2021||India||In fresh face-off, Bengal govt stops Visva-Bharati from blocking road on campus||The Birbhum district administration in West Bengal on Friday stopped the Visva-Bharati authorities from blocking a road that passes through the state’s only Central university campus and serves as a shorter route for residents of the town. Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty and the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) have been at loggerheads over several issues since August last year. The acrimony touched a new low recently when the university accused Nobel laureate economist Amartra Sen of illegally occupying some of its land. While addressing a TMC rally at Bolpur on December 29, chief minister Mamata Banerjee sharpened her attack on Chakrabarty, calling him a “stooge of the BJP.” The district police on Friday stopped construction workers from building a wall on the road, marking the second such incident since August when the Visva-Bharati authorities’ bid to construct a wall around the annual fair ground was thwarted by public and political resistance. “The university should form a committee, comprising me or any district official, local residents as well as people who live on campus. All decisions should be taken though discussion. A road cannot be blocked this way as it is extremely difficult for elderly people to take a 5-km detour,” Birbhum district magistrate Dr Vijay Bharti told the media on Friday. He visited the campus as well. The district administration also took possession of the road and handed it to the state public works department. The district superintendent of police, Shyam Singh, said the authorities did not seek any permission from the local administration before deciding to block the road and did not contact the administration either after construction of the wall was stopped. HT contacted the Visva-Bharati authorities for their reaction but no statement was made by any official till 6 pm. There were reports that the authorities also locked up a room used by former students.Trouble broke out at Visva-Bharati for the first time in August last year when a large crowd, comprising local residents and shopkeepers and headed by some TMC leaders, demolished two gates on the campus and damaged construction material stocked by the authorities to build a wall around an open ground where an annual fair is held. The fair, popularly known as Poush Mela, held towards the end of December, draws thousands of people and even foreign tourists. Opposed to the wall, local people and traders, for whom the fair is a major source of income, staged demonstrations. In 2019, the vice-chancellor, also removed some temporary shops that continued to do business even after the fair was over. He deployed private security agencies to guard the campus. After the alleged vandalism in August, 2020, the university authorities closed the campus temporarily. The chief minister disapproved the wall and said, “I do not want any construction that destroys the beauty of Visva-Bharati. The governor called me to seek the state’s intervention. I told him that when Rabindranath Tagore built Visva-Bharati he wanted students to be in the heart of nature and study in the open while listening to birds. He did not want wood and cement structures.”Visva-Bharati was set up by Rabindranath Tagore in 1922. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the present chancellor, virtually addressed the centenary celebration on December 24 and Union home minister Amit Shah spent around two hours on the campus on December 20, the day he led a big roadshow of the BJP in Bolpur town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-fresh-face-off-bengal-govt-stops-visva-bharati-from-blocking-road-on-campus/story-0dfYLKvZvNHcdrLthulK0L.html

01-01-2021||India||Serving employees to get disability compensation: All you need to know||In a significant New Year announcement, Union minister of state (independent charge) development of north eastern region (doner), MoS, PMO, personnel, public grievances, pensions, atomic energy and space, Jitendra Singh on Friday informed of the government’s decision to extend Disability Compensation for all serving employees, if they get disabled in the line of duty while performing their service and are retained in service in spite of such disablement.This order will particularly provide a huge relief to young Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) personnel like CRPF, BSF, CISF, etc since disability in performance of duties is generally reported in their case due to constraints of job requirement as well as hostile or difficult work - environment. Expressing his satisfaction on today’s order, Singh said, the Modi government is making all efforts to simplify the rules and to do away with discriminatory clauses. The ultimate objective of all these new initiatives is to provide ease of living for the Government servants even after they have superannuated and become pensioners or family pensioners or elder citizens, he said. All you need to know about the disability compensation:1. This new order will remove an anomaly in service rules, considering the hardship faced by the employees, since as per the earlier OM dated 5/5/2009, the provisions of disability benefits under Central Civil Services(CCS) (EOP) Rules did not provide such compensation to those government servants who were appointed on or after 1.1.2004 and covered under National Pension System (NPS). However, with the new order issued by the Department of Pensions in the Ministry of Personnel, the employees covered under NPS will also get benefits under Rule (9) of Extra Ordinary Pension (EOP). 2. If a government servant becomes disabled while performing his duties and this disablement is attributed to government service, in that case if he is still retained in the service in spite of disablement, a lump sum compensation will be paid to him by arriving at the capitalized value of the disability element, with reference to the Commutation Table in force from time to time. 3. In another employee-friendly decision, the Ministry of Personnel recently did away with minimum qualifying service of 10 years for pension, if a government servant is incapacitated due to bodily or medical infirmity and retired from government service. Accordingly, Rule 38 of CCS (Pension) Rules was amended to provide Invalid Pension at 50% of the last pay, even if the employee had not completed minimum qualifying service of 10 years. 4. In addition to above, in yet another reform in the Pension Rules, a decision was also taken to amend the rule and provide pension at enhanced rate to the family of an employee who died during service before completing the requisite service of minimum 7 years. As a result, now the family pension of 50 per cent of the last pay is also admissible to the family of employees who die even before completing 7 years of service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serving-employees-to-get-disability-compensation-all-you-need-to-know/story-KJpxHJ0gZoGTUOnekXkxaP.html
01-01-2021||India||New science policy draft focuses on self-reliance, enhanced funding in S&T||A push for self-reliance in technology, enhanced funding for science, technology and innovation with an earmarked budget by states, gender and social audits in academic and professional organisations are some of the major takeaways of the draft STIP 2020 that aims to position India among the top three scientific superpowers in the decade to come. The draft Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) has been uploaded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) on its website. The DST has also invited suggestions, inputs and comments for making changes by January 25.The policy states that its aim is “to achieve technological self-reliance and position India among the top three scientific superpowers in the decade to come; to double the number of Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) researchers, Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D (GERD) and private sector contribution to the GERD every 5 years; build individual and institutional excellence in STI with the aspiration to achieve the highest level of global recognitions and awards in the coming decade”.The policy also envisages the formation of an STI Development Bank for direct investments on various long and medium-term projects in select strategic areas, commercial ventures, start-ups, technology diffusion and licensing.It also aims to create an accountable research ecosystem, promoting translational as well as foundational research in the country in alignment with global standards.The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ+) community will be included in gender equity conversations with special provisions to safeguard its members’ rights and promote their representation and retention in STI, the draft policy states.The STIP will lead to the establishment of a National STI Observatory that will act as a central repository for all kinds of data related to and generated from the STI ecosystem. It will encompass an open centralised database platform for all financial schemes, programmes, grants and incentives existing in the ecosystem.The draft policy says an all-encompassing Open Science Framework will be built to provide access to scientific data, information, knowledge and resources to everyone in the country and all who are engaging with the Indian STI ecosystem on an equal partnership basis.A dedicated portal to provide access to the outputs of such publicly-funded research will be created through the Indian Science and Technology Archive of Research (INDSTA).The policy also proposes to create pathways for the government to negotiate with journal publishers for a “one nation, one subscription” policy, whereby, in return for a centrally-negotiated payment, all individuals in the country will have access to journal articles.It also talks about strategies to improve STI education, making it inclusive at all levels and more connected with the economy and that the society will be developed through processes of skill building, training and infrastructure development. It also proposes to establish education research centres (ERCs) and collaborative research centres (CRCs) to provide research inputs to policymakers and bring together stakeholders.With an aim to expand the financial landscape of the STI ecosystem, each department or ministry in the central, state and local governments, public sector enterprises, private sector companies and startups will set up an STI unit each with a minimum earmarked budget to pursue STI activities.“Each state will earmark a percentage of the state allocation for STI-related activities under a separate budget head. Foreign Multi National Companies (MNCs) will collaborate with domestic private and public sector entities on projects aligned to national needs and priorities,” the draft states.It also proposes that hybrid funding models with enhanced participation from public and private sectors will be created through the Advanced Missions in Innovative Research Ecosystem (ADMIRE) initiative.Research and Innovation Excellence Frameworks (RIEF) will be developed to enhance the quality of research along with the promotion of engagements with the relevant stakeholders. Proper guidelines will be formulated to enhance the operating and safety protocols related to research and development. The research culture will be reoriented to recognise social impacts along with academic achievements.The DST, along with the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser, started the process of formulating the STIP 2020 last year. The policy was to be out by the year-end, but has been slightly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-science-policy-draft-focuses-on-self-reliance-enhanced-funding-in-s-t/story-6nqKGkvchWgAw0CVswXelN.html

Forest officials said it might have fallen into the unused well a couple of days back. The pachyderm was noticed by local people on Thursday evening. A rescue team comprising forest, revenue and police officials have started breaking the well by constructing a pathway to get the jumbo out of the well. The well is located in a private land and visuals from the spot show the animal standing inside the well in a cramped manner with its legs covered deep in the slush. A senior forest official camping in the area said the elephant must have been injured under the impact of the fall and its health condition can be ascertained once it is out of the well. Local people said elephants used to frequent the area quite often posing a big threat to human habitat and fencing of the area was just started after repeated protests. “It seems to be tired. We hope we can rescue it by tonight. If it is injured it will be shifted to a camp after tranquilising it,” said the forest official. The official said large vegetation animals need big tracts of land to roam around and feed and farms in fringe areas draw them to it, leading to man-animal conflicts. According to statistics with the forest department, 24 people have died in elephant attacks last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-falls-into-50-feet-deep-well-in-kerala-rescue-efforts-underway/story-OX2cw83hobk0UdAQIo6irJ.html

01-01-2021||India||India weighs various options to evacuate sailors stranded in Chinese waters||India said on Friday it is looking at several options to assist 39 Indian sailors stranded on two merchant vessels in Chinese waters for months, including a crew change at sea or at a Chinese port, so that the men could be brought home. The Indian sailors are on MV Jag Anand and MV Anastasia which are carrying Australian coal but have not been allowed to discharge their cargo. The situation is believed to be the outcome of the China-Australia trade row. The matter has been taken up with the Chinese foreign ministry and local provincial authorities, who have been requested to allow the ships to dock or for their crews to be allowed to be changed, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. MV Jag Anand, a bulk cargo vessel with 23 Indian crew members, has been on anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13, while MV Anastasia is on anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20 with 16 Indians on board. The MV Anastasia is exploring the possibility of a crew change at sea at its current point of anchorage, and the Indian embassy in Beijing wrote to Chinese authorities on Thursday, proposing this alternative and seeking approval for it, Srivastava said. The Chinese foreign ministry also said in late November that a crew change wouldn’t be feasible at Jingtang port and that local authorities would examine requests from shipping companies for crew rotation at Tianjin port. Following this, shipping companies were asked to expeditiously file crew change applications, he said. “While the shipping companies are examining the logistics of sailing the ships away from their current points of anchorage, our embassy is liaising with relevant authorities in Tianjin for berthing approvals to facilitate the crew change,” Srivastava said. “We have also requested the shipping companies to ensure that they file in their plans for crew change at the earliest for approvals by the local Chinese authorities,” he added. Indian officials have been following up the issue of the Indian sailors for the past few months. Indian ambassador Vikram Misri has personally taken up the issue with China’s vice foreign minister, and the external affairs ministry has also followed up with the Chinese embassy in New Delhi. Srivastava reiterated that there is “growing stress on the crew members on account of the long delay”. He said, “Given this and our concern for the increasingly difficult conditions for our crew members, these two cases are being pursued vigorously.” He said several other ships from different countries were also awaiting their turn to unload their cargo at Chinese ports. “Our embassy in Beijing continues to remain in close and continuous touch with Chinese authorities in Beijing, Hebei and Tianjin. The ministry is also following up through the Chinese embassy in New Delhi for an early resolution,” he said. “We have noted the statements of the Chinese side, expressing their willingness to extend their assistance in this matter. We expect this assistance will be provided in an urgent, practical and time-bound manner, given the grave humanitarian situation that is developing on board the ships,” Srivastava added. The Chinese embassy had recently blamed commercial companies responsible for handling the cargo on the two merchant vessels for the predicament of the Indian sailors, and said it was providing assistance to the crew members. The Chinese side has also said crew change is not permitted at Jintang and Caofeidian ports because of Covid-19-related restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-weighs-various-options-to-evacuate-sailors-stranded-in-chinese-waters/story-YpaxCXwXC91PIMXyGi3RrL.html

These observatories are unique sources of information about atmospheric parameters,” Sinha said.Established in 1867, Patna meteorological observatory is among the earliest observatories set up by the then British Corps of Engineers.As per MeT officials, initially observations were taken twice a day at 9.30 am and 3.30 pm local time and subsequently the frequency was increased to four and then eight observations at three hourly intervals. The responsibility of observation and management of all meteorological offices was transferred to India Meteorological Department (IMD) after it was formally established in 1875.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-meteorological-observatory-gets-centennial-observing-station-status/story-6iGb5nT9S5HZgdMvY93TwI.html

In February, the SC had constituted the committee to look into illegal sand mining in the state and submit a report suggesting measures to deal with it. After visiting relevant places and understanding the details of the illegal trade, the committee recently submitted the report, which comprises 111point recommendations. The CEC suggests that the ministry of environment and forest issues environment clearance to all the valid LoI (letter of intent) holders recommended by the expert appraisal committee (EAC) in its meeting, held during 2014-2016, without insisting on submission of scientific study report as a precondition for the grant of EC within a period of three months, said a senior official of the mines department. In absence of replenishment study and environment clearance, the Supreme Court in November 2017 had banned bajri mining and directed the state government to ensure that illegal mining does not take place. Official data tabled in the Assembly states that between April 1, 2018 and July 31, 2020, a total of 3,076 FIRs and 33,317 complaints have been registered for violations of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. Also, in this period, the state government compounded Rs 216.19 crore as fine from the violators.

The state government is directed to conduct a drone survey in respect of all the remaining Khatedari leases within the next four months to assess the irregularities if any committed by them, he said. Recently, even chief minister Ashok Gehlot had stated that the issue of illegal bajri mining remained a concern for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-recommends-rs-10-lakh-per-vehicle-fine-to-curb-illegal-bajri-mining-in-rajasthan/story-GrzF9aGnHKt02ye3tkPP5I.html

He said the government is committed to delivering on its promise of housing for all by 2022, affordable housing for the poor, and rented accommodation for migrant workers. Modi added the project will strengthen cooperative federalism.“People were losing hope of owning a house even after putting in everything that they had saved. Houses remained on paper… People had also lost faith whether the law of the land will help them if they got into a dispute with the builder,” he said.Modi said the government has addressed these concerns and made it easy for a middle-class, hard-working family to own a house. He was referring to the Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) introduced in 2016 to protect the interest of homebuyers and ensure builders do not default on delivery of houses.“RERA has helped the people believe in realty projects again and that the projects will be completed. Today, 60,000 real-estate projects are registered under RERA. Thousands of cases have also been solved.”Modi appreciated the efforts of the states in providing housing for the poor and lashed out at the previous governments for not prioritising the sector. “Housing plans were not the priority of the central government in the past. They did not care about the details of the quality of construction. There was a chalta hai [it is okay], chalne do [let it be] approach… Why should not the country get new technology? The houses we build should be sturdy.”Modi referred to the dislocation and discrimination migrant workers faced during the Covid-19 lockdown and the poor living facilities they are forced to live in. He said the people who toil hard for the country’s development need to live with dignity. “…This is our responsibility. It is the intention of the government that, along with our businesses and investors, we will focus on creating affordable rental housing.”Modi also announced the winners of the Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerators with Uttar Pradesh topping the lost followed by Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lays-foundation-of-light-house-project/story-qBOnp5ovYvJmvHhvVlya0K.html

Among them, 20 people were found positive on Tuesday and Wednesday. Five were tested positive on Thursday and four on Friday.Among these 29 cases, eight have been detected in NCDC, New Delhi, two in IGIB New Delhi, five in NIV Pune, three in CCMB Hyderabad, 10 in NIMHANS Bengaluru and one in NIBMG Kalyani, the ministry said.The new strain, first detected in the UK in December, has spread fresh concerns across the world with most of the countries shutting their airspace to countries where the new strain has been found. India too has stopped flights from the UK till January 7. The new strain, which is believed to be more contagious and is potent to infect young people with no other health complications, forced several states to reimpose fresh restrictions. All UK_returned passengers have been tested and their samples are being genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs under INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia) launched by the government in the wake of the new strain. People tested positive with the mutated strain are being kept in isolation in health facilities. Contact tracing is being done for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Apart from India, countries which have reported the new variant include Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-more-test-positive-of-covid-19-uk-strain-tally-reaches-29/story-Q54tLzYcFwI16nHQTrVdKM.html
01-01-2021||India||Goa’s decision to not impose night curfew keeps New Year party going||Thousands of tourists crowded the beaches of Goa to ring in the New Year on Friday, flouting social distancing norms, in stark contrast to the rest of the country where states governments had imposed night curfews to curb gatherings and celebrations following the Centre’s caution over the coronavirus pandemic.The beaches became choked with crowds as many night clubs also organised parties for New Year’s eve. A few hours before celebrations were set to begin Goa’s health minister Vishwajit Rane had said that a night curfew was likely to be imposed in the coastal state, popular with partygoers, and that he had spoken to chief minister Pramod Sawant about the issue. “Spoke to the Hon’ble CM Dr.Pramod Sawant on imposing night curfew in the state on lines of the state of Delhi & Karnataka. The file is already in process. Strict SOPs is the need of the hour as Goa is a tourist state.” Rane said on Twitter.However, the chief minister later told news agency PTI that no decision on night curfew had been taken by the state. The chief minister’s decision to not implement a night curfew in the tourist state of Goa came on the heels of a letter to the state by the Union health ministry to lay down necessary standard operating procedure (SOP) keeping the state’s Covid-19 situation in mind. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had called for a strict vigil in Goa to curb all potential ‘super spreader’ events and places where crowds may gather to celebrate the New Year, PTI cited an official as saying.The ministry also referred to its earlier communication, saying states and Union territories may impose restrictions, such as night curfew, based on their assessment of the Covid-19 situation. “However, there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. In view of the matter, you may promptly assess the local situation and consider imposition of appropriate restrictions on 30th, 31st December and 1st January, 2021,” the letter said.It was a warning Rane had previously acknowledged on Twitter. “Received a letter from MoHFW INDIA to ensure SOPs & protocols are laid down by each state based on the situation in the respective states.Goa being a tourism state, it is imperative to have strict SOPs in place, to sustain tourism activities in keeping with Covid-19 guidelines,” Rane had tweeted on Thursday. Even though the chief minister had asked people to follow SOPs, visuals from party hotspots showed people flouting social distancing norms. Goa on December 27 saw its highest footfall of passengers when 11,000 passengers arrived on 72 flights, its highest traffic since lockdown. Goa has 51,066 cases of the coronavirus disease in the state, out of which 939 are active. Around 37 tourists, who travelled to Goa from the United Kingdom and tested positive for the coronavirus disease, and their contacts have been quarantined at ESI Hospital in Margao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-decision-to-not-impose-night-curfew-keeps-new-year-party-going/story-Mv2YW2gPPUg7DP4er02l9L.html

01-01-2021||India||India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations||Pakistan and India on Friday conducted the annual practice of exchanging the list of their nuclear installations under a bilateral arrangement that prohibits them from attacking each other’s atomic facilities.The exchange was made in accordance with Article-II of the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India, signed on December 31, 1988, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement here.It said that “the list of nuclear installations and facilities in Pakistan was officially handed over to a representative of the Indian High Commission at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, at 1100 hrs (PST).” “The Indian Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi handed over the list of Indian Nuclear installations and facilities to a representative of the Pakistan High Commission at 1130 hrs (IST),” it added.The agreement contains the provision that both countries inform each other of their nuclear installations and facilities on January 1 every year.This has been done consecutively since January 1, 1992, according to the FO.The exchange of information comes despite the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.The relationship dipped after India’s war planes pounded a terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.Tensions between the two nations spiked further after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations with India and expelled the Indian high commissioner following the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.Asserting that the abrogation of Article 370 was its “internal matter”, India has defended the imposition of restrictions in the Kashmir Valley on the grounds that they were put to prevent Pakistan from creating more mischief through proxies and terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations/story-UGFFx7sfYdK4QWTLKNYtxM.html

After the cordon was laid, terrorists lobbed grenades from inside and fired upon the search party. Although as per (the) SOP, terrorists were repeatedly appealed (to) by the troops to surrender in the evening and again in the morning. However, instead of surrendering, they fired upon troops and eventually got neutralised in a firefight.”The police spokesman said that the claims, made by the parents that Aijaz Maqbool Ganai had gone to the university to fill up a form on the day the encounter began, was found to be untrue after verification and cross checking using modern techniques, including studying the records stored by the telecom department. “Contrary to the claims, the verified digital evidence revealed and corroborated that Aijaz and Ather had gone to Hyderpora and from there to the place of occurrence (encounter) only. Similarly, Zubair had gone first to Pulwama, then to Anantnag, then Shopian to Pulwama and finally came to (the) place of occurrence.”Also Read: Mehbooba Mufti seeks impartial and swift probe into Lawaypora encounterThe spokesman said that background checks also reveal that Aijaz and Ather Mustaq, both OGWs (over ground workers) variously provided logistic support to terrorists. “Antecedents and verifications too show that both were radically inclined and had aided terrorists of the LeT (now so-called TRF) outfit. One of the OGWs, presently under police custody, has also corroborated Aijaz’s association with LeT terrorist Faisal Mustaq Baba, who was killed in Meej (Pampore) encounter in June last year. Pertinently, Ather was a relative and OGW of HM (Hizbul Mujahideen) top commander Rayees Kachroo, who got killed in 2017.Nevertheless, (the) police are investigating into the case from all possible angles,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-police-cite-evidence-to-claim-killed-lawaypora-youth-were-over-ground-workers-for-terrorists/story-oOOomqIojJZjdZDOo1VPqN.html

The last DDA housing scheme was launched in 2019 when around 18,000 flats had been put up for sale. This was later reduced to 10,000 since the planning authority had a hard time finding buyers. Even though the agency received 45,000 applications they could only sell 8,438 flats. 3. The MIG flats in Dwarka are located near Sector 16-B and 19-B, and are well connected via the Delhi Metro’s Blue Line (Dwarka-Noida/Vaishali).

01-01-2021||India||3 sites in Bihar identified for Covid-19 vaccination dry run||Patna, Jamui and Bettiah in West Champaran are among three districts of Bihar shortlisted for the pan-India dry run of Covid-19 vaccination to be undertaken on Saturday. Three facilities have been identified in each of these districts for the exercise. The urban primary health centre at Shastrinagar, community health centre at Phulwarisharif and sub-divisional hospital at Danapur are among the three health facilities identified for the mock drill in Patna. Three schools have been identified as session sites, which are locations where vaccination will be administered, in Jamui, said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, driving the vaccination programme. “The mock drill will essentially test the technology put in place for the vaccination programme. All vaccinations have to be done through the Co-WIN portal, as per the Centre’s operational guidelines. The portal contains the database of the vaccinator as well as the beneficiary,” said Kumar. Text messages will be sent out on mobile phones of the beneficiaries, which would guide them about the vaccination process and also remind them of the second shot after the first has been administered to them. “We have identified 25 test beneficiaries, who will be healthcare workers, at each of the health facilities for the mock drill tomorrow. The data of these beneficiaries will be uploaded in Co-WIN. We will follow all social distancing norms and the standard operating procedure put in place by the government of India,” added Kumar. As many as 35,000 healthcare workers have enrolled so far for the Covid vaccination in Patna, said a district health officer. “It is difficult to get an exact count on the number of private healthcare workers. We have, however, enrolled all those in public sector health facilities,” the officer said. “There will be one vaccinator per 100 beneficiaries, as per the norms prescribed by the Centre,” said the official. Private sector health facilities having more than 100 beneficiaries may get a vaccinator from the same facility, as the government has already prepared a database on them. A session site would comprise three rooms — a waiting hall, vaccination room and an observation hall. Each team at a session site would have five members, including one vaccinator and four vaccinator officers, who would be from the police, information technology and health sectors. The first vaccinator officer, ideally from the police set-up, has been tasked with the responsibility to maintain Covid-19 safety protocol, including social distancing. The second vaccinator officer will check the genuineness of the beneficiary through the Co-WIN portal, while the third and fourth, drawn primarily from the health set-up, will be at the observation room to check for any side-effect post-vaccination and for information, and counselling activity. The objective of the dry run is to assess operational feasibility in the use of the Co-WIN application in a field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide the way forward to actual implementation. The first round of the dry run was conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab on December 28 and 29 in two districts each where five session sites with 25 test beneficiaries each were identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-sites-in-bihar-identified-for-covid-19-vaccination-dry-run/story-kA2bAeHrjvHkISo1KrUGiI.html
01-01-2021||India||India lodges protest with Pakistan over Hindu temple’s demolition||India has formally protested with Pakistan regarding the recent vandalisation of a Hindu temple in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Friday. “The matter was taken up officially with the Pakistani side and a strong protest was lodged,” one of the people said.Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj’s samadhi along with the Krishna Dwara Mandir in Teri village in the northwestern town of Karak was vandalised on Wednesday by a mob. The mob claimed that the temple had encroached on extra land and set it on fire. At least two dozen people were arrested in overnight raids after the Hindu temple was attacked on Wednesday, according to reports. Some 1,500 people had reportedly participated in the attack on the temple. The arrests came after the country’s chief justice Gulzar Ahmed on Thursday took suo motu notice of the attack on the place of worship in Teri village. The chief justice took the step after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being set ablaze, during their meeting in Karachi on Thursday. The country’s supreme court will hear the case on January 5. Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs Noorul Haq Qadri called the attack “a conspiracy against sectarian harmony”. Qadri took to Twitter on Thursday and said that “protection of the religious freedom of minorities is our religious, constitutional, moral and national responsibility”.Local media quoted advocate Rohit Kumar, a representative of the Hindu community, as saying that the temple hadn’t exceeded the area agreed upon. Meanwhile, dozens of Hindus reportedly rallied in the city of Karachi to demand the rebuilding of the place of worship in Teri village.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997 and the local community had agreed to its reconstruction after the intervention by the supreme court in 2015. There was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple during its reconstruction, leading to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics. Guru Sri Paramhans Dayal was laid to rest at the site in 1919 and a temple was built there.The attack came weeks after the Pakistan government allowed Hindu residents to build a new temple in Islamabad on the recommendation of a council of clerics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lodges-protest-with-pakistan-over-hindu-temple-s-demolition/story-YIGZuPUadxcbQdGpAs26kL.html

The encounter has come close on the heels of an enquiry report that held an army captain guilty and responsible for the fake encounter at Amshipora (in) Shopian. Again, the three victims now established as innocent through an investigation, were killed and dubbed as militants,” Mufti said in her letter.The letter further said. “You and I may not agree in most political matters that concern J&K but I am certain we agree that such incidents bring disrepute to the armed forces and are a grave violation of human rights.”Former J&K chief minister said that while the J&K administration is apprehensive about returning the bodies to the families, this “callous” decision will only exacerbate their sense of loss and pain. “One hopes that you will rethink this decision and allow them to get closure. A mother who grieves the sudden and tragic death of her beloved son shouldn’t be deprived of the last chance to see his face,” reads the letter.The security forces on Wednesday had said that three local militants were killed in an encounter at Lawaypora on the outskirts of the Srinagar city.Also Read: Row intensifies over Srinagar encounterFamilies of the slain, however, rebutted the claim and said the youth killed in the encounter were civilians. The families also held a protest outside the police control room in Srinagar.At a press briefing on Wednesday, General Officer Commanding (GoC) Kilo Force, H S Sahi had said that the militants were planning to attack the security forces on the national highway and different agencies were getting inputs about the same.“We had been getting inputs about the militants’ movement on the national highway. The operation was launched last evening after getting inputs that militants were inside a house close to the national highway. They were asked to surrender, however they responded with firing and the operation was suspended for the night and when operation was resumed again in the morning, they were again given an offer to surrender, however, they again started firing and hurled grenades which gave an indication they had no intention to surrender.”Three youth killed in the encounter are identified as Zubair Ahmad from Turkawangam, Shopian, Ajaz Maqbool and Athar Mushtaq from Putrigam, Pulwama .Their families claimed that they were students who had left their homes yesterday before they were picked up and killed in a ‘staged’ encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-seeks-impartial-and-swift-probe-into-lawaypora-encounter/story-8SjyzBWBcJGKZcGnWvqQ7H.html

After conducting a dry run of Covid-19 vaccination in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat on December 28 and 29, the Centre will now extend the drill to rest of the country so that once a vaccine is approved for emergency use, the shot is administered to the first group of eligible people without a glitch.“Target of this exercise is that minutest details are thoroughly researched. At least two vaccines have sent their applications to Drug Controller and experts for approval, their data are being studied pro-actively,” Vardhan said during the video meeting, according to ANI.“The lists of health workers have been created and will be uploaded on Covid platform. Just like we prepare during elections, the same way we need to train each member of all medical teams responsibly,” Vardhan said. “After training over 2,000 master trainers at the national level, the training is underway at the state and district level, in over 700 districts. The procedure is similar to conducting elections where the team at a booth is also trained,” he added.All state capitals will conduct dry runs in at least three session sites on Saturday. Some states will also include districts that are situated in difficult terrain or have poor logistical support. In vaccine dry run, the entire process of transporting the vaccines from storage to the site, administering them to candidates, feeding data on Co-WIN app is practised without any real vaccine.The plan to extend the dry run to all states and Union territories comes amid the Drug Controller General of India’s (DCGI’s) indication that India might start the New Year with a vaccine against Covid-19. “We will have a Happy New Year with something in hand, that’s all I can hint at,” said VG Somani, DCGI, on Thursday.In Gujarat dry run, 475 beneficiaries underwent the dummy procedure, the main aim of which is to identify if there is any loophole in the planned process. Crowd management at a booth, maintaining social distancing guidelines inside the booth are also being practised at the mock drills. In Punjab, Ludhiana and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar were selected for the dry run. Nalbari and Sonitpur were the two districts of Assam where the mock drill already took place. Krishna district from Andhra Pradesh was chosen for the two-day drill.

Hundreds of police personnel have been deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points, where the farmers have been camping since November 26, even as the minimum temperature dipped to 1.1 degrees Celsius.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, according to news agency PTI, is likely to meet during the day to discuss its next course of action. Senior farmers’ leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni has said there is, however, no question of withdrawing from the two issues which are a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) and repealing of the farm laws, PTI reported.“The government has addressed our demands to drop penal provisions against farmers in an ordinance relating to stubble burning and to put on hold a proposed electricity amendment law,” Chaduni said. “But, we want to make it clear that there is no alternative to our two remaining demands which include repeal of the three agriculture laws and legal guarantee for MSP,” he added.Also read | Farmers’ protest: Delhi’s Chilla, Ghazipur borders remain closed; traffic divertedPTI reported that the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, one of the protesting farm unions, has issued a statement saying the Centre’s appeal to farmer leaders to suggest an alternative to repeal of the laws is impossible. “The new laws will hand over control of agriculture markets, farmers’ land and food chain to corporates,” the committee said in the statement.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said, after the sixth round of talks between ministers and a 41-member representative, on Wednesday that consensus has been reached on two of the four issues. Tomar had also said that the next meeting with farmers representatives will be held on January 4. Tomar said the union leaders kept insisting on the repeal of the three farm laws, but the government side tried to explain to them the benefits of the acts and sought to know specific problems faced by the farmers. The minister said the government has already said that it is ready to give a written assurance as he talked about the farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee for procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP).Also read | India’s protesting farmers hold key to self-reliance in edible oilsTraffic issuesAs the farmers’ protests continued, Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed due to the agitation and suggested alternate roads. “Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement.

The protesting farmers, however, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. On its part, the Centre has reiterated the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the Centre over the farm laws in his New Year’s message on Friday. “As the New Year begins, we remember those who we lost and thank all those who protect and sacrifice for us. My heart is with the farmers and labourers fighting unjust forces with dignity and honour.

Jhatikara Borders is open only for LMV (Cars/ Light Motor Vehicles), two wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it tweeted.“The Chilla and Ghazipur Borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests.

I did not oppose the central government. I said that the farm laws were very beneficial to the farmers. When ruling and opposition MLAs alleged that the Prime Minister was not negotiating with the farmers, I argued that the central government was always ready for the talks,” Rajagopal said in a statement, according to news agency ANI.Also read | Kerala passes resolution against farm laws“I said that farmer unions stand that they would engage in dialogue only after withdrawing the farm laws is the reason for the protests to continue in a prolonged manner. The statements that I am against the central government are baseless,” he added.Rajagopal, who represents the Nemom constituency in Thiruvananthapuram, had spoken against the resolution in the House initially but when it was put to voice vote he did not stage a walkout and supported it. After the session, when reporters asked him about it, he said he supported the resolution in accordance with the “democratic spirit of the house”. “I raised my disagreement in clear terms.

The speaker did not ask during voting about those who support the resolution and those who oppose it. It was reduced to a single question without being asked separately, which is a violation of the norms,” Rajagopal said.Also read Farmers’ protest: Delhi’s Chilla, Ghazipur borders remain closed; traffic divertedK Surendran, the BJP’s state unit president, had said he will talk to Rajagopal after he supported the farm laws. “There is no difference of opinion in the party.

I will talk to him about this,” Surendran said.The Kerala assembly passed the resolution, which was introduced by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, unanimously against the three farm laws during the special session. “The Centre wants to corporatise the farm sector. It must come forward to allay farmers’ fears. The entire country is with them. It should recognise public sentiment and withdraw the new laws,” Vijayan had said. The resolution in the Kerala assembly came a day after the protesting farmers and the government held the fifth round of talks on Wednesday. They reached consensus on two of four issues on the agenda. Farmer leaders have been protesting on borders of Delhi since November 26 against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-supporting-kerala-assembly-s-resolution-against-farm-laws-bjp-s-rajagopal-retracts/story-oSSFM4FY65vnrFEOLvX9WJ.html

Data from safety and efficacy trials conducted by SII is being vetted by the committee. The vaccine has been developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, which received regulatory approval in the UK on Wednesday.Also read | 2021 brings hope, ready for largest vaccine drive: PM ModiAfter the drugs controller’s approval, here is how the distribution plan will work:1. Officials with knowledge of the government’s vaccination plan have said that special cargo planes with cold boxes storage space and refrigerated vans will start ferrying vials of the vaccine from Pune, where SII’s Covid-19 vaccine production facilities are located, to various parts of the country.2. State administrations will then distribute the vaccine vials to district authorities for delivery to the hundreds of thousands of inoculation centres to be set up across India in a process which will span over several weeks.Also read | FAQs about immunisation answered3. The initial lots of the vaccine will be sent only to government hospitals, public health centres or large private hospitals. The first two priority group of health care and other frontline workers such as police personnel will be vaccinated at these sites.4. Polling booths, wedding halls, community centres, and mobile vans will be used as inoculation centres where the remaining high-risk population of elderly adults and those suffering from comorbidities will be administered the vaccine.5. The national expert group on the Covid-19 vaccine will send an order to SII with specific details of how many vials (each vial of the vaccine will contain multiple doses) are to be shipped to each destination after DGCI gives its nod.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today6. Officials have said that the vaccines will be transported by air and road but not by rail -- at least for now. “There is no plan to use refrigerated vans of Indian Railways as of now. For destinations near Pune, vaccines would be delivered by road. On longer routes, cargo flights will carry the pallets,” said the first official cited above.7. It will be SII’s responsibility to deliver the vaccines at the designated consignee points but the logistics and cold chains will be monitored primarily by the government. “SII has the obligation to deliver it safely at the specific places and hand it over to the state or central officials. Once the handover is done, the responsibility of further distribution lies entirely with the government,” said a second official.Also read: Centre releases Covid-19 vaccine rollout strategy8. The government has also set up fixed consignee points or places for handing over vaccine shipments to the states in capital cities and prominent urban centres.9. The vaccines will be stocked at four Government Medical Store Depots in Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata and state and regional vaccine stores. Refrigerated vans will bring these vaccines to the last point in the cold chain in Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and Community Health Centres.10. Officials have said that the transportation of vaccines from states and regional stores to divisions and districts would be done in cold boxes using insulated vaccine vans. Vaccines carriers with ice packs are used to transport vaccines from PHCs to the outreach sessions in the village, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-cargo-planes-to-vans-here-s-how-centre-plans-to-distribute-covid-19-vaccine/story-IgdjUkbSdhzh8So2Yq46bN.html

01-01-2021||India||MP farmers duped by traders outside Mandis, several arrested||State government in Madhya Pradesh continues to convince farmers about the efficacy of new farm laws introduced by the central government. However, a number of farmers from at least 10 districts have so far complained about being duped by traders outside Krishi Upaj Mandis. However, the state government claims to have taken tough action and the police have arrested accused in several cases. On Wednesday, police arrested two traders- Suresh Khoja and Pawan Khoja-- both residents of Khategaon in Dewas district, who purchased moong and gram worth Rs 1.73 crore from 22 farmers from Dewas, Harda, Sehore and Hoshangabad, but they didn’t pay to the farmers all that was due. As per the state government’s official communiqué, the farmers, in a joint memorandum, complained to sub-divisional magistrate concerned on Tuesday as per the provisions of the new laws-- Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act. The traders were booked under sections 420 and 34 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and arrested from Indore the next day. Similar complaints from farmers having been duped by traders have been received from other places too. More than 70 farmers from Nandarwada village in Hoshangabad district had alleged that trader Aditya Raj purchased paddy worth Rs 85 lakh on December 23 from them but ran away without making the payment. Superintendent of police, Hoshangabad, Santosh Singh Gaur said the trader was arrested within 24 hours of the complaint. For five farmers of Ratlam district in the state, the sale of green peas, onion and garlic worth Rs 10 lakh to a trader in Satara in Maharashtra proved to be a nightmarish experience. The farmers were framed in a false case of kidnapping of the trader’s 11-year-old son when they visited him for payment. The farmers were booked under sections 364, 363, 504 and 34 of Indian Penal Code (IPC), arrested and sent to jail, stated a complaint, lodged with Bilpank police station in the district on December 9, by the father of one of the farmers.Also Read: In his New Year greetings, Rahul Gandhi takes a veiled dig at Centre over farm lawsSimilar complaints of cheating were received from farmers in Guna, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Balaghat and certain other districts. In a glaring example of malpractices in purchase of agriculture produce, a private paddy procurement centre at Semra village in Patan Tehsil of Jabalpur district was found to be purchasing paddy from farmers without any authorisation from the government. Thousands of quintals of paddy worth about Rs 5 crore were purchased before action was taken against the centre, as per officials. State president of Mandi Board Employees and Officers Association, Madhya Pradesh, Angira Pandey said, “Farmers were duped of more than Rs 20 crore in 15 to 20 districts after the new farm laws came into being. This is all because of the confusion and chaotic situation outside the mandis due to the farm laws.” Also Read: MP govt orders probe after EC flags distribution of unaccounted cashPandey said that when purchase of agriculture produce by registered traders was completely regulated by Mandis, such a large number of complaints didn’t surface. “Whenever there was any malpractice by any trader, the provisions in Krishi Upaj Mandi Act of 1972 gave immediate relief to the farmers by penalising the traders. But now, farmers are supposed to approach the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) concerned and may not get relief as fast as they used to get under the Krishi Upaj Mandi Act.” National president of youth wing of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh Rahul Sharma said, “Complaints by farmers of cheating by traders in almost every region of the state have corroborated our stand on the new farm laws that these are not in the interest of the farmers but the corporate houses. The central government should withdraw the farm laws and strengthen the Mandi system instead with guarantee of MSP to farmers on sale of agriculture produce.” Farmers welfare and agriculture minister Kamal Patel disagreed with the farmers’ associations. “It is because of the new farm laws that farmers are lodging complaints with the administrative authorities and the administration is taking tough action against the wrongdoers. In many cases, the accused were arrested by the police. Earlier, there was no such remedy.” He claimed that the farmers in Madhya Pradesh “understand well” that the farm laws are there to help them get enhanced income. “That’s why they are with the farm laws and the BJP government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-farmers-duped-by-traders-outside-mandis-several-arrested/story-CyQDaqESsTc9ltOnATQc3J.html
01-01-2021||India||Mercury drops to 1.1°C in Delhi; parts of N-W India record sub-zero temperatures||Delhi recorded the season’s lowest temperature at 1.1 degrees Celsius on Friday, according to Regional Meteorological Centre. There was very dense fog in Palam with 0 visibility till 7am. After 7am, visibility improved to around 150 metres.Many parts of the northwestern plains have recorded sub zero or near 0°C minimum temperatures in the last couple of days.On Thursday for example, Hisar and Narnaul in Haryana recorded -1.2°C and 0.5°C respectively; Bhatinda and Ballowal in Punjab recorded 0°C and 0.2°C respectively; Sikar and Pilani in east Rajasthan also recorded 0°C and 0.2°C respectively while Churu in west Rajasthan recorded -1.3°C. Pantnagar in Uttarakhand, Una in Himachal Pradesh recorded 0.1°C and 0.5°C, respectively.Also Read: Govt advises people to stay indoors, wear warm clothes as cold wave persistsWhile many of these places do record 0°C during most winters, this year the cold is definitely severe, scientists said.After December 12, western disturbances mostly affected the Western Himalayan region; under their influence, thee was significant snowfall and rainfall over Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. “After the WD, cold northwesterly winds are blowing over Delhi NCR from Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Uplifted fog cover over Punjab and Haryana is also making it colder. The effect of La Niña, a global meteorological phenomenon, also contributed to fall in temperatures over northwest India this year,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.A fresh active western disturbance likely to affect the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains from January 3 onwards. It is likely to cause light to moderate snowfall over the western Himalayan region between January 3 and 6. Due to interaction between the western disturbance and lower level easterlies from Bay of Bengal, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm or hailstorm at isolated places is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, north Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh and northwest Madhya Pradesh during January 2 to 5 with maximum intensity on January 4 and 5, India Meteorological Department said in its Thursday bulletin.Due to southeasterly winds over northwest and central India, minimum temperatures are likely to rise gradually by 3-5°C during the next 4 to 5 days. “Cold wave” to “severe cold wave” conditions are likely in some pockets over Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh during the next 24 hours. “Cold day” to “severe cold day” conditions are likely over some pockets of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and west Madhya Pradesh during the next two days and over Himachal Pradesh during the next 24 hours.According to IMD, a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees and maximum temperature is 4.5°C or 6.4°C below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10°C or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4°C in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures is lower than normal.Dense to very dense fog is likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and dense fog is likely over parts of Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura during the next two days and over Uttarakhand, west Madhya Pradesh during the next 24 hours. Ground frost is likely over parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan during the next 24 hours.“During many years, minimum temperatures in Churu, Ganganagar, Bikaner, Hanumangarh, Hisar etc reach 0°C because these places are in desert regions where nights can be extremely cold but day temperatures are relatively higher so people don’t feel the bitter cold here. Climatologically we are in the peak of winter and there is an impact of cold winds from snow-clad mountains which is making even the plains reach sub-zero temperatures. Minimum temperatures are likely to rise significantly from January 2 due to the approaching western disturbance,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.“We have already said that below normal temperatures are expected over northwest India through the winter. We know that cold westerlies tend to enter inland during La Niña years which is also why winter is more pronounced,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, Pune, had said last week explaining the impact of La Niña.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mercury-drops-to-1-6-c-in-delhi-parts-of-n-w-india-record-sub-zero-temperatures-in-last-2-days/story-4ifVVuOA7eioYOEI4gvJBL.html

Happy new year to all. pic.twitter.com/L0esBsMeqWThe Congress leader has spoken up on several occasions in support of the farmers protesting against the three farm laws passed by the Centre in September last year. On December 24, after meeting with President Ram Nath Kovind along with other party members to discuss demands made by the farmers, Rahul Gandhi said, ”India is now an imaginary democracy”.On December 27 too, he targeted the Centre over the protests, saying that the farmers should keep walking and not be scared of the ‘bluster of the government’. He used a modified version of Dwarkaprasad Maheshwari’s popular poem “Veer Tum Badhe Chalo” to make the point. “Keep walking O brave one, patiently you move ahead. Doesn’t matter if there is a water cannon shower or bluster/bravado, you don’t fear, O fearless one. You remain firm, and walk on. O ‘annadata’, you keep walking,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. Thousands of farmers have been protesting for over a month against the new farm laws. Their demand that the three farm laws be completely repealed has not been accepted by the government. Even after several rounds of talks between the two parties, the government has only suggested amending the laws. The farmers have, however, said they will accept nothing less than complete repealing of these laws.Another round of meetings between the government and representatives of the farmers is scheduled to take place on January 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-his-new-year-greetings-rahul-gandhi-takes-a-veiled-dig-at-centre/story-yYHxrnNE67cJWQHDaVQFjP.html

01-01-2021||India||Govt looks to acquire forest land for mining in Korba||The coal ministry has issued a notification on its intention to acquire 712.072 hectares (ha) and all rights over the land for mining coal in Madanpur South coal block in Korba district of Chhattisgarh, whose government has been considering declaring the rich forest area an elephant reserve. According to the notification published on December 24, 489.274 ha is protected forest land and 159.327 comprises revenue and other forest land.The intention to acquire the land has been notified under provisions of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act. The law says that if the central government is satisfied that coal is obtainable from a tract of land, it can give notice of its intention to acquire it.But diversion of the forest land for non-forest use hasn’t taken place yet because the Chhattisgarh government was considering declaring it an elephant reserve.“We have not started the process of diversion of forest land. I cannot say anything on whether or when it will be diverted. The issue of extending the elephant reserve is still under consideration,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) in Chhattisgarh“Since the elephant reserve hasn’t been notified yet commenting on its boundaries will be premature. The government will take a call,” said PVN Rao, PCCF (wildlife) in Chhattisgarh.Environmental activists and legal researchers have raised several concerns with the intention to acquire large biodiversity rich forest land located in the Hasdeo Arand region-- one of the largest contiguous stretches of very dense forests in central India spanning 170,000 ha which has 22 coal blocks underneath.“The central government has issued a notification to acquire the same forest land for which a process for diversion is pending, especially because the state government is looking to declare the area as an elephant reserve and the local Gram Sabhas have refused to grant consent,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research think tank.“This raises a serious legal question on the validity of the notification issued under the Coal Bearing Areas Act, 1957 which is seeking to acquire government forest land. But more importantly, it highlights the failure of cooperative federalism as both the state and central governments appear to have visualized a different future for the Hasdeo Arand region where the Madanpur South coal block is located,” Kohli said.Alok Shukla, convenor of the Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a non-government organisation, said the government should consult the local gram sabha (village council).“I think acquiring forest land like this completely goes against the provisions of Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act. Recently four coal blocks in the Hasdeo region were saved from being auctioned after state government said they have rich, dense forest cover. This block is also in Hasdeo Arand and the catchment of Hasdeo river is located here so why is it being acquired for mining? First there should be detailed consultation with people of the region and state government should oppose this move by the Centre,” he said Asked whether the Centre had considered the impact of mining in an elephant habitat and rich forest area, a senior coal ministry official said on condition of anonymity : “The queries are premature. The notification talks merely of intention to acquire. The objective is precisely to find out the intricacies based on which a decision will be made.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looks-to-acquire-forest-land-for-mining-in-korba/story-gxOmysuzzjvjB0M0irMCGJ.html
01-01-2021||India||Asked to pay for cigarette, Uttarakhand policeman kills shop owner||A police constable killed a 28-year-old cigarette shop owner by crushing him under his car, enraged because the man had asked him to pay for the cigarette he bought . The incident took place on Wednesday in Bazpur area of Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar district. The cigarette seller, identified as Guarav Rohella, was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. Following the incident, Rohella’s family members and a large number of local residents gathered at Bazpur police station with his body, demanding action against the constable, who fled after committing the crime.  “In the initial investigation it was found that the incident happened at around 10.30pm when the accused constable Praveen Kumar, his brother-in-law Jivan Kumar and another person, Gaurav Rathore ,came to Rohella’s shop in their car,” said Dipshikha Agarwal, circle officer, Bazpur . “There, they asked him for cigarette which he gave them. When they started leaving without payment, Rohella asked Praveen to pay for the cigarette which enraged him. He along with his two accomplices started abusing him, resulting in a heated argument between the three accused and Rohella and his brother Ajay who too was present at the shop. It was thenthat Praveen started his car and crushed him under it,” Agarwal added. Agarwal said the police arrested the three men on Thursday morning. They were booked for murder, intentional insult and criminal intimidation under sections 302, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code on the basis of a complaint filed by Rohella’s brother Ajay. . Uttarakhand’s director general of police Ashok Kumarsaid he had taken serious note of the case and ordered the district police to take strict action against the three men, “No accused would be spared in the case and strict action would be taken against them.

01-01-2021||India||MP govt orders probe after EC flags distribution of unaccounted cash||The Madhya Pradesh government on Thursday asked its economic offence wing (EOW) to conduct an inquiry after the Election Commission of India (ECI) wrote to it that officials, including three Indian Police Service officers and a state police service officer, were involved in unauthorised distribution of unaccounted-for cash during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The state government’ ordered the inquiry in a letter written to the EOW. “ECI’s letter is attached with Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)’s detailed report (4 volumes) dated October 28, 2020,” the letter written by the General Administration Department (GAD) said.The ECI’s letter was forwarded to the state government in the third week of December by Madhya Pradesh’s chief electoral officer Veera Rana. The ECI recently summoned Madhya Pradesh chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and additional chief secretary (home) Rajesh Rajora before it on January 5 after the state government failed to take any action on its letter.The GAD’s letter quoted the ECI’s instructions to the chief electoral officer, which read: “In view of the above, Commission had directed to forward copy of the report of CBDT dated October 28, 2020, along with an extract of list of government servants involved, to lodge criminal action before designated authority, e.g. Economic Offences Wing, state of Madhya Pradesh against concerned for violation as per extant electoral and other relevant laws. In case of need for further information in this regard the same may be further sought from CBDT.” The GAD’s letter further states, “The CEO’s and the ECI’s letters are being forwarded with annexure and detailed report of the CBDT for analysing the available facts and necessary legal action. The same is being forwarded after sanction to the same from the competent authority.” The officials’ names were found in documents seized during Income Tax raids conducted at the establishments of RK Miglani, political advisor to the then chief minister Kamal Nath, the former CM’s then officer on special duty (OSD) Praveen Kakkad and some of their associates in April 2019 in Bhopal and Delhi, officials have said. The amounts mentioned in the annexure against the names of IPS officers include Rs 12.50 crore, Rs 30 lacs and Rs 25 lacs while the amount mentioned against the name of the state police service officer is Rs 7.5 crore. Superintendent of police, EOW, Rajesh Kumar said: “We have received the recommendation from the state government. We are in the process of lodging a preliminary enquiry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-orders-probe-after-ec-flags-distribution-of-unaccounted-cash/story-uBzIYLRsCqwUtqAfmgSZXN.html
01-01-2021||India||The Number Theory| A decade of rightward shift in Indian politics||As 2020 comes to an end, West Bengal, even though assembly elections will only take place in April-May 2021, has emerged as the most keenly watched political theatre. Things were not very different 10 years ago. Back then, it was the 34-year-old Communist Party of India Marxist (CPI-M) led Left Front government whose future was at stake from an aggressive All India Trinamool Congress (AITC). Today, it is the AITC which faces the challenge of surviving the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) political challenge. Ironic as it may sound, the BJP’s rise in the state has been facilitated by a large-scale shift of CPI-M supporters to the former. The West Bengal story, in a way, is symptomatic of how politics took a decisive rightward shift in India in the past 10 years. Here are four charts which put this in perspective.1. From existential crisis to the new hegemon: The BJP’s comeback decadeAfter a shock defeat in the 2004 elections, the BJP fought the 2009 elections with Lal Krishna Advani as its prime-minister candidate. The party managed to win only 116 Lok Sabha seats, its worst performance since the 1991 polls. The BJP did not win any major assembly election on its own in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Things started looking up after Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement of 2011 made a huge dent to Congress’s popularity. By the time Narendra Modi won his third term as the Gujarat chief minister in December 2012, the tables had turned. The BJP repeated its victories in major state polls in 2013 and became the first party since 1984 to get a majority of its own in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The fact that it improved its 2014 performance in 2019 laid to rests any doubts about the fact that it had become the new hegemon in Indian politics. The Congress, on the other hand, has failed to get its act together at the national level, and in some ways is still haunted by the ghosts of the 2011 Anna movement. Chart 1: !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();2. Mirror image of the rise of the right: An emaciated leftIn 2010, the Communist parties were running governments in three states: West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. While the communists in Kerala can be relieved from the results of the recently concluded local body elections – they make the CPI (M )-led Left Democratic Front the favourite in the assembly polls next year – the left has suffered severe reverses in West Bengal and Tripura. In these states, it is the right which has eaten up the left, although in different ways. In Bengal, the left started losing its support-base to the BJP from 2014 onwards, a process that only gained further momentum in 2019. In Tripura, when the Left Front lost to the BJP in the 2018 assembly polls, the BJP and the CPI(M) were almost neck and neck in vote share. But, in the 2019 elections, the CPI(M) was relegated to a distant third with the Congress making a comeback as the BJP’s nearest rival. Thanks to a rout in West Bengal and Tripura and just one seat in Kerala, the Left recorded its worst ever performance in 2019. Chart 2: !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();3. Political othering of Muslims: New India’s Modus VivendiIf there is one fact which defines the BJP’s rise as the dominant political force in the last 10 years, it is its politics of othering of Muslims, who make up more than 14% of India’s 1.3 billion people. The present regime has successfully spearheaded the three core issues of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the revocation of Article 370 that offered special status to Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir; and criminalisation of the Muslim practice of Triple Talaq. Hindutva has pushed the envelope further with issues like (politically) clubbing the National Register of Citizens with a Citizenship Amendment Act; which includes citizens of all major religions in India except Muslims or the recent laws against inter-community marriages in the name of preventing so-called love jihad. This rhetoric has been accompanied in praxis by the BJP fielding very few Muslim candidates in all elections and a sharp fall in the share of Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha in 2014 and 2019. To be sure, the share of Muslim MPs in the Lok Sabha was the lowest in the 1962 elections, not in 2019. Chart 3: !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();4. Surviving in the age of Hindu consolidation: The biggest challenge for any third political alternativeThe decade of 1990s and 2000s were the age of coalition politics in India. Even though the country had a Congress or BJP Prime Minister for most of this period, they were dependent on other parties for survival. If one looks at the Lok Sabha elections since 1984, when the BJP fought its first poll battle, the vote share of non-Congress, non-BJP parties reached an all-time high of 52.6% in 2009. This fell by almost ten percentage points by 2019. While part of the fall is explained by a shrinking of the left, the rise of political Hindutva had also contributed to this phenomenon. The biggest example of this was seen in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when despite being in an alliance, the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party could not prevent the BJP from sweeping Uttar Pradesh once again. In many other states, the BJP has been successful in usurping regional movements and parties by giving it a religious colour; the Assam Gana Parishad and All Assam Students’ Union in Assam are examples. Whether or not the AITC survives the BJP’s onslaught is the biggest question as we end 2020. Chart 4: !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*=’"+e+"’]");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();Source: TCPD, Election Commission of India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-number-theory-a-decade-of-rightward-shift-in-indian-politics/story-GkQ5PIcrq3czjoOeWzPhxI.html
01-01-2021||India||Night curbs in metros to ensure Covid-safe revelry||Authorities in Delhi have announced night-time restrictions to prevent gatherings in public places on December 31 and January 1, joining metro cities such as Mumbai and Bengaluru that introduced varying degrees of curbs to curtail New Year celebrations in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) epidemic.According to an order issued late on Wednesday, over five people are not allowed to assemble at public places in the Capital from 11pm on Thursday to 6am on Friday, and then again from 11pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday.This order — it cited the infectious mutant UK strain that has been detected in Delhi — does not apply to “licensed premises” such as hotels, clubs and pubs, which already follow social distancing measures and Covid-19 guidelines drafted by government authorities. “On such premises, Covid-19 guidelines like limit of persons, mandatory wearing of masks and ensuring other Covid-19 appropriate behaviour will apply,” Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev said on Thursday.There was no restriction on gatherings in residential premises. The order made it clear that there was no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement of people and goods.The order issued by Dev, who is also the chairman of the executive committee of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), effectively bans large gatherings at places such as the India Gate, a popular destination in the city on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day.DDMA is in charge of implementation and enforcement of Covid-19-related regulations and management strategies in the city. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal is its chairperson. The order said a “detailed assessment of the situation in Delhi has been made”, and “considering the threat posed by the mutant UK strain of Covid-19 virus and after observing local incidents of Covid-19 pandemics in Delhi”, authorities feared that “gatherings, congregations and public celebrations in New Year pose a considerable threat of spread of the virus”.All district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police in Delhi were told to ensure strict compliance of the restrictions. Violations can attract an imprisonment of up to six months, said a government official who did not want to be identified.Several teams of revenue officials will be deployed for surveillance and enforcement of broader Covid-19 guidelines at popular public places such as Connaught Place till January 2, a second official said, requesting anonymity. He added that officials were authorised prosecute people not wearing masks and not following social distancing norms, as specified by authorities in previous orders.Read more| Delhi records 574 Covid-19 infections in last 24 hours, one of the lowest in monthsThe official said the idea of night-time restrictions was discussed at a DDMA meet chaired by LG Baijal on Wednesday. “In the meeting, the L-G reviewed the Covid-19 situation and concerns were raised over patients of the UK strain being detected in Delhi,” he said.Authorities across the country, including those in Delhi, are on alert in view of the emergence of the mutant strain of the coronavirus that was first detected in London and Kent in mid-September. India has suspended flights to and from the UK until January 7 from December 31. While the new strain is more infectious, there is no evidence to suggest that it increases the severity of the disease.As of Thursday, India has reported 25 cases of the new strain; at least four of them are Delhi residents.Delhi has reported 625,369 cases and 10,536 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in March. On Thursday, the city recorded 574 cases and 13 fatalities.Overall, India has reported 10,286,236 cases of Covid-19 and 149,034 deaths. The seven-day average has dropped to 19,828, down from the peak of 93,617 for the week ending September 16. “At this juncture, people should not let their guards down, even though the number of new cases in India is on a decline. Across several other countries, there is a spike in cases and things for India can also change any moment. People should avoid gatherings,” Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in premier scientific body Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said.Read more| Night curbs imposed in Delhi on December 31 and January 1 from 11pm to 6amThe city’s business community hinted at muted, and cautious, New Year’s celebrations.“We have already been following Covid-19 guidelines ever since restaurants were reopened (on June 8 after a lockdown announced on March 25 to contain the spread of the disease)...We will follow those guidelines during New Year’s celebration as well. Restaurants will operate at 50% capacity and there will be no entry of guests without masks. Thermal screening will be mandatory along with hand sanitisation,” said Sanjeev Mehra, president of the Khan Market Traders Association.Not just Delhi, cities across India stared at low-key New Year’s Day celebrations with stringent restrictions in place. For instance, the Maharashtra government has imposed night-time restrictions from December 22 to January 5, prohibiting assembly of four or more people in Mumbai and other cities. Gatherings in restaurants, bars and pubs will not be allowed after 11pm. There is no restriction on visiting friends, relatives and public places, but not in a group of over four people, the police added.Unlike in the past, revellers in Bengaluru will not be able to gather in large numbers in popular spots such as MG Road, Brigade Road, Koramangala and Indira Nagar due to restrictions, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters on Thursday.Prohibitory orders banning the gathering of over four people in public places was in place in the tech hub from Thursday noon to 6am on Friday. Hotels and restaurants were allowed to function, but only till midnight. The government has already prohibited DJ dance programmes and special events at clubs, pubs and restaurants that attract people in large numbers.The Tamil Nadu government banned celebrations on roads and beaches, including the Marina Beach, till Friday. The Chennai Police will curtail movement on key roads after 10pm on Thursday. Hotels, restaurants and bars will have to close by this cut-off time.In West Bengal, chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said the state government will not impose night-time restrictions, but will take precautionary measures to prevent gatherings. “New Year celebrations are organised at a few places in West Bengal. If people abide by the Covid-19 safety protocols and cooperate with the police and administration, gatherings can be avoided,” he told news agency PTI.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curbs-in-metros-to-ensure-covid-safe-revelry/story-0d9JwqwwES6tSnFYtRXX4N.html
01-01-2021||India||FAQs about immunisation answered||How safe are vaccines?The three leading candidates have not shown any significant adverse reactions among the tens of thousands of volunteers who were vaccinated during the large-scale trials. The vaccines have been tested in healthy people and more data from those in vulnerable groups is being derived. The regulatory approval processes, in India as well as advanced markets such as the US and the UK, closely scrutinise adverse effects and a vaccine is approved only when it is safe and effective by design. Thorough checks are also in place on the production side as well as during logistics.What about the allergy reactions reported from other countries?Cases of anaphylaxis — a severe allergic shock — have been reported from a handful of people from among the close to three million people vaccinated across the world. Experts have since determined that these were because the individuals were allergic to particular ingredients in the vaccine similar to how people might have specific food allergies but be able to tolerate most other things. On December 30, UK authorities updated their advisory to say that only people with history of known allergies to any of the vaccine ingredients must exercise caution and that there is no risk for others.In India, recipients will be monitored for 30 minutes for signs of an allergic reaction, which can normally be addressed quickly.How soon can I get a vaccine?If you are a health worker or in a front line job such as police or the military, then you are among people first in line to receive a dose. After that, people above the age of 50 and those under it but with comorbid health conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 will be vaccinated. Together, these groups are expected to account for the first 300 million who will need to be given doses. The government has set a tentative target to complete this process by the summer, which means if you fall in any of these categories, you may get it in the next six months. For others, the wait may be longer and there have been talks of allowing private market sales, which could let people buy doses at market rates.Am I safe after the first shot?No. People will need to maintain precautions until they get the booster dose, since all three vaccines approved till now involve a two-dose regimen. Once both doses are given, it might take up to two weeks to build protective immunity.How long will it protect me?It is still unclear how long immunity to Sars-CoV-2 lasts, whether it is triggered by natural infection or through a vaccine. Research has shown that antibodies could last around six months, which makes chances of reinfection low. But another component of the immune system — the adaptive immunity that also includes memory cells — may remember the infection for years, as it does with coronaviruses. This, scientists estimate, can help avert a serious disease later on, even if it doesn’t stop a reinfection.Will the new variant make vaccines ineffective?The vaccines target the spike protein, which includes several of the 17 changes in a new mutation has spread widely in the UK and is believed to be more transmissible. Experts, however, say the changes are not significant enough to make the vaccines obsolete. All major vaccine developers are saying they are carrying out additional tests to determine for sure. But, even if a future variant does, the vaccines can be re-engineered quickly to fight off any new mutation that reduces their efficacy.Is one vaccine better than the other?Efficacy rates among the leading vaccines have had varying levels in clinical trials. Their early assessments also showed that some such as the mRNA platform vaccines are better than others, such as those that use the inactivated virus platform. But all of these appear to be above the 50% bar set by regulators for efficacy. In the initial phase of the roll-out, experts believe that any vaccine with an efficacy level of above 50% will help in slowing down the pandemic.How quickly can vaccines lead to herd immunity?This depends on the population of the country. As on December 30, Israel had vaccinated the most number of people per capita, with more than seven people per 100 having gotten the shot, Our World in Data statistics showed. In comparison, the per 100 people vaccination in the US, which delivered 2.13 million doses as of December 28, was a mere 0.64. For a country like India, hence, herd immunity may take longer to achieve. In the mean time, the primary objective would be to gives vaccines to those most at risk of death or hospitalisations — a cohort that largely includes people in higher age brackets and with comorbid conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faqs-about-immunisation-answered/story-OQAXjodG2oAxTuxAgPWUSI.html
01-01-2021||India||2021: Year of the shot in the Arm||For the next couple of years, the world’s most vied for commodity will not be a metal, currency, or even time; it will arrive in delicate glass vials – each with no more than 10 to 20 drops. Often, shipping it will require not only a fragile warning, but packs of dry ice and, perhaps, even security. Upon arriving at its destination, it will be delivered as a shot in the arm, each injection carrying not just a vaccine, but also an eventual way out of a pandemic that has devastated the world.As of December 31, there are three coronavirus vaccines approved in the world after due scientific process. Made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca, each drug has largely passed rigorous scrutiny to check for their safety and efficacy. At the time of this writing, a handful of countries have begun administering them to their citizens, setting the pace for what is likely to dominate 2021 – a year that will be measured not by how much of the past we leave behind, but how much of it we can go back to.The experiences in the US, the UK, and several European countries over 2020 have demonstrated that the factory-to-syringe process can throw up several challenges, and that even the most resourceful of nations can struggle with a process that can be as labyrinthine as it needs to be precise. This process involves identifying the people who need to be inoculated against the virus most urgently, ensuring that each dose is maintained at the right temperature, and requiring close follow-up to monitor for adverse reactions and then -- three or four weeks later -- bringing back vaccine recipients for a booster. The urgency of it is hastened by the threat of a new variant of the virus that threatens to accelerate the pandemic even further. FIRST-MILE CHALLENGEIn 2021, vaccine makers and their production partners have projected that they will be able to make 20 billion doses cumulatively, according to the Unicef’s Covid-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard. The number, however, is unlikely to remain at this level. Some have recently made subtractions. AstraZeneca and its partners have, for instance, pared back end-of-December projections from 400 million to a little over 100 million. At the same time, analysts expect a big bump in production later in 2021.“In the first six months, there is definitely going to be a situation where there is shortage globally; nobody can help that. We will see that easing off by August-September because you will have other vaccine manufacturers also being able to supply… Eventually everyone is going to get it; of course some countries will have to wait a little longer,” Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of Serum Institute of India, said on Tuesday. SII is manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and has contracts for several others that are further down the pipeline.According to science analytics company Airfinity, the three approved candidates together have a declared production capacity of around 4.8 billion doses by the end of 2021. The other candidates for which a large number of doses are expected this year are being developed by Novavax, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and Sanofi/GSK. Together, they have plans to produce about 4.1 billion doses, but they are yet to complete large-scale trials that the approved vaccines have. NOT JUST ABOUT DOSESBut production-line bottlenecks are still further downstream. Airfinity’s assessments also point to a possible shortage of vials and syringes that could slow down packaging and delivery, even if the inoculations are made in ample volumes. At present, roughly nine billion syringes and vials are produced annually across the world, the company’s latest assessments showed.In 2021, syringe production is expected to be expanded to a little over 12 billion, and vials to around 15.5 billion – but these numbers are still short of the expected vaccine production. Most vaccine makers are now switching to larger vials that can hold 5-10 doses to overcome part of the shortage.These problems are overtaken still by the strict temperature demands of some of these vaccines, particularly the mRNA shots developed by Moderna and Prizer-BioNTech that need to be kept frozen. The latter needs temperatures of -70 degrees C – colder than most typical cold-storage infrastructure capacities. Public health officials estimate that ultimately, up to 15% of the stocks may be lost to wastage. THE BILLION-PEOPLE QUESTIONShipping vials to destinations, however, is likely to pale in comparison to the challenge of profiling and managing millions of recipients, some of whom may need a dose sooner than others. The challenge is particularly acute in countries with large populations and geographic areas such as India.According to the Indian government’s tentative priority list, around 300 million people have been placed first in line for vaccinations. Comprising health care workers, frontline essential service workers such as police and firefighters, and people above the age of 50 (as well as those younger people with comorbid conditions), these are groups deemed most at risk of an infection or severe disease. The government hopes these groups will get a vaccine by July – meaning that should the rollout begin in January, India will need to vaccinate roughly upwards of 1.5 million people every day.“To be able to effectively reach the target population for the Covid-19 vaccination, India will need to utilise its existing national immunisation network, including the infrastructure (production, storage, transport, delivery facilities) as well as the human resources (vaccinators, supervisors, etc.). However, given the scale of the vaccination effort required for Covid-19, the effort will need to build on existing networks. This needs to be planned for, budgeted, and efforts made to put this in place ahead of a vaccine being available,” said Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health, health policy and bioethics.When, who and where are some of the most crucial questions in the vaccination arithmetic, with countries likely to follow different strategies, based on what they plan to target most with their inoculation programme. For instance, Israel, a small country with a relatively small population, has prioritised people aged over 60, health care workers, carers, and high-risk people. It also boasts, at present, the world’s fastest vaccination drive, having covered close to 8% of its population. The country’s objective is herd immunity.The UK, by comparison, is prioritising its oldest population. The country is in the grip of its worst-yet wave of infections and hospitals in many regions have surpassed their surge capacities. Its officials on Wednesday declared that they will focus on getting as many people as possible vaccinated to reduce the load on its health care system, even if that means booster shots are delayed. NATURE OF THE RACEAmong the top 10 countries with the most doses of vaccines administered by the end of 2020, eight are advanced economies. Early in December, international advocacy groups including Amnesty International, Frontline AIDS, Global Justice Now, and Oxfam, which are part of an alliance calling for a People’s Vaccine, said rich nations representing roughly 14% of the world’s population have bought up 53% of the most promising vaccines so far. Citing data from eight leading vaccine candidates in Phase 3 trials that have struck substantial deals with countries worldwide, the groups estimated that nine of 10 people are likely to not get a vaccine in 2021.“When you get into a pandemic, the normal market mechanism will take the scarce resources and only make them available to the richest countries, and the richest people in those countries,” said Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in an interview to HT in December.Gates and his organisation assist multilateral arrangements, such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in building Covax, a WHO-led initiative to pool resources to help bring vaccines to lower-middle income countries.Concerns about the inequities caused by the pandemic being perpetuated in the race to secure a vaccine have led some experts to advocate for more creative solutions. Nobel laureate economist Richard Thaler wrote in the New York Times on December 9 about letting celebrities and wealthy people jump the vaccination queue by bidding for spots at an auction. The bids, he suggested, could be used to “to redistribute money from the rich to the poor”.Such ideas found support among some bioethics academicians: “My idea is that instead of dollars, [wealthy] people should bid on sending units of vaccines to the Global South,” Peter Singer, a bioethics professor at Princeton, said at a discussion hosted by the NYT on December 24.These conversations have been taking place since much earlier in the pandemic, when experts began calling on policymakers to heed to principles of equity. “Some wealthy countries will likely end up with substantial amounts of vaccine. Over time, if all goes well, these countries will have to decide how much product they’re going to keep and how much, if any, they’re willing to share,” Johns Hopkins bioethicist Ruth Faden, a member of World Health Organization’s Covid-19 Vaccines Working Group, said during a university interview on July 1.While it remains to be seen if this will come true, some encouraging signs came in December when Canada – which has secured the most per capita doses – announced it will consider giving away its excess doses.GROWING THREATThe discovery of a new variant in the UK, which has grown rapidly in parts of the country and accelerated the outbreak, is quickly becoming a cause for concern. Scientists are racing to uncover more about its biology and what it means for the pandemic, but early indications suggest it is yet more capable of infecting people, and possibly even infecting groups (children) that were largely protected till now.While the variant does not seem to be making the current vaccine options obsolete, it will likely make the dash for doses more intense. “The emergence of this mutant definitely reinforces the importance of vaccinating as many people as fast as possible with Covid vaccines, and to be vigilant about mask wearing and social distancing,” wrote Shane Crotty, a professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology.The start of 2021 and much of its first few months could, thus, revolve around these problems. The conversation will at first be dominated by how well, or badly, countries are able to speed up vaccine delivery. Along with it is likely to run a debate on who should be first in line to get a dose and the complex moral calculus of such decisions.But what may turn out to be the most watched aspect is how well, and how long, vaccines will really protect us – and whether this will be enough to stay ahead of an evolving pathogen.

01-01-2021||India||Farmers’ protest: Barricades broken, police fire tear gas in Rajasthan||The Haryana Police on Thursday lathicharged farmers and fired tear gas shells after a group broke barricades at Shahjahanpur in Rajasthan in their attempt to march towards the national capital.Hundreds of farmers, mainly from Rajasthan and Haryana, have been agitating at the Shahjahanpur border in Alwar district against three contentious farm bills that they say will hurt them. Tensions flared up on Thursday as some of them on tractor-trailers tried to force their way into neighbouring Haryana. As the group pressed forward and removed barricades on the Jaipur-Delhi National Highway, the Haryana Police tried to stop them using a water cannon and tear gas even as their leaders urged them not go towards the national capital.“Haryana police used mild force on agitating farmers and also fired half-a-dozen tear gas shells when farmers tried to enter Haryana,” Bhiwadi superintendent of police Ram Murti Joshi said.While farmers on around 25 tractor-trailers pushed past the Haryana Police barriers, others stayed behind on the Rajasthan side, police said, according to news agency PTI. It reported that farmer leaders at the site made it clear that the protesters who forced their way into Haryana did not have their consent.Read more| Farmers to welcome New Year at Singhu as protest continues | 10 points“Haryana Police detained nearly 200 farmers seated on tractor trolleys,” Joshi added. Rewari superintendent of police Abhishek Jorwal told PTI over the phone that there were some young people “who came with tractors and broke through the barricades”. “We tried to stop them and gently persuade them. However, they were very aggressive and turned violent. They were not even listening to farmer leaders,” he added.Another police officer said the group became violent and at least one of them tried to drive his tractor in a reckless manner, endangering lives of police personnel and some others who tried to stop it.Meanwhile, farmers’ leaders at Shahjahanpur called for peace in the agitation.“We are sitting here peacefully and asking our members not to resort to violence,” Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said. “We have sent some of our members to talk to those who entered Haryana to convince them to return,” Jat added.Nagaur parliamentarian Hanuman Beniwal, whose Rashtriya Loktantrik Party quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on December 26 over the new farm laws, said it was done by some “overexcited youngsters”.“Delhi march is not that important because we want to get the issue resolved through dialogue with the government,” he said.Thousands of farmers across the country are protesting against the laws. A large group, mostly comprising those from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at key border points near Delhi since November-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-barricades-broken-police-fire-tear-gas-in-rajasthan/story-U0F3davmqDExuSbc9AM8kO.html
01-01-2021||India||Row intensifies over Srinagar encounter||Normal life was affected in parts of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Thursday as shops and business establishments were closed to protest the killings of three alleged terrorists in an operation on the outskirts of Srinagar on Wednesday. Police said mobile internet services have been suspended in Pulwama and Shopian districts to prevent any untoward incident. “The situation remained calm in the districts. There were no restrictions though the internet was suspended,” a police official said.According to the police, army troops and men of Central Reserve Police Force and Jammu and Kashmir police launched a cordon-and-search operation in the Lawaypora area on Tuesday evening following a tip-off about the presence of terrorists in the area. “The operation was launched last evening after getting inputs that terrorists were inside a house close to the national highway. They were asked to surrender. However, they responded with firing and the operation was suspended for the night and when it resumed again in the morning, they were again asked to surrender. However they started firing again and hurled grenades,” General Officer Commanding of the Kilo Force, H S Sahi, said on Wednesday. The three men were killed in retaliatory fire, he added.However,families of the three slain men identified them as Zubair Ahmad of Turkawangam, Shopian; and Ajaz Maqbool and Athar Mushtaq of Putrigam, Pulwama. They said that the men were students and alleged that they were picked up and then killed by security forces. Former Jammu Kashmir chief minister and People’s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti met the families of the three deceased and shared a letter by the family of Ajaz seeking his body and an inquiry into his death. “Met families of the young men killed in Lawaypora encounter. Forget justice, even their dead bodies are not being returned to them for the last rites. They have lost their beloved sons forever & in the midst of grief have to plead even for closure,” she posted on Twitter with copies of the letter.“The deceased was not remotely connected with any anti national activities and the question of joining militancy does not arise…The killing is very brutal and calculated one which is against the law of land and also hits the democracy and Indian constitution,” the letter by the family stated.The police have asserted that while the three were not mentioned in their list of terrorists, two of them were “hardcore associates of terrorists (OGWs)”.“Pertinently, one of the two is a relative of top HM commander Rayees Kachroo who was killed in 2017. Reportedly, the third might have joined very recently. Generally parents don’t have an idea about the activities of their wards. Several OGWs after committing terror crimes like grenade throwing & pistol shooting etc stay normally with their family,” police said in a statement. Other mainstream CPI(M) leader M.Y Tarigami wanted a probe by a sitting judge. “There are unverified reports that they were killed in a fake encounter. If true, this is shocking and must be probed by a sitting High Court judge. The circumstances in which the killings happened need to be thoroughly probed,” he said.Apni Party President Syed Altaf Bukhari also expressed concern saying that the claims by families have created misgivings about the veracity of Srinagar encounter.“The version of families of the slain trio is contradictory to what the army and the police claim about the Hokersar encounter. So the government must clear the air and remove the misgivings about the same,” he told a local news agency.Separatist Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said that said that such killings are heart wrenching ad demand a probe. “Such incidents warrant a fair and impartial probe be held , as the families of the killed youth are demanding , to get to the truth but in Kashmir this basic right to justice and redressal is a distant dream ,” it said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-intensifies-over-srinagar-encounter/story-ofLaIbMZKcHp9cXkNkKE8I.html
01-01-2021||India||Two months after CM Jagan Reddy’s complaint, Andhra Pradesh chief justice transferred||The Union government on Thursday cleared the transfer of Andhra Pradesh high court chief justice Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari to the Sikkim high court as its new chief justice in a direct swap with justice Arup Kumar Goswami, who moves from Sikkim to Andhra Pradesh. The notifications were issued by the law ministry after recommendations made by the Supreme Court Collegium on December 14, when its meeting was chaired by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, and attended by the next two most senior judges, justices NV Ramana and Rohinton Nariman. The development comes after an unprecedented row between the high court and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the state judiciary of stalling all the policy decisions of his government. After months of friction, the tussle reached a flashpoint in September when the high court issued a gag order against the media from reporting the contents of a first information report (FIR) in an land scandal in Amaravati, allegedly involving former advocate general Dammalapati Srinivas and the daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge, justice NV Ramana. In October, CM Reddy wrote a letter to CJI Bobde, complaining that justice Ramana was trying to influence cases in the high court to destabilise his government. This letter was released to the media by Reddy’s principal advisor Ajeya Kallam at a press conference. On an appeal by the state government, the Supreme Court on November 25 lifted the gag order on reporting the FIR, while a bunch of petitions asking for action against CM Reddy for his remarks against justice Ramana in the letter were dismissed by the top court on December 1. On December 30, justice Rakesh Kumar’s bench in the Andhra Pradesh high court said that the transfer of chief justices would delay proceedings in the three-capitals case and a pending Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cases against Reddy, giving him an “undue advantage”. The scathing comments by the judge came when the state government sought his recusal from a case. Justice Kumar retired on Friday. The law ministry has also notified transfer of Telangana high court chief Justice RS Chauhan as the new chief justice of the Uttarakhand cigh court. Chief justice Mohammad Rafiq, who was at the Orissa high court, was appointed as the Madhya Pradesh high court’s chief justice. The high courts of Telangana and Orissa will now be led by two judges from different high courts whose elevations were also notified on Friday -- justices Hima Kohli and S Muralidhar respectively.Justice Sanjib Banerjee, a judge of the Calcutta high court, has been appointed as the new chief justice of the Madras High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-months-after-cm-jagan-reddy-s-complaint-andhra-pradesh-chief-justice-transferred/story-6Z6RDCVxSYqj8lnC8SzG5N.html

According to people aware of the matter, more inductions—including of RSS functionaries —into the BJP’s national team are expected in the coming weeks. According to a party leader who requested anonymity, these changes are in line with the process of building a new team and strengthening the party’s presence across states. Joint general secretary (organisation) Saudan Singh was appointed as a vice president in the national team and will oversee the party’s work in Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pravesh,the party said on Thursday. Singh will take over the party’s work in Punjab and Haryana at a time when the ongoing farmers agitation is at its peak in the two states.Farmers’ unions in Punjab and Haryana are demanding the repeal of a set of contentious laws enacted in September to open up agricultural markets, which say would weaken the bargaining power of cultivators and put them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.V Satish, also a joint general secretary (organisation), has been given a new title; he will now be a Sanghathak (organiser). Satish, who was earlier in charge of states such as Madhay Pradesh, has been given charge of parliamentary office coordination, scheduled caste/scheduled tribe morcha coordination and Vishesh Sampark, or special outreach. Shiv Prakash, a third joint general secretary (organisation), has been given charge of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He retains the responsibility of looking after the party’s affairs in election-bound West Bengal, where the party is preparing for a tough contest against the ruling Trinamool Congress. “More names will be added to the national team as there are vacancies in several states including Uttar Pradesh that goes to polls in 2022; in Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand,” said a functionary aware of the details. In September, Nadda announced a new national team that had 12 vice presidents, eight general secretaries, three national joint secretaries and 13 secretaries apart from 23 spokespersons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-rejigs-bjp-s-national-team-to-boost-party-presence/story-KV2oCiVNFcOMZpeoUv3GtL.html
01-01-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||If 2020 was the year of the virus, then 2021 will be, aptly enough, the year of the vaccine. If we hadn’t ended the year with a vaccine — fortunately, we have, and not just one but a handful; and one may well be approved in India on January 1 — 2021 would have been the year of the mutant strain, which makes it sound like what 2020 really was, a pulp horror novel. But 2020 wasn’t merely the year of the virus.It was the year of the health care worker. Through the year, around the world, doctors, nurses, paramedics and other health care givers worked around the clock, putting themselves at risk, displaying physical, mental, and emotional stamina of the kind that the world hasn’t seen in decades.It was the year of the scientist and the researcher, the data scientist and the epidemiologist. Never in history have so many scientists and researchers around the world worked towards the same two objectives as they did in 2020: understanding the virus that caused Covid-19 better; and finding a cure or a vaccine for it. What do we have to show for it? Tens of thousands of research studies, a very clear understanding of the virus and how it attacks the human body, several successful vaccines, and a few drugs that work.It was the year of the home. It became the office and the school, the gymnasium and the restaurant, and it became, at once, both a sanctuary and a prison.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 pandemicIt was the year of the screen, the year of the Zoom background; the year of baking and family meals.It was, for people like my parents who are pretty much stuck in Chennai and can’t even meet friends and relatives because they are in the most vulnerable age group, the year of loneliness and fear (neither of which can be assuaged by any amount of video-calling).It was, for those among us who lost family and friends to the viral disease, a year of pain and sorrow, and a grieving process that seemed all too inadequate.For me, it was also a year of writing — thanks to this column, I wrote more than I have in years (although probably just as much as I usually rewrite in a couple of months).But for many others, definitely less privileged than anyone reading this column, 2020 was something else.For some, it was the year that pushed them back into a life they thought they had left behind; many may have neither the will nor the means to do it all over again.For some poor students who saw education as a way out of their situation, it was the year that ended their dreams. Many will drop out; some already have, forced to do so either because of their financial circumstances or the inability to follow classes online.And for some who left home to pursue their dreams elsewhere, it was a year that reminded them just how little they mattered — to the people and establishments they worked for; to the cities and neighbourhoods they lived in; even to governments that are expected to look out for everyone.Read more| India will have Covid-19 vaccine within days: AIIMS directorAnd so, even as economists speak of 2021 being the year of the great rebound, and CEOs wax eloquent in investor briefings about how their companies have become more efficient and are on the path to profitability, and the rest of us simply treat 2020 like what it really is for the privileged — a Formula 1 pitstop — it is important to make sure that in this new year, all of us, individuals, companies, governments, do all we can for those whose lives have been ravaged by the year gone by.They need opportunities; they need understanding; they need the playing field to be levelled; and, they need someone who can help them hold on to their dreams.Happy New Year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-2lPqiZ5Y0fneRgbiwdQApK.html
01-01-2021||India||2021 brings hope, ready for largest vaccine drive: PM Modi||Massive preparations are underway in India for the launch of the world’s largest vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday amid growing indications that the country’s drug regulators would soon approve the first vaccine for a roll-out in the coming days.Modi said the end of a pandemic-ravaged 2020 had brought with it a new hope, and urged citizens to unite in the vaccination effort in 2021 the same way as they did to reduce infections in the past year.“For vaccines, every preparation needed is underway. Efforts to get vaccines being made in India to the population that need it the most are being done. India is carrying out major efforts to pull off the world’s largest immunisation drive,” the PM said, inaugurating a new All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Rajkot, Gujarat, over video link from New Delhi. “In 2020, there was an atmosphere of disappointment and dismay due to the infection. There were doubts everywhere. But 2021 is coming up with a ray of hope in terms of its treatment,” Modi said.He described the battle against the coronavirus disease as a fight against “an unknown enemy” and urged the people to not believe in rumours, behave “as responsible citizens,” and “refrain from forwarding messages on social media without checking”.The Prime Minister also said the last day of year was one to “remember India’s millions of doctors, health warriors, sanitation workers, those working in drug stores, and other frontline corona warriors”.Read more| Elaborate distribution plan on track as India awaits vaccine approvalThree vaccines are being assessed for emergency approval by the Central Drugs Standard and Control Organisation (CDSCO). These are the vaccine candidates developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, which was the first approved anywhere in the world after clinical trials; Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Oxford University-AstraZeneca candidate, which is believed to be the one with the most doses available at the earliest; and one developed by Bharat Biotech International Limited,a completely made-in-India antidote. According to officials in the government who asked not to be named, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate has emerged as the front-runner for receiving regulatory approval, particularly because it had been green-lighted by the drug regulator in the UK on Wednesday.  Rolling out whichever vaccine is approved will be a challenging task – the government has targeted reaching 300 million people by July, which means over 1.5 million will need to be inoculated on an average every day beginning January. “…This year showed that when India unites, it can effectively cope with the most difficult crisis. India is in a much better position as a result of the effective steps and India’s record of saving victims of Corona has been much better than other countries,” Modi said.Later in the day, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan presided over a high-level meeting, directing states to gear up for the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out. The government also decided to carry out a drill for vaccinations across the country on January 2, replicating the dry runs held in seven districts in the last week. “The activity is proposed to be conducted in all state capitals in at least three session sites; some states will also include districts that are situated in difficult terrain or areas that have poor logistical support…,” said the ministry of health and family welfare in a statement. Read more| 11 foreigners test positive for Covid-19 in Jamshedpur amid scare over mutant variantAccording to the health ministry, the main objective of the dry run is to assess the operational feasibility of the Co-WIN application, the digital platform that will form the backbone of vaccination management. The linkages between planning and implementation will also be tested at a large scale, and issues that may lead to challenges during the actual roll-out will be identified. “The plan is all finalised, which is why dry runs are being conducted to see how it works on the ground. The pilot run helped us identify certain weak spots that are being sorted out, and now the same exercise will be conducted across the country,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.Overall, the vaccination process will include profiling and schedule management of several groups of people. These include 100 million health care workers (who are divided into nine categories), frontline workers such as police and military personnel, disaster management volunteers and municipal workers, and members of the general public most at risk from the virus. The last group includes the largest numbers, about 270 million. Of these, 260 million are people above the age of 50 who have been categorised as a priority group. The remaining 10 million are expected to be people who are younger but with comorbid conditions associated with a greater risk of disease or mortality. According to the Centre’s Covid vaccine operational guidelines, the age of a recipient for vaccination will be considered as of January 1, 2021. Anyone born on or before January 1,1971 will fall under this category, and high- risk population group will be further sub-categorised into various age groups with priority to senior citizens above 60 years of age.The latest electoral rolls for Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly election will be used to identify the population aged 50 years or above.The Prime Minister also praised the efforts of the Gujarat government in containing the coronavirus outbreak, and spoke on his government’s initiatives in the medical education sector. “We are working on mission mode to improve medical education in India. After the formation of National Medical Commission, the quality and quantity of health education will improve,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2021-brings-hope-ready-for-largest-vaccine-drive-pm-modi/story-MTAYQWonLKyX2OxqAGrDqJ.html
01-01-2021||India||Kerala passes resolution against farm laws||A unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala assembly on Thursday against three contentious laws passed by the Centre to open up agricultural markets received support from an unexpected quarter -- the lone Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of the House.O Rajagopal, 91, who was minister of state for railways in the Atal Bihari Vajapyee government, opposed the resolution initially, but when it was put to voice vote, he did not walk out and supported it, much to the surprise of both the treasury and opposition benches. After the session, when reporters asked him about his support for the resolution, he said he backed it in accordance with the “democratic spirit of the house.” “I raised my disagreement in clear terms. But I supported the substance of the resolution in accordance with the democratic spirit. Nothing big about it, in democracy, such compromises are common,” he said, expressing the hope that the farmers’ agitation against the farm laws will be settled soon amicably. When asked specifically whether he wanted the bills to be withdrawn, he said that was why he had supported the resolution. After his stand triggered a controversy in the BJP, he said it was wrong to say he did not oppose the resolution and blamed the speaker for not seeking a a division of votes in the house.The veteran’s ambiguous stand has put the BJP, which had described the resolution as “a mere waste of time and money,” in an awkward position.Read more| Lone BJP MLA backs resolution passed by Kerala Assembly against farm laws “There is no difference of opinion in the party. He is a senior leader and we didn’t think he will support the resolution. I will talk to him about this,” said the party’s state president K Surendran. In Delhi, minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, who belongs to Kerala, said he was not aware what the senior leader said in the house, adding that the state unit will explain it. BJP leaders close to Rajagopal said he was unhappy with a growing factional feud in the state unit of the party. After the elevation of Surendran, some senior leaders in the state unit were sidelined and the party’s attempt to broker peace between two prominent factions, one led by Muraleedharan and the other by P K Krishnadas, hasn’t yielded results. “His position literally shocked the party. The central leadership is also unhappy with it,” said one party leader, who did not want to be identified. It wasn’t the first time that Rajagopal had courted controversy. When the speaker was elected election in 2016, he supported the ruling Left Democratic Front’s nominee, P Sreeramakrishnan. He said he had backed Sreeramakrishnan because his name contains the names of both Ram and Krishna. Many Left leaders praised Rajagopal. “He took the right decision unmindful of its consequences,” said state finance minister Thomas Issac. Earlier in the day, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan introduced the resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the new laws and heed the demands of farmers who have massed on Delhi’s borders to protest against the legislation. “The Centre wants to corporatize the farm sector. It must come forward to allay farmers’ fears. The entire country is with them. It should recognise public sentiments and withdraw the new laws,” Vijayan saidAll 140 members of the assembly supported his resolution. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-passes-resolution-against-farm-laws/story-m9BxvQCHlGAgFhSyGiOJYL.html

This time around, Singh has come to Delhi’s Singhu border with his cousins to participate in the protest by farmers against the three new farm laws.“What is happening here is more important than being with our family or friends as a new year begins. The three farm laws are a direct attack on our livelihood and we have to fight for it,” he said as his cousin Yash Deep, 23, nodded in agreement.“Most of the youngsters in our village either go on a vacation or spend time with family and friends on New Year’s eve. This time, so many of them have opted to be here instead,” he said.Singh and his cousins are among the thousands of farmers who chose to remain camped at the capital’s four borders on Thursday to demand a repeal of the three farm laws passed by the Centre even as minimum temperatures dipped to 3.3 degree Celsius on Thursday morning-- the lowest this season.Read more| Farmers to welcome New Year at Singhu as protest continues | 10 pointsKuldeep Kaur, 54, who owns a boutique in Mohali, is among the protesters who have chosen to begin their new year by doing ‘seva’ at the protest site. “When we came here a few weeks ago, we realized the farmers needed help with fixing their torn clothes or other cloth items. This is why I came here with two of my employees to help them. Back home, we would have engaged in ‘ardas’ or prayers to welcome the new year. We will do the same here,” she said.On December 26, farmers had invited residents of Delhi-NCR to join them to welcome the New Year.From stitching clothes to preparing langars of kheer, halwa, jalebi, pizza, and kadhi chawal, hundreds of protesters at Singhu continued with their agitation like any other day on Thursday.Mohan Singh, 63, a school principal from Mohali, said, “We don’t want to celebrate the new year till the farm laws are repealed because more than 40 farmer brothers have died during this agitation. While every year, we welcomed the new year in celebration, this year will be marked by their remembrance.” Protesters also engaged in a plantation drive and planted 10 saplings on the road divider at the Singhu border.“People here should remember this once in a lifetime agitation and that is why we planted saplings to mark the beginning of the new year,” said Bhavjeet Singh, an IT professional who started the Tractor2Twitter campaign supporting the farmers’ agitation.Read more| ‘Won’t withdraw protest’: Farmers stick to resolve as talks yield little progressNot just farmers but people from several parts of Delhi joined the demonstration on Thursday including students from Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi University, and JNU.“Last year, we had welcomed the new year at our university during the anti-CAA protests with songs of resistance and revolution. We felt it was important to lend the same support to the farmers movement as they too have been fighting against state oppression,” said Huzaifa Khan, who recently graduated from Jamia and was present during the anti-CAA agitation last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/many-skip-celebrations-to-join-farmers-in-protest-to-ring-in-the-new-year/story-Qy62WHP8f2liWGKzu7O1kK.html
01-01-2021||Today's||Farm to factory: Small farmers need second source of income||In farming, size matters. 70% of India’s farmers have small and marginal land holdings, operating below one hectare. On an average, smaller holdings lose money as their household costs are higher than their earnings.According to the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), the average income of farmers owning up to two hectares is Rs 5,240 a month. The smallest farms are afloat since they don’t pay for labour, relying entirely on the family, and they consume much of what is produced.A proposed amendment in the three central farm laws may lead to reforms in the agriculture sector but with small farming, a second employment option is a must for marginal farmers and farm labourers. Farming is a seasonal affair, not a full-time job so the second job option is mostly required by small, marginal farmers and farm labourers in nearby areas. Industrial investment should be encouraged in rural and backward areas by offering special incentives.Farm to factory is the need of the hour. Apart from part-time seasonal farming, a small farmer and a farm labourer have sufficient time to work and can earn Rs 12,000-Rs 15,000 a month easily after eight hours of labour in a nearby factory. This can ensure an additional income to minimise the dependency on the sole agriculture-based income.Of the 8,000 workers at the Sonalika plant in Hoshiarpur, 90% are marginal farmers and farm labourers of nearby villages. This model of linking industry with employment for marginal farmers and farm labourers can be amplified pan-India, particularly in the backward areas. It would be the real execution of sab ka saath, sab ka vikas (progress for all), covering more than 60% of the population of the country residing in rural and backward areas.DISAFFECTED YOUNGSTERS PREFER TO MOVE OUTFundamentally, India must figure out a way to provide meaningful employment to people outside agriculture. Failing to do so means not just a failure of human development but also underemployment and disaffected youngsters, particularly children of farmers, who want to emigrate to Canada or other places because there are no jobs. Small farming is not so lucrative and the younger generation does not want to follow in their parent’s footsteps, which pushes them to work in cities. Unfortunately, urban areas, while offering more opportunities, also relegate many to low earning jobs. While working in cities, the earning and expenses of rural youngsters are at par, their net income is negligible to help out their families in villages. So, it is not lucrative for them to work in cities far from their native villages.A realistic hope is the promotion of new industrial investment with a special incentive in backward areas to provide new jobs to rural India.Though economic liberalisation in 1991, has paved the path of globalisation and foreign direct investment (FDI) in India but before this liberalisation, the central government preferred to issue conditional licences and incentives to promote the industry in rural and backward areas only. Delicensing of the industry also lost the crucial aspect of locating industry in rural or distressed backward area growth. In 30 years, industrial growth has shifted from rural or backward areas to crowded industrial areas in cities. As earlier, licensing and incentives were higher for industrial investments in rural and backward areas. In the 1970s, JCT, Hawkins cookware and Mahavir spinning mills had invested in Hoshiarpur, the most backward area of Punjab, because of licensing terms and special incentives offered by the central government.INCENTIVISE INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT IN VILLAGESAs a relief under the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre has introduced production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes of Rs 1.96 lakh crore, but they will not attract industrial investment in rural and backward areas. Before this, the government codified 29 central labour laws into four codes but none of these policies are sufficient to attract industrial investment in rural and backward areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atmanirbhar philosophy of development has to be applied to provide special incentive to industrial investment in rural and backward areas. To increase export from these areas, 50% relaxation in railway freight as freight subsidy can be provided from dry ports such as Delhi and Ludhiana. As of now, most industrial investments are being attracted by southern states near seaports but for Make in India and self-reliance, employment generation in rural and backward areas needs to be incentivised.Special incentives are being offered to develop industrial corridors and clusters but this model should be replicated in the rural and backward areas to provide job opportunities to nearby small and marginal farmers and farm labourers. The traditional models of job generation have to be re-evaluated. A distributed, micro-level factory that can produce solopreneurs and micro-enterprises has to be created and supported in the rural areas. For instance, processing and packaging of vegetables for sale in urban malls can be a micro-enterprise that may not need high capital investment but will be labour-intensive at the block level in the backward areas.Providing jobs to small, marginal farmers and farm labourers in nearby areas will minimise the rural-to-urban migration. On ground reforms in the agriculture sector through central amended laws will take more time but it is time for a policy and framework to promote industrial investment in rural and backward areas as a job engine for small, marginal farmers and farm labourers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/farm-to-factory-small-farmersneed-second-source-of-income/story-sy9JxnUHcP0kMmhCUMw6dP.html
01-01-2021||Editorials||The vaccine clearance brings hope to 2021||January 1, 2021, gave Indians reason for cheer. A committee of experts recommended to the country’s drug regulator on Friday that it approve the vaccine developed by University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, and made locally by Serum Institute of India, clearing the main hurdle before the country receives its first coronavirus vaccine. Once approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), which is expected to heed the committee’s advice, the vaccine will become India’s primary weapon to tackle the coronavirus. In coming months, India will carry out a long and painstaking process to give the country the immunocapital it needs, starting with 300 million identified as those who need it most urgently. A labyrinthine infrastructure has been rapidly readied by building on a decades-old one that at present reaches 27 million newborns a year for life-saving inoculations, but how well it copes with the pressure will only become clear when the first big volumes of vaccines arrive from the factories.In the 10 months since Covid-19 emerged in India , 10.2 million people have been infected. This is the second-largest number of infections in the world. In terms of deaths, the country has seen the third highest number of fatalities. But these grim statistics hide the fact there are also indicators in which India fares better than many others: It ranks 98 in terms of fatalities per million population, and in infections per capita, the country is not among the top 100. Helped by its younger population, the country’s case-fatality ratio of 1.48% compares well with the global average of 2.2% . In terms of tests in relation to epidemic size, India surpasses the 10-30 tests per confirmed case benchmark set by the World Health Organization as representative of adequate testing. While in absolute terms, these numbers could still be improved, they reflect an ability to scale-up crucial public health preparations. Over the last few weeks, central officials have drawn up detailed roadmaps for the factory-to-syringe process, while grassroots administrative workers are identifying those who need to be first in line. The country has erected a digital backbone for vaccine administration, and demarcated points for delivery and distribution. Local clinics are being turned into vaccination centres, and frontline health workers are being trained to administer doses and watch for any adverse reactions. Together, these preparations and gains achieved in testing and containment in the past year give reason for hope — hope that India will rise to the challenge of what will be the world’s largest vaccination drive. And at the start of any difficult mission, it is important to believe that we can make it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-vaccine-clearance-brings-hope-to-2021/story-g0XQtAFei6dhz8T75YWbQL.html
01-01-2021||Editorials||To deal with an aggressive China, its opponents must hang together||China’s year of wolf warrior diplomacy is ending with a spate of sanctions. Beijing informally suspended visas for all Indians in September. Australia has been publicly battered, with China imposing barriers/bans on billions of dollars of exports. The world should not be surprised. China imposed similar sanctions against Japan and South Korea in the form of a rare earths ban and the expulsion of a retail chain. Go further back, and the Dragon’s tactics include European countries, Mongolia, and The Philippines. Trade spats are a common across the world, but Beijing’s actions are imposed in retaliation to sovereign political or strategic decisions. China was not responding to someone else’s trade actions, it flexed economic muscle to force another country to kowtow on an aspect of foreign policy. China’s return on investment on these moves is mixed, but it is unlikely to change tack. Ultimately, Beijing carries out such policies because it faces no retaliation. If the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is to develop some heft, it should consider how its members can assist each other in diversifying away from the Chinese market as well as softening the damage caused by Chinese trade sanctions. The Japan-led Supply Chain Resilience Initiative is a step in the right direction. That China’s blockade of Australian coal has led to hundreds of Indian sailors being stranded in China is a reminder that its opponents need to band together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/to-deal-with-an-aggressive-china-its-opponents-must-hang-together/story-G5j9kdVsuHLszzBX3vv6rN.html
01-01-2021||Editorials||The government and farmers’ dialogue is good news||The sixth round of talks between the Centre and protesting farm unions has resulted in substantial progress: The dialogue process has been restored, ending a month-long, politically challenging impasse; the government has acceded to two of the four main demands of farmers; and both sides have agreed to meet again on January 4. Moreover, the government was wise to convince the unions to discuss the easier issues first. The Centre promptly agreed to spare farmers heavy fines for pollution-causing crop-residue burning and also acceded to the demand that the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020, should not impact farmers. The farmers had opposed a provision in the bill to switch them to direct-cash transfer instead of subsided power for agricultural use, which they argued would increase irrigation costs. The onus is on the government now to devise cash incentives so that farmers can dispose of crop remnants in an environment-friendly way. The trickiest two demands — a repeal of the new three farm laws, and a legislation guaranteeing minimum support prices (MSPs) for 23 farm commodities — have been deferred until January 4. The fate of the talks and their outcome hinges on these two issues. There are big hurdles still to be crossed. The government is unlikely to repeal the three laws that ease restrictions on farm trade by creating free markets. Farmers say these laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The government rightly offered to have a committee examine the laws again, which was rejected. The other demand is for a law banning sale of any farm produce below federally- fixed MSPs even to private traders. In Wednesday’s talks, the government suggested a committee to examine this demand because of its larger economic consequences. The farmers rejected this proposal too. The challenge is that if MSPs is made compulsory for even private traders, then it is sure to upend the normal market mechanisms of demand and supply, the immutable factors that decide price of any commodity. It could push up inflation and make agri-exports non-competitive, necessitating even more subsidies. Moreover, if buying at MSPs isn’t profitable for traders, they will simply exit the market rather than face penal action. This demand, therefore, isn’t amenable to a simple yes or no answer. It is difficult to predict what will happen as the talks progress, but a start has finally been made. And one larger lesson is that if the government had adopted a more consultative approach since the inception of the laws, the big farm crisis may have been avoided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-government-and-farmers-dialogue-is-good-news/story-K1iewdi6P8FEjkKgs9Mr1I.html
