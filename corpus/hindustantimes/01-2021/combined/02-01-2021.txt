Covid-19 was originally thought to be a respiratory infection. However, as the pandemic progressed, it became clear that this infection threatens other organs of the body as well, including the heart, brain and kidneys. The effect of Covid-19 on the heart was initially thought to occur in patients with pre-existing heart diseases, old age, obesity, diabetes or any long-term medical condition. But as the disease spread, many patients with no previous medical history showed features of cardiac damage. As many as one in four hospitalised patients showed signs of myocardial injury or injury to the heart tissue related to Covid-19. Covid-19 damages the heart both directly and indirectly. Direct cardiac injury occurs due to viral invasion of heart cells leading to cell inflammation called myocarditis. This inflammation may vary from a mild form to a severe fulminant type which can result in decreased heart function, abnormal rhythms and risk of sudden cardiac death. Indirectly, Covid-19 infection is seen to increase clots in arteries supplying the heart, inflammation of blood vessels and a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand by heart cells. All these reactions can result in features of acute heart attack and heart failure. With treatment and timely intervention, these conditions can be controlled. What has recently been identified is that many patients who had mild disease or did not require hospitalisation are now presenting with cardiac symptoms. Anticipating, that the cardiac sequelae may be as debilitating as the rest of the Covid-19, a Covid Cardiac Care task force was formed at our facility. We found a growing population of individuals who recovered from this infection came with a wide range of symptoms like palpitations, heart racing, shortness of breath, fatigue on exertion and dizziness. A pilot study is underway where we are evaluating and following up patients who are experiencing persistent or new cardiac symptoms after weeks of testing negative for Covid-19. Out of the current 100 patients, 40% have no past medical risk factor such as diabetes, hypertension or obesity. Patients now presenting with cardiac symptoms are in all age groups, from 29 to 70 years. Once all alternative causes for these symptoms are ruled out such as lung consolidation or lung fibrosis, patients undergo a concise and focused cardiac work-up. They undergo blood tests for cardiac biomarkers, an electrocardiogram and echocardiography with strain study to look for evidence of cardiac damage or dysfunction. This cardiac work-up has shown that many such patients have developed cardiac injury due to Covid-19 illness. Even patients after testing negative for the virus have underlying cardiac injury, which is now producing symptoms much after recovery. The extent of cardiac injury is seen to be independent of the individual’s past medical history and health and more dependent on viral inoculum and virulence. There is currently no way to predict who is at risk of developing these cardiac abnormalities. Once a patient is detected to have Covid-19-related cardiac injury, he or she is started on cardio-protective medications to maintain a steady healthy heart rate and minimise inflammation. The role of blood thinners is still not clear. Managing such patients requires careful examination, ruling out all alternative diagnosis and planning rehabilitation. Patients who have recovered from acute Covid illness are advised to eat a healthy balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It would seem that the recovery process from Covid-19 exists on a continuum early in the course of acute Covid-19. Management is focused on detecting and treating acute Covid-19 related complications while after recovery from the acute phase, people require management and evaluation of persistent or new symptoms.RR Kasliwal is adjunct professor of cardiology, Medanta Heart Institute The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/post-covid-19-cardiac-health-management-is-vital/story-A5icvUjIl1uYRoK7urZjfP.html

However, it has not affected the sales of Christmas cakes and goodies baked by the inmates of the Thane Central Jail.The jail authorities have sold cakes worth ₹5.22 lakh in the last seven days of December, which is more than the sales of the last two years. The goodies were baked by 15 inmates with the help of nutritionists and sold to different jails, government offices and organisations across the state.The Thane Central Jail has a bakery unit operated with the help of Nisha Naik, a nutritionist and bakery instructor. The Thane bakery unit this year had sold 28,122 cup cakes earning ₹2,10,840 and 1,917 sponge cakes earning ₹3,11,991. The jail earned a total revenue of ₹5,22,831 on Christmas goodies.Harshad Ahirrao, superintendent of police, Thane Central Jail, said, “We started getting orders from December 1. As we had to deliver the products on Christmas, the work for making them started on December 18 and till December 25 we completed all the orders. The earning of ₹5.22 lakh was in seven days. Also, the sale was better than the last few years as we maintain good quality and taste, as per the review of those who buy the goodies regularly. The sale has improved only through word-of-mouth,” added Ahirrao.The cakes were sent as per order to Arthur Road jail, Taloja Jail, Thane Central Jail, Byculla women and men jail and Kalyan Aadharwadi jail.

02-01-2021||Noida||Noida: No contact of patient with new strain of Covid-19 found positive||NOIDA: The test reports of three primary and 28 secondary contacts of the 33-year-old woman, who was found positive for the new strain of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, have confirmed that none of them has been infected so far. However, as a precautionary measure, all of them have been asked to be under quarantine at home, said officials.Gautam Buddha Nagar’s chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said the three primary contacts of the woman were administered the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), considered the golden standard for testing for Covid-19. After their reports came negative, RT-PCR tests were conducted on the 28 secondary contacts, identified through surveillance. “All of them have been found negative. The three primary contacts of the patient, including two family members and one domestic helper, were also tested via RT-PCR and their results came out negative,” he said. He added that ever since the new variant, referred to as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01), was detected in India in early December last year, the district administration has identified as many as 260 people who had returned from the UK after December 8 – the new strain is said to have first been detected in the UK. “While 189 of them had been tested with the RT-PCR method, the remaining 71 are either on vacation or have permanently shifted to other places in the country. We’ve cross-notified them to their present locations, based on telephonic conversations with them,” he said. The CMO also said that only two out of the 189 were found positive for Covid-19 through the RT-PCT testing method. For confirmation of the presence of the new variant among positive patients, samples of both patients were sent for genomic sequencing to the Indian Council of Medical research’s (ICMR) laboratory in Delhi. While the ICMR reports confirmed the 33-year-old woman case on Tuesday, the other – a 28-year woman from Greater Noida – was found negative for the new strain,” Dr Ohri said. Meanwhile, Covid-dedicated healthcare facilities in the district have started making arrangements to accommodate patients infected with the new variant, if any. While the administration has prepared an international traveller ward at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), the Sharda Hospital has readied a 30-bed ward for patients of the new strain.Dr Saurabh Srivastava, the head of the Covid-19 ward at GIMS, said the hospital is ready to tackle any critical situation. “The condition of the patient infected with the new strain is quite under control. We believe in controlling the pandemic instead of panicking,” he said. Dr Bhumesh Tyagi, a physician at the isolation ward of Sharda hospital, said that as the new strain is more contagious, the hospital management has readied a 30-bed exclusive ward to accommodate patients infected with new strain, if any. “The new strain appears very unpredictable, as it infects mostly younger people. However, our fingers are crossed regarding the lethality of the new strain. But to avert any mishap, we are ready with our resources. We’ve deployed 13 doctors for this ward,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-no-contact-of-patient-with-new-strain-of-covid-19-found-positive/story-uN16ybfB8Qp4j32tom4aPO.html
02-01-2021||Noida||Noida authority told to pay ₹71,000 to Sector 19 resident for damage due to water logging||GREATER NOIDA: The Gautam Buddha Nagar consumer disputes redressal commission has directed Noida authority to pay ₹71,000 to a man over damages due to water logging due to faults in the sewerage system in Sector 19.Anil Garg, the complainant, had filed complaint for compensation and punitive damages in 2018, alleging deficiency of services and unfair trade practices resulting in water logging, due to faulty and old sewerage system and other irregularities.Garg has been living in Block B of Sector 19 since 1988 and stated that he has been facing water logging problems in his home since 1996, adding that it became worse in 2017. The authority, in their written statement, denied all allegations, stating that no unfair trade practices have been adopted and that there has been no deficiency in services on their behalf. The authority had written that the complainant is not a consumer and that it is incorrect to say that the authority is not serious about the discharge of the duties.As regards to the sewage network in Sector 19, from house 185 to 497 in Block B is concerned, a decision to change and relay the said line has already been taken and estimated cost of said project, that comes out to be ₹229.83 lakh, was sanctioned on October 25, 2017, the authority had said. The tender for this job has been invited and work is going to start in the near future on war footing, the authority had written in its submission.Further, the authority had stated that the alleged dispute is purely of civil nature and that the forum had no jurisdiction under the provision of Consumer Protection Act.The commission, comprising president Anil Kumar Pundir and member Daya Shanker Pandey, observed that the complainant is in fact a consumer under the Act.“The district commission has ordered the authority to pay ₹60,000 towards damages and losses and ₹10,000 towards mental harassment, agony and trauma, and ₹1,000 towards other legal expenses. The order was delivered on December 22 and its copy was received Saturday,” Garg said.An official from the authority’s legal department, not authorised to speak with the media, said that the district commission’s order will be challenged at the state commission.“As complainant filed the complaint in a personal capacity, the authority is not bound to pay damages to other residents facing similar complaints,” it is stated in the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-told-to-pay-71-000-to-sector-19-resident-for-damage-due-to-water-logging/story-oEOGnI9DEVgr356gHGm2bP.html
02-01-2021||Noida||GB Nagar’s Covid-19 tally crosses 25K mark, last 5K recorded in 49 days||Gautam Buddh Nagar on Saturday crosses 25,000 Covid-19, 301 days after the first case was detected in March.The first 5,000 cases took 145 days in July, slowed down by the hard lockdown that was imposed nationwide for 68 days from March 25. However, as the restrictions were eased and testing increased, the number of days for the next batch of 5,000 cases reduced to 44 and then 30. Since November, however, as infected people were better isolated, the spread reduced, taking 33 days and then 49 days to reach Saturday’s figure of 25,001.In October last year there was a surge in cases, with 5,797 positive cases, the most in a month. November and December saw only 3,853 and 2,242 cases, respectively. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “In July, we were worried about accommodating patients in the Covid-19 facilities in the district. But, today we have less than 400 active patients.” “We started with just 597 tests in March, and by the end of June, the total test count was only 26,170. But after that, we ramped up our testing rate and between July 1 and November 15, we collected samples of over 628,656 people. It’s obvious that initially the number of positive cases detected will be directly proportional to the number of persons tested. But, after attaining the peak, the graph went down,” he said. Suhas said that till the vaccine is available widely, the district administration will ensure proper contact tracing and that people follow health protocols. “As a result of our consolidated efforts, the recovery rate in GB Nagar has gone over 97%, while the present case fatality rate (CFR) is around 0.36%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.43%,” the DM said. District chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that in the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the health department. For that, we have adapted the universally accepted ‘tracking, testing and treating’ method. The health workers have been told to ensure maximum contact tracing – precisely finding out 25 contacts of one infected patient. We are testing nearly 5,000 people every day and treating infected patients as per symptoms,” he said. Dr Deepak Gupta, virologist with the Government Institute of Medical Science (GIMS) in Greater Noida, said that the downward trend indicated that the pandemic was under control in the district and people ought to stick to these health protocols even as the new variant of the virus made news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-25k-mark-last-5k-recorded-in-49-days/story-0aqAxZvZA3NqH3HV2DvkML.html

02-01-2021||Noida||Three arrested for assaulting RSS worker in Noida||Noida: Three men have been arrested for allegedly beating up an 35-year-old man and his brother in Noida’s Sector 9 on Friday evening. The police, however, said that this was a case of a road rage.The victim, Vinod Kaushik, said he is a secretary of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Gautam Budh Nagar and was on his way to meet some people with his brother Vipin, in a residential society around 6pm for fundraising when a group of people allegedly beat him up.Soon after the purported incident, a number of RSS workers reached the Sector 20 police station and demonstrated for about four hours, demanding that the suspects be arrested. Vinod, in the complaint to the police, alleged that he was travelling in his car while his brother was on a motorcycle when a local person, along with 15 of his supporters, attacked him. “I suspect the role of the Jhundpura police check post-in-charge in supporting the suspects. He should be suspended with immediate effect,” he alleged in the complaint. Vinod’s other brother Uma Nandan Kaushik, said: “The suspects gathered at the spot and first attacked Vinod. Vipin, who was following Vinod, stopped and came to his rescue. The suspects also attacked Vipin in the head and legs,” he alleged. Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Noida Zone 1, said that primary investigation shows this was a case of road rage. “A man – Wahab – was driving an e-rickshaw while Vinod was in his car. The two vehicles collided and the car received some dents. Vinod slapped the e-rickshaw driver over the issue, and the latter then called some men from Sector 9 and they manhandled Vinod,” the ADCP said.The Sector 20 police later registered a case against the suspects under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 147 (rioting) of the IPC. “We arrested three persons – Nadeem, Wahab and Mehtab. We are investigating the matter from all angles,” the ADCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-arrested-for-assaulting-rss-worker-in-noida/story-OsSpHwuExe3mD2a8f4JX9J.html

Of the 40 species of waterbirds counted this time, 17 were resident species while 23 migratory species. The census also included six species of IUCN Red-listed threaten birds -- Black-necked Stork (resident), Black-tailed Godwit (winter migratory), Common Pochard (winter migratory), Ferruginous Duck (winter migratory), Woolly-necked Stork (Indian migratory), Greater Spotted Eagle (winter migratory).“Overall, winter migratory waterbirds this winter was fewer than earlier in northern India. At Surajpur, during AWC 2021, we recorded an increase in number, which indicates a healthier wetland habitat,” said TK Roy, ecologist and conservationist, AWC. According to the experts, water birds are one of the key indicators of wetlands health that provides feeding, resting, roosting, and foraging habitats for these species.The migratory birds start arriving in the region by October from far Central Asia, North Asia including Russia and Siberia, while their strength reaches its peak by December. Their departure begins by March and by mid-April they are all back to their breeding grounds in central Asia.Roy added that due to global climate change’s impact delaying the winters, the migration this year had been slower.“In November we observed more numbers and diversity of migratory waterbirds at Surajpur wetland but suddenly few species completely disappeared and overall numbers also shrank,” Roy added.Spread over 308 hectares, the Surajpur forest reserve area is home to 186 species of resident, winter migratory, summer migratory, and passage migrant birds. Among the major misses, this year included -- Pied Avocet, Ruddy Shelduck, Western Marsh Harrier, Great Cormorant, Glossy Ibis, Black-headed Gull, Smaller wader species.“We are committed to develop better habitat and manage our wetlands so that the population and species diversity increases. This year, the lockdown also had a positive effect on our wetlands due to lower human intervention,” said Pramod Kumar Srviatavsa, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-more-birds-at-surajpur-this-year-reveals-census/story-8WMjxTCROFRZDbUrqndkIL.html

Master Shyoraj Singh, president BKU-Lokshakti, compared these farm laws to colonial – Abadkari Bill introduced in 1906 – which was anti-farmer. The farmers had protested for nine months and forced the British government to withdraw this bill. We will make our strategy after the January 4 meeting with the government to how long the protest will go,” BKU-Lokshakti president said. As the temperature dipped over the last two days, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) provided protesting farmers at the Chilla border between Noida and Delhi with blankets, sleeping bags and other winter essentials.The facility was provided by Gurugram-based Hemkund Foundation. Gurpreet Singh, a representative of the foundation, said that they have been supporting the farmers at different places. “We have set up sleeping tents at Singhu border as well. These shelter offers protection against bitter cold, rain and wind,” he said. He said a tent can accommodate four persons and they also provide blankets, toothpaste, toothbrush, bathing soap, washing detergent, oil, mosquito repellent, sanitary napkins and milk.Yogesh Pratap Singh, BKU-Bhanu UP President, said that there was slight rain on Friday night which brought down the temperature. “We sought help of the NGO for the safety of farmers. The protest will go one if the farmers are safe. To keep farmers warm, we visit the neighbouring bushes and bring timber for bone fire to beat the cold,” he said. The farmers also make breakfast, lunch and dinner at the spot to keep the protest going. Reports of farmer deaths prompted the organisation to attempt to boost their supporters’ morale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/an-ngo-s-helping-hand-for-farmers-at-chilla-border/story-KgxP7JS3mjh0sqcg4jEB3K.html
02-01-2021||Noida||UP Gate: Elderly, women not ready to go back despite adverse weather||Ghaziabad: Despite the chill, farmers protesting the new central farm laws at the UP Gate site on Saturday said that they were not returning till the laws are repealed. Their leaders said they conveyed the government’s request to have women, children and senior citizens outside at the protest to return and sit out the extreme cold unseen in 15 years. “No one is ready to go back,” said 85-year-old Bilender Kumar from Charoli village in Gautam Budh Nagar. He is covered in a blanket and stays in a small temporary tent at the UP Gate flyover. “I have been here since the protest started (November 28) and will go home only when the government accepts our demands. A farmer is used to adverse weather like summers, winters or rain and will not get affected.” Like him, many senior farmers and women have come to UP Gate from western UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab. “We now have two blocks of women-only camps at UP Gate and on Friday their count was 200. A few will go back home and will return in a couple of days. Neither rain nor adverse weather has not affected them and we are all geared up to help them,” said Ravneet Kaur, who is co-ordinating the ‘women-only’ camp at UP Gate. “Despite the weather conditions, more people are coming to UP Gate and coming prepared with blankets, woollens, etc. to stay here for the protest. It seems that no one is ready to go back.”The farmer leader said that the protesters have not paid heed to the request put up by the government during the last meeting. “In fact, it rained today (on Saturday) and they were seen holding up their tents and plugging leaks. No one is ready to go back home. When we request them, some even jokingly say that their wives will beat them up and will not let them in if they go empty handed (without the repeal of three new laws),” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. The officials of the Indian Meteorological Department have predicted that there are chances that the region will receive light to moderate rainfall on January 4 and 5. “There is also a prediction of hailstorm on January 4. Light rain is also predicted for January 3. This is due to western disturbance which will have impact up to January 6. As a result, the minimum temperature is likely to range about 8-9 degrees Celsius and likely to fall down to 5-6 degrees Celsius after the western disturbance ends. The wind speed is also likely to pick up in range of 25-3kmph,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of Indian Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. The farmers light up wood to keep themselves warm and many even staying inside in their tents for hours on end. “Till the time the two key demands of repeal of laws and a new law on MSP is accepted, the farmers will not go home. This fight is now for ‘sammaan’ (honour) for us and we will not bow down. We had not come here to go back with amendments as suggested by the government,” said Ram Pal Singh, an elderly farmer from Amroha. Tikait said that farmers having stayed for over a month are not in a mood to go back till the government repeals the three laws. “During the last meeting there was no consensus on two key demand but we decided to keep them aside and discussed two other smaller issues which were accepted by the government. Now, the two key issues will come up during the talks on January 4. Even if there is no decision on January 4 we will continue talks and get government to accept our demands. Till that time, everyone is staying back,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-gate-elderly-women-not-ready-to-go-back-despite-adverse-weather/story-csDdBnR8DwEBQohFsJhB6L.html
02-01-2021||Gurugram||City receives light rain; minimum temperature rises||The minimum temperature of the city rose by several degrees to settle at 9.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s reading. The minimum temperature recorded on Friday was 4.1 degrees Celsius. Light rain was also reported from some parts of the city in the morning and evening hours. IMD officials had earlier predicted a rise in temperature starting Saturday. They attributed the increase in temperature to a western disturbance and said that there was a possibility of rain on Sunday as well. The maximum stayed at 19.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday, according to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory in Delhi. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) for Gurugram did not record the city’s temperature on Saturday. The Palam observatory, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the rise in temperature is likely to continue and cold wave conditions will abate in the next three-four days. He said that rainfall under the influence of a western disturbance could be expected on Sunday as well. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum and minimum temperature are expected to hover between 19 and 9 degrees Celsius respectively on Sunday.Meanwhile, air quality in the city stayed in the “very poor” zone with a reading of 336 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This is up from 376 (also ‘very poor’) the previous day. Gurugram did, however, remained the least polluted city in the NCR, with Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Delhi all recording ‘severe’ air on Saturday. Experts said that air quality might improve starting from Sunday on account of rain and better winds conditions. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “The air quality is likely to improve further on 03.01.2021 and reach in Poor to Moderate category. The air quality is likely to remain in moderate to satisfactory category on 04.01.2021(sic).” Subsequently, the air quality is likely to improve significantly from Saturday onwards and remain largely in “moderate” category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-receives-light-rain-minimum-temperature-rises/story-4yjbDh5ocTF5k4HBfroIkJ.html
02-01-2021||Gurugram||Online assessments for classes 1-8 to start next week||Assessments for students in classes 1 to 8 in government schools across the city will be conducted online from next week for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out. Haryana government recently clarified that it planned to continue with online classes for such students for now. The education department will now conduct these monthly assessment tests through an app called AVSAR, which has been developed by it recently. Teachers said that the tests will give them some idea about the progress made by students since physical school visits for these students are restricted. Schools across the country were closed last March and classes are being held remotely to contain the spread of Covid-19. While schools in Haryana reopened for physical classroom sessions in October for students in classes 9 to 12, they are yet to start physical classroom sessions for students in classes 1-8.Raj Kumar, school principal, Government Senior Secondary School in Islampur, said that the monthly assessment tests would be conducted for students starting from next week for the first time since schools were shut in March. Kumar said assessment test for students in these grades were needed since students were not allowed to visit the school for doubt-clearing sessions, which helped teachers in mapping students’ progress. “We have sent videos to students which will help them in navigating through the app interface. This is for the first time that we will be holding the monthly assessment test in a structured manner through this app,” said Kumar. He said that the lack of smartphones might become a hurdle in the assessment process. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that monthly exams would be conducted regularly starting this month through the app. “Students will have to download the app to register for these exams. They’ll be able to access study material on the basis of which they’ll be tested,” said Sharma.She said that while many students had made arrangements for a phone, volunteers or Shiksha Mitras appointed by the school will help those students who do not have a smartphone. The education department had appointed Shiksha Mitra in August. As per the department’s definition, a Shiksha Mitra can be any parent, sibling, relative, neighbour or community volunteer, who has an internet-enabled smartphone and is in a position to lend the phone to the student daily for some time. Deputy district education officer Kalpna Singh said that while the lack of smartphones was a concern among students in classes 1 to 8, an assessment mechanism was needed for charting the progress of students. “The tests will be starting in the coming week. We will tap into volunteers or other resources if students face any hurdles,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/online-assessments-for-classes-1-8-to-start-next-week/story-KfFHboTxY1OuONNqo8b4FM.html

Following the court order, the senior town planner formed a committee on Friday, comprising DTCP officials, two complainants and a representative of the developer, and asked it to submit a report within a week.Malibu Towne on Sohna Road is a residential society spread over 208 acres that has both plots and apartments. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that the survey team went to the colony on Saturday to physically verify the details of the violations that the complainant has submitted to the department and in the court. “The deviations that have been carried out on the ground will be matched with the original layout and the building plan. All these would be noted and a detailed report will be submitted on this matter to senior town planner for suitable action,” he said. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, who led the survey team, said that encroachment of green areas, deviation of land, installation of gensets, sub-division of land and non-construction of service roads were issues, which were raised by the complainant and they were looked into in detail. “We analysed the complaints and did a detailed ground survey to assess the situation. It will take a week to check whether the facilities and services were delivered as promised or there were violations,” he said. Raman Sharma, a resident of Malibu Towne, who submitted the complaint along with another complainant, alleged that the size of plots sold by Malibu Estates Private Limited was changed in violation of the approved layout plan and the community buildings and plots were sold in violation of rules. He also alleged that plots under EWS category were not available, apart from several other violations related to community sites and buildings.Subhash Raghav, vice president, Malibu Estates Private Limited, said that this matter was already under consideration of Lokayukta Court. “All these points are under Lokayukta Court. These are all pending issues, which are already in principle approved by us.

02-01-2021||Gurugram||Second waterbody revived under Gurujal||A pond in Khentawas village of Farrukhnagar block that was severely polluted and unusable was restored and inaugurated on Saturday. It was the second natural water body to be restored under the Gurujal initative project. The Mojabad pond in Pataudi was revived in September 2020. Minister of state (independent charge) for statistics, programme implementation and planning Rao Inderjit Singh inaugurated the restored pond site through video conference. The 1.25-acre water body in Khentawas was among the 72 water bodies identified for restoration in different blocks of the district. Currently, 14 such water bodies in sites like Kasan, Dhaula, Wazirpur, Navada, Dharampur and Khentawas, are under restoration. “The Khentawas pond will recharge groundwater by up to 19.7 million litres in a year,” said Shubhi Kesarwani, director, Gurujal. The village is situated about 18kms from Gurugram and has 400 households, with a population of more than 2000. Untreated water of the village would be discharged into the pond.The Gurujal team began the restoration work last year with desilting and levelling the pond bed. “Thereafter, a 150 kilo litres a day (KLD) capacity sewage treatment plant (STP) was constructed at a cost of ₹70 lakh to recycle the water,” said Kesarwani. The treatment will remove large coarse material or suspended solids before being pumped into filtration tanks and then to a holding tank before being released into the pond. The team also planted saplings of neem, sheesham, jamun, gulmohar and tamarind, among others, in an effort to beautify the pond.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said that the local population will be responsible for the maintenance of the treatment plant and pond. Minister Rao Inderjeet Singh also supported traditional methods of water conservation to recharge groundwater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/second-waterbody-revived-under-gurujal/story-OXOqpEna5f4zMR1VvoZtiL.html
02-01-2021||Gurugram||Anath Road to be redesigned as city’s first model street||Anath Road — a 2.4-kilometre stretch in Sector 18 that runs parallel to the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway — is likely to be redesigned as the city’s first model street. The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), along with Raahgiri Foundation and a few private stakeholders, are jointly executing this project.As per GMDA officials, more than 6,000 pedestrians and cyclists use this narrow, busy stretch every day that has the passport office and many multinational corporations. Built in the 1990s, the pothole-riddled stretch neither has any pedestrian amenities nor any speed-calming measures.The redesigning of the street will include two aspects: One part will be solely dedicated for pedestrians and cyclists while the other path will be reserved for motorists. The redesigning will also accommodate around 390 trees, which will come in the path of the proposed changes. “The project is being executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. It is the city’s first attempt towards making a model street — one which will address and cater to the needs of both motorised and non-motorised modes of transport. The design plan has received approval, and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed by the government and the private stakeholders,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based road safety expert, who is one of the members overseeing the project.As per GMDA officials privy to the matter, on-ground work is expected to start in the first week of March.“There are three main stages in this project. The design aspect has been completed theoretically and has also been approved. In the second stage, GMDA will be assessing the utilities coming in the path of the project and figure out ways to redesign around it or, if the need arises, shift them to a different location. In the third stage, simultaneous to the second, we will clear all encroachments on the stretch and subsequently, start on-ground work,” said a senior GMDA official privy to the matter.As per the design plan, the path for pedestrians and cyclists will be shared while a two-metre-wide green belt or footpath extension will divide the non-motorised transport (NMT) path and the one used by motorists.In the green belt or footpath extension, benches for sitting purposes have also been incorporated into the design.The width of the 2.4-kilometre stretch is not uniform. At certain points, the right of way (ROW) is 45 metres wide while in some areas it narrows down to 30 metres. As per officials privy to the matter, dedicated pick-up and drop points have been earmarked in the design plan wherever the ROW is 45 metres wide and extra space is available.“The rationale behind the creation of dedicated pickup and drop points is to eliminate parking on the footpath or stalling on the main street and holding traffic. To safeguard those on the NMT path, bollards have been placed at the entry and exit points in the design plan to prevent vehicles from accessing the lane. Further, raised zebra crossings have also been incorporated into the design to help pedestrians cross from end to the other,” said Bhatt.Raised zebra crossings not only helps to create a dedicated path for pedestrians to cross the stretch, but the extra elevation also helps motorists spot pedestrians better. As such, such crossings act as speed-calming structures.Depending on the volume of pedestrians and vehicles, some raised zebra crossings are signalised and have pelican lights.The redesign model also has spaces for setting up e-recharging stations, which can be used by e-rickshaws or electric cabs.VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA, explained that the redesigning is being done in two ways. Kundu said that the GMDA would be relaying the entire 2.4-kilometre carriageway while the Raahgiri Foundation and other private stakeholders will be responsible for redesigning the NMT path, green belts, and sitting areas through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding.“The philosophy of the GMDA, as per the city’s mobility plan, is to create road solutions for the people rather than for motorists. Our top priority in this regard is pedestrians, followed by cyclists, public transport and vehicular traffic. The Anath Road redesigning is being carried out keeping this point of view,” said Kundu.Kundu said that GMDA’s initial plan for the project was to simply widen the Ananth Road, officially known as Subedar Major Laxmi Chand Road. However, he said that the GMDA realised that the existing width of the road is sufficient enough for vehicular traffic, provided the same path is no longer mixed, and being used by both cyclists or pedestrians as well.Kundu said that the estimated cost for redesigning the entire project is estimated to be at least ₹16 crore, half of which would be for relaying the main carriageway and the other half for redesigning the NMT stretch.“This project is emblematic of Gurugram, in which the civil society, companies and the administration work cooperatively to develop a model street, which prioritises road safety for all categories of road users, particularly pedestrians and cyclists,” said Manas Fuloria, CEO of Nagarro, one of the companies funding this project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/anath-road-to-be-redesigned-as-city-s-first-model-street/story-S7RDjlLpg0KmJkzGzm9MIO.html
02-01-2021||Gurugram||300 college students protest against proposed exams||Around 300 students of Government Girls College in Sector 14 on Saturday took out a march to protest against the university administration’s purported plans to conduct the second-semester exams from January. After gathering in front of the college around 11am, students moved further ahead and reached the city bus stop, where they raised slogans against the university administration.In June last year, the higher education department had said that first and second-year students will be promoted to the next semester without any exam and on the basis of marks obtained in internal assessment and previous examinations. However, students, who were promoted to the third semester, said they were told on Thursday that the second-semester exams would be conducted in January. Most students said that they were not in favour of holding second-semester exams since the syllabus couldn’t be completed due to the pandemic. They also said that the announcement had come at such a short notice that it would be difficult to handle third-semester studies along with second-semester exams. Soni Sharma, who was among the protesting students, said, “Our second semester was disrupted due to Covid-19 and we did not complete the syllabus. The semester exams did not take place and we were promoted to the third semester. However, we are now being told that second-semester exams will take place in January in 10 days. How can we be tested when the syllabus was not completed properly and we are busy with the third-semester studies? We have so many papers and science subjects are particularly difficult,” said Sharma, a BSc student. She said that students had received information about the conduct of classes only on Thursday. Sonia, another third-semester student, said that the matter was discussed with the principal on Thursday but nothing conclusive came out of it after which students decided to protest on Saturday. “Most students are not in favour of exams. If students in other universities can be promoted, why can’t the same mechanism apply to us? Ideally, third-semester exams should be conducted now. We can’t handle third-semester studies along with second-semester exams with so much syllabus left to cover,” said Sonia. She said that exams for the second semester did not make sense since the semester had been disrupted due to various factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic. “We did not have classes for the most part in January 2020 since our results were declared late. Only limited classes took place in February due to which the syllabus couldn’t be covered and later the pandemic struck in March. How can we be expected to take exams for a semester where the syllabus was not completed?” said Sonia. Markanday Ahuja, vice-chancellor of Gurugram University which is responsible for conducting exams for students, said that students were agitating unnecessarily and no examination date sheet had been prepared. “No date-sheet has been made till now. We have simply called a meeting of college principals to explore the possibility of conducting exams since the government has said that exams need to be taken. The UGC has also made a recommendation,” said Ahuja. He said that college principals had been asked to take feedback from students for a preferable time for exams but students had reacted unnecessarily. “We are simply trying to explore the possibility of holding exams, whether exams should be conducted during the third semester or later,” said Ahuja. He said that a follow-up meeting was due for Monday where further decisions in this regard will be taken. Protesting students said that they had been assured that they would get to be a part of the discussions scheduled to take place on Monday after which they’d decide the next course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/300-college-students-protest-against-proposed-exams/story-AalnZn8CAH6CnHcsJL6MwJ.html

02-01-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan crematorium caretaker turns Covid warrior||Thirty-year-old Amol Dabhade has emerged as a true Covid warrior and an unsung hero during the pandemic.The caretaker of Lal Chowki crematorium in Kalyan has cremated more than 350 Covid patients since March 2020, sometimes working continuously for more than 24 hours and going on for days without meeting his family or celebrating birthdays with them. But Dabhade has no regrets.A resident of Adharwadi in Kalyan, Dabhade stays with his 55-year-old mother and 26-year-old wife. He said, “I have been working in the crematorium for many years. Earlier, there were merely four to five people to be cremated in a day. I stayed nearby, the money I earned was enough for the three of us and I could spend enough time with my mother and wife. However, things changed after March when the pandemic set in. The body count started increasing and so would the despair and helplessness of the people who came here.”Dabhade remembered the days when he had to cremate 15 to 19 persons in a day. “My family used to worry about my health but I have always been careful with all the safety precautions. Initially, I was worried too looking at the death. However, one day a man came to cremate his 30-year-old son, a Covid warrior. He was also the sole breadwinner of the family. The son died of Covid and the father told me he was very proud of his son who worked for people during the pandemic. This inspired me and I told my family not to worry about me, I will also do my bit for the society. I believe God has given me this opportunity through my work and he will give me strength too.”Dabhade said that he never said no to any family who came to the crematorium at any time of the day. “I had to cremate 19 bodies back-to-back. Each body took more than 40 minutes, after which I took one-and-a-half hours to clean the machine. Otherwise, it would get stuck leading to a long queue. I used to reach home late after my family was asleep or sometimes after two days. My wife and I did not even meet on our birthdays. The appreciation from people was my gift for this year.”The KDMC had allowed cremation of Covid patients at six of its crematoriums. A KDMC official said, “A total 980 deaths has been reported in the KDMC jurisdiction over nine months, and this crematorium alone has burnt more than 350 bodies so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-crematorium-caretaker-turns-covid-warrior/story-evvhvwy6vzM4SsVceV7jHK.html

02-01-2021||Mumbai||12,000 people to be vaccinated in Mumbai daily, centres to rise from 8 to 50||In an attempt to increase its capacity for the vaccination process, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has set a target of immunising 12,000 beneficiaries daily at all the vaccination centres. Currently, BMC has allotted eight centres for vaccination, but it has plans to gradually increase them to 50-100. On Saturday, the civic body announced that the vaccination process will start in Mumbai within 24 hours of the availability of the vaccine stock.As per BMC’s plan, of the eight centres, four major civic hospitals – King Edward Memorial (KEM), BYL Nair, Cooper and Sion – have been equipped to vaccinate 2,000 people on a daily basis. The remaining four centres – Bhabha hospital (Bandra), VN Desai Hospital (Santacruz), Rajawadi Hospital (Ghatkopar) and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital (Kandivli) will vaccinate 1,000 people every day. With a target of vaccinating 12, 000 people every day, BMC plans to complete the first phase of vaccination in 12-15 days.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, who visited all the cold storage facilities and the eight vaccination centres to take a review of the preparations on Saturday, said, “We have started the eight centres on a standby mode. Each administrative ward will have at least two vaccination centres. At first, we can increase the total number of centres to 50. However, we have also identified some school buildings and public structures that will help us to almost double the centres in the future, as we reach to other phases of vaccination. I have directed the staff today to leave no stone unturned in the preparations for our vaccination plan.”During the first phase of vaccination, around 1.25 lakh healthcare workers are expected to be immunised, while in the second phase, frontline workers such as police personnel and conservancy workers, will be vaccinated. In the third phase, around 50 lakh citizens will be vaccinated, of whom 30 lakh people are above 50 years of age identified in the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey. Citizens with comorbidities will also be vaccinated in the third phase of the vaccination drive. BMC has identified an area of 5,000 square feet on the first floor of its five-storey building at Kanjurmarg as the centralised spot for storing the vaccine. The facility will have two walk-in coolers (WIC) and one walk-in freezer (WIF). Each of WICs will have a capacity of 40 cubic metres and will maintain temperature upto -80 degree Celsius, while the WIF will have a capacity of 20 cubic metres and maintain temperature between -15 and -250 degree Celsius. Seventeen ice-lined refrigerators (ILR), each with a capacity of 225 litres, will be supplied by the state government. Eight of the refrigerators have been delivered to each of the identified vaccination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/12-000-people-to-be-vaccinated-in-mumbai-daily-centres-to-rise-from-8-to-50/story-2lwVOE0Abeo1iOHvt7NihL.html
02-01-2021||Delhi||DDA puts 1,354 flats for sale in new scheme, Feb 16 last date to apply||The Delhi Development Authority on Saturday launched its housing scheme-2021 putting on sale 1,354 flats that are located mainly in Dwarka, Jasola and Vasant Kunj areas. This includes Rs 2.1-crore three-bedroom High Income Group (HIG) flats, the costliest to be put up for sale till date by the authority, located in south-east Delhi’s Jasola.There are 254 flats in the HIG category located in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini, Dwarka. Of these, 215 flats in Jasola have been put on sale for the first time, while the remaining are those that were returned by allottees in the previous housing schemes. The cost of HIG flats, which are 87.9 sqm to 177.3 sqm in size, varies between Rs69.62 lakh to Rs 2.14 crore. Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA officials are optimistic that the 254 HIG flats in Jasola will find takers. “These are spacious flats, located on the Delhi-Noida border and are well-connected to the rest of the city via Metro and other public transport system. There is a dual piping system as the complex has its own sewer treatment plant. The most important thing is that each flat has two parking slots. The Rs 2.1 crore cost is as per the market rate,” said a senior DDA official. Real estate experts say that the number of property transactions have increased in the past few months as property prices have plummeted due to economic slowdown triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mudassir Zaidi, executive director, Knight Frank, said, “In the past few months, the property transactions have increased despite a slump in the market. While the costs have gone down, there is interest in newer projects, especially in Delhi. As there are not many private housing projects in Delhi, there is a demand for DDA flats. As for the cost of HIG flats in Jasola, it is as per market prices.”Apart from HIG flats, the DDA has put on sale 757 Middle Income Group (MIG) flats with two and three bedrooms in Dwarka, Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Janahgirpuri and Madipur. Spread over 64.04 sqm to 129.98 sqm, the cost of MIG flats varies between R40.64 lakh to R1.24 crore. Of the 757 flats, 711 are located in Dwarka sub-city—one of the planned residential areas developed by the DDA. There are 291 flats for the Economically Weaker Section and 52 in the Lower Income Group (LIG) category in Dwarka and Rohini.The last date to apply for the scheme is February 16 and senior DDA officials said that the draw of lots will be held in February end or first week of March.Unlike the last housing scheme in 2019, DDA officials said that the scheme will be launched online using the newly developed AWAAS software. The official added that all applications, payments and possession letters will be processed online. “People will have to come to the DDA office just once to execute the conveyance deed,” said the official.A senior DDA official said that people are advised to visit the site and inspect flats before applying for it. “We have provided the contact number of officials who will be present at the site to show the sample flats,” said the official. After three unsuccessful housing schemes, the land-owning agency is hoping for a good response to its new housing scheme as the flats on offer this time are spacious and located in areas which are well connected to the rest of the city.Last year, the DDA had put 18,000 flats on sale, but had to reduce the number of flats in the scheme to 10,294 later, as it didn’t get the desired response. The land-owning agency had received 45,012 applications for its flats, but it could sell only 8,438 flats — 488 HIG, 1,555 in MIG, 5,172 LIG and 1,223 EWS category flats — of which close to 6,000 flats were returned, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-puts-1-354-flats-for-sale-in-new-scheme-feb-16-last-date-to-apply/story-ocIb4zIedDVrGjjzF3SqmO.html
02-01-2021||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking news||Cycling group rides into 2021 in style Chandigarh-based Cyclegiri group pedalled into the new year with a specially planned route that spelled 2021. According to group administrator Akshit Passi, 25, the riders started cycling from Yadavindra Public School Chowk in Mohali and went up to Sector 27, Chandigarh. “It was a two-hour trip and we rode for 33km on Saturday morning. The cold weather made the ride extra special,” Passi said. Ex-mayor at receiving end as BJP councillor adds insult to injury It was double whammy for a former mayor of Chandigarh the other day. During the general house meeting on December 31, a Congress councillor called him “anpad (illiterate)”. The former mayor from the BJP and his party members objected and demanded an apology from the Congress councillor. After several minutes of pandemonium, the Congress leader relented and withdrew his comment. But the embarrassment for the former mayor didn’t end there. Later, at the mayor’s office, where journalists were present, a BJP councillor said, “It was disrespectful of the Congress member to call him anpad. There’s no decency left. Like one doesn’t call a kana (squint-eyed) person a kana to his face, similarly one shouldn’t call an illiterate an anpad on his face.” Looking uncomfortable, the former mayor responded, “How can a Class 10 pass be called an anpad?” Bidding adieu to city’s Jhansi Ki Rani Only two months ago, BJP councillors, led by local unit chief Arun Sood, boycotted an MC general house meeting called by Chandigarh mayor Raj Bala Malik and gifted her the most embarrassing moment of her one-year term. But by the year-end, the councillors were all praise for Malik’s working style at the last meeting under her mayorship. Sood even likened her to Jhansi ki Rani for being active at the grassroots, particularly during the Covid-19 lockdown. MC agenda passed by voice vote amid clanging of thalis Congress members outwitted the BJP by bringing thalis to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation House last week. They didn’t let the House meet proceed by clanging the stainless steel plates, forcing an adjournment. With important issues up for discussion, local BJP chief Arun Sood decided to bring the items on the agenda to get them passed with voice vote. When the meeting resumed, the Congress members reached the well of the House, clanging the thalis only to be outdone by their BJP counterparts, who passed all the items on the agenda, except one, by voice vote without any discussion. Mohali MC in sleep mode as stray cattle give commuters nightmares Ever since the five-year term of the municipal corporation ended on April 26 last year, officials have forgotten to address Mohali’s civic issues. The stray cattle problem has grown alarmingly with one of the worst-hit areas being a site near the MC office in Sector 68. Commuters have a tough time negotiating certain stretches in town and the fog has aggravated their problem. Prohibit youngsters from hookah bars Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, minced no words when she said there was a need to prohibit youngsters from hookah bars as they are a gateway to addictions, starting from nicotine/tobacco. Participating as a guest in a panel discussion on hookah bars being the new fad with the young, she said that nicotine leads to constriction of blood vessels and affects all our organs from head to toe. The health risks of smoking through a hookah include exposure to toxic chemicals that are not filtered out by the water and the risk of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis and Covid-19, increases as hookah smoking is a social activity. Chandigarh has already imposed a hookah ban till February. Former Congmen in war of wardsTwo former Congress leaders Nirmal Singh (HDF) and Venod Sharma (HJP) whose newly floated parties fought the municipal elections in Ambala have entered into a political slugfest post results. After his party’s poor performance, Singh accused Sharma of “using muscle and money power”. Sharma, whose wife has been elected the mayor, mocked Singh and said: “Yeh to hamare hi haathon mein khele hue hain; hume pata hai tumhara kitna janadhaar hai.” New Year’s a low-key affair at PU The New Year celebrations at Panjab University were a low-key affair this time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a tradition, the vice-chancellor would address non-teaching staff on the first day of the year. But there was no such interaction in view of the health protocol.

02-01-2021||Chandigarh||Winds from Delhi turn Chandigarh’s air quality poor||Air Quality Index (AQI), which had remained below 150 for most of December, suddenly jumped to 256 at the monitoring station in Sector 25, Chandigarh, on Saturday morning. Attributing it to wind systems forming in the region due to western disturbances, experts said the air quality is expected to improve with rain likely for the next few days.The jump is high considering that at the Sector-25 station, which gives live updates, AQI had gone up to just 140 on Diwali night, though it was recorded higher at other observatories of Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.“The air quality turned poor at other stations as well, and the sudden spike is most likely related to some weather phenomena,” said Debendra Dalai, member secretary, CPCC.Throwing more light on it, Surender Paul, director, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh, said: “A western disturbance is active in the northwest of the region, and winds from other places are rushing in towards here. The most likely explanation is that winds are coming from in and around Delhi, where air quality is poorer.” However, with rain likely in the coming days, AQI is likely to fall below 100 again, said Paul.Central Pollution Control Board classifies AQI of 200-300 as poor. It can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. AQI of 100-200 is moderate, and can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung and heart diseases. AQI of 50-100 is satisfactory, though it can still cause minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Beloe 50, AQI is classified as good and has minimal impact on health.‘Cleaner air so far has led to colder winter’Air this winter has been cleaner than in previous years. The average AQI of the city in December 2020 stood at 119, as compared to 140 in December 2019.Explaining how this made the winter chillier, Paul said: “Pollutants, especially particulate matter, soak up heat during the day and keep the city warm at night. This has been missing this winter and has been one of the reasons why the city has been colder.”Dalai added that due to less vehicular movement this year, the concentration of greenhouse gases had also come down and made the city a bit more colder this season. City records 1.1mm rain, more on the cardsMeanwhile, western disturbances started affecting the region, with 1.1mm rain recorded in the city on Saturday. Chances of rain are likely to increase from Sunday, and up to 30mm along with thunderstorm is likely on Monday .Sunday was a cold day as maximum temperature fell from 17.4°C on Saturday to 15.7°C, five notches below normal. Minimum temperature remained unchanged at 6.1°C. A cold day is declared when maximum temperature is more than 4.5°C below normal and minimum temperature is less than 10°C.In the next three days, maximum temperature will remain between 16 and 17 degrees while minimum will remain between 8 and 10 degrees, according to the weather bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/winds-from-delhi-turn-chandigarh-s-air-quality-poor/story-2kOkIzYTbo5XjwU0Fg4mgJ.html

02-01-2021||City||Protesting Youth Congress workers, Sikh activists detained||Nearly two dozen Youth Congress workers and Sikh activists supporting the farmers’ agitation were detained on Saturday, when they were holding a counter protest against Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, who were holding a dharna near Shingar cinema.The BJP workers, led by national general secretary Tarun Chugh, were staging their protest against the alleged inflammatory statements made by Ludhiana Member of Parliament Ravneet Singh Bittu, and the “deteriorating law and order condition in the state”. High drama was witnessed when a large number of Youth Congress workers accompanied by some Sikh activists tried to breach the police barricades and interrupt the saffron party’s protest. The police had to use mild force to restrain them. Earlier, the Sikh activists led by Harpreet Singh Makhu and Congress leaders had reached the Samrala Chowk and Transport Nagar road, respectively, to raise slogans against the BJP government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Makhu said, “BJP is trying to disturb peace in the state and torpedo the farmers’ agitation. Police detained us even when we were protesting peacefully.” Youth Congress’ district president Yogesh Handa said, “Farmers are struggling for their rights on Delhi borders while the BJP is doing politics here. We will continue to support the farmers till the farm laws are repealed.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Deepak Pareek said, “To avert any untoward situation, around two dozen Congress workers and Sikh activists were detained by the police but they were released in the afternoon.”Meanwhile, the BJP leadership said that the Congress was protesting only to gain political mileage and was concerned about farmers.SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon, meanwhile, issued a statement saying that both Congress and BJP were trying to create trouble in the state. “Farmers have already announced that they won’t allow BJP leaders to enter their villagers; so why are the party’s leaders protesting here,” he said. On the Congress, he said, “Bittu’s inflammatory statements will only bring back the old dark days of terrorism in the state.” The Mahila Congress, meanwhile, sent messages of protest to the BJP national leadership, over the FIR against Bittu. District president Leena Taparia said BJP leaders are acting like dictators and trying to suppress the voice being raised against them. Protests lead to traffic chaosMeanwhile, commuters were on the receiving end as huge traffic jams were witnessed near Samrala Chowk, Transport Nagar road and adjoining areas due to the protests. Police had been diverting vehicles from these roads, but it failed to help. Traffic movement was also disrupted on the internal roads of Shivaji Nagar area connecting Shingar cinema road with Transport Nagar Road.Suresh, a commuter, said, “The public should not be harassed due to the protests which are staged by political parties. Every time the matter is raised, police claims that strict action will be taken against those who will block roads during protest, but nothing is done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protesting-youth-congress-workers-sikh-activists-detained/story-K7OzZ7cl8NyJt9ZdN9YagI.html

02-01-2021||Dehradun||Sisodia, Uttarakhand minister to spar over ‘development debate’ on Jan 4||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Delhi deputy chief minister (CM) Manish Sisodia challenged Uttarakhand urban development minister Madan Kaushik for an open debate in Dehradun on development works done by both Delhi AAP government and Uttarakhand’s BJP government. Sisodia floated the challenge on Twitter and posted, “On the invitation of open debate by minister Madan Kaushik, I would be in Dehradun on January 4.”“I am willing to hold discussion on works done in health, education, power, water and unemployment at Dehradun’s IRDT auditorium. Also, I am inviting for a debate in Delhi on January 6,” stated Sisodia. Minister Kaushik, while countering Sisodia’s challenge, said that he has “totally accepted his challenge for open debate but will answer him in AAP’s den- Delhi.”“He has said that he is coming to Dehradun for the debate but I would tell him not to take so much efforts. I am preparing all the list of development works done by our government which I will show him during an open debate in Delhi. He need not come here as I will go to Delhi,” said Kaushik.Sisodia had earlier challenged the Trivendra Singh Rawat-led government to list at least “five development works done by it in its three and a half years of tenure” during his first Dehradun visit last month. Also read: Expert panel gives nod to Covaxin for restricted emergency useHe had then attacked the BJP government during an event in the capital saying, “It will not be able to list any of the development work because there are none.”“Rawat’s government is not zero tolerance to corruption government but zero work government,” said Sisodia in a jibe to Rawat’s claim of zero tolerance to corruption in Uttarakhand.AAP’s Uttarakhand president SS Kaler on Sisodia’s visit said that “It will be good for the people of Uttarakhand to know what sort of development works this BJP government has done in its last three and a half years of tenure.”“However, if Kaushik fails to appear for the debate on January 4, it will show that there are no works to show. We will be then be going among people to expose this government which would also enable the people to consider the development issues while voting in next assembly elections in 2022,” said Kaler. Amid the ongoing politics on debate challenge, political expert says that it is all a “tactic by AAP to make its presence felt in state political scenario.”“AAP which has declared to fight the next assembly election of 2022 on all 70 seats, is trying to make its presence felt with such tactics,” said MM Semwal, state-based political expert who is a professor of political science in Garhwal Central University, Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal.“Though it seems to be difficult for it to make any significant impact in the elections, but it’s trying hard to shake the political scenario of the state with its senior leaders like Sisodia throwing challenges of debate to Kaushik who too is a very clever politician,” said Semwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/sisodia-uttarakhand-minister-to-spar-over-development-debate-on-jan-4/story-EE0HBO7UDQlESlBnXvIhAK.html

It states that while the state is occupied with a plethora of activities in the ongoing Covid-19 battle it is equally important to update the data on containment zones. “Access to accurate data on containment zones of states will not only help in targeted testing, but will also help in real-time tracking of important key performance indicators, such as active cases being reported from these zones. This will facilitate evidence-based decisions related to regulating the spread of the infection in each containment zone and understanding their efficacy in breaking the chain of transmission. Going forward, this data will be a key element in the vaccination strategy,” the letter states As per data put forward by the central health ministry in its letter dated December 24, not one of the 36 districts have updated their data on the national Covid-19 portal, which aims to show the number of active containment zones, or total number of containment zones. However, the data also showed that only Mumbai (island city), Pune, Thane, Nashik and Raigad have uploaded data to the state website. The Centre had made it mandatory for all states to update data on the central Covid-19 portal from December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/most-dists-have-not-updated-data-on-central-covid-19-portal/story-ybZHgQzHiRQ2ogFzIqMK9L.html

He was a part of the sit-in protest farmers have been staging at the site since November 28 against the three farm laws enacted in September to liberalise the agriculture sector.“The deceased... was found hanging at one of the mobile toilets at the protest site. He has also left behind a note which is written in Punjabi,” said circle officer Anshu Jain. Jain added the farmer was from Rampur district. “The farmers’ committee has decided against conducting the autopsy. Prima facie, it appears to be a case of suicide and nobody has suspected any foul play. The note recovered from his possession will be examined,” said Jain.Shamsher Rana, the national media co-ordinator of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the farmer, in his suicide note, blamed the government for not accepting the demands of farmers. “[He] has also mentioned that his funeral be conducted at the UP-Gate [protest site]. However, it is likely that his body will be sent to his native place and handed over to his family,” he said.On Friday, a 57-year-old farmer from Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat died at the protest site. The cause of his death could not be ascertained as his family refused permission for a post mortem. His brother said that the deceased had complained of breathlessness on Friday morning and died later.Hundreds of farmers from Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh have been protesting against the three farm laws for over a month at UP-Gate. Apart from the UP-Gate, thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana are camping at Delhi’s borders with Haryana at Singhu and Tikri.

02-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi air quality remains in severe zone, winds likely to bring relief||Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the severe zone on Saturday, with the hourly average air quality index reading 453 at 7am.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) in the city was 441, in the severe zone, on Friday. This was a major change from Thursday’s AQI recording of 347, which is categorised as ‘very poor’. Weather department scientist VK Soni said that the change in wind direction will also improve wind speeds on Saturday and help disperse pollutants. “Our forecast had said that there was a possibility of the AQI deteriorating on Friday and that was primarily because the wind speeds were down for a large part of the Friday morning. However, the speeds picked up from afternoon after the change in wind direction,” Soni said. Also Read: NASA shares pics that ‘unravel complexities of Earth from a cosmic vantage point’He added that on Saturday, the average wind speeds are likely to be around 15kmph and improvement in air quality will be visible from Saturday morning itself. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has also forecasted a western disturbance to impact the city from Saturday, which will also lead to rainfall activities in some parts of Delhi, bringing further relief from pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-remains-in-severe-zone-winds-likely-to-bring-relief/story-Uqon9355Tni5a77YbBZReO.html

02-01-2021||Patna||New Year challenge for NDA to resolve key issues in Bihar||In the New Year, all eyes will be on how the NDA government in Bihar puts up a united front in the face of growing perception about glaring differences on key issues of governance.Though ruling allies BJP and JD-U claim “all is well”, the continued impasse over issues such as cabinet expansion, nomination of MLCs and other important appointments is sending contradictory signals and keeping the RJD-led opposition interested, which is citing defection of six JD(U) MLAs to BJP in Arunachal Pradesh recently as a sign of the internal rumblings in the alliance.NDA leaders say both sides will have to resolve all outstanding issues. “Maybe, after January 14 (when the inauspicious Kharmas period ends), efforts will start in that direction,” said a senior JD-U leader, adding that Nitish Kumar handing over the party president’s post to Rajya Sabha MP RCP Singh was an indication that he would not like to be bogged down by political issues on a day-to-day basis any further and would instead focus on governance.The BJP, on the other hand, seems to be in no hurry despite a truncated Nitish cabinet and the CM himself throwing the ball in the ally’s court when asked about expansion.“The government has got going on the 7-Resolves – Part-2 without wasting any time. In a coalition, not much should be read into some delay. All issues will be resolved soon,” said JD-U spokesman Neeraj Kumar.BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said senior leaders of both the parties were in touch and everything would be resolved in course of time. “The opposition should stop day dreaming. There is no confusion in the NDA,” he added, without elaborating how quickly the outstanding issues will be resolved.Also Read: Mukesh Sahani is the richest minister in Nitish Kumar governmentCongress leader Premchandra Mishra said that the way the Nitish government was running in Bihar, nothing was left to be said. “Everyone is watching the growing fissures and how the BJP is trying to outsmart the JD-U on every front, while the governance suffers,” he said.Cabinet expansionNever in the past has Nitish Kumar continued with such a small cabinet, with one minister saddled with several key departments. The Opposition sees it as an indication of a weakened Nitish Kumar, while the CM has put the onus on the BJP. This is the first time BJP is the senior partner in the government.Union Cabinet expansionJD-U leaders say the Nitish Cabinet expansion cannot be seen in isolation. Along with it, several other key issues will also have to be resolved, including JD-U’s participation in the Union Cabinet, which has been due since 2019. It had brought the JD-U and the BJP face to face two years ago.Nomination of MLCsThe nomination of 12 members to the Bihar Legislative Assembly has been hanging fire for over a year. With the BJP emerging a bigger party, it is reportedly staking claim to more seats, while last year it was the JD-U that had put its foot down over accommodation of LJP despite BJP’s insistence. Ashok Choudhary and Mukesh Sahni are ministers in the Nitish government but not members of any House.Advocate General’s appointmentThe appointment of Advocate General is said to be another bone of contention between the two allies. BJP, being the senior partner this time, wants it should have the say in the appointment to the key position, as it happened in the case of Speaker. At present, the AG with the previous government is continuing, but BJP leaders say a decision will soon be taken on it.Boards and corporationsA large number of boards and corporations are without heads for a long time due to delay on the part of the ruling alliance partners in finalising names for posts. The same is the case with 20-point programme implementation committees at the block and district levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/new-year-challenge-for-nda-to-resolve-key-issues-in-bihar/story-OjZREUUTFY9XUaOH8n48XI.html

02-01-2021||Chandigarh||Improving efficiency: Haryana attempts to cut bureaucratic flab||Aimed at cutting the bureaucratic flab to right size, the Haryana government has initiated an exercise to rationalise the organisational structure and modify service rules based on redefined framework. The exercise will also examine the adoption of information and communication technology to streamline deliverables, officials said. The state government every month spends about ₹2,600 crore on the salaries and pensions of government employees. The two non-plan expenditure components eat about 40% of the revenue receipts of the government. Officials said that the rationalisation exercise would be initially undertaken in 39 government departments. Some of them are town and country planning, industries and commerce, excise and taxation, transport, urban local bodies, higher education, school education, elementary education, technical education, public works, agriculture, irrigation, development and panchayats, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, supplies and disposal, information and public relations, sports, tourism, skill development, forests, social justice, mines and geology.Eight administrative secretaries in the rank of additional chief secretary and principal secretary and two IAS officers posted in the chief minister’s office have been allocated theses 39 departments to examine the organisational structures and service rules and propose modifications. They are expected to submit their reports by January 31. “The expected outcomes entailed examining existing posts, designations and their charter of duties, identification of areas of work of departments and their field offices, overlap between departments, studying adoption of information and communication technologies to streamline departmental deliverables and its impact on organisation structure and human resource availability,’” said an official quoting from a letter issued by the state government. Rightsizing exercise often hit roadblocksHowever, such rightsizing exercises have often hit hurdles. Referring to a similar exercise conducted earlier, the finance department in 2009 pointed out that a large number of administrative departments did not follow the restructuring and rightsizing exercise. “Instances have come to finance department notice that some posts which were kept in diminishing cadre (with a ban on future recruitment or promotions) proposals were being sent to the department of their revival. Such proposals were departure from the agreed outcome of the said exercise of restructuring on the same pretext that was considered and denied at the time of restructuring. The exercise of restructuring was a comprehensive exercise and the departments were fully involved and their views duly considered. The exercise of restructuring the staffing pattern was a complete re-engineering in the matters of pattern of staffing of the department,” said a finance department communication dated January 21, 2009 .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/improving-efficiency-haryana-attempts-to-cut-bureaucratic-flab/story-sAZTeEurFjAZ61rehdn3PK.html

02-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A face from Kashmir||It’s cold, and he’s away from home. At night he misses his parents.Azim Jawed is a winter migrant from Kashmir. Like scores of Kashmiri people every year, he undertook the great seasonal migration from the freezing villages and towns of the valley to the regions across Delhi, to escape the harsh winter climates and find work.Like Mr Jawed, many Kashmiri migrants settle in the Walled City during their winter migration, especially around the Jama Masjid. Right on cue, the tea stalls of the area start to serve Nun chai, the Kashmiri pink tea. This year, however, scores of tea shop owners and guest house managers confirm that the pandemic has restrained people from coming to the capital in large numbers.Mr Jawed is one among that slow trickle. Aged 19, he has found a temporary job running a footpath chai stall belonging to an eatery. This morning he is sitting behind the counter, waiting for customers.“It’s snowing at home,” he says while talking of his village in Badgam. Mr Jawed’s father is a farmer. Like the rest of his family, he could have stayed back in the village — “but I don’t like cold.” At this point, he pretends to shiver and vigorously shakes his head.Currently alone, the young man has been to Delhi before, and he says he is fond of its great crowds, and its noise. He likes the fact that “it is so different from Kashmir... when you are in Delhi, you cannot think that a place like my village exists… and when you are in my village, it is difficult to believe in a place like Delhi.”Starting into the empty pan — still no customers — Mr Jawed focuses on what he wants from life. He has no plan to be a farmer like his father. No, not even a tea seller. Neither does he intend to live permanently in Delhi. He eventually wants to set up his own business of “tent supply and wedding decoration” in his home district. His logic sounds sensible—“All other trades keep fluctuating, but people will always get married, so wedding decoration business will always guarantee money.”Looking contented with his argument, Mr Jawed says he will return home in March, and will then “start to set up my business with my father’s help.”And in case you are wondering, his tea stall serves the usual chai, not the Nun of Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-face-from-kashmir/story-uJTk5Ocy0wQ6igtB6TPUTJ.html

The soldier, Naib Subedar Ravinder, was a resident of Jhajjar, Haryana. “The Pakistani Army resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation on the line of control (LoC) in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district. Our troops responded strongly to enemy fire. In the incident, Naib Subedar Ravinder was critically injured and later succumbed to his injuries,” said a defence spokesperson. “Naib Subedar Ravinder was a brave, highly motivated and a sincere soldier. The nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,” added the spokesman. “At about 1530 hours (3.30 PM) Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars along LoC in Nowshera sector. In the evening at about 1730 hours (5.30 pm), Pakistan again initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation in Nowshera sector, prompting India to retaliate in equal measure,” said. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR)—a publicity wing of Pakistan’s armed forces posted on its website that Indian troops initiated ceasefire violation in Khuiratta sector along LOC. “Pakistan army troops responded befittingly. Reports of heavy losses to Indian troops in men and material. During intense exchange of fire, a valiant soldier Sepoy Fazal Elahi, age 35 years embraced shahadat (died),” ISPR stated on its website. It further claimed that Indian Army troops resorted to unprovoked fire in Kotkotera Sector deliberately targeting civilian population on December 30. “Due to indiscriminate fire of automatics in Phalni Bazar, a 34-year-old male suffered critical injuries. Pakistan army responded effectively and targeted those Indian posts which initiated fire,” it added. It further stated, “In Hotspring Sector, Pakistan army troops shot down an Indian Army Quad copter. Indian Quad Copter had come 100 meters inside our territory. The unprovoked act was responded befittingly wherein own troops shot down the quad-copter. In year 2020, 16 Indian quad-copters have been shot down by he Pakistan Army.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soldier-dies-in-pak-shelling-in-rajouri/story-MdR8xjIhTOF7XGLPpukk6L.html

This is the first Nagar Kirtan — a religious procession meant to mark a special occasion — organised at the border protest site by the Sikh farmers, after they had to give the ritual a pass during Guru Nanak Jayanti on November 30.The procession was headed by a tractor pulling a large customised trolley that was heavily decked with flowers and carried at least six people chanting hymns and distributing prasad. The tractor was followed by hundreds of devotees on foot, some Nihang Sikhs riding on horses, followed by other devotees riding modified vehicles. “If we were in Punjab, we would have had the Nagar Kirtan on the New Year day. Since we are settled here now, we thought it would be feasible to have the Nagar Kirtan on this day,” said one of the organisers, Jagdeesh Singh, who is from Jaldiyala in Jalandhar district of Punjab.The procession began around noon on Friday and slowly crawled its way through the maze of vehicles and people gathered at Singhu Border.Among the vehicles which were a part of the procession was a Maruti Alto modified into an open-air vehicle and a 1958-make modified Villy Jeep, which carried eight devotees.Read more| Farmers continue protests outside Delhi, say no question of withdrawing 2 demands“Our New Year celebrations will happen when the government agrees to our demand. Until then, we will keep any festivities limited to religious rituals and speeches,” said Khushwant Singh Sidhu, who belongs to Jagraon village in Ludhiana. Apart from the Nagar Kirtan, another smaller function included a dance performance by a Haryana farmer. “No one wanted to celebrate the New Year here. So, I decided to put up a performance for my farmer friends from Punjab and my state,” said the performer Chand Singh, a farmer from Kathura village in nearby Sonepat, amid hookah puffs. Farmers at the borders said call dropping had been a big challenge for them on Thursday night as they tried calling back home to wish their families for New Year. Paramjeet Singh, from Rampursunra village in Phagwara, said that the five Wi-Fi points arranged by the Delhi government recently were not enough to cater to the huge number of farmers present in the area. “We usually go to sleep here by 10.30-11 pm. But last night we stayed awake until 2 am just to wish our families. I could connect to them only around 2am after repeated attempts,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nagar-kirtan-dance-performance-mark-otherwise-muted-new-year-celebrations-at-singhu-border/story-UVNn2XcQ6L5s7dAJeMSRcI.html

Agnihotri also slammed the CM for continuously transferring government officers. “During the pandemic, the state government transferred deputy commissioners, secretary (health) and many IAS officers. Consequently, these officers have lost faith in the government. On top of it ministers pressure government officials to provide better jobs to their wives while MLAs tell them to provide jobs to their relatives. How are the officers to work for the people in such circumstances?” he asked.“Thakur does not have the capacity to take decisions. The only thing the state government has done during its three-year tenure is to overturn its decisions. One cabinet meeting is held for decision-making, while the other cabinet meeting is held to overturn the decision. By making such statements, he is just demoralising officials,” he said. “Jai Ram Thakur has proved himself to be the most incompetent CM in the history of the state. He is working as a puppet of the mafia, due to which the mafia flourishing in the state and crimes, especially rapes, are also on the rise in Himachal. Drug trade is increasing in the state at a rapid rate and state government has failed to control it,” he alleged.He also hit out at state government over its failure to prevent coronavirus pandemic and for inflating the bus fares, electricity charges, ration rates, petrol and diesel prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cm-not-brave-enough-to-accept-responsibility-for-his-own-failures-mukesh-agnihotri/story-gD1N0FN1tMobEU655vEa0K.html

According to additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Padwal, nakabandis were in place at different locations till 2am on Friday morning and at these checkpoints, police booked 20 people on the suspicion of consuming alcohol and driving. These people taken to nearby hospitals for blood tests to confirm their condition. As of 6am on Friday, 35 revellers had been arrested.This year, traffic police had made adequate preparations for New Year’s Eve, including conducting special drives for drink driving cases. Breathalysers were not used this year for fear of contracting and transmitting Covid-19. Instead, police personnel on duty relied on their observations and took those suspected of drink driving to hospitals to get tested for alcohol levels in their blood.Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Yashasvi Yadav said the number of drink drivers were low compared to last year owing mainly to the restrictions imposed by the state to prevent the spread of Covid-19. “This New Year’s Eve people had stayed inside as establishments were closed early due to section 144 being put in place by the government. This is the main reason that only 35 people were caught for drink driving,” said Yadav.According to the traffic police, 2,700 police personnel and other volunteers were stationed at different locations across the city and particularly at places where there are pubs and lounges and where large crowds were expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-35-people-booked-for-drink-driving-on-new-year-s-eve-in-mumbai/story-ynvnBVdNjVbsNI0V0lQP8L.html
02-01-2021||Chandigarh||23% drop in road mishaps in Himachal in 2020, says DGP||Director general of police Sanjay Kundu on Friday said there had been a 23% reduction in road mishaps and a 36% drop in injuries in Himachal in 2020.A total 2,187 road accidents took place in the state in 2020 (till December 26) against 2,844 mishaps in 2019. While 853 people died in crashes in 2020, 1,130 were killed on the road in 2019. Likewise, 3,105 people were injured as compared to 4,836 last year, the DGP said, adding that most road mishaps were caused due to speeding and largely two-wheelers and cars were involved in them.“Dangerous and negligent driving, overtaking, bad road conditions, drugs and alcohol abuse, adverse weather conditions and mechanical faults are also responsible for accidents,” he said. Kundu, who was in Dharamshala, said though the lockdown had played some part in reducing the number of accidents, predictive policing and shift in focus from penalising to road safety had been instrumental in improving the state’s road mishap statistics. “District-wise daily geographical and temporal mapping of accidents, root-cause analysis, micro-management and weekly review of the situation helped us identify the cause for accidents and curb them. Instead of issuing challans, the police shifted its focus to road safety and deployed doppler radars and laser speed guns to check speeding, which resulted in decline in accidents,” he said. Maintaining that the year 2020 had been productive for the Himachal Pradesh Police, the DGP said predictive policing had helped check crime. “We are now analysing crime trends on a weekly basis instead of monthly or quarterly basis and can predict what may happen in a particular area,” he said. Apart from it, the police also introduced Register Number 26 to profile sexual offenders, which helped reduce crime against women. He said cyber crime was on the rise said the police was issuing advisories from time to time to make the public aware of such crimes.On resolutions for the New Year, Kundu said, “The Himachal Police has set some objectives, on which work will be done extensively. We want to improve the crackdown on drugs and make the roads safer for women and children. Reducing road accidents and improving infrastructure facilities for the force will also be a priority.” The health of police personnel will also be prioritised and facilities will be provided to keep them fit and active, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/23-drop-in-road-mishaps-in-himachal-in-2020-says-dgp/story-kHqjmFQpU5ER7SnqRrRxgP.html

Since then, the traffic police department has managed to contact 4,600 motorists and recover the fines from 2,596 violators.According to joint commissioner of police (traffic) Yashasvi Yadav, the call centre has two help desk personnel and two constables to make calls to violators to remind them to pay their dues.“There were a lot of pending e-challans. We set up the call centre to reach out to those motorists who had not paid the fines. We will continue the call centre until the entire pending amount is recovered,” said Yadav.Traffic police officers said there was a backlog of 29 lakh unpaid e-challans for various violations, amounting to ₹315 crore.“We had earlier made public appeals, urging motorists to pay their dues, but did not get a proper response. A mobile app was also launched to make it easier for the violators to pay their fines, but that too failed to work,” said an officer.Earlier, the traffic police had requested the regional transport department to cancel the licences of 2,000 motorists who failed to pay their pending e-challans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/call-centre-set-up-by-mumbai-traffic-cops-recovers-e-challans-worth-1-12-crore/story-UquAeuTLodsKchroY2XrKO.html
02-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 vaccination dry run in four districts today||With the Covid cases under control, the state government is now focussing on the vaccination drive, which is set to begin soon. The state will hold a dry run for the vaccination programme in four districts in different regions on Saturday. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state administration was fully prepared and they were waiting for the Centre’s approval to start the drive. “Dry run basically means a mock drill of the actual vaccination drive, where the entire process, right from sending messages to people, verifying identification of those who reach the health centre, giving them dummy vaccine shots and keeping them under observation will be carried out. This will help in plugging potential problems that might occur while conducting the vaccination drive,” Tope said. Tope said the Centre wanted them to hold the dry run in one district, but they have chosen four in four different regions. Pune (western Maharashtra), Nagpur (Vidarbha), Nandurbar (north Maharashtra) and Jalna (central Maharashtra) will have the dry run on Saturday. Maharashtra reported 3,524 new cases on Friday, taking the tally to 1,935,636, while the toll reached 49,580, with 59 new casualties. Mumbai clocked 631 cases on Friday, taking the case count to 2,94,067. The city has 8,943 active cases. Nine deaths took the city’s toll to 11,125. Until Friday, 67 United Kingdom (UK) returnees have tested positive for Covid-19, however, it is yet to be confirmed if any of them carry the new, more transmissible strain of Covid-19.“In each district, the dry run will be conducted at three health centres and 25 health workers have been selected for the shots. Each centre will have a team of five, with one vaccinator and four supporting staff for identification, maintenance of protocols and making entries on Co-WIN mobile app prepared by the ministry of health and family welfare. The team will also observe (during actual vaccination) Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) protocol to check if the participant shows any health complications or side effects post vaccination,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of health services. They will also run a test on the toll-free number, 104, where people appointed at any of the vaccination centres can call and inform about a difficulty or emergency situation for support. Each centre will have officials from the state health department, World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) to oversee the mock drill, she added. The health centres have been equipped with a waiting room, vaccination room and observation room, apart from facilities such as electricity connection, internet connectivity and security arrangements, the officials said. After conducting a dry run of vaccination in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat on December 28 and 29, the Centre has decided to extend the drill to rest of the country on January 2. In the dry run, the entire process of transporting the vaccines from storage to the site, administering them to candidates, feeding data on Co-WIN app is practised without any real vaccine. The state government has made preparations to administer a vaccine to around 3.25 crore people, which will be completed in three phases. Vaccine shots will be given to health workers, frontline workers and citizens above the age of 50 years and having co-morbidities.

To preserve vaccines, cold storages are ready and the state administration is fully prepared. We are waiting for the Centre’s nod for the vaccination drive,” the health minister said Maharashtra has reported fewer than 5,000 cases for the past 28 straight days, although the state authorities have expressed fear of a spike in the first week of January in view of the crowding during Christmas and new year celebrations. The state completed a total of 1,28,23,834 Covid tests with 76,201 tests conducted on Friday. The positivity rate for the day has declined to 4.62% against the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 15.09%. “A total of 4,471 UK returnees who had landed between November 15 and December 23 have been traced till date. RT-PCR tests have been conducted on 3,273 of them, and 67 samples were found positive. Of them, 29 are from Mumbai, Pune (13), Thane (7), Nagpur (8), 2 each from Nashik, Aurangabad, Raigad, Buldhana and one each from Nanded and Washim,” said state surveillance office Dr Pradip Awate. He said that 61 samples have been referred to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to ascertain if they are infected with the new variant. The state has also traced 422 people who have come in contact with the UK returnees and 26 of them have tested positive for Covid-19, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-vaccination-dry-run-in-four-districts-today/story-eVjzXKEI1NbGIhRBoNAG0I.html

Complainant clicked on the link and filled the form with his wife’s details and selected a reputed gas agency’s option.Read more: Mumbai tops cybercrime frauds in 2019, Bengaluru ranks 2nd: National Crime Records BureauTwo days later the complainant received a call from a person who identified himself as DK Varma, a relationship manager of a firm ‘LPG Vitrak Chayan’. Varma told the complainant that his application was approved and his firm will help him get the license for LPG distributorship and grant of ₹30 lakh from Government of India to start the agency, the police said.Varma later asked the complainant to pay the fees for processing the registration, no objection certificate (NOC), license and contract document. As complainant wanted to move to his hometown in Bihar, post his retirement, he accepted the offer and made online payment of ₹3.66 lakh, the officer said.When complainant received confirmation letter for the LPG gas agency it had a Mumbai address mentioned in it. For verification, the complainant visited the address and found it to be wrong.The complainant then visited the website again, and after carefully inspecting the site discovered that the website was a fake one, and the accused used similar-looking name to cheat people.The complainant then approached the cyber police officers.

02-01-2021||Mumbai||All eyes are now on Mumbai civic body polls: Congress chalks out road map||In a first, the central leadership of the Congress has chalked out a programme to be implemented by its Mumbai unit for the upcoming civic polls. From defining the roles of newly appointed team leaders, to directing them to hold padyatras and outreach programme and appointment of local committees, the central leadership has prepared a time-bound schedule for the next four months. Contrary to the traditional style, the party has not only constituted various committees for the election, which is a year away, but has also specified the roles of each member of the leaders’ team. The city unit, which is known for decades-old factionalism, has been given message to work together, by dividing responsibilities among various camps and finetuning roles for each of them. Read more: Mumbai Congress vows to go solo in civic body pollsThe All India Congress Committee (AICC), the highest decision-making body of the party, appointed a team to lead the city unit two weeks ago, ahead of the crucial elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. Besides the president, it has appointed a working president and key leaders to head coordination, manifesto and campaign committee. Days after the appointments, the party has directed the Mumbai president to complete Padyatra covering 100km in100 days, organise 10 public meetings with key local leaders, launch membership drive and complete the appointment at executive committees. Working president Charan Singh Sapra has been directed to restructure the media cell by January 26 and establish a network of social media workers till booth level, create a Facebook page for every district and WhatsApp groups in each of the booth. Campaign committee head Arif Naseem Khan has been directed to identify the issues to be taken up in the campaign, while coordination committee chief Amarjit Sing Manhas has been asked to better the coordination between state and city leaders. Apart from chalking out the schedule for the meetings at various levels, the leadership has also earmarked the responsibilities to be completed in the next four months. Constitution of various committees, training of spokesperson and officerbearers has to be completed in every district and block by the end of April. “This is happening for the first time. The Central leadership would never take interest in functioning of the city or state units after announcing the names to lead the units. The BMC elections are being taken very seriously by the leadership, perhaps in the wake of the grand show by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the recently held Hyderabad civic polls. This has, however, sent a strong message among city leaders and workers establishing the fact that central leadership is monitoring the unit closely,” said a senior city leader, requesting anonymity. “The meticulously chalked out plan has helped in charging up the party rank and file. AICC, through the road map, has sent out a message that it is serious about the Mumbai unit and the forthcoming elections. There will be no room for factionalism in the city unit, as the new leadership is ready for discussion and dialogue. The Mumbai Congress will not only implement the programme given by the AICC but regain its old glory,” said Sapra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/all-eyes-are-now-on-mumbai-civic-body-polls-congress-chalks-out-road-map/story-Od9k7QdNu48SYUn4CE6tqN.html

This comes as a huge relief for residents of Sohana, Kumbra and other localities falling in these sectors, as they were paying much higher user charges. While GMADA charged ₹10 per 1,000 litres on an average, the MC charges just ₹1.8 for the same quantity of water. Residents had been demanding rationalisation of the tariff for long. After much deliberations, on December 23, a memorandum of understanding was signed by executive engineers of both the authorities in the presence of cabinet minister and local MLA Balbir Singh Sidhu. GMADA has sent a final water bill to residents and asked them to deposit the amount by January 15.

PUTA has been pressing vice-chancellor Raj Kumar to hold the interviews of teachers for promotion under CAS immediately.According to PUTA, over 80 teachers of the university are waiting to be promoted. Varsity had held a few interviews of teachers under CAS in December, but PUTA members have resolved to continue the protest until all the pending cases of promotions are not cleared by the university.Letter to chancellor On December 30, PUTA again wrote to Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of the university, requesting him to direct the vice-chancellor to complete the CAS promotions without further delay.“The pace at which the vice-chancellor is conducting these meetings clearly shows that the career advancement process of teachers, who are the backbone of the university headed by him, stands nowhere on his agenda,” states the letter to chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-teachers-body-protest-over-promotions-enters-43rd-day/story-oJ6BllZDNyX6n1qxEV0fyL.html

02-01-2021||City||2020 Chandigarh’s wettest year in decade||CHANDIGARH About 1218.5mm of rain over the past 12 months in Chandigarh has made 2020 its wettest year in a decade, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) records have revealed.This is 15% above the normal precipitation figure (1059.3mm) for the city, which is calculated by taking the average of the past 30 years. Last year, total 916mm of rain had been recorded and it was 13.5% deficient. After 2020, the second highest rainfall in the past decade was in 2018 at 1069.3mm, 0.94% in excess of normal.Explaining what was different in 2020, Chandigarh IMD director Surender Paul said, “This year, there were lesser western disturbances (WD) that affected the region. Though WDs bring a lot of rain to the region, they also push back the moisture-laden easterly winds which are usually present up to the southern parts of Haryana. Due to the interaction of both these systems this year, there was higher than normal rain.”Paul added that while Chandigarh received higher than normal rain, its adjoining stations were mostly at normal. “Chandigarh’s position at the foothills of the Himalayas also works favourably for rainfall here. We had above normal monsoons and strong pre-monsoons in the city,” he added.Total 920.1mm of rain was received in the monsoon months, making it higher than the normal of 845.7mm — 8.8% in excess. However, Paul said it was too early to determine whether the same trend will continue this year and how much rain can be expected in the 2021 monsoon.Rain likely from todayWestern disturbances will be active in the city from Saturday onwards and chances of rain will continue up to January 5. “While possibility of rain will be low on Saturday, up to 30mm rain can be expected Sunday onwards,” said Paul. An orange warning for thunderstorm and hail has been issued by the IMD in the region on Sunday and Monday, asking people to be prepared.The rain is likely to bring relief from the frequent spells of cold wave in the city. “Wind speeds will increase from Saturday due to which fog formation will be affected. However, temperature will rise after January 6 again and dense fog could engulf the region. It is likely that temperatures will fall further and we will see the coldest spell of the season in this duration,” the IMD director said.Visibility on Friday morning dropped below 50 metres, while the fog made the minimum temperature rise up from 2.7°C on Thursday to 6.1°C. Maximum temperature went up from 16.3°C on Thursday to 17.4°C on Friday. In the next three days, day temperature will remain between 18°C and 20°C while night temperature will be 7- 9°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2020-chandigarh-s-wettest-year-in-decade/story-wDvw4q5mnZYzp9VjUeTpNN.html
02-01-2021||City||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena, Congress fight over renaming Aurangabad; BJP mocks them||Ruling partners in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Shiv Sena and Congress are again at the loggerhead over the renaming of Aurangabad city. Congress has opposed Sena’s proposal of renaming it after Sambhaji Maharaj, while the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has termed it as a ‘fixed fight’. Ahead of the ensuing civic polls in Aurangabad, the Shiv Sena has raked up the old issue of the renaming of the city as Sambhaji Nagar. The original proposal was passed by the party in Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, ruled by it for more than three decades, in June 1995. The BJP too had supported the proposal and issued a notification during the Sena-BJP alliance government. The proposal was challenged by a Congress corporator in the high court and later in the Supreme Court. Congress has said as a ruling party it will be opposed strongly. Thorat said changing the names of places was not a part of the Common Minimum Programme of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, in which Congress and NCP are partners. “If any proposal about renaming Aurangabad as Sambhaji Nagar comes up, the Congress will strongly oppose it. Congress does not believe in changing names as it does not benefit the common man, Thorat said and asserted that although his party is a part of the MVA alliance, it will surely oppose such a proposal. However, I am not aware of any proposal about renaming Aurangabad,” he further said. The renaming issue is seen as another flashpoint between Sena and Congress, the two ruling parties in the MVA government. Recently, Congress had hit out at its ally after Sena MP Sanjay Raut criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and expressed the need to change the leadership of United Progressive Alliance. Mocking the Sena, leader of the Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that it remembers the renaming issue only when elections approach. The Sena raked up the issue again when the civic elections are round the corner. Fadnavis added and pointed out that Sena will forget the issue once the elections are over. On Friday Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant questioned why Modi government has failed to approve the proposal of renaming Aurangabad airport after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj six months after MVA government sent it to the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-shiv-sena-congress-fight-over-renaming-aurangabad-bjp-mocks-them/story-yDeuZnkgjcL6Dr7PGkeT0H.html

02-01-2021||Delhi||New Year revellers choke central Delhi despite restrictions||Roads on central Delhi were choked with vehicles on New Year’s Day as revellers hit areas around India Gate, Connaught Place, Purana Qila, Sunder Nursery and Indraprastha Park. Delhi traffic police said that from around 2pm on Friday, people started pouring into the India Gate lawns, after which the section of the road leading to the monument had to be closed for general public. However, this did not help traffic congestion on the roads around the area. Traffic control room records showed that in the evening, long traffic snarls were reported from Tilak Marg, ITO, Mandi House, India Gate roundabout, Connaught Place outer circle, Zakir Hussain Marg, Akbar Road, Teen Murti Marg and Shanti Path. Anil Mittal, additional spokesperson, Delhi Police said at one time during the day, at least 5,000 people were present at India Gate on Friday. “People kept coming and going as there were restrictions on public gathering. Adequate staff was deployed at India Gate and nearby areas to ensure that the visitors adhered to social distancing norms and wore face masks. Traffic police was also deployed in adequate strength to make sure the traffic movement remains smooth,” Mittal said. Despite the fact that Delhi Zoo, which was a major attraction among the public on New Year’s Day till last year, was closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, people gathered around Purana Qila to enjoy street food and ice creams. This also led to traffic hold ups around Bhairon Marg, Pragati Maidan and around Indraprastha flyover. Traffic police officials also said that apart from these favourite hangouts, large gatherings were also seen around Sunder Nursery and South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s (SDMC) Waste to Wonder Park, near Sarai Kale Khan. “Cars were parked on roadsides and people walking on the roadside were one of the main reasons for traffic jams around these spots, Additional traffic officials were deployed around these areas to manage the rush,” the Delhi traffic police said. Looking at the rush by afternoon, the Delhi police on Friday had to direct the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to restrict entry and exit in at least five Metro stations to control crowd in the central Delhi. “Exit gates of Khan Market, Supreme Court, Central Secretariat and Mandi House are closed. Entry and interchange is permitted at these stations,” DMRC tweeted on Friday. All entry/exit gates were however opened by 6pm. The exit gates of the Rajiv Chowk Metro stations were shut down from 4pm because of the increase in the footfall in Connaught Place. Because of the high influx of people at the Metro gates, and the Covid-19 restrictions, the average waiting time of trains went up to 35 minutes. DMRC officials said that this was done on the directions of Delhi police, as a security measure to control crowd in these stations. “We were told that it is around these stations that people gather the most for New Year’s celebrations,” said a DMRC spokesperson. People posted pictures of traffic jams on social media. “Massive traffic jam is seen on Captain Gaur Marg, starting from C-block East of Kailash traffic signal. The construction at Ashram Chowk is making things worse for commuters,” tweeted VK Aggarwal. Another commuter, Ayush Sariyar tweeted, “Huge traffic block at Karol Bagh-Jhandewalan stretch. Long queue of vehicles, blocking the arterial road.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-year-revellers-choke-central-delhi-despite-restrictions/story-sBXY4hXt0ixfPaRFt3k8lL.html

02-01-2021||Chandigarh||AAP will soon announce its CM face in Punjab: Raghav Chadha||The newly appointed AAP Punjab co-incharge Raghav Chadha on Friday said the party would soon announce its chief ministerial candidate for 2022 assembly elections in the state.On a visit to the state, Chadha visited the Golden Temple and Dugiana Temple on Friday. He was accompanied by leader of the opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema and other party MLAs. Later, he was joined by AAP state president and MP Bhagwant Mann during a press conference here.On a question about AAP’s CM face for Punjab, Chadha said, “He will be a person Punjab could feel proud of.” Chadha, who is AAP MLA from Rajendra Nagar in Delhi and national spokesperson of the party, said, “The party will register a landslide victory in 2022 assembly polls. Punjab had been looted by the SAD-BJP and the Congress governments. Now, the people of Punjab have made up their minds that only one party can take Punjab on the path of progress, and this time they will ensure an Aam Aadmi Party government in the state.”Alleging that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had “betrayed” the people of Punjab, Chadha said, “Before the elections, the Congress had made many promises such as waiving all debts of farmers, Ghar-Ghar Rozgar, eradicating drugs in four weeks; but none of them were fulfilled. Intoxicated with power, Captain forgot his people and reneged on all his promises”.Lashing out at the Badals of SAD, Chadha said, “When these black (farm) laws were enacted, SAD, for its greed of power, remained part of the Modi-led central government. After the bill came, they kept praising the anti-farmers black laws. Even when these were passed in the Parliament and became laws, Harsimrat Kaur Badal remained the union minister. But, after seeing the anger of the people, she resigned out of compulsion,” he added. Chadha said the people were especially impressed with the work done by the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi in the health and education sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-will-soon-announce-its-cm-face-in-punjab-chadha/story-w3j1086iQlS862Bw9llxCK.html
02-01-2021||Delhi||Air slips into severe zone, city witnesses first smog episode||Low temperature, dense fog and cracker bursting on New Year’s eve, pushed Delhi’s air quality into the severe zone on Friday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index (AQI) in the city on Friday was 441 -- a major drop from Thursday’s AQI recording of 347, which is categorised as very poor. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) recordings show that the concentration of PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) started rising from Thursday midnight and reached above the 300ug/m3 mark. The ambient air quality standard for PM 2.5 levels in India is 60ug/m3. At 8pm on Friday, the average PM2.5 levels in the city were 313.3ug/m3. “There were instances of cracker bursting around some residential neighbourhoods. The emissions from these combined with the dense fog cause the smog that we saw in the early morning hours. The radiative fog mixed with high PM (particulate matter) levels also reduced visibility,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre. IMD recordings show that at 6am, the visibility at Safdarjung and the Palam observatory was zero metres, and it stayed below 200 metres till around 9am. IMD scientists said that the pollution levels are expected to improve by Saturday morning. Soni said the wind direction changed from north-westerly to easterly on Friday afternoon. He added that the ventilation conditions in Delhi were poor and the mixing height was also low, which led to pollutants getting trapped closer to the surface. The mixing height is the height of vertical mixing of air and suspended particles above the ground. This height is primarily determined by temperature. When the temperature increases, the air expands and pushes the height higher, giving pollutants closer to the ground more space to mix with the atmosphere. He also said that the change in winds direction will also improve wind speeds on Saturday and help disperse pollutants. “Our forecast had said that there was a possibility of the AQI deteriorating on Friday and that was primarily because the wind speeds were calm for a large part of Friday morning. However, wind speed picked up from afternoon after the change in direction,” Soni said. He added that on Saturday, the average wind speeds are likely to be around 15kmph and improvement in air quality will be visible from Saturday morning itself. The IMD has also forecasted a western disturbance to impact the city from Saturday, which will also lead to rainfall activities in some parts of Delhi. “This will also bring relief.” Despite the assurance of a better weekend, on Friday evening at least 28 out of the total 37 pollution monitoring stations were in the ‘severe’ zone. These areas included Mundka, Alipur, RK Puram, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, Rohini, Dwarka sector-8, Bawana, and Narela among others. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) also said that high moisture content in the city’s air and calm winds led to the deterioration in pollution. “Surface winds became extremely calm as forecasted and the low dispersion conditions led to accumulation and trapping of pollutants near surface. The radiative fog mixed with high PM levels made it smog and reduced the visibility further,” Safar analysis read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-slips-into-severe-zone-city-witnesses-first-smog-episode/story-UdN77EyjIIYHHZpdFqCRPP.html

The officer said that the year was challenging for the police since the pandemic left them “mentally, physically and officially over stretched”.“ We have discussed with a bank for better insurance for our personnel. Now, insurance cover for natural deaths of police personnel has been raised from R5 lakh to R28 lakh and for deaths in accidents from R30 lakh to R78 lakh,” said Mittal. He said that now even families of suicide victims will be offered R10 lakh as compensation.The police in 2020 also opened seven wellness centres in police colonies where 11,700 personnel and their families sought medical consultation. “Now there is a compulsory medical check up for our personnel over the age of 40 so that any illnesses are diagnosed and treated in time,” said the officer.The police said that 5,645 personnel of the ranks from constable to sub-inspectors were promoted through 2020. These included three out-of-turn promotions for personnel who helped recover 50 or more missing children through the year. A total of 190 personnel were also hired on compassionate grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-612-delhi-cops-infected-with-covid-19-in-2020-97-recovered/story-CCCGz1LSblfWvL7tWWPsYN.html
02-01-2021||Delhi||7 arrested in Rs 1.5 crore burglary case in Chandni Chowk||Five robbers and two people who bought stolen property have been arrested in connection with an over Rs 1.5 crore burglary that was reported from north Delhi’s Kinari Bazar near Chandni Chowk on November 22, police said on Friday. Stolen diamond, gold and silver jewellery items and documents of two properties, which were purchased after selling some stolen valuables, have been recovered from the arrested persons.To escape arrest in Delhi, two key members of the gang on December 4 had surrendered themselves before the Uttar Pradesh police in a robbery case in which they were wanted, a police officer said. The duo was sent to Dasna jail, from where one of them, identified as Jeeshan Ali,32, was bailed out on December 24. The Delhi Police have taken custody of the other jailed burglar, 35-year-old Mobin (single name), in the Chandni Chowk case, said police officers associated with the probe.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said on November 22, a businessman, Ankit Gupta, had reported to the police that the gate of his Kinari Bazar house was broke open and Rs 5 lakh cash and jewellery worth around Rs 1.5 crore were stolen. During the probe, an investigator said, it was learnt that Gupta’s parents lived in the house but they had moved to his northwest Delhi home in October after their house help went to his hometown. The special staff team was roped in on December 22, as the local police could not solve the case.The team collected information about the suspects through technical surveillance and a ring of informers. On December 26, three of them Jeeshan Ali, Ikram alias Lambu, and Azad Ali, were arrested while they were going to dispose of the stolen jewellery in Karol Bagh.“Their interrogation led to the arrest of two other burglars – Rijayul Hasan,32, and Mobin – and the two receivers of their stolen property Mohammad Akram,48, and Irfan alias Chunnu,35. Mobin and Jeeshan had purchased one property each in Uttar Pradesh using their booty,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-arrested-in-rs1-5-crore-burglary-case-in-chandni-chowk/story-2irHQUbvnO14T911fKBDIP.html
02-01-2021||Education||CBSE Board exams schedule: Schools, parents concerned over practicals||With schools in the national capital closed since March and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announcing practical exams in two months, several teachers and principals are concerned how these assessments will be conducted with barely any hands-on learning experience, especially for science stream students.As many as 2,168 schools in the national capital are affiliated to the CBSE, which usually begins conducting board exams for class 10 and 12 students in February. On Thursday, the board announced that it would conduct exams between May and June and practicals from March 1.CBSE controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj specified that there would be “no dilution in quality measures of the exams” by the board. “Generally, schools would have time between January and mid-February to conduct board examinations. This time, however, after consultations with all stakeholders, we have increased that time period. Practical exams can be conducted by schools between March and June 10. This would allow schools to have the flexibility to conduct practical exams in smaller batches while maintaining social distancing and other Covid-19 guidelines.”Several principals are worried as many parents are not eager to send their children to school before the Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. School authorities have also planned to discuss the issue with parents once schools reopen after winter vacation.Divya Bhatia, principal of Amity International School, Saket, said that it would be “impossible” for class 12 students to appear for science practicals in front of an external examiner before getting any hands-on experience.“Every science subject has 8-10 experiments. Students need to see the deflections of a galvanometer or make electrical circuits on their own. For Biology, they need to look at cells under a microscope available in school, do titration and other experiments in Chemistry,” she said, adding that they plan to talk to parents to see if they would be willing to allow children to come to labs in smaller batches.Principals are also uncertain about the mode of practical examination for the boards. Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, said, “We need more clarity on whether practical examinations will be conducted in online or offline mode. If exams are conducted in offline mode, we will need to give students some hands-on experience before the test.”The internal assessment component comprises 20-30 marks for several subjects and often include a practical component in the form of projects or viva voce or both. Teachers said they are not facing as much difficulty in other subjects as compared to science subjects.For instance, in Computer Science, which carries 30 marks in the practicals category, Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that since most students have computers at home, classes have continued without much difficulty. For subjects like Psychology where students are required to conduct psychological tests as practicals, the component has gone online.“Students are either carrying out the tests online or they are conducting it on their family members. For subjects like Political Science and History, teachers are organising individual virtual interaction with students for clarity on their projects,” she said, adding that they are still waiting for instructions from authorities if schools can be reopened or not.The challenge is even bigger at Delhi government schools where most of the students from underprivileged backgrounds do not have uninterrupted access to “virtual labs or online practicals”.Mudassir Jahan, head of school at a girls’ government school in south Delhi’s Noor Nagar, said, “In the next two months, if cases reduce and the government allows, we will call some students to school in smaller batches of maybe five students while following all Covid-19 guidelines. Till then, we can send recorded video experiments to them. Our concern is towards low-performing students who need additional in-person assistance in all subjects.”Despite repeated attempts, Delhi government spokespersons and officials in the deputy chief minister’s office did not respond to requests for a comment on the matter.In October, the Delhi government had written to CBSE over practical exams. “Practical and project work are an integral part of any subject. It is pertinent to give students hands-on practice for the same for a sufficient period of time,” read the letter sent on October 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cbse-board-exams-schedule-schools-parents-concerned-over-practicals/story-47X344Ey6hQvignFRbRbZO.html

The whole world had to fight Covid-19 – the biggest pandemic faced by humankind. I take this chance to salute and honour our Corona-warriors, doctors, nurses, medical staff, policemen, sanitation workers, and all socio-religious institutions. You continued to serve the public even in such a difficult time,” said Kejriwal.Kejriwal further said, “During these testing times, our strong health care system has set countless examples before the world. Delhi showed that we are on par with other developed countries of the world. During this pandemic, several initiatives of Delhi were replicated by many countries and governments across the world,” he added. “This year may have come to an end but Covid-19 still persists. We must take all precautions and follow the guidelines to keep ourselves safe. We hope that a vaccine arrives in India soon, so that things return to normal. Until then, please take care of yourselves and your family,” Kejriwal said.In Delhi, as on December 31, 625,369 people had been infected by the virus, since the first case was reported on March 2. Even though 609,322 of them have recovered, 10,536 succumbed to the virus, said government records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fight-against-covid-not-over-says-cm-kejriwal-in-his-new-year-message/story-MJnANM20n3g2aVnhDm1Y2L.html
02-01-2021||Delhi||Let bars, restaurants stay open till 3am, says Delhi govt panel||A committee set up by the Delhi government to augment excise revenue in the Capital has recommended that restaurants, clubs and pubs be allowed to stay open till 3am instead of 1am; be allowed to serve full bottles on the table; and to serve liquor in open areas such as rooftops and balconies.The panel has also said that anyone over the age of 21 should be able to get a drink at a bar or a hotel. In Delhi, at least on paper, the minimum age to be served liquor at an establishment is 25. The report, uploaded on the excise department’s website for feedback from stakeholders ahead of drafting a policy, has also called for licence fee for bars to be rationalised on the basis of location instead of seating capacity; for it to be made easier for restaurants which have a valid fire safety certificate to get a bar licence; and for establishments to be allowed to purchase liquor from retailers too, instead of only wholesalers as mandated by current rules. The report, which HT has seen, also recommended that provisions be made for additional liquor serving counters (for an extra fee) and that establishments be allowed to store liquor anywhere inside their premises, including refrigerators, instead of specific storage rooms, and doing away with the provision of issuing a public notice in the neighbourhood to record objections before granting liquor licence, something that it said is often misued by competitors to block a new licence from being issued. After the feedback process ends, the government will draft a policy and table it before the Delhi cabinet. If approved, after incorporating changes (if any), the policy will be notified and excise rules will be changed accordingly, said a senior official in the excise department who asked not to be named.The same committee has also recommended that the number of dry days in the Capital be reduced from 21 on an average to three per year, norms be relaxed for departmental stores to avail licence for selling wine and beer, and equitable distribution of government-operated liquor stores across all 272 municipal wards, areas under New Delhi Municipal Council and the Indira Gandhi International Airport.The committee was set up in September by Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the portfolios of finance and excise, to augment the government’s excise revenue, simplifying liquor pricing mechanism, checking malpractices, ensuring equitable access, and helping the government in its ease of doing business policy, which is primarily aimed at recovery of state revenues in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.Delhi’s projected excise revenue for 2021-22 is ₹7,651 crore – up from ₹5,068.7 crore, the actual revenue for 2019-20, said an official in the finance department.The committee noted that Delhi currently has 720 functional retail liquor stores – of which nearly 40% sell only country liquor – in local shopping complexes, as against 1,190 liquor stores in Mumbai and 1,794 in Bengaluru. Other than that, Delhi has around 800 bars located in hotels, restaurants, pubs and clubs. While those in five-star hotels are allowed to operate 24x7 under a special license which costs a hefty fee, most bars located in restaurants, clubs and pubs have to wrap up by 1am under the current norms. Liquor shops in the city have to shut by 10pm.“We welcome these recommendations. The progressive measures will help the industry that is one of the highest employment generators in the country. It will also be a booster shot for tourism and vibrancy of New Delhi which was losing out to its fellow metros. It will ultimately lead to a more vibrant and stronger economy,” said Riyaaz Amlani, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, a collective of more than 500,000 restaurants across the country.Vinod Giri, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), said: “The objectives set by the government are spot on. The premise behind the recommendations is right, and some recommendations are obvious winners… We applaud this initiative. It shows that the Delhi government has its focus on policies that work for all stakeholders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/let-bars-restaurants-stay-open-till-3am-says-delhi-govt-panel/story-eAGs37HgdauyseScpP1lyM.html
02-01-2021||Delhi||Case lodged against Nehru Place bar-cafe for Covid rules violations||The Delhi Police on Friday said they had registered a case against “MHouse”, a bar and cafe in south Delhi’s Nehru Place, and arrested its manager for allegedly violating Covid-19 guidelines and night restrictions that were imposed in Delhi to prevent large gathering in public places for New Year celebrations due to the pandemic.The police said that the MHouse management was serving “hookah” to the guests despite not having a licence for it and they have taken photographs of the same. But the management of the cafe and bar management, refuted the allegations by saying that “nobody was served sheesha (hukka)” and that the police only “found sheesha lying in boxes”. Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said that around 2 am on January 1, the Kalkaji police station team team reached the MHouse. “There was a crowd who were being served hukka and alcohol. Moreover, the guidelines of social distancing were not being followed by them,” said DCP Meena.DCP Meena said that the manager of the club, Umesh Chand, was asked about the permission of the bar as well as the cafe but he could not produce them. The officer said the manager could not give any satisfactory reply. The team members took photographs of the bar and cafe and asked the manager to accompany them to the police station.“As the social distancing guidelines and directions of night curfew (restrictions) issued by the Delhi government were being followed, a case was registered under section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act, and Indian Penal Code’s Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), and 4/21 (1) of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) Act. The manager, Umesh Chand was arrested,” said Meena.Chand, who was later released from the police station, in a statement denied the allegations. “...There was no sheesha (hukka) served in our premises. When the police team visited our premises sheesha was lying in boxes. I would also like to update that we were maintaining social distancing in our outlet as per DDMA guidelines and we have all valid licenses to operate our premises and the same was also shown to the concerned police,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/case-lodged-against-nehru-place-bar-cafe-for-covid-rules-violations/story-GiDnPVR4KzWzcHA5eqIImN.html
02-01-2021||Pune||Students in Pune unhappy with MPSC decision to restrict number of attempts||After the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) announced to limit attempts for candidates for its competitive examinations, students preparing for these exams have been upset. Several student organisations have written directly to the state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday to rethink about this decision as it will affect thousands of candidates now. According to the MPSC’s order issued on December 30, candidates from the open category will now have only six attempts, OBC candidates will have nine attempts and there won’t be any limit for attempts for SC and ST category candidates. “It is my sixth attempt for the MPSC competitive exams which I will appear in the year 2021 and if I couldn’t make it then it will be the last attempt. This decision taken by the state government is certainly not right, as I am preparing and giving various competitive exams from the last five years. I come from a farmer’s family from a remote village in Solapur district; my parents are struggling hard only to send me money for my studies. And if such decisions on restrictions on attempts are implemented then it would be the end for me and several other students preparing for MPSC exams,” said Sagar Abnawe, a student preparing for MPSC student. While student organisations have also opposed this decision, Kuldeep Ambekar, president of students’ helping hand organisation said, “The decision taken by the state government in restricting the attempts especially for the open category students is worrying. Already the reservation issue is hot and Maratha community reservation case is pending in Supreme Court, on that background this decision is not right. Compared to UPSC administration, the MPSC and its officials working are very careless. Also, students have suffered a lot due to the Covid-19 pandemic and now they were again preparing for exams when this order was made. We have given a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray to reconsider this decision and take it back for the benefit of lakhs of students in the state.” While Kalpesh Yadav, Pune city president, Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena said, “Today for a few hundred posts opened by MPSC, lakhs of students appeared for the exams in hope that they will crack it and get a chance to serve our Maharashtra state. When this order was issued yesterday, students got worried and it’s confusing them, MPSC should give proper and clear information about it to students. While putting restrictions on number of attempts, MPSC should also try to improve their own management of work-related to conducting the exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-unhappy-with-mpsc-decision-to-restrict-number-of-attempts/story-0y4LIaDZjWAFbt78c5FAxN.html

02-01-2021||Pune||Pawar to hold meeting on water quota for Pune city||Pune district guardian minister Ajit Pawar will call a meeting on city’s drinking water quota after the irrigation department sought to reduce the allocation from Khadakwasla reservoir. With the city receiving an additional 2.5 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) water supply from Bhama Askhed dam, the irrigation department has demanded to reduce the existing water quota from Khadakwasla dam and allot it to rural areas. Pawar said, “The irrigation department officials met me before the inauguration of Bhama Askhed water project and gave the proposal to reduce water supply from Khadakwasla dam. We would call a meeting on it that will be attended by MLAs from city and rural parts in the next fifteen days to arrive at an amicable decision.” Pawar said, “I am not for cutting water supply for the city as its population is increasing. With the 24x7 water scheme being executed and additional supply from Bhama Askhed dam, water will be saved. We are trying to process maximum water through sewage treatment plants. After the grampanchayat elections, a decision would be taken on it by calling a separate meeting with all stakeholders.” BJP city unit president Chandrakant Patil said, “There is always a conflict between rural and urban areas over water supply. PMC has asked for additional water quota from Khadakwasla dam for the 23 villages merged within the PMC limits. The guardian minister must call a meeting on it and all leaders must need to address the issue.” Pawar said the Bhama Askhed project will put an end to the tanker mafia in the eastern parts of the city. It’s Maharashtra’s tradition to join hands in development projects Ajit Pawar and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sharing the dais for the second time after their oath ceremony became a talking point in political and media circles. Fadnavis said, “It’s Maharashtra’s tradition that all parties come together for development projects by keeping their political agenda aside. Yet, the media unnecessarily discusses the issue. Now we have got the trick that if we want to be in media Pawar and me must need to visit each other’s home for tea.” Pawar assured Fadnavis in his speech that they would share the stage repeatedly. Pawar said, “Since the former chief Minister Yashwantrao Chavan, it’s tradition that all parties and leaders must come together for development works.” Fadnavis bats for HCMTR Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has appealed to Ajit Pawar to look into the high capacity mass transit route (HCMTR) project in the city as it is important along with the metro project. He said that industries around Pune should use treated water generated through sewage treatment plants instead of dam waters. The dam project is important for the city At least 12 lakh residents living in the eastern parts of the city would benefit from the Bhama Askhed project. Eastern parts of the city mainly Vimannagar, Vadgaon Sheri, Ahmednagar Road areas, Dhanori and Kalyaninagar were facing water scarcity. Many housing societies were paying huge money on water tankers. PMC has designed the pipeline in a way that water flows directly through gravity and no pumping is needed to bringing water to the city from the dam located at a distance of about 50 kms. Ban electricity generation from Mulshi dam Pawar said that a plan should be made to ban hydroelectricity generation from Mulshi dam. The Mulshi dam water is controlled by Tata Power, which utilises the water for hydroelectricity generation. The hydropower project is located in Bhira, where the water is released directly into the sea after power generation. A committee was appointed during the BJP rule to study the project and its report is awaited. “The water from Mulshi dam should be utilised for Pune city and rural parts for irrigation purposes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pawar-to-hold-meeting-on-water-quota-for-pune-city/story-QSnEbi6xNwBwnEbCLZIlwN.html
02-01-2021||Pune||Proposal for chargesheet against Milind Ekbote, Sambhaji Bhide submitted by rural police||PUNE The Pune rural police have put forward a proposal for a chargesheet in cases lodged by the Pune rural police against Samasta Aghadi president Hindu Mahasangh Milind Ekbote and Hindutva leader Sambhaji Bhide, according to Anil Deshmukh, home minister of Maharashtra.When asked about cases against Milind and Bhide, Deshmukh said, “We have recently received a proposal for a chargesheet in this matter. We will take due action at the earliest possible time.”However, of the multiple cases that Ekbote and Bhide are booked in, he did not clarify which one was awaiting sanction for prosecution from the government.In one case, Ekbote was booked with at least 38 others for rioting, public property damage, and criminal conspiracy. In another case, Bhide was also booked along with Ekbote for attempted murder, and inciting communal violence. There is no clarity on which case the proposal for prosecution was sent in, from either the home minister or the police.“When it comes to some of the sections of IPC, a proposal for prosecution has to be sent to the government. In our case, a proposal for prosecution has been sent two months ago. I’m assuming that is what the home minister was referring to, even though I cannot be sure. However, the proposal sent by us is against Ekbote and others, and not Sambhaji Bhide,” said Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of Pune Rural Police.There are 36 cases registered by the Pune rural police after riots broke out in Bhima Koregaon in 2018, according to another senior official of Pune rural police. Of these cases, chargsheets have been filed in 16 of them, while summary reports of logical conclusions have been filed in at least 18 others. The cases against Ekbote and Bhide, however, remain open.“At this point, we cannot reveal many details about which case the proposal has been sent in. Whatever the home minister said is all we can reveal,” said deputy SP Rahul Dhas of Daund division of Pune rural police.The statement by the home minister was made on January 1, exactly three years since the riots broke out in Bhima Koregaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/proposal-for-chargesheet-against-milind-ekbote-sambhaji-bhide-submitted-by-rural-police/story-WJ4iHZBojygrrzffs35DcL.html

02-01-2021||Pune||Flyover demolition leaves traffic at Pune varsity circle in U-turn chaos||It was expected that demolition of the flyover at the Savitribai Phule Pune University circle will ease traffic congestion, but little has changed for commuters.The demolition work of flyover which was started on July 14 during the lockdown in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, was completed by the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) on August 10.The three-way road at the university circle, which goes to Aundh, Baner-Balewadi and Sus-Pashan sees major traffic flow.A major problem which people are facing is the long U- turn which commuters have to take to access Senapati Bapat road.“The decision to have such a long U-turn is taken after consideration with PMRDA and it will remain till the metro work is completed,” said Prakash Mhasalkar, police inspector (Traffic), Chaturshringi Police Station.“If we open SB road junction there will be a rise in traffic and at the moment there is no space for a huge rush of traffic,” added Mhasalkar.Daily commuters continue to suffer as they are left with no option.“I come from Pimple Gurav and everyday I have to face a traffic hurdle and six traffic signals. It is completely poor planning to keep such a long U-turn. There are potholes as well after you cross the signal from the Baner side,” said Jambuwant Manohar. Commuters are also complaining of missing metro barricades.Metro barricades are missing at a few places,” said Kapil Rege, who travels every day from Shivajinagar to Balewadi via the university circle. “Things look the same even as when there was a flyover. At least commuting was easy when the flyover was in place,” added Rege.Traffic constable Sumant Gaikwad, on duty at the university circle, said, “Evening hours things are getting difficult to manage as rush of traffic has increased in the last one month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/flyover-demolition-leaves-traffic-at-sppu-circle-in-u-turn-chaos/story-KvcpZAiKmo2NbxSztt0lMO.html
02-01-2021||Pune||Sedate, prayerful, low-key event marks 203rd Bhima Koregaon anniversary||The 203rd Bhima Koregaon anniversary on January 1, 2021, was a low-affair key with the strictest of security mechanisms in place on either side of the Pune-Ahmednagar highway, leading to the site of the Bhima Koregaon memorial, in Perne village, near Pune.Fifteen police checkpoints were put in place to prevent outsiders from entering Perne village. District collector Rajesh Deshmukh had earlier issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1973, between December 30, 2020 and 6 am, January 2, 2021. With Covid-19 preventive measures already in place, the district administration had appealed to the Dalit community to take an online darshan of the victory pillar, instead of being physically present at the spot.The anniversary celebrations at the “vijay stambh” in Perne, began with Buddhist monks in ceremonial robes chanting prayers.At 6 am, the Mahar regiment presented a spot drill in the presence of Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Anil Deshmukh and minister for energy, Nitin Raut, who offered their tributes at the obelisk. Prakash Ambedkar, president of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) also paid his tributes. Volunteers of the Samata Sainik Dal put on a prayer dance in an open space in front of the stambh, in the presence of a large number of police personnel. Prominent Buddhist and Dalit organisations across the country had appealed to community to refrain from venturing to attend the event, citing the Covid-19 threat as a deterrent. Other Ambedkarite organisations also offered their respects at the venue based on slots offered by the rural police. Samata Sainik Dal volunteer Shailesh Kamble said, “I am lucky to have got a police pass. The crowd was not much and social distancing was maintained during the event.”The Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyaan, an umbrella organisation of Dalits and minorities, had organised the Elgar Parishad Conclave at Shaniwar wada in Pune on December 31, 2017. On January 1, 2018, the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon, turned violent leaving one person dead and several others injured. Pune Police, in a subsequent chargesheet, stated that “inflammatory” speeches at the Dalit meet were among the key factors that triggered the violence. The Elgar Parishad case has since been taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Ten lakh people had attended the event last year.The Koregaon Bhima development plan“The Koregaon Bhima development plan will be taken into consideration by the state and necessary finance will be provided. Since I am the guardian minister of Pune District, I will ensure that adequate funds are given for the project. People are going to continuously come to the spot, permanently, and government must proactively provide space for parking and other facilities. The state government will give good compensation to the local landowners after acquiring their lands for the development project,” said deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sedate-prayerful-low-key-event-marks-203rd-bhima-koregaon-anniversary/story-oiylopzrTmSk4uOkb14NWJ.html
02-01-2021||Pune||From the app to real life: Pune police warn due diligence needed to stay safe on dates||The case of sexual harassment and alleged rape, filed last Saturday in Pune by a 26-year-old woman against a romantic acquaintance whom she met on the dating app Tinder, is making headlines. The incident certainly raises questions about social media and recommended digital conduct of users. Bhagyashree Navtake, DCP cyber-crime and EOW, said, “Social media is a part of our lives today. Whether it is online or offline, being mindful is of paramount importance. Before deciding to meet someone you’ve only met online, it is very important to run a thorough background check on the other person. Also, it is advisable to not meet someone in a private or secluded place for the first time.” While violence may not be a common consequence of disagreeable online encounters, instances of cyber bullying, blackmailing, stalking, extortion, and harassment are on the rise. DCP (crime) Bachchan Singh shared some cases that were reported in the recent past. “I remember multiple cases that were reported, where the couple, complete strangers, met on dating apps or on social media, and then got into a romantic relationship. Physical intimacy followed, and then the man started blackmailing the woman for further sexual favours. In some cases, there was extortion. There have also been some cases of gay encounters that turned sour after a couple of meets, and resulted in harassment.” According to Singh, social media and dating apps are vulnerable spots and the ideal hunting grounds for sexual predators. He warned that it is absolutely necessary to exercise tremendous caution while dealing with complete strangers online. “Giving out too much personal information in the initial conversations with strangers, sharing personal photographs, and revealing monetary details can have shattering consequences. It is best to take it slow, and to do the due diligence,” he added. Singh recalled the most recent case of a 28-year old man, who was arrested two weeks back by the Pune Police’s Crime Branch for harassing and duping women by getting in touch with them on online dating sites. “The man would approach women, strike a relationship, and then get them to share pictures on chats. He would then use these pictures to harass and blackmail them,” said Singh. He confessed of having duped 10-12 women. Criminal lawyer Vijayalaxmi Khopade Khopade has dealt with 10 digital crime cases in the last six months, and she feels that the flip side of the cases involving sexual harassment and cyber stalking is victim shaming. She stressed, “The problem is that social media is a great bait for sexual predators. The victims usually are women. Due to mental conditioning and the fear of getting shamed, the victims usually get exploited, and are left feeling hapless. The key is to avoid these situations, and be mindful of the netiquette that is required while using social media and dating apps.” Psychologist Swarali Marathe said, “Not everyone is real and transparent on digital dating forums. Also, people with personality disorders, where they possess violent streaks, may also be on these apps. So, one needs to be very careful while using these services and sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/from-the-app-to-real-life-pune-police-warn-due-diligence-needed-to-stay-safe-on-dates/story-kCTH533vxbGq3bgglThq7M.html

No traffic congestions were witnessed in Connaught Place, India Gate and other places in the city, where people usually gather to celebrate the New Year,” said Agarwal.Also Read: Passengers at Delhi airport welcomed with flowers, ‘corona kit’ on New Year’s EveAccording to the Delhi Police data, 221 vehicles were towed away for unauthorised parking while two road accidents were also reported between 8pm on Thursday and Friday. One of the injured persons in the accidents is an assistant police sub-inspector.Unlike the previous years, when police would use alcometers to measure the alcohol content in breath samples, the police carried out manual checking of vehicles and used blood samples to ascertain drunk driving.Additional police personnel were deployed across the city, especially in the vicinity of malls, hotels, restaurants, pubs and bars, to ensure orderly celebrations. Nearly 1,100 traffic police personnel were on the roads since Thursday evening for regulating traffic and monitoring violations.“Our main focus was on traffic regulation as we did not want to spoil the celebrations. However, those found violating the rules were prosecuted and accordingly fined under the law,” said Agarwal.Restrictions were imposed in Delhi from 11pm on Thursday till 6am on Friday to prevent large gatherings in public places for New Year celebrations due to the pandemic. Similar restrictions will be in place from 11pm on Friday to 6am on Saturday.The Delhi police have said they will not stop visitors from gathering on the India Gate lawns during the day on Friday. But they will be asked to disperse before 11pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-fewer-traffic-violations-amid-muted-new-year-celebrations/story-KXVJ9brLPtRYAlvd313hQO.html
02-01-2021||World||Iran points finger at Israel as it warns Donald Trump against war||Iran’s foreign minister accused Israel of concocting a just cause for Washington to start a war against the Islamic Republic as Iranians marked the first anniversary of the US assassination of a top general.Mohammad Javad Zarif said Iran had new intelligence from Iraqi sources showing that “Israeli agent-provocateurs” were staging attacks on U.S. targets, laying a “trap” for outgoing President Donald Trump to start a conflict and jettison his successor Joe Biden’s plans to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord. He didn’t give further details about the nature of the intelligence.His comments came after Iran’s military warned that it was prepared to defend itself and respond firmly to any U.S. aggression during a weekend of bellicose statements commemorating General Qassem Soleimani’s killing by the U.S. in a drone strike in Iraq on Jan. 3, 2020.U.S. forces were “vulnerable and in a defensive position” out of fear of an Iranian strike to retaliate for last year’s assault, said Major General Yahya Ramin Safavi, a top military adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. “We hope that while Trump’s evil government is around, nothing will happen,” he said on state TV.“The U.S. military has a better understanding of its weaknesses than its politicians. We will never initiate war, but if someone attacks Iran, we will respond firmly and with full preparedness,” Safavi said, adding that Iran was capable of sinking U.S. aircraft carriers.The comments show that while Iran wants to make clear that it won’t hesitate to defend itself against U.S. military action, it does not want to escalate conflict and sees Trump’s allies in the region as trying to start a war and to exploit a possible divide within the defense community in Washington over whether Trump should strike Iran.On Thursday, the U.S. sent home the USS Nimitz, the only Navy aircraft carrier operating in the Middle East a day after it also sent B-52 bombers to the Persian Gulf in a show of force, AP reported, citing three unnamed defense officials. The report said the two actions may reflect a split among Pentagon officials.Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have resurged in recent weeks with Trump reviving threats against the Islamic Republic in his final weeks in office as he tries to derail plans by Biden to rescue the beleaguered nuclear accord and provide sanctions relief.Trump’s decision to target Soleimani pushed the countries to the brink of war, capping a security crisis in the Persian Gulf that started when Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal. Iranian officials and military commanders have repeatedly vowed to seek revenge for the strike for as long as U.S. forces are scattered across the Middle East.The multilateral accord limited Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, but since Trump walked away from it Iran has ramped-up its atomic activities and said on Saturday it had notified the United Nations’ nuclear agency that it may start producing 20% enriched uranium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-points-finger-at-israel-as-it-warns-donald-trump-against-war/story-mth9vaEybI7GQHzgDyNeQM.html

02-01-2021||World||UK judge to rule on US extradition for WikiLeaks’ Assange||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will find out Monday whether he can be extradited from the UK to the US to face espionage charges over the publication of secret American military documents.District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is due to deliver her decision at London’s Old Bailey courthouse at 10 a.m. Monday. If she grants the request, then Britain’s home secretary, Priti Patel, would make the final decision.Whichever side loses is expected to appeal, which could lead to years more legal wrangling.However, there’s a possibility that outside forces may come into play that could instantly end the decade-long saga.Stella Moris, Assange’s partner and the mother of his two sons, has appealed to U.S. President Donald Trump via Twitter to grant a pardon to Assange before he leaves office on Jan. 20.And even if Trump doesn’t, there’s speculation that his successor, Joe Biden, may take a more lenient approach to Assange’s extradition process.U.S. prosecutors indicted the 49-year-old Assange on 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse that carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.Lawyers acting on behalf of the U.S. government said in their closing arguments after the four-week hearing in the fall that Assange’s defense team had raised issues that were neither relevant nor admissible.“Consistently, the defense asks this court to make findings, or act upon the submission, that the United States of America is guilty of torture, war crimes, murder, breaches of diplomatic and international law and that the United States of America is ‘a lawless state’,” they said. “These submissions are not only non-justiciable in these proceedings but should never have been made.”Assange’s defense team argued that he is entitled to First Amendment protections for the publication of leaked documents that exposed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan and that the U.S. extradition request was politically motivated.In their written closing arguments, Assange’s legal team accused the U.S. of an “extraordinary, unprecedented and politicized” prosecution that constitutes “a flagrant denial of his right to freedom of expression and poses a fundamental threat to the freedom of the press throughout the world.”Defense lawyers also said Assange was suffering from wide-ranging mental health issues, including suicidal tendencies, that could be exacerbated if he is placed in inhospitable prison conditions in the U.S.They said his mental health deteriorated while he took asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for years and that he was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Assange jumped bail in 2012 when he sought asylum at the embassy, where he stayed for seven years before being evicted and arrested. He has been held at Belmarsh prison in London since April 2019.His legal team argued that Assange would, if extradited, likely face solitary confinement that would put him at a heightened risk of suicide. They said if he was subsequently convicted, he would probably be sent to the notorious ADX Supermax prison in Colorado, which is also inhabited by Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.Lawyers for the U.S. government argued that Assange’s mental state “is patently not so severe so as to preclude extradition.”Assange has attracted the support of high-profile figures, including the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and actress Pamela Anderson.Daniel Ellsberg, the famous U.S. whistleblower, also came out in support, telling the hearing that they had “very comparable political opinions.”The 89-year-old, widely credited for helping to bring about an end to the Vietnam War through his leaking of the Pentagon Papers in 1971, said the American public “needed urgently to know what was being done routinely in their name, and there was no other way for them to learn it than by unauthorized disclosure.”There are clear echoes between Assange and Ellsberg, who leaked over 7,000 pages of classified documents to the press, including The New York Times and The Washington Post. Ellsberg was subsequently put on trial for 12 charges in connection with violations of the Espionage Act, which were punishable by up to 115 years in prison. The charges were dismissed in 1973 because of government misconduct against him.Assange and his legal team will be hoping that developments in the U.S. bring an end to his ordeal if the judge grants the U.S. extradition request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-judge-to-rule-on-us-extradition-for-wikileaks-assange/story-SJZSlGMiKwY02At0PrZt9J.html
02-01-2021||World||China’s muscle flexing in East China Sea ‘wearing down’ Japanese resistance: Report||In an attempt to wear down Japanese resistance in disputed East China Sea, China has been ramping up civilian and military presence in the airspace and waters around a rocky uninhabited group of islands, which are under Japanese administration.The islands are also known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, are under Japanese administration but claimed by both countries.As part of its strategy, China has sent military planes on hundreds of sorties in the area, forcing the Japan Self-Defence Forces to scramble its fighter jets from dawn till dusk, South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.Observers told the SCMP that the tactic is draining Japanese personnel and equipment but also comes at a big risk for China.From 2013 to 2018, an average of 720 Chinese coastguard vessels ventured into the waters and in 2020, 1,157 of the Chinese ships went into the contiguous zone of the islands, up more than 5 per cent from last year.According to SCMP, the Japanese Coast Guard started reporting the number of Chinese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus in 2008.In the early years, the Chinese sent vessels a few times. And in 2020, 1,157 of the Chinese ships went in the contiguous zone of the islands, up more than five per cent from last year and almost triple the number from 2012.Tensions have also been on the rise in the sky. The Japanese Ministry of Defence said in the year to March, Japanese fighter jets responded to 638 incursions by Chinese warplanes, nearly all of which were near the islands.The total was up from 500 from the previous year and was the second-highest annual number since 1958.The frequent Chinese sorties force the Japan Air Self-Defence Force to fly above the East China Sea from sunrise to sunset, Kyodo News reported citing government sources.The two countries have agreed to restart talks on the island but there is a great deal of mistrust to overcome.Japanese State Minister of Defence Yasuhide Nakayama voiced those concerns in early December when he said China’s growing maritime activities in the waters surrounding Japan were a threat.He also called Beijing’s movements an attempt to “unilaterally” change the status quo in the East China Sea. “Every single day, the Chinese ships, the coastguard vessels try to enter our territorial waters,” Nakayama said.Amid all this, the US, Japan and France plan to hold their first joint military drills on one of Japan’s uninhabited outlying islands in May.The exercise is nominal to practise disaster relief efforts but could also form the basis for coordinated defence against attack, according to Japan’s Sankei newspaper.Derek Grossman, a security specialist from the Rand Corporation, said pressure from Chinese warplanes has severely strained the Japan Air Self-Defence Force’s ability to sustain normal operations.“[It] has suffered in terms of pilot fatigue as well as the cost of maintenance on aircraft ... [and] the routinisation of intercepts makes it more difficult for the [air self-defence force] to determine whether this time is different. That is precisely the uncertain mindset Beijing wants potential adversaries to have prior to actual armed conflict,” Grossman said.Timothy Heath, also from the Rand Corporation, said China’s strategy for the Senkakus depended on “wearing down” Japan’s resistance over time so that eventually Tokyo acquiesced without fighting.And a number of factors were in China’s favour.“First, the huge amount of resources available to the Chinese coastguard and People’s Liberation Army Navy provides an important material advantage. Japan cannot match China plane for plane and ship for ship. Tokyo will become exhausted if it tries to do so,” Heath said.“Also, China is highly motivated to sustain these intrusions, due to the value for its security and the political benefits for Chinese audiences that the intrusions offer of humiliating Japan,” Heath added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-muscle-flexing-in-east-china-sea-wearing-down-japanese-resistance-report/story-ijmWiYAKGaZdAzcf7HwnQO.html
02-01-2021||World||Britain will allow mixing of Covid-19 vaccines on rare occasions||Britain will allow people to be given shots of different Covid-19 vaccines on rare occasions, despite a lack of evidence about the extent of immunity offered by mixing doses.In a departure from other strategies globally, the government said people could be given a mix-and-match of two Covid-19 shots, for example if the same vaccine dose was out of stock, according to guidelines published on New Year’s Eve.“(If) the same vaccine is not available, or if the first product received is unknown, it is reasonable to offer one dose of the locally available product to complete the schedule,” according to the guidelines.Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at Public Health England, said this would only happen on extremely rare occasions, and that the government was not recommending the mixing of vaccines, which require at least two doses given several weeks apart.“Every effort should be made to give them the same vaccine, but where this is not possible it is better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all,” she said.Covid-19 has killed more 74,000 people in Britain - the second-highest death toll in Europe, and health officials are racing to deliver doses to help end the pandemic as fears grow that the health service could be overwhelmed.Earlier this week, the government reactivated emergency hospitals built at the start of the outbreak as wards fill up with Covid-19 patients.Britain has been at the forefront of approving the new coronavirus vaccines, becoming the first country to give emergency authorisation to the Pfizer/BioNTech and the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccines last month.Both vaccines are meant to be administered as two shots, given several weeks apart, but they were not designed to be mixed together.The government’s new guidelines said there “is no evidence on the interchangeability of the Covid-19 vaccines although studies are underway”.However, the advice said that while every effort should be made to complete the dosing regimen with the same vaccine, if the patient is at “immediate high risk” or is considered “unlikely to attend again” they can be given different vaccines.Britain sparked controversy earlier this week by announcing plans to delay giving the coronavirus vaccine booster shot in an attempt to ensure more people could be given the more limited protection conferred by a single dose.The top U.S. infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, said on Friday he did not agree with the British approach of delaying the second dose up to 12 weeks.“I would not be in favour of that,” he told CNN. “We’re going to keep doing what we’re doing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-will-allow-mixing-of-covid-19-vaccines-on-rare-occasions/story-6T21s58K01TE67jilGkbGM.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Situation worsening’: New Covid-19 strain increasing across UK, officials say||Officials on Saturday expressed concerns over the spread of a new mutated coronavirus strain in the United Kingdom as the infection rates across the country continue to rise. The hospitals across Britain, already stretched because of rising patients, are facing a meteoric rise with virus-infected filling in the ICUs and wards. Evidence shows that the new strain of Covid-19 is increasing in the country with a majority of cases surfacing from London, the South East and the East of England, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.Field hospitals that were constructed in the early days of the pandemic but were subsequently mothballed are being reactivated, news agency Reuters reported.The UK is in the “eye of the storm”, according to the Royal College of Nursing’s England director. The remarks come after the UK on Friday recorded 53,285 new Covid-19 cases and fresh 613 fatalities, taking the death toll to over 74,000.The government has confirmed that the infection rates have increased faster than expected in these areas where the new strain has been circulating and stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.The variant of the coronavirus, which could be up to 70% more transmissible, is spreading rapidly in Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously said that the mutated virus strain is not thought to be more deadly or to cause more serious illness.- London’s primary schools to stay closed, order authoritiesThe UK government ordered all primary schools in London to remain closed for the start of the new term next week in an attempt to rein in a jump in hospitalisations resulting from the mutant strain of the coronavirus.From Monday, the capital’s primary schools – for children from 5 to 11 years – will have to provide remote learning for most pupils. Vulnerable children and those whose guardians are key workers will continue to attend school.

The ministry said it would give more details on Monday.Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, unions and hospitals have been pushing for front-line carers to get vaccinated rapidly.“The concerning situation in urgent care is partly driven by coronavirus related sick leave by care workers,” the health ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-to-vaccinate-emergency-care-workers-as-soon-as-possible/story-ePhwU7gOeRcH1wiHZp5xkL.html
02-01-2021||World||China expects Joe Biden to end Donald Trump’s ‘cold war’ policy, restore ties||As Joe Biden is set to assume power this month, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday hoped that the US President-elect would end the incumbent Donald Trump’s “Cold War” policy towards Beijing and return to a “sensible approach” by restoring normal ties.The Trump administration launched a broadside against China on all fronts, including trade, Tibet and Taiwan besides, scathing criticism against the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) headed by President Xi Jinping.The Chinese side hopes that the next US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart cooperation, Wang, who is also a State Councillor, told the state-run Xinhua news agency in an interview.“China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening,” he said.Biden, who defeated President Trump in the November 8 Presidential election, is scheduled to take over on January 20, formally ending the Trump era which saw the US-China ties touch a new low.Wang said that in recent years, the US-China relations have run into unprecedented difficulties.Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of US policymakers about China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong, he said.“What has happened proves that the US’ attempt to suppress China and start a new Cold War has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world. Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail.“We are ready to develop with the United States a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability. We know that some in the US are uneasy about China’s rapid development. However, the best way to keep one’s lead is through constant self-improvement, not by blocking others’ development,” he said.“We believe that as long as the United States can draw lessons from the past and work with China in the same direction, the two countries are capable of resolving differences through dialogue and expanding converging interests by cooperation,” Wang said. He also stuck a positive note on China’s ties with the European Union (EU).China is racing to improve its ties with the EU ahead of Biden’s plans to end Trump’s unilateral approach and work out coordinated policies towards China with all US allies, especially the EU.Seen as an attempt to thwart Biden’s plans to forge a united policy towards Beijing, China concluded talks with the EU on a landmark investment treaty ending a long, drawn-out negotiations.On Wednesday, Chinese President Xi along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron announced that they have completed investment agreement negotiations as scheduled.“The agreement will provide greater market access, higher level of business environment, stronger institutional guarantees and brighter cooperation prospects for mutual investment,” Xi said.US Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger blasted the EU for reaching the deal with China despite Beijing’s “human rights record”.The EU has “removed a fig leaf,” Pottinger said, China’s state-run Global Times reported.White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro also called it “a bad deal,” which will pose a geopolitical challenge to the US.Wang, in his interview, said that “the most important conclusion is that our cooperation and common understandings far outweigh competition and differences. China and the EU are comprehensive strategic partners, not systemic rivals,” he said.Wang also hailed China’s burgeoning ties with Russia, which Chinese experts say could get stronger if Biden pursues former US president Barack Obama’s policy of identifying Moscow as a prime enemy of Washington than Beijing.China and Russia will continue to be the example of good-neighbourly and friendly relations between major countries, which would underpin the global strategic stability, Wang said.He hailed the intensive interactions between the two heads of states, noting that President Xi and President Vladimir Putin have had five phone calls and exchanged correspondence on multiple occasions, providing the most important strategic guidance for the steady growth of the bilateral relations.“The year 2021 is a year of special importance for China-Russia relations, as both countries will enter a new development stage. In developing China-Russia strategic cooperation, we see no limit, no forbidden zone and no ceiling to how far this cooperation can go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-expects-joe-biden-to-end-donald-trump-s-cold-war-policy-restore-ties/story-mNn4jifJWOQEFWd2I7AaQK.html

Ltd., China Mobile Ltd. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., with trading of the companies to be suspended sometime between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11.The move stems from an executive order President Donald Trump issued on Nov. 12 barring investment in publicly traded companies that the U.S. government says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military.“China opposes the Americans from abusing national security by listing Chinese companies into the so-called ‘Communist China Military Companies’ list and will take the necessary countermeasures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement.The actions will also “greatly weaken all parties’ confidence in the US capital market,” the statement said.The ministry did not offer details on what the measures might be.Under Trump, the US has stepped up economic sanctions and travel bans against Chinese companies, government officials and Communist Party members, especially recently in Trump’s last few weeks in office.In December, the U.S. announced plans to limit visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their family members to one month, instead of 10 years.Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the U.S. market and the U.S. has lobbied other countries to follow suit, albeit with mixed results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-retaliation-for-nyse-s-delisting-of-companies/story-mlMNoW8uL3tNCUbA63S04M.html
02-01-2021||World||AstraZeneca plans 2 million doses a week of Covid-19 vaccine for UK: Reports||Amidst growing pressure over sufficient supplies of Covid-19 vaccines in the UK, pharmaceutical companies have hit back at government claims that access to enough jabs was a “limiting factor”, insisting there was no issue at their end. While AstraZeneca says it expects 2 million doses of the Oxford University vaccine to be ready each week in just over a fortnight, Pfizer BioNTech said the number of doses it has now sent to the UK is “in the millions”. The Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs are the two vaccines against coronavirus that are approved for rollout in the UK. “The plan is then to build it up fairly rapidly; by the third week of January we should get to 2 million a week,” an AstraZeneca source told ‘The Times’ newspaper. “The deliveries to the UK are on track and progressing according to our agreed schedule,” a Pfizer spokesperson said. Meanwhile, there are growing questions on whether Britain could have had more supplies ready to go, similar to how India has created a massive vaccine stockpile in advance, according to ‘The Daily Telegraph’. Pune-based Serum Institute of India has a licensing tie-up for the Oxford vaccine. It has emerged that India has already managed to stockpile 50 million doses of the jabs. “The rate-limiting factor at the moment, as they say, is supply not distribution,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a Downing Street briefing earlier in the week. The issues around supply are being raised as the UK is set to begin the rollout of the Oxford vaccine among the elderly and frontline workers from Monday after it received regulatory approval on Wednesday. The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine and scientific advisers have calculated that at least 2 million vaccinations a week could be needed, as well as a lockdown that includes school closures, to avoid the pressures on intensive care exceeding the peak of the first wave. Ministers hope that their target of vaccinating 30 million vulnerable people and health workers by Easter in early April could be met ahead of schedule. The UK’s chief medical officers (CMOs) have defended the Covid-19 vaccination plan, even though a doctors’ union has voiced criticism. The UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. The British Medical Association said cancelling patients already booked in for their second doses was “grossly unfair”. But the CMOs said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab “is much more preferable” as the “great majority” of initial protection came from the first jab. “The second vaccine dose is likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy,” the CMOs said. “In the short term, the additional increase of vaccine efficacy from the second dose is likely to be modest; the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine,” they added. However, some general practitioners (GPs) who had already booked in their patients for their second dose after a 21-day gap are planning to keep to the schedule. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and 944,539 people have had their first dose. Under updated government guidance, the second booster dose can now be administered any time up to 12 weeks apart for both the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines. Experts advising the government, including the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), said the focus should be on giving at-risk people the first dose of whichever vaccine they receive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-plans-2-million-doses-a-week-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-uk-reports/story-8gbSOtrj72BWR0UgOi5ZpJ.html
02-01-2021||World||A closer look at the four candidates in Georgia’s senate runoffs||Georgia has two runoff elections on Tuesday that will decide control of the US Senate and have a decisive influence on the ability of President-elect Joe Biden to advance his legislative agenda.Here’s a look at the four candidates: Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, and Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.Also Read | In Georgia, Joe Biden’s presidency meets early defining momentDavid PerdueDavid Perdue, the 71-year-old Republican senator and former corporate executive, is fending off a challenge from Democrat Jon Ossoff.The incumbent lawmaker was born in Macon, Georgia, and earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Georgia Tech. While in graduate school he began working for an international management consulting firm, Kurt Salmon Associates.Perdue had a globe-trotting business career, spending time in Asia and Europe. He held executive positions with Sara Lee Frozen Bakery LLC and Haggar Clothing Co. before joining Reebok International Ltd., rising to president and CEO of the Reebok brand. During his tenure, Reebok negotiated a contract with the National Football League to be the exclusive uniform and sideline apparel provider for the league from 2001 to 2012.Perdue moved on to Pillowtex, a financially troubled North Carolina textile company that he left after less than year, shortly before the company shut down and shed thousands of jobs. He blamed the failure on an inability to raise sufficient capital in a short time. He then landed at Dollar General Corp., where as CEO he led a period of growth from 5,900 stores to 8,500 nationwide for the discount retailer.After leaving Dollar General in 2007, Perdue served as a Georgia Ports Authority board member and formed Perdue Partners, an international trading firm, with his cousin Sonny Perdue, the former two-term Georgia governor who became President Donald Trump’s agriculture secretary.Perdue has depicted himself as an outsider in the Senate who can bring business sense to government. He’s been a loyal Trump ally and has echoed the president’s unfounded allegations of voter fraud in November.Jon OssoffDemocrat Jon Ossoff is challenging Republican Senator David Perdue in a campaign focused on expanding access to health care, reducing drug prices, preserving abortion rights, transitioning to clean energy sources, and passing a New Civil Rights Act to address racial disparities in policing and incarceration.The 33-year-old documentary filmmaker gained national attention in a 2017 special election he narrowly lost for an Atlanta-area seat in the House of Representatives. Ossoff raised nearly $30 million in that race, helping to make it the most expensive House race in history.The November Senate election put Ossoff just 1.8 percentage points behind Perdue. The race is going to a runoff since Perdue didn’t capture 50% of the vote, falling just short with 49.7%.Ossoff got his bachelor’s degree from Georgetown University and a masters degree from the London School of Economics. He worked as a national security aide for Georgia Representative Hank Johnson for several years, and did a high school internship in the office of the late Georgia Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon whom he describes as a mentor.In 2013, Ossoff became CEO of Insight TWI, a company that helps reporters investigate, produce, and market documentaries on corruption in foreign countries. His campaign website includes footage from some of the company’s projects from Africa and the Middle East.Kelly LoefflerSenator Kelly Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, is running for re-election after being appointed in 2019 by Georgia’s Republican Governor Brian Kemp to replace Johnny Isakson, who had two years left in his Senate term when he retired due to health concerns.Born and raised in Illinois, Loeffler earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and her master’s in business administration from DePaul University’s Kellstadt Graduate School of Business in 1999.Loeffler, 50, was the chief communications and marketing officer for Intercontinental Exchange Inc., the parent firm of the New York Stock Exchange, where her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is the chief executive officer. The 22% rally in ICE shares in 2020 helped make Sprecher a billionaire.Loeffler was also the chief executive officer of Bakkt, an Intercontinental Exchange unit that trades Bitcoin futures. She’s a co-owner of the Atlanta Dream of the Women’s National Basketball Association.The Republican incumbent finished second in the Nov. 3 general election, behind Raphael Warnock. Conservative voters split their ballots between her and GOP Representative Doug Collins, who came in third.Loeffler is a staunch defender of Trump and has supported his unfounded claims of voter fraud in the November election. She and Perdue, the other Republican incumbent, called for Brad Raffensberger, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, to step down, alleging without evidence that he mishandled the November vote.Like Perdue, she’s come under scrutiny for stock trades that began the day she and other senators got a classified briefing on the coronavirus outbreak, but investigations have led to no ethics or other charges.Raphael WarnockReverend Raphael Warnock, 51, is the senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. preached. He won the most votes in November’s 20-candidate special election for one of Georgia’s Senate seats, almost 33%, although Republican votes were split between two major candidates.Originally from Savannah, where he grew up in public housing, Warnock earned a bachelor’s degree at Morehouse College and a PhD from Union Theological Seminary. Before being chosen to lead Ebenezer Baptist in 2005, he was an assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York and the senior pastor at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore.Warnock participated in protests to push Georgia’s elected officials to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. He’s also advocated for action to fight climate change, saying addressing environmental injustice is a moral duty.Warnock offered a prayer at Barack Obama’s second inauguration, and presided over the funeral of John Lewis, the Georgia Representative and civil rights leader who died in July.Loeffler, his Republican opponent, has tried to paint Warnock as “radically liberal,” a line of criticism that’s been criticized by other faith leaders as an attack on the Black Church..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-closer-look-at-the-four-candidates-in-georgia-s-senate-runoffs/story-0wrxQ3BM9BCfJNozsgeFBI.html
02-01-2021||World||‘It’s just unprecedented’: Senate hinges on Georgia runoff chaos||Georgia’s Senate run-off elections arrive Tuesday after a whirlwind two-month campaign that smashed fundraising records, inspired historic voter turnout, bombarded the airwaves with ads, and loomed over congressional negotiations on major spending legislation.The stakes may never have been higher in such a narrow election. Amid President Donald Trump’s incessant attacks on Georgia’s election integrity, four people are seeking two seats that will determine which party controls the Senate. For President-elect Joe Biden, nothing less than his entire agenda is on the table.Those high stakes are underscored by planned visits on Monday by Trump and Biden, repeat appearances for both the outgoing and incoming presidents.“Something like this has never happened before and probably never will again,” said University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock. “Two seats, from one state, in one election, that will decide Senate control. It’s just unprecedented.”During the final week of the campaign, the events ranged from small, tightly controlled get-togethers to drive-in rallies. Voters said they understood the broader significance of these races -- and the circumstances surrounding them.Democrat Terri Sapp, 47, said she voted early “because I just didn’t want to risk the chance that something might happen to me first,” and to “fire” Republican Mitch McConnell as Senate majority leader.Trump has focused his attention in the state not on the Republican candidates or the future of the Senate, but almost entirely on his baseless claims that voter fraud caused Biden to win the state in November by a little more than 12,000 votes. Some Republicans fear he may throw the election to the Democrats by demanding the resignation of Governor Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, both Republicans.If Democrat Jon Ossoff can beat first-term GOP Senator David Perdue, and fellow Democrat Raphael Warnock can defeat Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, the Senate will be split 50-50 between the parties. If that happens, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaking vote, effectively flipping control of the chamber to Democrats.But a victory by either Republican would give McConnell 51 votes, a slim majority but enough to curtail Biden’s initiatives and block key nominations to his cabinet and the judiciary.Perdue’s chance for last-minute barnstorming was curtailed after he decided to quarantine after coming into close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus, meaning he’ll likely skip Trump’s Monday rally and his own event on election night.Limited polling in the state shows both races are extremely close while drawing intense interest. More than 70,000 new voters have registered in Georgia since Nov. 3. More than 2.8 million people had cast ballots as of Thursday, shattering the previous record for the December 2008 Senate runoff, when 2.1 million votes were cast.Although Georgia doesn’t register voters by party, the locations of heavy early voting in urban and minority areas suggests strong Democratic turnout. But Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day so it’s difficult to predict an outcome.The results won’t be known for days, given that it took 10 days to call the Nov. 3 election in Georgia. And those counts will almost certainly face legal challenges.The unusual dual run-offs are playing out because none of the candidates got more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 general election, a requirement for winning statewide elections in Georgia.Since then, spending has poured in for the twin contests, which the Center for Responsive Politics now lists as the two most expensive congressional elections in American political history. Nearly half a billion dollars has been spent just in the runoffs, with another $205 million spent during the first round.Georgians last elected a Democrat to the Senate two decades ago, and such runoffs in the state typically have low turnout, which favors Republicans. Yet Democrats are fighting hard after Biden took the state. High-profile Democrats, including former first lady Michelle Obama, have cut ads on their behalf.“The state is clearly going through some realignment,” Bullock said. Bill Clinton in 1992 was the last Democratic president to carry Georgia before Biden, and a Democrat hasn’t held a Georgia Senate seat since 2005.In their campaign-trail messaging, Republicans Perdue and Loeffler claim Ossoff and Warnock are “dangerous radicals” and socialists who’ll support liberals like New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Warnock is under attack for past supportive statements about the late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, and the pastor Jeremiah Wright, whose sermon including a condemnation of the U.S. was a campaign flashpoint for Barack Obama in 2008. Ossoff, educated at Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, has been dismissed as a “trust-fund socialist.”From the left, Ossoff and Warnock claim the Republicans are heartless and too wealthy to relate to or care about the less fortunate -- Loeffler’s husband Jeff Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, recently hit the billion-dollar mark -- and who tried to enrich themselves at the expense of Georgia residents suffering from the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic downturn.Democratic State Representative Roger Bruce, 67, said his party is benefiting from an influx of more diverse voters in the fast-growing suburbs around Atlanta, and Black voters inspired by what he called “big time” racial overtones in Republicans’ rhetoric.A photo of Loeffler posing beside a former Ku Klux Klan leader -- she says she was unaware of his affiliation -- bolstered those perceptions, said Bruce, along with her earlier criticisms of the Black Lives Matter movement. Those remarks prompted some members of the Atlanta Dream WNBA basketball team, which Loeffler co-owns, to wear “Vote Warnock” T-shirts.“The reality is we’ve already shown that we can get more votes than them. Donald Trump got less votes. We just got to do it again,” Bruce said.Ossoff on Tuesday repeated the claim that Perdue “has been personally profiting from this pandemic.” Investigations into stock sales by both Perdue and Loeffler that occurred after Congress was briefed on the coming pandemic before the public was fully aware haven’t led to any ethics citations or other charges.Despite being caught awkwardly between supporting Trump’s claims of voter fraud and their need to spur GOP turnout, both Republicans have underscored continued allegiance to the president, including siding with him against McConnell on increasing stimulus payments in the virus relief package from $600 to $2,000, a sideshow from Washington during the runoffs.Perdue boasted to supporters in the Atlanta suburbs how he consulted with the president over Christmas about the new stimulus package, before Trump signed it, and reminded them that the president will return for a second rally for him and Loeffler on Monday.“Let’s not let them slip in here in a runoff just because the president is not on the ballot,” Perdue said of the Democratic candidates.Loeffler used similar rhetoric at an event in Columbus.“This is why we have to hold the line. This is why we’re the firewall. This is why we cannot let Chuck Schumer’s radical agent of change -- Raphael Warnock -- and his running mate, the trust-fund socialist Jon Ossoff, into the Senate. Because they radically want to change America,” Loeffler said, referring to the Senate minority leader.Many of those interviewed at Loeffler and Perdue campaign events said they’ve been influenced by ads linking Warnock and Ossoff with images of liberal politicians from the coasts.“He’s way too radical for me,” former State Representative Gary Cason, 77, said of Warnock. “In every which way you can think of,” added Herman Dowden, 70, of Ellenwood.“I think that when we paint pictures of people as radicals, and as not in touch with society, it is not a good strategy,” said Olu Brown, 43, pastor of Impact Church in Atlanta, who backs the Democrats. “This is an opportunity to really focus on Georgia and what’s good for Georgians -- and I think Warnock and Ossoff have done that.”Georgia’s runoffs have even created international fascination. Bullock says he’s fielded media inquiries about the contests in recent days from news outlets in Argentina, Chile, Finland, Germany, South Korea, and “much of the British media.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-just-unprecedented-senate-hinges-on-georgia-runoff-chaos/story-ybWAdOW6vwh8EKlrzcNMvJ.html

This is why Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said he will not appear before the bureau,” said Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (JUI-F) leader Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri.“You cannot run the government by hiding behind the army and continuously telling lies. Why do you defame the army by dragging it in politics?” he added.Pakistani Muslim League (Nawaz) (PML-N) Senator Javed Abbasi said that the NAB has been turned into a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf “(PTI) wing”.“There are several judgements of the Supreme Court that highlights the role of NAB in political engineering and forcing politicians to change their loyalty,” he added.The members from the treasury benches responded by saying the opposition was trying to exert pressure on the government to force it to stop pursuing corruption cases against its leaders, who had amassed wealth through commissions and kickbacks, laundered money and stashed it in banks abroad, reported Dawn.Meanwhile, on December 29, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and PML-N senior leader Khawaja Muhammad Asif was arrested by NAB in Islamabad in connection with the assets beyond means case.

02-01-2021||World||India’s first ‘cultural diplomat’ to US returns home after three-year tenure||India’s first cultural diplomat to the US, Dr Moxraj, who spent last three years teaching Sanskrit, Hindi and spreading traditional Indian culture along with Yoga and meditation in many American states believes that the Vedic doctrine of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam” has found its own resonance in the post-COVID-19 world.“India is the only country which believes in the doctrine of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and this idea of India is not new but from the time of man’s origin, hence it was inspired by ‘Yatra Vishva Bhavatyekanidam’ in the Yajurveda,” said Dr Moxraj as he concluded his three-year tenure as the teacher of Indian Culture at the Indian embassy here.“Even a civilised person does not want to spoil his family and kutumb in the same way, the culture of India has been working for the good of all. Therefore, India has been trying to maintain the natural balance through yoga, meditation, mental health and vegetarianism and non-violence,” said Dr Moxraj, who left for India on Friday.Well versed in Vedic texts, Dr Moxraj was one of the 162 teachers sent by Indian Council for Cultural Relations three years ago to various diplomatic missions across the world to create awareness about traditional Indian culture, an initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi government.“It is the government, which for the first time worked on a plan to appoint 162 Indian culture teachers in all continents,” he said.Having worked under three Ambassadors – Navtej Sarna, Harshvardhan Shringla and Taranjit Singh Sandhu, Dr Moxraj, who was born in Rajasthan in 1979, in the last three years led the International Yoga Day celebrations in front of the US Capitol, White House and Washington Monument.Through special classes started by the Indian Embassy, he taught Hindi and Sanskrit to Indian Americans, US citizens and members of the diplomatic community in Washington DC.He taught Hindi, Indian culture, yoga and Sanskrit in many American States like Washington DC, Virginians, Maryland, West Virginians and Kentucky.He was invited by George Washington University and Georgetown University to conduct special Hindi classes. Both the universities have given special praise to the Government of India and the Indian Embassy.As millions of Americans were forced to stay home during the coronavirus lockdown, the Indian Embassy launched “Yog Apke Dwar” “Yoga at Home,” a free online yoga programme which was conducted by him.Dr Moxraj also took Hindi and Indian culture to Hollywood, as he conducted special classes for African-American Hollywood actress and popular singer Mary Milben.Milben’s two videos in particular -- National Anthem of India on India’s Independence Day in August and Om Jai Jagdish Hare on the occasion of Diwali – has been widely acclaimed.Milben attributed her success and knowledge of Indian culture to her “beloved Indian teacher” Dr Moxraj. Those performances were life changing, she said.“I fell in love with India because of Dr Moxraj, not only because of the language, but also I was introduced to India, the Indian American community and India community all over the world,” Milben said.Foreign Secretary Shringla, when he was the Indian Ambassador here, had praised Dr Moxraj for holding workshops on yoga and his Hindi classes.India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, in his farewell reception, acknowledged the “good work” and “contribution” of Dr Moxraj in spreading Indian culture and values at the embassy here. Sandhu hoped that the ICCR would soon send his successor here.Indian-American community leader Sunil Singh praised the initiative of Prime Minister Modi to send yoga teachers to the important diplomatic missions like Washington DC.“In these three years, he taught us Vedic knowledge and yoga. He made India proud by taking Hindi and Indian culture to Hollywood,” Singh said.

The document then went to the Kazakh parliament and was ratified by it on December 29.The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights commits its signatories to ensuring the abolition of death penalty within their jurisdiction, with the exception of war time. In 2003, the first president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, signed a decree temporarily suspending the death penalty.

02-01-2021||World||Iran plans 20% uranium enrichment ‘as soon as possible’||Iran said Saturday it plans to enrich uranium up to 20% at its underground Fordo nuclear facility “as soon as possible,” pushing its program a technical step away from weapons-grade levels as it increases pressure on the West over the tattered atomic deal.The move comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US in the waning days of the administration of President Donald Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal in 2018.That set in motion an escalating series of incidents capped by a US drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad a year ago, an anniversary coming Sunday that has American officials now worried about possible retaliation by Iran.Iran’s decision to begin enriching to 20% a decade ago nearly brought an Israeli strike targeting its nuclear facilities, tensions that only abated with the 2015 atomic deal. A resumption of 20% enrichment could see that brinksmanship return.Even Ali Akbar Salehi, the US-educated head of the civilian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, offered a military analogy to describe his agency’s readiness to take the next step.“We are like soldiers and our fingers are on the triggers,” Salehi told Iranian state television. “The commander should command and we shoot. We are ready for this and will produce (20% enriched uranium) as soon as possible.”Iran’s decision comes after its parliament passed a bill, later approved by a constitutional watchdog, aimed at hiking enrichment to pressure Europe into providing sanctions relief. It also serves as pressure ahead of the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he is willing to re-enter the nuclear deal.The International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledged Iran had informed its inspectors of the decision by a letter after news leaked overnight Friday.“Iran has informed the agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium ... up to 20 percent at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the IAEA said in a statement.The IAEA added Iran did not say when it planned to boost enrichment, though the agency “has inspectors present in Iran on a 24/7 basis and they have regular access to Fordo.” The parliamentary bill also called on Iran to expel those inspectors, though it appears Tehran still hasn’t decided to take that step.Salehi said Iran would need to switch out natural uranium in centrifuges at Fordo for material already enriched to 4% to begin the process of going to 20%.“It should be done under IAEA supervision,” Salehi added.Since the deal’s collapse, Iran has resumed enrichment at Fordo, near the Shiite holy city of Qom, some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Tehran.Shielded by the mountains, Fordo is ringed by anti-aircraft guns and other fortifications. It is about the size of a football field, large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges, but small and hardened enough to lead US officials to suspect it had a military purpose when they exposed the site publicly in 2009.The 2015 deal saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The accord also called for Fordo to be turned into a research-and-development facility.Under Iran’s former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Tehran began 20% enrichment. Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear weapons program, feared Tehran was building a bomb.After the discovery of Fordo, the US worked on so-called “bunker buster” bombs designed to strike such facilities. As Israel threatened at one point to bomb Iranian nuclear sites like Fordo, US officials reportedly showed them a video of a bunker-buster bomb destroying a mock-up of Fordo in America’s southwestern desert.Israel, which under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to criticize Iran’s nuclear program, offered no immediate comment Saturday.As of now, Iran is enriching uranium up to 4.5%, in violation of the accord’s limit of 3.67%. Experts say Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium stockpiled for at least two nuclear weapons, if it chose to pursue them. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.Iran separately has begun construction on a new site at Fordo, according to satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press in December.Iran’s announcement coincides with the anniversary of the US drone striking Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last year. That attack later saw Iran retaliate by launching a ballistic missile strike injuring dozens of US troops in Iraq. Tehran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet that night, killing all 176 people on board.As the anniversary approached, the US has sent B-52 bombers flying over the region and sent a nuclear-powered submarine into the Persian Gulf.On Thursday, sailors discovered a limpet mine on a tanker in the Persian Gulf off Iraq near the Iranian border as it prepared to transfer fuel to another tanker owned by a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. No one has claimed responsibility for the mining, though it comes after a series of similar attacks in 2019 that the US Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved.In November, an Iranian scientist who founded the country’s military nuclear program two decades earlier was killed in an attack Tehran blames on Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-plans-20-uranium-enrichment-as-soon-as-possible/story-8Aq0s5Vt3bNDPKI9v7nxzL.html

The country of 9 million people has ramped up its vaccination drive to a 24/7 operation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised Israelis that the country will be the first to emerge from the pandemic if they cooperate. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith health providers administering the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at a rate of 150,000 people a day - almost 2% of the population - the country is expected to have a much higher fraction of population with vaccines than other countries including the UK, according to a report published in The Guardian.Here is how Israel launched the world’s fastest Covid-19 vaccination drive: 1. Israel has advantages - it is a relatively small country in terms of geography and also population. A robust pre-pandemic digitalised healthcare system clubbed with the geographical advantages were factors in Israel’s initial success. 2. Manpower also played an important role in the country’s successful inoculation drive. Everyone over the age of 18 is obliged to register with government-linked insurance agencies and army medics have been called in to help.3. The government campaigned vigorously to curb the spread of anti-vaccine information. It petitioned Facebook to remove four groups that published “content designed to mislead about coronavirus vaccines”, according to a report.4. ‘Green passports’ are being issued to encourage citizens to get vaccinated. These are documents that would allow vaccinated people to eat in restaurants, travel freely and be exempted from quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-passports-to-army-medics-how-israel-launched-the-world-s-fastest-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-06FmwAuu9x6Zm4FeCdNXmK.html

Victoria, which now has 29 active cases, this week made masks mandatory across the state while limiting gatherings and shutting its border to NSW, prompting lengthy delays at border checkpoints on New Year’s Day. Authorities on Saturday said genomic sequencing showed the Victoria outbreak was directly linked to the NSW cluster, vindicating the decision to shut borders.“As a result of the learnings that we have gone through, we’ve taken the view that the responses we have put in place are proportionate and fair. Victorians have a lot at stake here,” Victorian health minister Martin Foley said.South Australia state recorded another day of zero cases while Tasmania, which is COVID free, banned visitors from parts of Victoria. Queenslanders were urged to reassess travel plans to NSW and Victoria.Australia has reported more than 28,450 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.

The government has said residents will be able to choose which type they receive, though the details are yet to be announced.The Hong Kong government appointed a committee to approve the emergency use of the vaccines, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said last week, signaling the city is moving closer to authorizing the candidates.Separately, Radio Television Hong Kong reported Saturday that Tony Ko, chief executive of the city’s Hospital Authority, said the organization is considering testing all of its medical staff regularly for coronavirus.Hong Kong does not require all residents to screen for the virus but issued mandatory testing orders to tenants of 44 buildings where cases were found in the past 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-in-talks-to-use-vaccine-records-for-travel-hket-says/story-CPWhfGwPPOPL8ROEUgnaTJ.html
02-01-2021||World||Brazil President Bolsonaro’s tough 2021 balance between ideology, pragmatism||Brazil’s pugnacious president, Jair Bolsonaro, survived 2020 in surprisingly good shape personally and politically, with buoyant popularity ratings despite his own bout of Covid-19 and a broader pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 of his countrymen.But the new year — and a looming re-election campaign — bring risks on all sides for the populist who has fought to limit environmental protections and rein in leftist influence on government and culture while feuding even with fellow conservatives in Latin America’s largest nation.Resurgent Covid-19 has lifted Brazil’s death rate to its highest in three months, despite the president’s insistence the pandemic is petering out. His sons face corruption investigations. He has no firm block of support in congress. And he’s losing his main international ally with the exit of US President Donald Trump, whose off-the-cuff rhetoric and tendency to test democratic norms had emboldened the Brazilian leader.Perhaps most damaging is the expiration with the new year of a pandemic-inspired financial aid program that has helped fend off hunger for tens of millions of poor Brazilians — among whom his popularity has been growing.Bolsonaro may be famous for breaking the rules, but he’s going to have to be more pragmatic, said Lucas de Aragão, a partner at Brasilia-based political consultancy Arko Advice. “He’s never going to be a president who plays by the book, but he has to start picking his fights.”More pragmatism starts with choosing his enemies more carefully, de Aragão said.During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro’s broadsides against the political establishment and intellectual elite resonated with disaffected voters, including many moderates. He won handily, and has since kept up his confrontational tone, hammering away at congressional leaders, federal prosecutors, governors and the Supreme Court — many of them people who potentially could help him get bills through congress or win reelection in 2022.In the United States, Trump held to his polarizing tone and lost. Unlike Trump, Bolsonaro does not have a powerful party standing behind him. As a matter of fact, since leaving the Social Liberal Party a year ago, he does not have a party at all — and is now trying to cobble together a working majority in congress, where a February 1 leadership vote could determine the fate of his legislative ambitions.Bolsonaro has shown some signs of reaching out. After months of demonizing the Supreme Court as biased against him, he was photographed in October hugging Supreme Court Justice Dias Toffoli at an informal meeting in Toffoli’s house.The reaction illustrated his dilemma. Many of his firmest supporters turned to social media to express their surprise, if not bewilderment.“I need to govern,” Bolsonaro said in response to concerns raised by a supporter on his official Facebook account.Last month’s municipal elections alarmed the Presidential Palace. Only five of the 16 mayoral candidates who Bolsonaro publicly backed won — none of them in the country’s biggest cities. Three senior government officials told The Associated Press that the results took Bolsonaro by surprise. “He did not expect to have so little influence,” said one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to comment publicly.Recent polls say Bolsonaro is roughly as popular as when he was elected. But his ratings have declined among richer and better educated Brazilians while increasing among the poor, who have been receiving the government’s pandemic financial aid.The end of that aid is likely to dent the president’s popularity, said Arko’s de Aragão.It is the only income for more than a third of those who received it, according to a December study by Brazilian polling institute Datafolha. As many as 70 million Brazilians ended up getting financial support during the health crisis, costing the government a hefty $61 billion at a time when economists are warning of an unsustainable deficit and rising inflation.The cutoff could leave 24 million of them in extreme poverty, International Monetary Fund Director Kristalina Georgieva warned in December.With no firm congressional bloc of his own, Bolsonaro has been courting a group of centrist lawmakers known as the Centrao in hopes of winning leadership in the lower house of congress.Such efforts might not be enough to assure a majority, and if their candidate, Arthur Lira, loses, Bolsonaro will struggle to achieve promised legislation, such as the loosening of gun laws or opening up the Amazon rainforest to development.The group’s support did not come for free and Bolsonaro faces pressure to grant its members some ministerial positions –– the sort of political horse trading he had promised his supporters that he would never do.For many Bolsonaro voters, the Centrao bloc represents the kind of corrupt politics the president tried to distance himself from during the campaign.But any signs of conciliation seem to be overshadowed by Bolsonaro’s hardline stands against pandemic restrictions on gatherings and his skepticism over vaccines.Bolsonaro, who recovered from a bout of Covid-19, has said he will not take any of the vaccines, and has actively undermined confidence in the Chinese-made CoronaVac shot backed by Sao Paulo Gov. João Doria, who is widely expected to run against Bolsonaro in 2022.Prominent health experts and opposition lawmakers have accused the government of dragging its feet on a national immunization program. It only presented a plan in mid-December when forced to by the Supreme Court.With no approved vaccine ready for delivery, Latin America’s largest nation is running behind other Latin American countries.Oliver Stuenkel, a political scientist who teaches at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, said the president still relies heavily on polarization.“He continues as a radical ... This is something that is deeply embedded in his political DNA: to polarize, divide and not govern,” Stuenkel said.Pereira echoed that view: “He needs to moderate to govern, but he needs to polarize to win elections. This is the contradiction of the Bolsonaro government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-president-bolsonaro-s-tough-2021-balance-between-ideology-pragmatism/story-avyCjWuLHQYgq1wpb794hI.html
02-01-2021||World||In Georgia, Joe Biden’s presidency meets early defining moment||Usually it’s a president’s first midterm election that reorders a White House’s political approach and priorities. For President-elect Joe Biden, his most defining congressional election is coming before he takes office.Two runoffs Tuesday in Georgia will decide which party controls the Senate and, thus, how far the new president can reach legislatively on issues such as the pandemic, health care, taxation, energy and the environment. For a politician who sold himself to Americans as a uniter and a seasoned legislative broker, the Georgia elections will help determine whether he’s able to live up to his billing.“It’s not that you can’t get anything done in the minority or get everything done in the majority, but having the gavel, having that leadership control can be the difference in success or failure for an administration,” said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid, who held his post opposite current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.Both Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock must win Tuesday to split the Senate 50-50. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, as president of the Senate, would provide the tiebreaker needed to determine control.To be sure, even a closely divided Democratic Senate wouldn’t give Biden everything he wants. Senate rules still require 60 votes to advance most major legislation; for now, there aren’t enough Democrats willing to change that requirement. So, regardless of Georgia’s results, Biden will have to win over Republicans in a Senate where a bipartisan group of more centrist senators stand to see their stock rise.A Democratic Senate still would clear an easier path for Biden’s nominees to key posts, especially on the federal judiciary, and give Democrats control of committees and much of the floor action. Conversely, a Senate led by McConnell almost certainly would deny Biden major legislative victories, as it did late in President Barack Obama’s tenure, by keeping his agenda from even getting up-or-down votes.Biden’s team is keenly aware of the stakes. The president-elect will travel to Atlanta on Monday, the eve of the runoffs, to campaign with Ossoff and Warnock for the second time in three weeks. Biden’s campaign aides have helped raise millions to boost the party infrastructure that helped Biden become the first Democratic presidential nominee since 1992 to carry the state. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will campaign Sunday in Savannah.In his last visit, Biden called Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler “roadblocks” and urged Georgians “to vote for two United States senators who know how to say the word ‘yes’ and not just ‘no.’”Congressional makeup shapes any administration, but perhaps even more so for Biden, who spent 36 years in the Senate, plus eight as Obama’s vice president and top congressional liaison. Biden leaned on that resume to pitch himself to the country as a consensus builder; he also criticized presidents’ increased use of executive action to go around Congress and insisted it would be different in his presidency.Even some Republicans are hopeful. Michael Steel, once a top adviser to Republican House Speaker John Boehner, a chief Obama foil along with McConnell, blamed Obama’s Capitol Hill troubles on his personal approach to his fellow politicians. Conversely, Steel said, “President-elect Biden is a legislator by avocation, by training, by instinct, by experience in a way that former President Obama was not.”Steel predicted Biden and McConnell, two former colleagues, can find “common ground” on infrastructure and immigration — policy areas that have stumped multiple administrations. Steel noted a handful of Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Rob Portman of Ohio, could face tough reelection fights in 2022, potentially making them eager to cut deals they could tout in campaigns.Still, there’s no indication McConnell would allow consideration of other top Biden priorities, most notably a “public option” expansion of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without a single Republican vote when Democrats controlled both chambers on Capitol Hill. Biden’s proposed tax hikes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans also are likely dead in a GOP Senate.Biden will need his negotiating skills to navigate the left flank of his own party as well. While progressives say they’ve lowered their expectations of what’s possible — even under a Democratic Senate — they still intend to push Biden.Larry Cohen, chairman of Our Revolution, the offshoot of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, said progressives will press Democrats in Congress to use the “budget reconciliation” process to work around the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold. Cohen argued that tactic might be used to accomplish long-sought goals like ending tax subsidies to fossil fuel companies and enabling the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to negotiate as a single customer with pharmaceutical companies.Those moves, Cohen noted, could generate considerable savings, creating new revenue even if Republicans won’t agree to any tax increases.He also said progressives will push Biden to use executive authority. He named two initiatives Biden has called for publicly: ending new drilling on federal lands and raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, even if Congress won’t set that floor across the economy. Another progressive priority, cancelling student debt under federal loan programs, is something Biden has not said whether he’d be willing to attempt unilaterally.Democrats’ limited expectations about their own power, even with a potential majority, belie the exaggerated claims Republicans have used in the Georgia races.In Perdue’s and Loeffler’s telling, a Democratic Senate would “rubber stamp” a “socialist agenda,” from “ending private insurance” and “expanding the Supreme Court” to adopting wholesale a “Green New Deal” that would spend trillions and raise taxes on every US household by thousands of dollars each year. Besides misrepresenting Biden’s and most Democratic senators’ policy preferences, that characterization ignores the reality of the Senate’s roster.At one campaign stop this week, Ossoff said Perdue’s “ridiculous” attacks “blow my mind.” He scoffed at the claim that his policy ideas, which align closely with Biden, amount to a leftist lunge. But the challenger agreed with the incumbent on how much the Georgia runoffs matter.“We have too much good work to do,” Ossoff said, “to be mired in gridlock and obstruction for the next few years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-georgia-joe-biden-s-presidency-meets-early-defining-moment/story-ggBWRFQUaExfxQXDKverBN.html
02-01-2021||World||China switches into covert mode in Nepal, has team of 3 to continue mission||President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party of China hasn’t given up on efforts to influence the course of Nepali politics and has positioned a three-member team in Kathmandu that is continuing to reach out to prominent politicians in the Himalayan nation, people familiar with the matter said.President Xi had sent a four-member team led by Guo Yezhou, vice-minister of the international department of the Chinese communist party’s central committee that made a high-profile visit to Nepal that was closely tracked by the media.The team wrapped up its visit on Wednesday, unable to deliver on its primary objective of uniting the two rival factions of the Nepal Communist Party led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and former prime ministers Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Nepal.Also Read: Chinese team in Nepal makes a peace offering to PM Oli. He doesn’t biteGuo Yezhou’s delegation, which had targeted persuading PM Oli to roll back the December 20 presidential order dissolving Nepal’s 275-member House of Representatives, had also explored the possibility of getting the two warring factions to jointly contest the national elections on April 30 and May 10 if the presidential order can’t be rescinded. A third option believed to have been pursued by Guo Yezhou was designed to address the possibility of the Supreme Court rolling back the presidential order and involved the formation of a communist-led government with the support of opposition parties such as the Nepali Congress minus PM Oli.Nepal watchers said the high-profile Guo Yezhou’s delegation was, however, only the public face of the Chinese effort.“The covert aspect continues,” one of them said.For now, this assignment has been handed to three officials of the Chinese communist party, who were part of the second team that had quietly travelled by road from China to Nepal before Guo Yezhou landed at Kathmandu’s international airport on Sunday last.The three - Zekun Lai, Dongme Huang and Yonglin Zhong - are the Chinese communist party’s points persons on Nepal politics who have cultivated political leaders for years. “This is what you might call the backchannel effort that stays under the radar,” a diplomat based in Nepal said.The change in the Chinese approach to keep its intervention a secret comes against the backdrop of resentment in some quarters in Nepal over its attempt to influence politics and politicians. A day before Guo Yezhou’s delegation returned to China on Wednesday, dozens of people had hit the streets of Kathmandu holding a torch rally on Tuesday night to protest against the visit that was aimed at interfering in Nepal’s internal political matters.To be sure, China denies that Guo Yezhou’s team was tasked to influence Nepal’s politics but underlines that it wants Nepal’s politicians to “properly manage internal differences”.“As the country’s friend and close neighbour, we hope relevant parties in Nepal can take into account the national interests and the big picture, properly manage internal differences and commit themselves to political stability and national development,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hasn-t-given-up-in-nepal-positions-a-team-of-3-to-continue-outreach/story-sEfBAumsjyNscJdLyw60YO.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Down with patriarchy, long live feminism’: How demonstrations led to Argentina legalising abortion||Argentina has become the largest South American nation to legalise abortion after massive demonstrations across the country by pro-abortion activists, who had seen several bills about the issue rejected until now. December 30 saw one of the most important moments in Argentina’s history when after more than 12 hours of debate, the Catholic church influenced government passed the law, which legalises abortion allowing terminations up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. “We managed to break the prejudice, and the discussion became a lot less dramatic. Society at large started to understand the debate in more moderate, less fanatic terms,” Lucila Crexell, a senator, was quoted by the New York Times.Argentina is a country where the Catholic church has long held sway in government decisions, therefore the topic of abortion was always shunned. Only two years ago, the government rejected a bill that sought to legalise abortion, a decision that felt like a heartbreaking defeat for the organisers and demonstrators of a stirring women’s movement.However, the fight for legalising abortion had started in the 1980s, when feminists took up the cause. The issue gained little to no traction at the time, owing to a time when democracy seemed weak since the country had just come out of a military dictatorship and religious conservatism ruled public debate.In 2005, the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion was formed and the fight for legal abortion had formally begun. The first bill was introduced in 2008 but it was shunned due to lawmakers who did not want to be associated and the Catholic church lobbying. “Many said they agreed, but refused to put their signature on the bill,” said Julia Martino, one of the activists in that effort as quoted by New York Times.What really kicked off the movement was the brutal murders of women in 2015, including a 14-year-old pregnant girl, and led to the creation of the Ni Una Menos (Not One Woman Less) movement, which began highlighting the struggle Argentine women faced in getting underground abortions.The efforts of the movement brought Argentinian women together, participating in massive street demonstrations and protests, and shedding light on the issues like sexism, gender parity and women’s rights. Their demonstrations were so effective and outreaching that several other Latin American nations took notice and followed in their footsteps.In 2017, abortion rights activists called for a demonstration to support legalisation and the turnout was unlike anyone had expected. “What happened with the movement is that it started increasing in number and gaining different voices,” said Claudia Pineiro, a writer and abortion-rights activist. Slogans were shouted at the massive rallies, of which the most popular was, “Down with the patriarchy, which is going to fall! It’s going to fall! Long live feminism, which will triumph! It will triumph!” One of the activists of the issues in the 1980s and a government sociologist, Dora Barrancos, said that the new generation had ‘an insurrection that is infectious.’The Ni Una Menos movement had rocketed the issue of women’s rights into the country’s political discourse and has had a significant impact on government decisions surrounding the issue. In 2017, the country passed a law expanding the quota system which women to attain full parity in national politics.The foundation stone for such decisions was also laid by female lawmakers who, despite having political differences, found themselves united on this particular front who planned out their strategies on WhatsApp groups. “We realised how powerful we are as women when we act in a coordinated fashion,” Silvia Lospennato, an ally of the former president Mauricio Macri who was against abortion, was quoted as saying by New York Times. “We all contributed, in a way of doing politics that is very anomalous and is completely different from the way men do politics,” she added.Several women lawmakers sought to legalise abortion in 2018 but the government, after intense lobbying by the Catholic church, rejected the bill. Several senators who voted against the bill then, voted for it this time around as well. President Alberto Fernandez, elected in 2019, promised to make the issue a legislative priority in his campaigns. The movement had eventually garnered the support of all kinds of people. It had started out with young women but they were joined by older women, men, blue-collar workers and over time, the demonstrations had taken the shape of a national movement. Rural campaigners had also joined in with the urban base.This is not the first time that street activism has succeeded in ushering in progressive laws in the country. In 2010, Argentina approved same-sex marriage and 2012 saw them approving one of the world’s most progressive gender identity laws.

02-01-2021||World||Tokyo to request new emergency declaration amid surge in Covid cases: Report||The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will ask the central government later on Saturday to declare a state of emergency following a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, local media reported.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike will make the request in a meeting with Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who coordinates government measures to fight the pandemic, the Nikkei newspaper said, citing multiple sources.Calls by Reuters to the governor’s office were not answered.Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, will make a similar request of the government on Saturday, national broadcaster NHK reported.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has resisted calls to reinstate a national state of emergency, which the government had instituted in April during an earlier wave of the pandemic.It relied on voluntary business closures and travel restrictions rather than the sort of rigid lockdown measures seen in parts of Europe and the United States.Tokyo raised its Covid-19 alert level to its highest measure on Dec. 17 and has requested restaurants and other businesses to close by 10 p.m (1300 GMT).New Covid-19 infections in Tokyo hit a record 1,337 on Dec. 31, and on Friday numbered 783. A nationwide record was also set on Dec. 31 with 4,520 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-to-request-new-emergency-declaration-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-report/story-yZqQBRmR9hXwdzrNpMoLvN.html
02-01-2021||World||US slams Chinese aggression against India in new defence policy law||The United States expressed “significant concern” with Chinese aggression along the border with India in a defence policy law passed by the Senate on Friday, completing a congressional override of President Donald Trump’s veto of the legislation.“Continued military aggression by the government of China along the border with India is a significant concern,” says the $740 billion National Defence Authorisation Act 2021 (NDAA). It calls upon Beijing to resolve all disputes using existing diplomatic mechanisms.The legislation became law after the Republican-controlled Senate voted 81-13 to pass it, with way more than the two-third votes required to override a presidential veto. The Democratic-led House of Representatives had passed the override last week with a similarly overwhelming support - 322 to 87.Trump had vetoed the legislation passed earlier by both chambers, but his reasons had nothing to do with the section on Chinese aggression on the border with India. He had demanded that it should repeal liability protection for social media platforms, drop sections renaming military facilities named after confederate military figures, and thinning US military deployments in certain areas.It was the first congressional override of presidential veto for Trump, whose term ends on January 20, when President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th US president.The NDAA conveys bicameral and bipartisan support for India in its border standoff with China. Though it is neither a demand nor a threat enforceable with consequences, it is a significant show of support for India.In Section 1206 titled “Sense of Congress on the aggression of the government of China along the border with India and growing territorial claims” the law says, “Continued military aggression by the government of China along the border with India is a significant concern.”The “government of China should work with the government of India towards de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control through existing diplomatic mechanisms and refrain from attempting to settle disputes through coercion or force”, it adds, and goes on to point to China’s other aggressive actions in the region.It says US congress believes that “attempts by the government of China to advance baseless territorial claims, including those in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and with respect to Bhutan, are destabilising and inconsistent with international law”.Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic lawmaker who proposed this language in the law, said after its passage, “Through today’s New Year’s Day vote in the Senate, Congress has made the National Defence Authorisation Act into law, including elements of my resolution calling on China to end its military aggression towards India and others in the broader Indo-Pacific region.”He added, “The Chinese military’s violent aggression along the Line of Actual Control with India and elsewhere is unacceptable, and the passage into law of this legislation sends a clear message of support and solidarity to India and our other partners across the world as we enter the New Year.”The bicameral and bipartisan snub for Trump came amid his efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden in the presidential election. Having failed to convince courts and state legislatures with claims of election wrongdoings, he is trying to get congress to overturn it when it meets on Wednesday to certify Biden’s victory, the final stage in the presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-chinese-aggression-against-india-in-new-defence-policy-law/story-Qyw5y9omIGjd9MiYCaiiZK.html
02-01-2021||World||Brexit is a new world businesses still need to figure out||British businesses probably didn’t expect to start 2021 worrying about wooden pallets after a year of grappling with the coronavirus and a meltdown in the economy.Yet as they start a  new relationship with the European Union, securing a supply of heat-treated platforms—baked to 56 degrees Celsius (133 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 30 minutes—is now one of the myriad issues they face.The 1,200-page trade deal struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Christmas Eve after a little over nine months of negotiations ended the uncertainty that the UK would crash out of the bloc in chaos. While the zero-tariff, zero-quota accord is a relief for British companies, it only marks the next stage in the evolution of the Brexit process—and potentially the most difficult one.  Also Read: Deal approved, post-Brexit era begins for UK and EUBe it wooden pallets for shipping goods, customs paperwork, new fish quotas or the recognition of professional qualifications, the next few months will be a case of figuring out the consequences of not just what’s in the historical agreement, but also what’s not.“It’s going to be a marathon, a very long marathon,” said Mark Price, former deputy chairman of retailer John Lewis Partnership and a former UK trade minister. “This is why trade deals normally on average take about seven years to agree as they are hugely complex.”Johnson hailed the agreement with the EU four and a half years after Britain voted to leave and said it will “drive jobs and prosperity across the whole continent.” But it will take time to divine whether that prediction ultimately will come true.Bloomberg Economics estimates that UK growth will be half a percentage point lower per year for the next decade compared with if the country had stayed in the now 27-member single market. It forecast the economy will expand 6% this year, though that was before the latest tightening of England’s Covid-19 restrictions.Brexit Bulletin: They Think It’s All Over. It Isn’t YetIn the meantime, businesses have to contend with paperwork before more complex issues can be resolved, such as the financial services industry’s future in the EU. There are also regulations around rules of origin determining what goods can be exported to the EU that need to be navigated. Mutual recognition of standards, which would allow firms to make products in the UK and market them in the EU without any extra certification, isn’t part of the deal.“There are likely to be a thousand separate unintended consequences from a trade deal of such scale,” said Will Hayllar, a partner in the consumer goods practice at OC&C Strategy Consultants Ltd. While “many things will get flushed out in time,” there will be uncertainty for businesses “in the intervening period when they have to decide if they will comply with everything or not.”Take wooden pallets. With Britain now having “third country” status with the EU, exporters and importers must comply with rules on preventing the spread of pests and diseases. It may take some disruption to trade for the EU to agree on a solution, said Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation.“Heat-treated wooden pallets are not needed for safety reasons and just add extra costs and this is something that should and could have been resolved before now,” said Goudie. Britain’s food and drink industry alone could face an additional 3 billion pounds ($4 billion) of extra costs a year from increased bureaucracy, the group estimates.Indeed, when disruption comes, it comes quickly. Dover, Britain’s busiest port, has only just cleared a backlog of thousands of trucks after France shut its border for two days in December because of the new strain of the coronavirus that’s forced much of Britain into another lockdown.  Also Read: British lawmakers approve post-Brexit trade deal with EUCompanies have sought other routes. Deutsche Lufthansa AG flew another Boeing Co. 777F with fruit, vegetables, clothing, medical equipment and jet-engine parts from Frankfurt to Doncaster-Sheffield Airport in England on Thursday. A load bound for supermarkets is scheduled for Jan. 2.Irish officials also warned of potential delays from early next week. Around 410,000 trucks or vans come through Dublin port each year from the UK and before Brexit virtually all would have passed unencumbered. More than a quarter of these vehicles will contain food or animals that now have to be checked. For one, the auto industry has maintained a consistently dim view as to just how smoothly trade between the UK and EU will be, even though the Brexit accord spared manufacturers 10% tariffs on cars and 4% levies on components.“Immediate costs and friction are inevitable,” said Mike Hawes, the chief executive officer of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. “Brexit has always been about damage limitation.”Bracing for the end of the Brexit transition period was already a costly endeavor, with the trade group estimating in November that the industry had spent at least 735 million pounds on preparing for new customs declarations, stockpiling parts and other measures.It remains to be seen whether investments in the UK delayed by Vauxhall maker PSA Group and BMW AG pending an outcome to trade talks will now materialize.  The same can be said for Nissan Motor Co., which hasn’t yet confirmed whether all models built at its plant in Sunderland, northeast England, contain enough local content to avoid tariffs. The Japanese carmaker opened the plant in the mid-1980s specifically to access the European single market.The government has attempted to ease the transition by delaying the introduction of full border controls. Companies moving goods into Britain won’t have to file customs declarations for six months.UK businesses exporting goods into the EU won’t have to produce rules-of-origin paperwork proving their goods were sourced domestically—and therefore exempt from tariffs—until the end of 2021, according to a Dec. 29 guidance note from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Firms could still be asked to provide the documents retroactively.Then there’s the financial industry. Banks have now lost their “passporting rights” allowing them to trade freely in the EU. Future access to the market will rely on the bloc confirming Britain’s financial frameworks are broadly aligned or “equivalent” with its own rules. Both sides had previously vowed to deal with that by mid-2020.“The deal is done but the reality that businesses have to face has not arrived yet,” said Ian Cheshire, the outgoing chairman of Barclays UK He predicted three to six months of “minor chaos from paperwork” though ultimately “people will work that out.”Among those people will be workers in Britain’s services industry, which makes up 80% of the economy. They face the hurdle of having their professional qualifications recognized in the EU, something that’s no longer automatic.  And while the Brexit deal was heralded by Johnson as a new era for the fishing industry, that too has been cast into doubt. A last-minute compromise on how and when to reduce EU access to British waters finally got the deal over the line. A study published on Dec. 29 by the Scottish government, which opposes Brexit, said new quotas reduce the catch for key species of cod and haddock.“It’s quite remarkable that for all the headlines about fishing, there was little on financial services when it is so blindingly obviously more important for our future,” said Cheshire. “I genuinely worry that people have not understood quite how difficult the path ahead could be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-is-a-new-world-businesses-still-need-to-figure-out/story-C95ZijqL1mdu2RLoTbD5fO.html
02-01-2021||World||‘Cheap trick’: China rebuffs latest Taiwan offer of talks||China has rebuffed the latest offer of talks from Taiwan, saying the government was engaging in a “cheap trick” and provocation by seeking confrontation with China at every turn.Taiwan is ready to have “meaningful” talks with China as equals as long as they are willing to put aside confrontation, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday, offering another olive branch to Beijing in her New Year’s speech.China views the democratic and self-governed island as its own territory, and cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after Tsai was first elected, viewing her as a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence.In a statement late on Friday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said there was no way of changing the reality that the island was part of China, and the refusal of Taiwan’s government to accept that was the root cause of present tensions.Since 2016, Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) “has continued to provoke by seeking independence, confronting the mainland at every turn, deliberately creating confrontation across the Taiwan Strait”, it said.“They again talked about so-called ‘dialogue,’ but where can that come from?” the office added. “We urge the DPP authorities to stop it with these cheap tricks that dupe people.”Tsai, re-elected by a landslide last year on a pledge to stand up to China and defend Taiwan’s democracy and security, has repeatedly said Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.Tensions have risen in recent months with China ramping up its military activities near the island, including on occasion flying fighter jets across the median line of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which usually serves as an unofficial buffer.China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing US support for the island. Beijing views this as a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cheap-trick-china-rebuffs-latest-taiwan-offer-of-talks/story-CdRpYdBxbguiNSIbkdsTsO.html
02-01-2021||World||Pfizer, BioNTech to offer Covid vaccine to volunteers who got placebo||Pfizer Inc and its partner BioNTech Se plan to give volunteers who received a placebo in its Covid-19 vaccine trial an option to receive a first dose of the vaccine by March 1, 2021, while staying within the study. The trial’s Vaccine Transition Option allows all participants aged 16 or older the choice to discover whether they were given the placebo, “and for participants who learn they received the placebo, to have the option to receive the investigational vaccine while staying in the study,” the companies said on their website. The US Food and Drug Administration and a panel of its outside advisers have expressed concerns over Pfizer’s “unblinding” plan, saying it could make it harder to continue collecting data on safety and effectiveness needed to win full FDA approval of the vaccine. Trial participants who received the placebo will have two doses of the investigational vaccine reserved for them within the study, the companies said on the website.“The study doctor will follow the latest guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their local health authorities to offer the Vaccine Transition Option to participants in a prioritized manner,” the companies said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-to-offer-covid-vaccine-to-volunteers-who-got-placebo/story-8MP3jEm9228zPVcLJeFlfK.html
02-01-2021||World||Once a model, California now struggles to tame Covid-19||Ambulances waited hours for openings to offload coronavirus patients. Overflow patients were moved to hospital hallways and gift shops, even a cafeteria. Refrigerated trucks were on standby, ready to store the dead.For months, California did many of the right things to avoid a catastrophic surge from the pandemic. But by the time Gov. Gavin Newsom said on December 15 that 5,000 body bags were being distributed, it was clear that the nation’s most populous state had entered a new phase of the Covid-19 crisis.Now infections have been racing out of control for weeks, and California remains at or near the top of the list of states with the most new cases per capita. It has routinely set new marks for infections and deaths, and began the new year reporting a record 585 deaths in a single day.Experts say a variety of factors combined to wipe out the past efforts, which for much of the year held the virus to manageable levels. Cramped housing, travel and Thanksgiving gatherings contributed to the spread, along with the public’s fatigue amid regulations that closed many schools and businesses and encouraged — or required — an isolated lifestyle.Another factor could be a more contagious variant of the virus detected in Southern California, although it’s not clear yet how widespread that may be.California’s woes have helped fuel the year-end US infection spike and added urgency to the attempts to beat back the scourge that has killed more than 340,000 Americans. Even with vaccines becoming available, cases are almost certain to continue growing, and yet another surge is expected in the weeks after Christmas and New Year’s.On Friday, the number of confirmed US coronavirus cases surpassed 20 million, nearly twice as many as the No. 2 country, India, and nearly one-quarter of the more than 83 million cases globally, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In California, the southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped with patients, and intensive care units have no more beds for Covid-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms. Some hospitals are having difficulty keeping up with the demand for oxygen.Hospitalizations statewide have gone up more than eightfold in two months and nearly tenfold in Los Angeles County. On Thursday, the total number of California deaths surpassed 25,000, joining only New York and Texas at that milestone.“Most heartbreaking is that if we had done a better job of reducing transmission of the virus, many of these deaths would not have happened,” said Barbara Ferrer, the county’s public health director, who has pleaded with people not to get together and worsen the spread.Crowded houses and apartments are often cited as a source of spread, particularly in Los Angeles, which has some of the densest neighborhoods in the US Households in and around LA often have several generations — or multiple families — living under one roof. Those tend to be lower-income areas where residents work essential jobs that can expose them to the virus at work or while commuting.The socioeconomic situation in LA County is “like the kindling,” said Paula Cannon, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California. “And now we got to the stage where there was enough Covid out in the community that it lit the fire.”Home to a quarter of the state’s 40 million residents, LA County has had 40% of the state’s deaths and a third of its 2.3 million cases. The virus has hit Latino and Black communities harder.Cannon said there’s a moral imperative for people who can follow stay-home orders to help prevent spread that is harder to contain in other areas.“What you can’t do is say to people, ‘Can you stop living in a house with eight other people, five of whom are working essential worker jobs?’” she said. “This is the structure that we can’t change in LA. This is, I think, contributing to why our levels have suddenly got scarily high and looks like they’re going to keep going up and keep staying that way.”In March, during the early days of the pandemic, Newsom was hailed for issuing the nation’s first state stay-home order.The Democrat eased business restrictions in May, and when a broader restart led to another surge, imposed more rules. In early December, with cases out of control, he issued a looser stay-home order. He also closed businesses such as barbershops and salons, halted restaurant dining and limited capacity in retail stores. The latest restrictions apply everywhere except in rural Northern California.But Dr. Lee Riley, an infectious diseases professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said that while the state managed to flatten the curve of rising cases, it never effectively bent the curve downward to the point infections would die out.When cases rose in June and July, California was never able to do enough contact tracing to isolate infected people and those they may have exposed before they spread the disease — often unwittingly — to others, he said. And public health directives were never adequately enforced.“What California did was to maybe delay the peak,” Riley said. Infections “really just never got low enough. And we started lifting the restrictions, and that just allowed the transmissions to just continue to increase. We never really saw a real decline.”California’s health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said if state and local leaders had not made difficult decisions early on that saved lives, the current surge might not be the worst the state has seen.He acknowledged the exhaustion many people feel after enduring months of disruptions to their lives. Public health officials, he said, need to find a way to reach people who have given up or not followed rules on social distancing and masks.Across California, local officials have reminded people that the fate of the virus lies in their behavior and asked for one more round of shared sacrifice. They reminded people that activities that were safe earlier this year are now risky as the virus becomes more widespread.“You can practice safety and low-risk behavior from March to October. But all that is erased. Nothing matters except what you are doing to fight the virus right now,” said Corinne McDaniels-Davidson, director of the Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University. “This pandemic is an ultra-marathon. In our culture, we are used to sprints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-a-model-california-now-struggles-to-tame-covid-19/story-UTagblABrLuiDZ2ZwQaXfK.html
02-01-2021||World||US judge dismisses lawmaker lawsuit against Pence over electoral count||A judge on Friday rejected a lawsuit filed by a US lawmaker from Texas and other Republicans against Vice President Mike Pence who is set to preside Wednesday over a joint session of Congress to formalize the results of the 2020 presidential election.US District Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle said Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for the state of Arizona who filed suit Sunday lack standing to bring the legal action seeking to overturn the election of President-elect Joe Biden.A spokesman for President Donald Trump referred questions to Pence’s office. A spokesman for Pence declined to comment.Trump has refused to concede defeat and has repeatedly falsely claimed the election was tainted by widespread fraud. He and his allies have lost dozens of court efforts seeking to reverse the election results.Biden beat President Donald Trump by a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College and is set to be sworn in on Jan. 20.Under the Electoral College system, “electoral votes” are allotted to states and the District of Columbia based on their congressional representation.Some Republicans have said they plan to object to the count of presidential electors next week in Congress. Reuters reported this week the effort could trigger a lengthy debate in the Senate but has virtually no chance of overturning the results.A Justice Department lawyer representing Pence on Thursday had urged Kernodle to dismiss the lawsuit saying they had sued the wrong person as they raised “a host of weighty legal issues about the manner in which the electoral votes for president are to be counted.”“The Senate and the House, not the Vice President, have legal interests that are sufficiently adverse to plaintiffs to ground a case or controversy,” Pence’s filing said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-dismisses-lawmaker-lawsuit-against-pence-over-electoral-count/story-UeSTXhu9wpT6hdAaaoojgJ.html
02-01-2021||World||GOP torn over Trump’s Electoral College challenge of Biden||President Donald Trump’s extraordinary challenge of his election defeat by President-elect Joe Biden is becoming a defining moment for the Republican Party before next week’s joint session of Congress to confirm the Electoral College results.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is urging Republicans not to try to overturn the election, but not everyone is heeding him. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri vows to join House Republicans in objecting to the state tallies. On the other side of the party’s split, GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska warns such challenges are a “dangerous ploy” threatening the nation’s civic norms.Caught in the middle is Vice President Mike Pence, who faces growing pressure and a lawsuit from Trump’s allies over his ceremonial role in presiding over the session Wednesday.The days ahead are expected to do little to change the outcome. Biden is set to be inaugurated January 20 after winning the Electoral College vote 306-232. But the effort to subvert the will of voters is forcing Republicans to make choices that will set the contours of the post-Trump era and an evolving GOP.“I will not be participating in a project to overturn the election,” Sasse wrote in a lengthy social media post.Sasse, a potential 2024 presidential contender, said he was “urging my colleagues also to reject this dangerous ploy.”Trump, the first president to lose a re-election bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of non partisan election officials that there wasn’t any. Of the roughly 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He’s also lost twice at the US Supreme Court.Still, the president has pushed Republican senators to pursue his unfounded charges even though the Electoral College has already cemented Biden’s victory and all that’s left is Congress’ formal recognition of the count before the new president is sworn in.“We are letting people vote their conscience,” Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican, told reporters at the Capitol.Thune’s remarks as the GOP whip in charge of rounding up votes show that Republican leadership is not putting its muscle behind Trump’s demands, but allowing senators to choose their course. He noted the gravity of questioning the election outcome.“This is an issue that’s incredibly consequential, incredibly rare historically and very precedent-setting,” he said. “This is a big vote. They are thinking about it.”Pence will be carefully watched as he presides over what is typically a routine vote count in Congress but is now heading toward a prolonged showdown that could extend into Wednesday night, depending on how many challenges Hawley and others mount.The vice president is being sued by a group of Republicans who want Pence to have the power to overturn the election results by doing away with an 1887 law that spells out how Congress handles the vote count.Trump’s own Justice Department may have complicated what is already a highly improbable effort to upend the ritualistic count January 6. It asked a federal judge to dismiss the last-gasp lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Republican electors from Arizona who are seeking to force Pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote.In a court filing in Texas, the department said they have “have sued the wrong defendant” and Pence should not be the target of the legal action.“A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction,” the department argues.A judge in Texas dismissed the Gohmert lawsuit Friday night. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee, wrote that the plaintiffs “allege an injury that is not fairly traceable” to Pence, “and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.”To ward off a dramatic unraveling, McConnell convened a conference call with Republican senators Thursday specifically to address the coming joint session and logistics of tallying the vote, according to several Republicans granted anonymity to discuss the private call.The Republican leader pointedly called on Hawley to answer questions about his challenge to Biden’s victory, according to two of the Republicans.But there was no response because Hawley was a no-show, the Republicans said.His office did not respond to a request for comment.Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who has acknowledged Biden’s victory and defended his state’s elections systems as valid and accurate, spoke up on the call, objecting to those challenging Pennsylvania’s results and making clear he disagrees with Hawley’s plan to contest the result, his office said in a statement.McConnell had previously warned GOP senators not to participate in raising objections, saying it would be a terrible vote for colleagues. In essence, lawmakers would be forced to choose between the will of the outgoing president and that of the voters.Several Republicans have indicated they are under pressure from constituents back home to show they are fighting for Trump in his baseless campaign to stay in office.Hawley became the first GOP senator this week to announce he will raise objections when Congress meets to affirm Biden’s victory in the election, forcing House and Senate votes that are likely to delay — but in no way alter — the final certification of Biden’s win.Other Republican senators are expected to join Hawley, wary of ceding the spotlight to him as they, too, try to emerge as leaders in a post-Trump era.A number of Republicans in the Democratic-majority House have already said they will object on Trump’s behalf. They only needed a single senator to go along with them to force votes in both chambers.When Biden was vice president, he, too, presided over the session as the Electoral College presented the 2016 vote tally to Congress to confirm Trump the winner. The session was brief, despite objections from some Democrats.Jen Psaki, speaking for the Biden transition team, dismissed Hawley’s move as “antics” that will have no bearing on Biden being sworn in on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gop-torn-over-trump-s-electoral-college-challenge-of-biden/story-6IvASFJI5WlFBCB2Qy2liM.html
02-01-2021||World||Trump vetoes California fishing bill, cites worsening seafood trade deficit||President Donald Trump vetoed a bill Friday that would have gradually ended the use of large-mesh drift gillnets deployed exclusively in federal waters off the coast of California, saying such legislation would increase reliance on imported seafood and worsen a multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit.Trump also said in his veto message to the Senate that the legislation sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., “will not achieve its purported conservation benefits.”Feinstein issued a statement late Friday saying Trump’s veto “has ensured that more whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine species will be needlessly killed, even as we have a proven alternative available.”Trump vetoed the fishing bill as the Republican-controlled Senate followed the Democratic-led House and voted to overturn his earlier veto of the annual defense policy bill, enacting it into law despite Trump’s objections.The fishing bill’s sponsors said large-mesh drift gillnets, which measure between 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) and 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) long and can extend 200 feet (60.9 meters) below the surface of the ocean, are left in the waters overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. But they said at least 60 other marine species — including whales, dolphins and sea lions — can also become entangled in the nets, where they are injured or die.It is illegal to use these nets in US territorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, and off the coasts of Washington state, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. They remain legal in federal waters off California’s coast.In 2018, California passed a four-year phaseout of large-mesh drift gillnets in state waters to protect marine life.The bill Trump vetoed would have extended similar protections to federal waters off California’s shoreline within five years and authorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the commercial fishing industry switch to more sustainable types of gear.Trump said the West Coast drift gillnet fishery is subject to “robust legal and regulatory requirements” for environmental protection that equal or go beyond environmental protections applied to foreign fisheries.He said Americans will import more swordfish and other species from foreign sources without this fishery.Feinstein vowed to “reintroduce this bill on the first day of the new Congress” and said she will push for quick enactment once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vetoes-california-fishing-bill-cites-worsening-seafood-trade-deficit/story-280rZNSUmutw4TVoOjck3I.html

Happy New Year!”Obama then shared an article published by The Washington Post Friday describing how a group of prison inmates pooled money together to help a high school student pay for his tuition at the private Catholic school he attended, as reported by The Hill.“And here’s a story that reminds us of the power of fresh starts, community, and the good that’s in all of us, across the country and around the world,” Obama wrote, along with a link to the Post article.His sentiments mirrored those shared by his former vice president, now President-elect Joe Biden who called on Americans to “unite, heal and rebuild” in 2021.“The challenges we face as a nation will not disappear overnight, but as we look forward to the start of a new year, I’m filled with fresh hope about the possibilities of better days to come,” Biden wrote in a tweet.“After a year of pain and loss, let us unite, heal, and rebuild in 2021,” he added.The tweets of the President-elect and former President come after a year where the US has seen over 20 million people contracting Covid-19 and over 340,000 people succcumbing to the virus across the country.The pandemic also fuled an economic crisis where Americans filed for unemployment followed by months of socail unrest following the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.During Biden’s campaign, Obama made several appearances in TV ads and at rallies, calling for unity and support behind Biden to prevent a second term for President Donald Trump.Ahead of Georgia Senate runoff elections on Tuesday -- that would determine which party controls the upper chamber -- Obama has again used his platform to rally support for Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and the Raphael Warnock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-delivers-new-years-message-says-us-best-days-are-still-ahead/story-2rsLwlQQsCKiT59TCAOijO.html

Vulnerable children and those whose guardians are key workers will continue to attend school. Pre-schools will remain open, the government said Friday.The government had originally omitted 10 London areas from a list of schools that would be closed, but yielded after local authorities complained to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. London mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the government’s change of heart.London has one of the country’s highest levels of Covid-19 infections per capita -- in the most recent week of complete data, the capital had a rate of 807 cases per 100,000 people, compared with a rate of 675 in the previous week.“The situation in London continues to worsen and so today we are taking action to protect the public and reduce the spread of this disease in the community,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-tells-london-s-primary-schools-to-stay-closed/story-8qbYhKTuXKt6lqR8E7EeGN.html

In 2019 there were 86 accidents, eight of which were fatal, resulting in 257 fatalities.Large commercial airplanes had 0.27 fatal accidents per million flights in 2020, To70 said, or one fatal crash every 3.7 million flights -- up from 0.18 fatal accidents per million flights in 2019.The decline in crashes came amid a sharp decline in flights due to the coronavirus pandemic. Flightradar24 reported commercial flights it tracked worldwide in 2020 fell 42% to 24.4 million.More than half of all deaths in the To70 review were the 176 people killed in January 2020 when a Ukrainian plane was shot down in Iranian airspace. The second deadliest incident was the May crash of a Pakistan airliner crashed in May killing 98.Large passenger airplanes covered by the statistics are used by nearly all travellers on airlines but exclude small commuter airplanes in service.Over the last two decades, aviation deaths have been falling dramatically. As recently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) said.Over the last five years, there have been an average of 14 fatal accidents for commercial passenger and cargo planes resulting in 345 deaths annually, ASN said.In 2017, aviation had its safest year on record worldwide with only two fatal accidents involving regional turboprops that resulted in 13 deaths and no fatal crashes of passenger jets.The United States has not had a fatal US passenger airline crash since February 2009 and one fatality due to a US passenger airline accident in that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aviation-deaths-rise-worldwide-in-2020-even-as-fatal-incidents-flights-fall/story-kUl3WDGSlWDgjlidUS09HK.html
02-01-2021||World||Mitt Romney assails US failure to plan for Covid-19 vaccine roll-out||Senator Mitt Romney criticized the slow roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine in the US, blaming the federal government for failing to help states get the shot into more people’s arms.“That comprehensive vaccination plans have not been developed at the federal level and sent to the states as models is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable,” the Utah Republican said in a statement Friday.The US vaccination program -- Operation Warp Speed -- has distributed millions of doses to states but is failing to meet projections for how quickly people will be inoculated. About 3.2 million doses have been given, according to the Bloomberg News vaccine tracker, far short of the Trump administration’s goal of administering 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020.Officials have blamed the delays on a delicate vaccine with complex storage requirements, uncertainty over the supply of doses, and strain on local health agencies already facing historic challenges. After criticism, President Donald Trump said this week that it’s the responsibility of the states to deliver the shots, urging them on Twitter to “Get moving!”Romney, one of the most forceful Trump critics among Republicans, said it’s unrealistic to assume health-care workers caring for those sickened by the virus can take on a vaccination program as well, or to lean on major pharmacy chains to save the day. He suggested more medical professionals be trained and enlisted to administer shots, including veterinarians, combat medics, and medical students.“The current program is woefully behind despite the fact that it encompasses the two easiest populations to vaccinate: front-line workers and long-term care residents,” Romney said. “Unless new strategies and plans are undertaken, the deadly delays may be compounded as broader and more complex populations are added.”Michael Pratt, chief communications officer for Operation Warp Speed at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the department has been working with states for months to distribute the vaccines and that the pace will ramp up.Sluggish Vaccine Campaign Raises Specter of US Dysfunction“There will always be a lag between the doses allocated and those shipped; between those shipped and those administered; and between those administered and those reported to CDC as administered. We’re working to make those lags as small as possible,” Pratt said.There have been more than 20 million cases in the US and more than 346,000 Americans have died. Tens of thousands more are expected to succumb in coming months, making the vaccine’s distribution all the more critical.Some countries are far outstripping the US’s vaccination pace. Israel, whose size and population is similar to New Jersey’s, gave shots to an average 60,000 people a day in its first week. If the US were moving at the same speed, it would be doing 2.2 million daily inoculations -- 10 times its current pace.President-elect Joe Biden this week faulted Trump for the slow roll-out of the vaccine and vowed he would speed up vaccinations to 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitt-romney-assails-us-failure-to-plan-for-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out/story-IUUHWWrYLYac3J1r6vDSOO.html

Gavin Newsom’s office announced Friday that California would begin collaborating with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to evaluate and upgrade outdated oxygen delivery systems at six Los Angeles area hospitals.The collaboration comes as older hospitals are having difficulty maintaining oxygen pressure in aging infrastructure and some were scrambling to locate additional oxygen tanks for discharged patients to take home.California this week became the third state to exceed 25,000 Covid-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-hits-record-585-coronavirus-deaths-in-1-day/story-MgrIstwYYKNKgRO3zBfrDJ.html

Ahmed said the PML-N chief’s passport will expire on February 16 and it will not be renewed. Prime Minister Imran Khan in October had said that he would contact his British counterpart Boris Johnson, if needed, to discuss Sharif’s deportation. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, on Wednesday said Pakistan had asked the British authorities to deport Sharif who was convicted by the courts. Sharif resigned as Pakistan prime minister in 2017 after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding public office and ruled that graft cases be filed against the beleaguered leader over the Panama Papers scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-extradition-treaty-with-uk-can-only-cancel-nawaz-sharif-s-passport-pak-minister/story-gqOwCWxiliI4OS5sRfqmBP.html

02-01-2021||World||Trump handed defeat as congress overrides his defense bill veto||US Congress handed Donald Trump a major, bipartisan defeat in the waning days of his presidency, as the Republican-led Senate voted to override his veto of a $740.5 billion defense policy bill.It’s the first time one of Trump’s vetoes has been surmounted. On Twitter, in his first response to the override, Trump said the Senate “missed an opportunity,” terming the effort “Pathetic!!”The final tally was 81 to 13, easily exceeding the two-thirds threshold needed to override a veto, with support coming from both Republicans and Democrats as it did earlier in the House. The massive annual defense authorization measure now will become law.Trump had sought to intimidate GOP senators into voting to sustain his veto, unleashing a bitter attack on fellow Republicans as the chamber prepared to begin the override process.“Weak and tired Republican ‘leadership’ will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass,” Trump tweeted Dec. 29. “Negotiate a better Bill, or get better leaders, NOW!” he added. On Saturday, Trump attacked Senator John Thune for a second time, suggesting that Governor Kristin Noem run again the Senate’s No. 2 Republican in a 2022 South Dakota primary.Friday, before the final vote, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, urged “all of our colleagues” to override Trump’s veto. Senate Armed Services Chairman Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and typically a Trump ally, called the annual defense bill “the most significant vote we have” and praised the bipartisan spirit that went into it.The Senate vote followed the House’s 322-87 vote on Dec. 28. Senate leaders had to overcome procedural hurdles after several senators, led by Bernie Sanders of Vermont, refused to give unanimous consent to proceed to the override vote -- part of their effort to increase pandemic aid to $2,000 a person from $600. In the tangled politics of the moment, that increase has been championed by Trump and opposed by many Republicans.The votes to override Trump’s veto reflects a widening rift between the president and some congressional Republicans, who stood by him through previous conflicts, as his influence ebbs. More GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in recent weeks recognized Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election.‘Not an Option’“Not once in six decades has a Congress let its differences prevent it from completing this work for our national security and our men and women who wear the uniform,” McConnell said Tuesday on the Senate floor in backing the veto override. “For the brave men and women of the United States armed forces, failure is simply not an option. So when it’s our turn in Congress to have their backs, failure is not an option either.”Although many of Trump’s voters remain loyal to the president, a number of Republican lawmakers share concerns over his recent behavior. The split comes at a dangerous time politically for the GOP -- just days before two runoff races in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate.Trump vetoed the annual defense measure, in part, because he wanted to attach an unrelated provision to eliminate Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects technology companies from liability for most content published by their users. He cited Section 230 in Saturday’s Twitter post, saying it “gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies.”Trump also took issue with the bill because it contains a provision for renaming military installations that honor Confederate generals. And in his veto message, Trump called the bill a “gift” to China and Russia, without clearly articulating his reasoning.Troop BenefitsThe defense bill, H.R. 6395, is considered must-pass legislation because it authorizes not only billions of dollars for weapons systems, but also benefits for U.S. troops. The measure would increase hazardous duty pay to $275 from $250 per month.It’s a point of bipartisan pride for members of the House and Senate Armed Services committees that the annual defense policy bill has now been enacted without fail for 60 consecutive years.The president and others on the right have long accused social media platforms of censoring conservatives, something that the technology giants deny. While lawmakers from both parties have called for modifying or even eliminating Section 230, even Trump allies said it was the wrong place and the wrong time to wage that battle.The defense bill authorizes $732 billion in discretionary spending for national defense, including $69 billion for overseas contingency operations. It also authorizes funding for 93 F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin Corp., the No. 1 defense contractor.The legislation also establishes a commission to study and provide recommendations, within three years, on the removal of names, symbols, displays and monuments that honor or commemorate the Confederacy. It addresses diversity in the military ranks by requiring the removal of personal identifiers in promotion and selection pitches, a step backed by Democratic Representatives Jackie Speier of California and Anthony Brown of Maryland.The defense measure establishes a Pacific deterrence initiative intended to counter China’s influence in the region. Congress plans to authorize $2.2 billion for the new effort designed to bolster the U.S. defense posture and weapons and alliances in the region.Lawmakers took aim at Russia with provisions including additional sanctions on Turkey for purchasing a Russian made missile defense system, as well as penalties on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-handed-defeat-as-congress-overrides-his-defense-bill-veto/story-ilsaclPnoh9XLfI004GwFL.html

Such moves by Iran could complicate efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal.“Iran has informed the Agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country’s parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU) up to 20 percent at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant,” the IAEA said in a statement.An IAEA report to member states earlier on Friday obtained by Reuters used similar wording in describing a letter by Iran to the IAEA dated Dec. 31.“Iran’s letter to the Agency ... did not say when this enrichment activity would take place,” the IAEA statement said.Fordow was built inside a mountain, apparently to protect it from aerial bombardment, and the 2015 deal does not allow enrichment there. Iran is already enriching at Fordow with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges.Iran has breached the deal’s 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can enrich uranium, but it has only gone up to 4.5% so far, well short of the 20% it achieved before the deal and the 90% that is weapons-grade. The deal’s main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-tells-iaea-it-plans-to-enrich-uranium-to-up-to-20-at-fordow-site/story-enQT4PYzcz9nADExY6pptM.html
02-01-2021||World||Georgia US senate runoff: Loeffler, Perdue run hard-line pitch||The merchandise featured in Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s online campaign store includes T-shirts and bumper stickers bearing Donald Trump’s name and the message: “Still my president.”The Georgia Republican is running television ads ahead of Tuesday’s Senate runoff elections that lambastes her opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, as “dangerous” and “radical.”Loeffler’s colleague, Sen. David Perdue, meanwhile, is warning Georgians that Democrats will enact a “socialist agenda” if his challenger, Jon Ossoff, wins on Tuesday.In the final days of campaigns that will decide control of the US Senate, the Republican incumbents are appealing to the most conservative part of the electorate. Their steady embrace of the hard-right, Trump wing of the GOP — even repeatedly refusing to acknowledge Trump’s defeat — and their caricatures of the Democratic challengers may seem like a risky approach in a state that narrowly voted for Democrat Joe Biden for president in November after years of steady Democratic gains.Yet the strategy reflects prevailing GOP wisdom in the Trump era: Republicans’ clearest path to victory, even in swing states, is to drive up support among a GOP base motivated by allegiance to the president and fear of Democrats. Still, the approach comes at the expense of a once-broader Republican coalition that included more urban and suburban moderates and GOP-leaning independents who have rejected the Republican brand under Trump.“The president resonates with a lot of people, and so do the buzzwords, so you hear ‘Trump’ and ‘socialism’ a lot,” said Michael McNeely, a former vice chair of the Georgia Republican Party. “I wish we lived in a society where people talked about ideas, but that’s just not where we are.”Trump may have complicated Perdue’s and Loeffler’s gamble even more with how he’s handled his defeat to Biden.The president has spread unfounded assertions of voter fraud and blasted Georgia Republican officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp, who have defended the elections process. When Trump allies, including Perdue and Loeffler, backed up the claims, some Republicans expressed concern it could discourage some Trump loyalists from voting in the runoff. Now, other Republicans are worried that GOP candidates have instead turned off the more moderate voters repelled by Trump.“No Republican is really happy with the situation we find ourselves in,” said Chip Lake, a longtime GOP consultant and top adviser to Loeffler’s vanquished rival, Rep. Doug Collins. “But sometimes when you play poker, you have to play the hand you’re dealt, and for us that starts with the president.”Trump will visit Georgia for a final rally with Loeffler on Monday evening, hours before polls open. It is unclear whether Perdue will attend. The senator said Thursday he was quarantining after being exposed to an aide who tested positive for coronavirus.Democrats are fine with the GOP senators’ decision to run as Trump Republicans and use exaggerated attacks. Opposition to the president has been a unifying force among their core supporters, and Democrats believe Republicans’ overall tenor falls flat with voters in the middle.“We talk about something like expanding Medicaid. We talk about expanding Pell Grants” for low-income college students, Ossoff said at a recent stop in Marietta, north of Atlanta. “David Perdue denounces those things as socialism?”Ossoff noted Perdue’s claims that a Democratic-run Senate would abolish private insurance; Ossoff and Warnock, in fact, back Biden’s proposal to add a federal insurance plan to private insurance exchanges, not abolish private insurance. “I just want people to have the choice,” Ossoff said.November returns demonstrate the GOP snare. Biden beat Trump by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in Georgia, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992. Biden’s record vote total for a Democrat in the state was fueled by racially and ethnically diversifying metro areas but also shifts in key Atlanta suburbs where white voters have historically leaned Republican.Yet Perdue landed within a few thousand votes of Trump’s total and led Ossoff by about 88,000 votes. Republican turnout also surged in small towns and rural areas, while Georgia Democrats had a disappointing general election down-ballot, failing to make expected gains in legislative races.“We’ve won this race once already,” Perdue says at some of his runoff campaign stops, echoing his advisers’ belief that their top priority is maintaining enthusiasm from Trump’s base. They add that they can corral the narrow slice of swing voters with arguments that warn against handing Democrats control of the House, Senate and White House.Lake and McNeely, however, predicted that hard-right attacks and Trump-centric appeals won’t deliver votes beyond the base, particularly amid a crush of advertising in a runoff campaign whose total expense could top $500 million.“We reached the point of diminishing returns a long time ago,” Lake said.They also bemoaned Trump’s continued grievances about his defeat even after his own attorney general said there was no evidence the election was marred by fraud and courts across the country rejected challenges to the outcome.“If, for some reason, the Republican candidates lose,” Lake said, “it’s going to be hard to write a post-mortem on this runoff and not look directly at all the chaos that has been created on voter fraud.”Early voting ended Thursday with just more than 3 million Georgians casting absentee or in-person ballots. That trails the final early vote count of 3.65 million ahead of the general election. But the early vote already has set a statewide Georgia runoff turnout record.Jen Jordan, a Democratic state senator who in 2017 won a suburban Atlanta district long held by Republicans, acknowledges her party, too, has moved to base strategy. But Jordan argued that Democrats still root their pitch more in policy ideas, especially on health care access and public education, that she said has wide appeal. She said Perdue and Loeffler undermined their “socialism” warnings by splitting from most congressional Republicans to support the president’s call for $2,000 pandemic aid payments to individual Americans.“I’ve never heard the word socialism so much in my life, and then they’re both like, yeah, let’s give everybody $2,000 checks,” Jordan said.McNeely, the former state GOP leader, lamented that even if Perdue and Loeffler win, their campaigns move Georgia further away from a more centrist tradition. He cited Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, whose retirement opened the way for Kemp to appoint Loeffler.Unlike many Southern Republicans of his generation, Isakson was never a Democrat. But he rose through the Georgia General Assembly in an era when Democrats dominated the state. In Washington, Isakson was a reliable Republican vote but shunned partisan jousting and intently avoided talking about Trump whenever possible.“Sen. Isakson learned to see things from a different perspective,” McNeely said, adding that Republican politicians should “think beyond campaigns and what the president is thinking” and that more voters should decide that “it doesn’t make you a bad guy or gal because you compromise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-us-senate-runoff-loeffler-perdue-run-hard-line-pitch/story-ezalY7kz2tXa138cr4rDBN.html
02-01-2021||World||A record 3 million early votes cast in Georgia’s US senate runoff races||A record 3 million early votes have been cast in the two Georgia runoff elections that next week will decide which party controls the US Senate, according to a final tally released on Friday.The turnout figures, compiled by the University of Florida’s U.S. Elections Project, indicate strong voter interest in Tuesday’s elections that pit incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler against Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.If Republicans win one or both of those seats, they will retain a slim majority in the US Senate, enabling them to block much of incoming Democratic President Joe Biden’s agenda.If Democrats win both seats, the chamber will be split 50-50, giving the tiebreaking vote to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Biden and Harris are due to take office on Jan. 20.The 3,001,017 early votes amount to 38.8% of all registered voters in the state, according to the US Elections Project. That puts turnout at a record high for a Georgia runoff, exceeding the 2.1 million ballots cast in a 2008 Senate contest.The runoff elections are necessary because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election.Early voting ended on Thursday. Georgia releases information about the number of people who voted but does not tally their votes until Election Day.Perdue is quarantining in the race’s final days after coming in contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-record-3-million-early-votes-cast-in-georgia-s-us-senate-runoff-races/story-ShS8OIqJiTBAWT1OrKJOFO.html

These companies are involved in civilian and military production with money from US investors.Earlier, US President Donald Trump on November 12 had signed an executive order that prohibits Americans from investing in 31 firms.The order prohibited US investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.“The Chinese Communist Party’s threat to American national security extends into our financial markets and impacts American investors,” the State Department said in a factual report.“Many major stock and bond indices developed by index providers like MSCI and FTSE include malign People’s Republic of China (PRC) companies, listed on the Department of Commerce Entity List and/or the Department of Defense List of Communist Chinese military companies,” it added.The executive order has resulted in a series of companies being removed from indexes compiled by MSCI, S&P Dow Jones Global Indices and FTSE Russell, reported SCMP.Following the steps of the US and Japan, the Taiwanese Economic Affairs Ministry on Wednesday too tightened control over Chinese investments due to national security concerns.Based on new regulations that came into effect from Wednesday, Chinese military-owned companies and Chinese Communist Party-owned companies were banned from investing in Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-to-delist-3-chinese-telecom-companies-to-comply-with-us-executive-order/story-8eDf3zIiMLfxTsW3RU1NgI.html

Some of the attacks have come from Baloch nationalist insurgents, who during the last three years have carried out at least five major terror strikes in the area.The security plan for Gwadar involved encircling the city with a fence and putting in place two entry and exit points, officials have said. It is believed a modified plan will be set in motion later this year. Read more| Hindu temple in Pakistan vandalised, set on fireThe project has been questioned on various platforms in Pakistan. At a press meet earlier, senator Mir Kabir Mohammad Shahi said it “was a conspiracy to separate Gwadar from Balochistan”.Following an outcry, provincial home minister Ziaullah Langove clarified this week that the provincial government stopped the fencing work “as it will not take any decision against the wishes of the people of the area”. He insisted that there was nothing more to the plan than the intention to protect the port city.Security analyst Amir Rana feels that if fenced as planned, Gwadar would become the first Pakistani city to be “sealed” on the basis of security concerns. In a column, Rana argued that fencing is considered one of the last resorts in dealing with trans-border security threats. Rana recalls that the 2019 attack on Pearl Continental Hotel was among the deadliest attacks in the area. The Balochistan Liberation Army, which claimed the attack, had badly damaged the building using explosives and rocket fire.Similarly, in October this year, militants targeted security forces that were escorting a convoy of Oil & Gas Development Company from Gwadar to Karachi, on the Makran coastal highway. An alliance of Baloch insurgent groups called BRAS claimed the attack in which at least 14 people including seven Frontier Corps men lost their lives.These attacks have raised questions not only about the security of strategic installations, but also about the lives of foreign nationals working there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-puts-on-hold-controversial-plan-to-fortify-gwadar-with-fencing/story-UAy7uaOrnDa4iirQkMzOvK.html

The Bangladeshi contingent has been invited to take part in the parade at a time the two countries are celebrating the golden jubilee of the birth of Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi marching contingent will consist of 96 soldiers. They will be carrying their BD-08 rifles during the march past, a license-produced variant of the Chinese Type 817.62mm assault weapon, the officials said on condition of anonymity. The Bangladesh Ordnance Factories produce more than 10,000 such assault rifles every year.Foreign soldiers took part in the parade for the first time in 2016 when a French army contingent of 130 soldiers marched down Rajpath. Then French President Francois Hollande witnessed the parade as the chief guest that year. The parade this year will be shorter, involve fewer participants and only a fourth of the usual number of spectators will be allowed at Rajpath, with the ceremonial event being curtailed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by Hindustan Times on December 30. The marching contingents will be seen in a rectangular formation this year instead of the traditional square formation because of fewer participants being allowed in the squads. These squads will only have 96 participants compared to 144 in the ordinary course. The shortened route of the parade will see it end at the National Stadium instead of Red Fort, the officials said Fewer people will be allowed to witness the parade, with the government following strict social distancing protocols. Not more than 25,000 spectators will be allowed at Rajpath this year, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 will not be permitted at the parade. Last year’s Independence Day celebrations were also muted as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and measures imposed to check the spread of the disease, with fewer VIPs attending the annual August 15 event at Delhi’s Red Fort while school children skipped it altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladeshi-soldiers-to-take-part-in-republic-day-parade/story-4VQZEJHmyIRjXOLSHOhyXL.html

We will fight for our rights that are being taken away by the Narendra Modi government which is doing nothing for the poor...We will contest the upcoming elections to local bodies with the AIMIM,” Vasava told reporters.Owaisi heads the Hyderabad-headquartered All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM).“Well begun is half done! Had a fruitful meeting with BTP chief Chotu bhai Vasava at his house in Bharuch. The long wait of the Gujarati people finally gets over as BTP and AIMIM come together to create new political power,” tweeted Jaleel, who heads Maharashtra unit of the AIMIM and represents Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat in the neighbouring state.He told reporters that both the parties shared the same “ideology” that the country should run according to Constitution.Jaleel said the alliance will emerge a strong challenger for the BJP and the Congress, and will make impact on the upcoming polls.“The alliance with the BTP is a matter of pride for the AIMIM. There is great enthusiasm among people over this tie-up. People in Gujarat will choose us as an alternative,” he said.The BTP has two MLAs in the Gujarat Assembly who had refrained from voting in the Rajya Sabha elections held in June last year.The tribal party had contested the 2017 Assembly elections in alliance with the Congress.But after the newly-elected members of Congress in Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district Panchayat voted for a BJP nominee for the president’s post, which queered the pitch for the BTP-backed candidate, Vasava announced severing of its alliance with the Congress in December.The BTP had allied with the Congress in Rajasthan and supported Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the revolt by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot earlier last year.Elections to six municipal corporations, including Ahmedabad, 55 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka pachayats were supposed to be held in November, 2019, a month before their five-year terms came to end, but were postponed by three months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-joins-hands-with-btp-to-contest-local-polls-in-gujarat/story-4oefjucTuPzmpIMMVdFVDK.html

02-01-2021||India||Day 1 of nationwide dry run concludes as two Covid-19 vaccines await final nod||The nationwide dry run of Covid-19 vaccination on its first day took place on Saturday with state governments expressing confidence to start the vaccination programme whenever the Centre gives a go-ahead. A total of 286 session sites spread across 125 districts were conducted and more than 75 lakh beneficiaries have already been registered on Co-WIN software till date, the health ministry said. Around 1,14,100 vaccinators have been trained so far. The dry run helps states and local authorities identify areas where they need to develop — in training or in arranging for more spacious areas for vaccination — so that the actual vaccination process does not encounter any glitch.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said vaccine in the state will be available around January 14, during the Makar Sankranti festival. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja said the Centre will send vaccine stocks within two to three days. Meanwhile, the subject expert committee of Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation on Saturday made three crucial recommendations. It has granted Serum Institute of India the permission for restricted emergency use of the vaccine, subject to multiple regulatory conditionalities.Free Covid-19 vaccine for all frontline workers in 1st phase: Harsh VardhanBharat Biotech too got recommendation from the committee for restricted use of its vaccine in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode specially in the context of infection by mutant strains.Cadila Healthcare got the permission for the conduct of its third phase of clinical trial. Union health minister Harshh Vardhan, as he took stock of the dry run exercises, said vaccine to frontline workers will be administered free. He said the details of how 27 crore priority beneficiaries -- those above 50 years of age and those below it having comorbidities -- would be vaccinated until July were being finalised.Covid-19 vaccination dry run underway; health minister urges people not to pay heed to rumoursIn Delhi, the dry-run was being conducted in state capitals in at least three session sites. Some states also included districts that are situated in difficult terrain or have poor logistical support, according to officials. Maharashtra, Kerala and Gujarat conducted the mock drill in four districts each, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in five districts each while Rajasthan carried out the dry-run in seven districts.Before today’s dry run, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Punjab conducted dry run on December 28-29 with at least 125 intended beneficiaries at five sites in a maximum of two districts each.The union health ministry had said that no major issues were observed during the pilot dry run and all states had expressed confidence in the operational guidelines and IT platform for large-scale programme implementation.“I appeal to the people not to be misguided by rumours regarding safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccine. We will not compromise on any protocol before approving a vaccine,” Vardhan said adding that vaccine hesitancy was an issue even when the country started polio immunisation drive.In West Bengal, the dry run was held at Urban Primary Health Centres in Duttabad and Madhyagram and Amdanga Rural Hospital in North 24 Parganas district. A senior official in Assam said the dry run will continue regularly in the state till actual vaccination takes place.Tamil Nadu Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said overall, the processes worked successfully. The dry run was held at three centres each in the districts of Chennai, Tiruvallur, Nilgiris and Tirunelveli, and five in Coimbatore.

He said the Aam Aadmi Party demands Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, MP Gautam Gambhir and the three mayors of the municipal corporations come clean on this “massive scam”.Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it is sad that the Aam Aadmi Party has chosen to start the New Year with a “blatant lie” on Trommel machines used at landfill sites.“AAP spokesperson Durgesh Pathak has alleged that MCDs are indulging in a scam in Trommel machines by making a five-year hire contract which is a lie. Secondly, Pathak says Trommel machine costs around 17 lakhs which, too, is a lie. Trommel machine contracts are on an annual renewal basis with the EDMC & others. So there is no logic of calculating on a five-year basis as is done by Durgesh Pathak today,” he said.Trommel machine costs Rs 52 lakhs which can be verified by the market, and the MCDs have hired them at 6 lakhs per month inclusive of full usage & maintenance expenses, he said.Each machine runs 24-hour a day with a driver and an operator on each machine working in 3 shifts. This apart, it has oil expenses and high maintenance expenses which are borne by the supplier company, he said. The company has to provide operative Trommels 365 days a year. The operation expenses of each machine runs upto over 5 lakhs a month, he added.Kapoor has said it will be better if AAP leaders crosscheck facts before making “politically-biased” allegations against MCDs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-bjp-spar-over-cleaning-of-landfills/story-8SLuxsRNnEk35QYS7OiFzI.html

Based on a complaint from authorities, police launched a search and arrested the dentist.In 2019, a NEET impersonation scam rocked Tamil Nadu and at least nine people were arrested including medical students.A number of ‘aspirants’ allegedly hired ‘expert’ proxies to write NEET on their behalf.Such hired individuals scored good marks in the test which aided aspirants to get admissions in medical courses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-dentist-forges-daughter-s-neet-marks-to-get-her-medical-admission-held/story-sUiT5DsxPO1aNjR4TPMY6K.html

Fiji was hit by a Category 5 Tropical Cyclone Yasa on December 17-18, 2020, which caused extensive damage and destruction of critical infrastructure.“The relief material sent by the Government of India, consisting of shelter and hygiene kits, will provide immediate assistance to the cyclone-affected communities,” the statement read.“Despite challenges posed by the pandemic, over 6 tons of relief supplies were put together in a short span of time by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and were airlifted to Fiji with the help of Air India and Fiji Airways via Sydney, Australia. This was possible thanks to the effective cooperation among multiple agencies in three countries to deliver the relief material to Fiji in record time,” it added.The Ministry said that India has firmly stood by Fiji during times of crisis and devastation caused by natural disasters like Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016.“The relief material sent now in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Yasa highlights India’s commitment to providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) support to Friendly Foreign Countries as a first responder,” it added.Disaster Risk Reduction and Management is an important pillar of India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans’ Initiative (IPOI) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2019, the Ministry noted, adding that India remains committed to extend full support to Fiji’s efforts to restore livelihoods of the affected communities and to build resilient infrastructure.

02-01-2021||India||Scientists outline steps for safely receiving Covid-19 vaccine||Following accounts of potential allergies to the Covid-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, scientists have outlined steps on safely receiving the second dose of the therapeutic in individuals who develop a reaction to their first dose.The research, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, summarised what is currently known about allergic reactions to vaccines like those developed against Covid-19. In the study, a team of experts led by allergists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the US, proposed detailed advice so that individuals with different allergy histories can safely receive their Covid-19 vaccine. After closer review of the data related to allergic reactions, the US FDA recommended that the mRNA vaccines, based on the genetic material of the novel coronavirus, be withheld only from individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the Covid-19 vaccine. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also advised that all patients be observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination by staff who can identify and manage such reactions. In the review research, Aleena Banerji, MD, clinical director of the Allergy and Clinical Immunology Unit at MGH and her colleagues outlined steps on safely receiving the second dose in individuals who develop a reaction to the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. “Our guidelines are built upon the recommendations of US regulatory agencies and provide clear steps to the medical community on how to safely administer both doses of the vaccine in individuals with allergic histories,” Banerji said. According to the experts, allergic reactions to vaccines are rare, with a rate of about 1.3 per 1 million people. They said the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will have a similarly low rate of occurrence of allergic reactions. The researchers recommend that individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to an injectable drug, or vaccines containing polyethylene glycol or polysorbate speak with their allergists before being vaccinated. Banerji and her co-authors also suggested that vaccine clinics monitor all patients for 15 to 30 minutes to manage any allergic reactions that occur. They said even patients with severe allergies to foods, oral drugs, latex, or venom can safely receive the Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-outline-steps-for-safely-receiving-covid-19-vaccine/story-ej9t4QG372pu0apwKPAYNK.html

The subject expert panel of India’s drug regulator on Saturday has recommended it for emergency use. While the final nod rests with the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), Covaxin moving a step closer to getting approval carries major significance for India in the global scenario as 10 countries have already shown interest in India’s first home-grown vaccine. 10 million doses of the vaccine have already been produced for the Indian market.Here is all you need to know about this vaccine:Made-in-India vaccine: This is the first made-in-India vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology.Inactivated vaccineAn inactivated vaccine is one which is developed by inactivating (killing) the live microorganisims that cause the disease. This destroys the pathogen’s ability to replicate, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognise it and produce an immune response. There are many inactivated vaccines against Hepatitis A, Influenza, Polio, Rabies, which offer “excellent protection”, Bharat Biotech has said.Expert panel recommends Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency useCovaxin’s efficacy as proved in animal studiesBharat Biotech in its report published after animal studies said that its vaccine candidate showed protective efficacy. The vaccine candidate was administered in 20 rhesus macaques, divided in four groups. One group was administered with placebo, while three other groups were immunised with three different vaccine candidates. “To summarize, the vaccine candidate was found to generate robust immune responses. Thus, preventing infection and disease in the primates upon high amounts of exposure to live SARS-CoV-2 virus,” it said. Covaxin’s human clinical trial outcomesThe third phase of trial is still going on, while the company has already published the findings of the first two rounds. It followed a double-bind, randomised, multi-centre phase two clinical trial which included children as well. Efficacy to be determined only after two shotsAfter Haryana minister Anil Vij tested positive after receiving one dose of the vaccine during the trial, the company clarified that the efficacy is to be determined only after 14 days post the second dose. Also, as its trial was random in which some received the vaccine and some received placebo, there was no way to know whether the minister received a vaccine shot or a placebo shot. PriceUnion health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has on Saturday clarified that the first phase of vaccination which will include frontline workers will be free. There has been no talk on the price of Covaxin though Dr Krishna Ella, the MD of Bharat Biotech, earlier said that the vaccine will be cheap, cheaper than a water bottle, he had said in a conference, pointing to a water bottle. Since his comment, it has been estimated that it will come at a cost lower than Rs 100. InvestmentAccording to reports, Bharat Biotech’s total investment is about Rs 350-400 crore for the development of the vaccine, including new manufacturing facilities, investment for trials etc.Covaxin in other countriesBharat Biotech has already signed a letter of intent with US firm Ocugen to co-develop Covaxin for the US market. The company was also in talks with 10 countries in South America, Asia and Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-vaccine-gets-primary-clearance-all-you-need-to-know-about-covaxin-s-efficacy-price/story-oMQlTg6bvaDoLyyRQou5cO.html
02-01-2021||India||CDS General Bipin Rawat visits air bases in eastern sector, meets frontline soldiers||In his first official engagement outside the Capital in the New Year, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat on Saturday visited India’s forward air bases in the eastern sector and interacted with frontline soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh amid a border row with China in eastern Ladakh, officials said. “Nothing can deter the Indian armed forces from remaining steadfast in their call of duty,” an official statement quoted Rawat as saying. While the current border row is confined to the Ladakh theatre, the Indian military is on high alert to deal with any misadventure by the Chinese forces all along the border --- stretching from Ladakh in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east. Rawat completed one year as India’s first CDS on December 31. As CDS, Rawat is the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs, and is the single point military adviser to the defence minister. The CDS interacted with personnel from the army, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Special Frontier Force in Dibang Valley and Lohit Sector of Arunachal Pradesh, the statement said. Complimenting the soldiers for their operational readiness, Rawat said that only Indian soldiers could remain vigilant under the challenging conditions and they were willing to go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the country’s farthest frontiers. Rawat’s visit to the eastern sector comes at a time of deadlocked military and diplomatic talks between India and China to ease tensions in the Ladakh theatre. Earlier this week, defence minister Rajnath Singh said that talks with China on disengagement and de-escalation in the Ladakh sector --- where the two countries have been locked in a border row for eight months --- had not yielded any meaningful solution. Both India and China are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh sector and are firm about holding forward positions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) through the harsh winter months. Both sides are expected to hold the ninth round of military talks to reduce border tension but there is no indication of when India and China will hold the dialogue. Both countries had agreed to hold the corps commander-level dialogue at an early date during diplomatic talks on the dispute on December 18. While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-general-bipin-rawat-visits-air-bases-in-eastern-sector-meets-frontline-soldiers/story-6NcDExYrZp6e18dcdRTNlI.html

02-01-2021||India||LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi arrested on charges of terror financing||Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, one of the alleged masterminds of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, was arrested by Pakistani authorities on Saturday on charges of involvement in terror financing, almost five years after he was freed on bail. Lakhvi’s whereabouts had not been known since he was released on bail from a jail in Rawalpindi in April 2015. However, it was widely believed that he had continued playing a key role in directing the activities of the LeT even while he was in prison after being arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage. A spokesperson for the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Pakistan’s Punjab province said in a statement that Lakhvi was arrested on charges of terrorism financing during an intelligence-based operation conducted by the department. “Today, on 2 January 2021, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was arrested in a case of terrorism financing registered by the CTD Punjab in Police Station CTD Lahore,” the spokesperson said. “He is accused of running a dispensary [and] using funds collected for terrorism financing. He [and] others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the spokesperson added. Lakhvi, who is also a UN-designated terrorist, will face trial in an anti-terrorism court in Lahore, the spokesperson said. There was no immediate reaction to the arrest from Indian officials. A person familiar with developments noted, however, that Lakhvi was arrested on terror financing charges and that there had been little progress in efforts to prosecute him for his suspected role in the Mumbai attacks. Lakhvi was one of seven men arrested in the wake of the Mumbai attacks for allegedly helping plan, support and finance the terrorist assault on India’s financial hub that killed 166 people. The arrest came weeks ahead of the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) planned reassessment of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terror financing. In October last year, the multilateral watchdog retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, and gave the country time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”. Last month, LeT founder Hafiz Saeed was convicted for the fifth time on terror financing charges and given a jail term of fifteen-and-half years. In November last year, Saeed was given two separate five-year prison terms under provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act for using and providing funds for acts of terrorism in two cases of terror financing. He was also given a six-month prison term for being a member of a banned group. Saeed was also given two sentences of five-and-a-half-years in February 2020. The sentences will run concurrently. While Lakhvi was in prison following his arrest in December 2008 for the Mumbai attacks, he spent his time at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail in “relative luxury”, according to a BBC report. He had separate rooms, access to a television, mobile phones and the internet, and received guests on all days. He also fathered a child while he was in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-operations-commander-zakiur-rehman-lakhvi-arrested-on-charges-of-terror-financing/story-ka4L2skRgClQMfnpmwhfuJ.html
02-01-2021||India||Pups named after Ladakh fronts inducted into ITBP canine squad||Galwan, Shyok and Rezang along with 14 other Belgian Malinois puppies were on Wednesday inducted into the combat canine ranks of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force that guards the country’s LAC with China.A ‘namkaran parade’ or ceremonial naming event was held at the training centre of the force in Bhanu near Chandigarh where its veterinary cadre chief DIG Sudhakar Natarajan adorned each pup with a special collar bearing its name and touched them with a silver sword on the right shoulder as a sign of induction into the ranks.   The ITBP handlers who carried them subsequently presented a crisp salute with a promise to keep them healthy, safe and fit for fighting.The puppies have been named after the various strategic geographical locations of the Ladakh sector where the ITBP is deployed as part of its primary task to guard the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.  The paramilitary force along with the Army is engaged in an standoff with the Chinese military in this region at present.PTI had reported earlier this month about the naming of these puppies, at the forces’ National Training Centre for Dogs (NTCD) at Bhanu, as Ane-la, Galwan, Sasoma, Shyok, Chang-Chenmo, Chip-Chap, Daulat, Rezang, Rango, Charding, Imis, Yula, Srijap, Sultan-Chuksu, Mukhpri, Chung-Thung and Khardungi.They were born during September-October and their father Gala is deployed for counter-terrorist duties while mothers Olga and Olyshea who are sisters undertake anti-Maoist operations with the ITBP troops in Chhattisgarh. The pups will now be trained for infantry patrol and anti-terrorist roles at the Bhanu training academy over the next few months. DIG Natarajan said there are three fundamental reasons for naming these puppies after strategic locations.  “One is we are doing away with the practice of giving our canine buddies westernised names. Secondly, our troops deployed in bone numbing, blood freezing high altitude borders would feel a sense of pride when they call out the names enmeshed deeply into our force’s ethos and glory instead of calling out to an Elizabeth or a Julius Cesar or Hamlet,” he said.He stated the third reason to be that these names are “a crisp salute to all our troops deployed all along the excruciatingly tough borders, keeping the nation safe”. It has been decided, he said, that the next batch of canines will be named on the lines of regions and border posts present along the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh. The Belgian Malinois breed of dogs first shot to international fame after they assisted the US Navy SEALs in the 2011 operation that killed Osama bin Laden in his safe haven in Pakistan and were later famously called as the ‘Osama hunters’.A senior officer said the puppies were later treated to a ‘bara khana’ or grand feast in military style. The menu consisted delicious bone broth soup tempered with powdered dog kibbles and garnished with puppy milk formula powder.This dog breed, since it was introduced in India about a decade ago, is being extensively used by the central security forces and police units in anti-Naxal operations and for counter-terrorist tasks as they are considered ferocious and most suitable for such duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pups-named-after-ladakh-fronts-inducted-into-itbp-canine-squad/story-QIYd2kAKk0Ibj2DsoqXSzO.html
02-01-2021||India||Expert panel recommends Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use||Covaxin, the indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology, became the second vaccine in India to inch one step closer to the final approval for emergency use. The subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Saturday recommended Covaxin for restricted emergency use. On Friday, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield was given the recommendation. Both will now have to wait for the final approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). Also Read: Govt’s expert panel approves AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for emergency useThe development comes on a day a nationwide dry run exercise of vaccination was conducted under the supervision of the Union health ministry. Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said India is perhaps the only country which has several vaccine candidates almost ready.Bharat Biotech had applied for emergency-use authorisation first on December 7. The expert panel at that time asked the firm to submit its safety and efficacy data from the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial for further consideration. On Friday, as the expert panel looked into the details of both Covishield (Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech), it asked Bharat Biotech to expedite volunteer recruitment for the ongoing third phase trial. A day after came the recommendation.Also Read: SII’s Covishield approval: Efficacy, cost and all about AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccineBoth the vaccine candidates have been recommended for restricted emergency use which comes with a few riders. For Oxford vaccine, the panel has imposed certain regulatory provisions, including that the shot is indicated for active immunisation in individuals of 18 years or more to prevent the disease and that it should be administered intramuscularly in two doses at an interval of four to six weeks.Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate is an inactivated one which is developed by inactivating (killing) the live microorganisims that cause the disease. This destroys the pathogen’s ability to replicate, but keeps it intact so that the immune system can still recognise it and produce an immune response. There are many inactivated vaccines against Hepatitis A, Influenza, Polio, Rabies, which offer “excellent protection”, Bharat Biotech has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-panel-recommends-bharat-biotech-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use/story-s6WDwjh8GdtFqByZHSHR5N.html
02-01-2021||India||In a first, India successfully isolates, cultures UK-variant of Sars-CoV-2: ICMR||In a first, India has successfully isolated and cultured the UK-variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in a tweet on Saturday. “UK-variant of the virus, with all signature changes, is now successfully isolated and cultured at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) from the clinical specimens collected from UK-returnees,” the country’s apex medical body wrote on Twitter. It said that Sars-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, was being tracked through the countrywide network of ICMR-laboratories since early days of the epidemic in India. No country has yet reported successful isolation and culture of the UK variant, according to ICMR. Vero cell lines were used by the scientists of ICMR-NIV to culture the UK-variant of the virus, it added. India has reported 29 cases of the new coronavirus variant, that is spreading rapidly around Britain and other countries, within five days of tracing its first such infection. The new United Kingdom variant genome of Sars-CoV-2 – B.1.1.7, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last 38 days. India successfully cultures the new viral strain on the horizon (UK-variant of SARS-CoV-2). #ICMRFIGHTSCOVID19 #IndiaFightsCOVID19 #CoronaUpdatesInIndia #COVID19 #Unite2FightCorona @MoHFW_INDIA @PIB_India @DrHVoffice @drharshvardhan @AshwiniKChoubey @icmr_niv pic.twitter.com/vaCMQMSHOJFrom November 25 to December 23, 2020, midnight, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect Covid-19.Apart from India, the presence of the new strain of the mutant virus has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore.As a precautionary measure, the aviation ministry has restricted the operations of flights between India and the UK. Flights from India to the UK can start on January 6, while operations from the UK to India will begin on January 8. The schedule is valid till January 23, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri clarified on Saturday.The ministry has also issued a set of guidelines for travelling between the two nations. All passengers from the UK will have to submit self-declaration form on the online portal of Delhi Airport(www.newdelhiairport.in) at least 72 hours before the scheduled travel. They need to carry their negative report of the RT-PCR test, which should have been conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey.Passengers will have to undergo RT-PCR tests again upon arrival at their own cost. If tested positive upon arrival, passengers will have to be quarantined accordingly, the government has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-india-successfully-isolates-cultures-uk-variant-of-sars-cov-2-icmr/story-gcPowy6zIcpWhbVdLu9BlL.html

02-01-2021||India||Congress’ opposition to rename Aurangabad won’t affect alliance: Shiv Sena||Two days after Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said his party would strongly oppose any proposal that seeks to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar, the Shiv Sena on Saturday said its resistance will not affect the three-party MVA government in the state.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut expressed confidence that the issue would be resolved when all the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies- Sena, NCP and Congress- sit together and talk.On Thursday, Thorat had asserted that the Congress would oppose any proposal to rename Aurangabad, saying that changing the names of places was not part of the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the three ruling parties.It was the Shiv Sena, which had first made the demand to rename Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar over two decades ago.Also Read | Maharashtra: Shiv Sena, Congress fight over renaming Aurangabad; BJP mocks themA proposal to that effect had been passed in the general body meeting of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in June 1995, which was challenged by a Congress corporator in the high court and later in the Supreme Court.In its party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, the Sena said, “The Congress has opposed the proposal of renaming Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar. It has made the BJP happy. But the Congress’s opposition to the proposal is not new and therefore, linking it to the MVA government is foolishness.” “Even if the name has not been changed in the government records, Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar when there was Congress’s chief minister in the state. The people had also accepted it,” it said.“But some people feel that the issue of renaming Aurangabad will create friction within the ruling alliance,” the Sena said in a veiled attack on the BJP.“Thorat announced that if any proposal for renaming Aurangabad comes up before the MVA government, his party would oppose it. It is his claim. After his statement, BJP leaders started demanding that the Sena should make its stand clear on the issue. But the Sena has not changed its stance on it.” “Balasaheb Thackeray had renamed Aurangabad as Sambhajinagar 30 years ago, which was accepted by the people.And it will soon be changed officially as well,” it said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said BJP leader Chandrakant Patil asked that if Allahabad’s name can be changed to Prayagraj, Faizabad’s to Ayodhya, why cant Aurangabad’s name be changed to Sambhajinagar.“But we want to ask why the party did not do so when it was in power in Maharashtra,” the Sena added. “Any state requires a foundation of self-respect and even the Congress will agree that Aurangazeb was not a secular person. The Muslims in Maharashtra have stood behind the Shiv Sena. They want development and welfare,” it said.“It is an insult to the memory of Chhatrapati ShivajiMaharaj that a city in Maharashtra should bear Aurangazeb’s name, who brutally killed ChhatrapatiSambhaji Maharaj,” it said.“But what Thorat is saying is right. The Maharashtra government is duty-bound to implement the CMP of giving justice to the downtrodden and the farmers,” it added.Congress’s opposition to the renaming proposal will not affect the MVA alliance, it said.Meanwhile, Raut said, “Thirty years ago, Balasaheb Thackeray gave the name Sambhajinagar. Only paper work is left now. When all the MVA allies sit together and talk, the issue would get resolved.” The renaming of Aurangabad was not a political issue, he said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam said the MVA government has been formed to work and not change the names of cities.“The CMP doesn’t mention changing name of Aurangabad,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-opposition-to-rename-aurangabad-won-t-affect-alliance-shiv-sena/story-KleAiI91L9p3IOSL18qAML.html
02-01-2021||India||Nothing can deter Indian Armed Forces from remaining steadfast in call for duty: CDS||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Saturday hailed India’s defence forces for remaining vigilant under any challenging circumstances. “Nothing can deter the Indian Armed Forces from remaining steadfast in their call for duty,” he was quoted as saying by new agency ANI. Rawat made the comment during his visit to the forward military bases along the China border in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam as he completed one year in office on Friday. After witnessing measures adopted by troops to maintain effective surveillance and enhanced operational readiness, General Rawat said,“Only Indian soldiers could remain vigilant under such challenging situations — ever-willing to go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the borders,” according to ANI. Rawat had taken charge as the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) on January 1 last year. “The CDS has a task cut out: To make all three services work in a cohesive manner. We will work as team,” he had said soon after assuming office. As part of his current role after serving as Army chief for three years, General Rawat is the principal military adviser to the defence minister on all matters related to the tri-services. “As team, we will work towards a goal where 1+1+1 is either five or seven, and not three. What I mean is, the synergised effort should not be the sum of the whole, it should be much more. And we have to achieve that through integration,” he said after taking charge. Meanwhile in Kashmir, the Army has set up a ‘feedback and grievances’ helpline as part of its efforts to strengthen the bond with the people. “As part of Indian Army’s efforts to further strengthen the bond of friendship between the Aawam and Jawan, a ‘feedback and grievances’ helpline has been established under the aegis of Chinar Corps,” a defence spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-can-deter-indian-armed-forces-from-remaining-steadfast-in-call-for-duty-cds/story-csidoi6fWbM1gba7JMQI0L.html

We want people of Goa to be safe. We want business activity to continue and sustain. They (tourists) have to ensure that they wear a mask and maintain social distancing. We will recommend strict action against hotels and clubs that do not maintain the SOPs,” Rane told a press conference on Saturday.Rane, at the last minute on the New Year’s eve, pitched for a night curfew in Goa, a move that could have potentially derailed the state’s New Year’s eve celebrations that were planned by various hotels and nightclubs. However, he was overruled by chief minister Pramod Sawant who said that there would be no night curfew in the state but that norms would have to be followed.Visuals emerging from across the state, however, revealed that revellers were seen thronging the popular hotspots, often gathering in groups, without masks.Also read: Free Covid-19 vaccine for all frontline workers in 1st phase - Harsh Vardhan“Tourists should realise they are coming here to enjoy. But they should have responsibility. 60 per cent of people wear masks only at the airports.

The government should increase the fine to Rs 500 on beaches. These people will not understand. We want Goa to be looked up as a topmost tourist destination. I am not saying do not go to the beach, go to the beach but maintain social distancing,” Rane said.“I am sorry there will be a spike and the spike will be uncontrollable. Reporting cases in time will help us keep the count down,” Rane also said.Goa is seeing around 100 fresh cases of Covid-19 each day which is lower than the 500-odd daily cases that were being recorded at the peak of the infection in September last year. However, the state has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths per million having registered more than 700 deaths till date and more than 50,000 registered cases cumulatively so far which is more than 3 per cent of the state’s population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-act-against-hotels-clubs-not-following-covid-19-norms-goa-health-minister/story-EY4ymR1cCAjJKJuzouQe8O.html

The United Kingdom has given the nod to Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccine.The United States has approved the emergency use of Pfizer. But India, as it already has three applications, is likely to get more than one vaccine for emergency use, the minister implied.At present, six Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials in India, including the frontrunners Covishield and Covaxin. Covishield is the Oxford vaccine developed by Astrazeneca and Pune’s Serum Institute of India. Covaxin is the indigenous one being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Apart from these two, there are ZyCOV-D being developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd in Ahmedabad in collaboration with the Centre’s Department of Biotechnology, and NVX-CoV2373, which is being developed by Serum Institute in collaboration with Novavax.

02-01-2021||India||Jagan govt extends term of special officers in Andhra local bodies||The Andhra Pradesh government on Friday extended the terms of special officers of the local bodies by six months, according to two separate order issued in this regard. The terms were due to end on Sunday and Monday.State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar has said the elections to local bodies will be held in February. The government has opposed the move saying the entire official machinery will be busy with Covid-19 vaccination programme then.The high court last week ruled Kumar is the final authority to decide the schedule for the elections and directed the government to constitute a three-member committee to discuss the poll schedule.Kumar and the government have been at loggerheads since March last year over the conduct of local elections. The process for the elections was stalled due to Covid-19 pandemic.Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has accused Kumar of stalling the election process in collision with opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He alleged Kumar sought to benefit the TDP because he belongs to the community of N Chandrababu Naidu, the head of the party.The government removed Kumar through an ordinance in April that sought to reduce the term of the state election commissioner from five to three years.Kumar moved the high court challenging the ordinance and got an order in his favour on May 29.

Speaking at a programme here, he said, “We initiated the campaign against Covid-19 in March 2020 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and at the beginning of this year we could say firmly that the dry run of the vaccine will be held on January 5 across the state and the vaccine will be available near around Makar Sankranti.” The chief minister added that a dry run of the vaccine is being held at some places in the state on Saturday. Adityanath was speaking while laying the foundation stone of Advocate’s Building at the collectorate campus here on Saturday. On Friday, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) recommended granting permission for restricted emergency use of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, paving the way for the roll-out of the first Covid-19 shot in the country in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-will-be-available-in-up-near-makar-sankranti-yogi-adityanath/story-4adYklwlqIayVpYhDo6oBK.html

How can I trust BJP’s vaccine, when our government will be formed everyone will get free vaccine. We cannot take BJP’s vaccine,” the SP president said. Yadav also attacked the Yogi Adityanath led-BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over its handling of the pandemic. “Why cold-chain and refrigerators for vaccine now? This government was warding off Covid by clanging plates, claps, and hovering helicopters over hospitals,” he said while addressing the media a press conference at the party office in Lucknow. Soon after the SP chief’s remarks, minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur told news agency ANI, “Akhilesh Yadav’s statement that he ‘won’t get vaccinated as it’s a BJP vaccine’ is very unfortunate...What can be more unfortunate than a young leader linking Covid-19 vaccine with a political party. It shows Akhilesh Yadav can’t think above politics.”Yadav was addressing the press conference on the sidelines of an event in which religious leaders from Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh communities from Ayodhya gathered to extend support to him and his party. Ahead of assembly elections in the state slated for 2022, the SP chief announced he would withdraw civic taxes (water, house, sewer) for people of Ayodhya. “It is the land of Maryada Purshottam Ram. It’s a religious place. If this government does not withdraw the civic taxes, our government will.” He added that he was a religious person and had a temple at home, outside, and had made one inside the chief minister’s residence when he was the chief minister. In the run up to polls, earlier this week Yadav had said his party would return to power in UP in a “historic change” in 2022 and would then withdraw all cases lodged against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) protestors.The SP leader’s comments regarding the vaccine come on a day when the Covid-19 vaccination dry run is underway across 259 vaccination centres in 116 districts of the country. Saturday’s immunisation drive is being conducted after the exercise was carried out on December 28 and 29 across four states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab. Earlier in the day, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan announced that in the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination, free vaccine shall be provided across the nation to most prioritised beneficiaries that include one crore healthcare and two crore frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-i-trust-bjp-s-covid-19-vaccine-akhilesh-yadav-won-t-get-vaccinated-for-now/story-wymck18etFE26C7tqyEuZM.html

02-01-2021||India||Police probe Srinagar jeweller’s murder as little-known group claims responsibility||Investigators are probing whether business rivalry could have been the motive behind a 70-year-old jeweller’s killing in Srinagar on Thursday even as a little-known group has claimed responsibility for murdering him for acquiring property in the city under the region’s new domicile rules. The rules were formulated in 2020, a year after the end of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status that, among other things, prevented people from outside the region from owning property and getting jobs in the Union Territory. Satpal Nischal, the jeweller, who ran a shop for over four decades on Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street, was from Punjab’s Gurdaspur Punjab. He had purchased a house and a shop after acquiring domicile status for him and his family as per the new rules. Police said they have obtained some leads from the murder scene and were looking at all angles, including The Resistance Front (TRF)’s claim that it murdered Nischal. “We are investigating the case and are even looking what TRF has said in a Facebook post,” said sub-divisional police officer Shahjahan Ahmad, who is involved in the investigation into the murder. In the Facebook post, the TRF claimed Nischal was part of what it described as a “settler-colonial project” in Kashmir. It added he was murdered in an “intelligence-based operation” while calling Nischal an agent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological fountainhead. The TRF claimed Nischal was “posing as a businessman” and added he “was an active participant” in the demographic change and settler project “run by Hindutva fascists to alter the demography of Kashmir”. The post said TRF has warned Indian nationals irrespective of faith, caste, or colour that they will be treated as RSS agents and not civilians if they come to Kashmir with the intention of settling here. “For a long time, we warned and now the time has come when we shall warn no more. We know your names, we know where you live and we know what you do and we are coming for you,” said the TRF post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-probe-srinagar-jeweller-s-murder-as-little-known-group-claims-responsibility/story-MPumjuc0LOsyduwzMNRriN.html

Our government’s commitment to the welfare of farmers is unparalleled,” Javadekar tweeted.On Friday, over 850 academicians from different parts of the country came out strongly in support of the agricultural reform laws brought by the government, saying these Acts seek to free farm trade from restrictions and enable farmers to sell their produce at competitive prices.In a statement, the academicians who also include a few Vice-Chancellors, said that union government has repeatedly assured the farmers that these three farm laws will not do away with Minimum Support Price (MSP) “but rather free the farm trade from all illicit market restrictions, open the market beyond ‘mandis’ and further assists the small and marginal farmers to sell their produce at market/competitive prices”.“The new laws also provide full autonomy for farmers to sell their produce. We strongly believe in the government’s assurance to the farmers to protect their livelihoods. The government is still firmly committed to delivering the principle of minimum government, maximum governance,” the statement said.“We stand in solidarity with both the government and the farmers and salute their intense efforts. We all will live, progress, and develop together and peacefully,” the academicians said.The statement comes amid continued protest by farmers on Delhi borders against the three laws - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The government and farmers have held six rounds of talks so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-s-commitment-to-welfare-of-farmers-unparalleled-prakash-javadekar/story-QCN3xyasAddIoXBhGSlIdO.html
02-01-2021||India||Airtel writes to DoT, says Jio’s charges against it baseless, outrageous||After Jio’s purported allegations that channel partners of rival telcos were inciting and provoking agitators involved in tower disruption, Airtel has shot-off a letter to the telecom department slamming the charges as baseless and outrageous.Airtel has told the Department of Telecom (DoT) that Jio’s allegations against it did not demonstrate any evidence that Bharti had any hand in the ongoing issues that the company is facing, and that the complaint should be dismissed “with the contempt that it deserves”.The letter by Airtel to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said the company is aware of a complaint made by Reliance Jio to the department dated December 28, in reference to the disruption of RJIL (Reliance Jio) services due to farmer’s protests in Punjab and Haryana.Airtel noted that a similar allegation had been levelled by Jio in a letter to the telecom regulator earlier in December to which the company had responded.“The baseless allegation made by Jio that Airtel is behind the farmer agitation to ‘sabotage’ their network and to force customers to switch to Airtel is therefore simply outrageous,” Bharti Airtel’s Chief Regulatory Officer Rahul Vatts said in the letter to the DoT dated December 28.Airtel added that Jio’s complaint does not bear any evidence that Airtel has any hand in the ongoing issues that Jio is facing.“In fact, we are amused as to how Jio can even believe that Airtel would be so omnipotent as to make customers forcibly port out of Jio. If we had this power, we would have exercised it over the last three years when Jio amassed a massive number of customers,” Airtel said.Jio’s letter to the DoT had claimed that “majority of the current sabotage and damage of RJIL network in Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country is as a result of the blatant efforts by some of the distributors, retailer and channel partners of Airtel and VIL in a malicious and inciteful campaign to capitalise on the ongoing farmers protest”.Jio had said the target of the campaign was to disrupt its services and leverage these disruptions to promote mobile number portability to other networks.Jio has said in its letter that “evidences clearly and unimpeachably demonstrate the direct involvement of channel partners of Airtel and VIL in these disruptions as well as Airtel and VIL’s (Vodafone Idea) ineffectiveness in controlling them”.A mail sent by PTI to Reliance Jio on the issue did not elicit a response.Meanwhile, rubbishing the charges levelled against it, Airtel said Jio’s complaint against the company was “in poor taste” and urged the telecom department to dismiss this complaint “with the contempt that it deserves”.“We have seen a history of Jio going to any length to make baseless allegations, adopt bullying tactics and use intimidatory behaviour to suit their purposes and meet their goals. This is another such instance,” Airtel said in its letter to the DoT.Airtel said that it has operated in the telecom industry for 25 years, during which it had competed hard in the market place to serve customers with excellence. The telecom firm asserted that it has always conducted business with character and transparency.“The irony of the situation is that while the operating teams were having several conversations over the last few days on how to provide support to the Jio teams based on their request, Jio was actually spending time drafting frivolous letters and making scurrilous allegations,” Airtel said.Airtel said it strongly condemns any person disrupting telecom networks or services to customers.“Telecom is an essential infrastructure and we believe it is against the law to indulge in such acts. As a matter of fact, we have always advocated firm Government action to ensure 100 per cent continuity of networks,” it added.It urged the DoT to bring forth a policy to mandate ICR (Intra circle roaming) in such situations of vandalism and network outages as a matter of course so that customers were never inconvenienced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airtel-writes-to-dot-says-jio-s-charges-against-it-baseless-outrageous/story-UISJ4l5rghWUgwqApe5TuI.html

02-01-2021||India||‘Nation first mantra behind PM Modi’s rising popularity’: Javadekar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s high popularity over the past six years is an indication of the acceptance of his “prudent” policies and is a “rare phenomenon”, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said on Saturday. “His popularity is increasing because he is prudent and has a definitive vision for the development of the nation,” the minister said addressing the media. Javadekar cited the findings of a data firm Morning Consult, which shows that in the approval ratings of world leaders, the net approval for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the highest at 55%, which puts him ahead of several world leaders. The survey shows that over 75% of the respondents approve of Modi while 20% disapprove of him, which puts his net approval rating at 55%. Leaders of Mexico and Australia are second and third in the list of popular leaders.As per the survey, the ranking is far better for PM Modi as compared to other global leaders, German chancellor Angela Merkel, for instance, has a rating of 24%, while it is in the negative for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The firm tracks the approval rating for leaders of 13 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. “There has been praise for the PM’s policies including from the World Health Organisation,” Javadekar said. He went on to add that the PM has won various international awards for his work and policies. “…Everything for the country and country is everything that is the way he has worked. He gave simple slogans during the corona crisis to drive home the need for maintaining physical distance and other Covid-19 protocols. Because of his initiatives such as made in India, made for the world, India’s heft has increased internationally,” he said. Even as the opposition has criticised the government’s response to the corona crisis, particularly the lockdowns, Javadekar said India was not caught napping when cases of infection began to be reported in January last year. The opposition parties such as the Congress had referred to the lockdowns as unplanned and said it forced thousands of migrant workers to walk their way home to their native states in the absence of proper planning.

02-01-2021||India||SC stays for 2 weeks demolition of BJP MLA’s illegal construction in Roorkee||The Supreme Court on Saturday stayed for two weeks the demolition of an alleged illegal construction done by the BJP legislator from Roorkee, Pradeep Batra. In a special sitting over the weekend, the SC bench, headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, asked the MLA to approach the high court with his request to carry out demolition of all identified unauthorised constructions by himself. The bench heard senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi on behalf of Batra, as the lawyer submitted that the MLA will himself pull down all illegal constructions after an inspection and identification by the Roorkee- Haridwar municipal authorities. Rohatgi, assisted by advocate Gagan Gupta, also conceded that in case Batra fails to raze the unauthorised construction within a week of such identification by the municipal authorities, the officers would be free to forthwith demolish the same by taking help of local police force, if necessary. Taking on record these submissions, the bench, which also included Justice BR Gavai, agreed to give two weeks’ time to the MLA for approaching the Uttarakhand High Court with a formal application in this regard. The court ordered a status quo for two weeks but also clarified that it has not expressed any merit on Batra’s contentions. “It will be open to the High Court to accept the suggestion/proposal as made by the petitioners or to reject the same. We are not expressing any opinion either way on the merits of the said statement,” added the bench. On December 24, the high court had paved way for demolishing a large part of Batra’s property in Roorkee, rejecting his plea that a request for settling the dispute after paying for the illegal construction, identified by the municipal authorities, is pending since 2017. The high court noted that the authorities have on December 18 issued a demolition order and hence, there was no requirement to wait for disposal of Batra’s application to compound the irregularities. The order had come on a public interest litigation (PIL) by one Gaurav Pundir in 2017. Pundir alleged that the MLA and his family had illegally constructed a building on a ‘Nazul’ land (land in government’s control) in Roorkee. The PIL had also stated that various notices and orders on illegal constructions were issued to Batra by the municipal authorities since 2015 but the MLA went ahead with further constructions. Subsequently, the high court heard Batra’s contentions and also the municipal authorities before giving a go ahead for the demolition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-for-2-weeks-demolition-of-bjp-mla-s-illegal-construction-in-roorkee/story-sb2rZnT8N5bskN0oZ8cDvM.html

It has cleared all safety trials and there are no adverse effects. People should not hesitate in taking the vaccine,” Mande told ANI. Talking about the vaccine dry run that took place in four states across the country, Mande said, “If Dr Harsh Vardhan said the dry run was a success in four states, that is the most authentic voice of the government. This is a very good development and should set the country on track for vaccination as soon as approval is granted.” He further compared the nation-wide vaccination process to the general elections. “When the vaccine eventually gets regulatory approval, there is a huge task ahead of the government to make sure that all our population gets vaccinated. Calling it a ‘mammoth task’ would be an understatement. It is like conducting the general elections,” he said. He further stressed the importance of preparedness to get the vaccine to the people, deliver it to them, and monitor them afterwards for at least a short while to check for adverse reactions. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the objective of the dry run that took place today for Covid-19 vaccine introduction was to “assess operational feasibility in the use of Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application in a field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide the way forward prior to actual implementation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-is-safe-people-should-not-hesitate-to-take-it-says-csir-dg/story-O9mN0nReVCPYLS4c7t0mgL.html

Yadav’s statement comes just a couple of days before the seventh round of discussion between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives to break the deadlock over the three farm laws.“It’s a plain lie that the government has accepted 50% of farmers’ demands. We’ve got nothing on paper yet,” Yadav was quoted as saying by PTI.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said earlier this week that after the round of talks between the Centre and the farmers’ representatives on Wednesday, the two had reached a consensus on two out of four issues. The Swaraj India leader, however, rubbished these claims. “Our two main demands — three farm bills should be scrapped and legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP) are still pending,” he said.Yadav said that if the farmers’ demands were not met after the meeting with the Centre on January 4, a march would be held on January 6. “The next round of talks with the government will be held on January 4 and if our demands are not accepted, we will hold a march at Kundli-Manesar-Palwal on January 6. We will announce a date about when and move forward from Shahjahanpur border,” he said.Farmers across the country, especially from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting around Delhi against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws that were passed in September. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The demonstrators have made it clear that they would not accept anything less than a complete rollback of the three laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/still-pending-yogendra-yadav-over-centre-s-claims-of-resolving-50-of-farmers-issues/story-oV49hndi1Qkco1xpPN6LkO.html

02-01-2021||India||Protesting farmers to hold tractor parade on Jan 26 in Delhi if demands not met||Tens of thousands of protesting farmers will enter the national capital on Jan 26, Republic Day, and carry out a tractor parade if their demands for a repeal of three farm laws and a law guaranteeing minimum prices for crops are not met by then, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, said on Saturday. Addressing a press conference in the capital, a seven-member team that is coordinating the over one month-long protests, spelt out a fresh agitation agenda spanning 15 days from Jan 6, which includes picketing Raj Bhavans, onward marches from six blockade sites on Delhi’s borders and a “rehearsal” for the Jan 26 tractor parade. The farm leaders said they would wait for the outcome of January 4 talks with the government and the Supreme Court’s hearing on January 5 on a clutch of petitions related to the three farm laws. “This is our ultimatum. If all issues are not resolved and our demands are not met by Republic Day, then we will start entering Delhi. The government is saying that 50% of the demands have been met. But the government has shown no signs of meeting our biggest demands,” said Yogendra Yadav, a leader of the platform leading the protests. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in recent years to demand that the Centre revokes the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September last year. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Also Read: Confident ongoing farm stir will end’: MoS Kailash Choudhary ahead of Jan 4 meetingTogether, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed rates. “Tractors from all neighbouring states will begin rolling into Delhi if matters are not resolved. Contingents from all current blockade sites will start moving. We will continue with our blockade of goods and services of Ambani (Reliance group) and Adani (group), including their products, malls and petrol pumps,” Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader said. The leaders were addressing their first press conference in the national capital since their agitation began. The leaders slammed what they called the government’s propaganda. “The government doesn’t want to withdraw the laws because it has become an ego issue for them. They have tried to tarnish our agitation in countless ways, sometimes calling us Maoists and Khalistani (a reference to Sikh separatists),” Balbir Singh Rajewal said. Asked what the farm unions would do if the Supreme Court were to uphold the validity of the laws, he said: “We are not a party to the case. But we will make a decision when the appropriate time comes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protesting-farmers-to-hold-tractor-parade-on-jan-26-in-delhi-if-demands-not-met/story-4YqXsNX59nEMmcWfTi6Q1K.html

The tractor parade with the national flag will be called ‘Kisaan Parade’,” Krantikari Kisan union president Darshan Pal said, according to news agency ANI.“We were peaceful, are peaceful and will be peaceful, but will stay at Delhi borders until new farm laws are repealed,” said one of the leaders of the protesting farmers’ unions, according to PTI.Farmer groups continued to block traffic from Ghaziabad and Noida to Delhi on Saturday. The Singhu and Tikri border crossing points from Delhi to Haryana have also remained completely blocked since last month when the farmer agitation against three laws enacted to liberalize the sector started. At the Ghazipur border, the service lane of National Highway-24 continued to remain closed for traffic.Meanwhile, Union minister of state (MoS) for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said a solution would come up during the talks to be held on January 4 with the farmers and that the ongoing deadlock would end. “I am confident that in the next round of talks with farmers, a solution will be reached and the ongoing protest will come to an end. The three farm bills are in favour of farmers. They used to demand to get rid of the middleman and sell their produce at a rate of their choice,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The first five rounds of talks between protesting farmers and the government failed to resolve the deadlock. On December 30, the farmers’ unions decided to meet the ministers for the sixth time. The government only agreed to address two of the four issues raised by farmers, which were sparing heavy fines for stubble burning and continuing the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use. The farmers have said they will intensify their stir if their demands are nor met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-tractor-parade-in-delhi-on-jan-26-say-protesting-farmers/story-MopzXZr3m9aRfCkVbKjiNL.html

Munawar Faruqui, who is from Gujarat, and Edvin Anthony, Prakhar Vyas, Priyam Vyas and Nalin Yadav were performing at a New Year’s event at a café in Indore when a group of Hindu Rakshak Sanstha members entered the venue and created a ruckus. The comedians also allegedly made remarks against Union home minister Amit Shah.The group accused the comedians of “indecent and disgraceful” remarks against Hindu Gods and Goddesses, customs, and Shah, a police officer said. They took them to a police station, allegedly roughed them up and later filed a First Information Report (FIR) against them.

Responding to Velumani’s challenge to prove the corruption charges levelled against him or quit politics, Stalin said, “I am ready to quit politics. Are you (Velumani) ready?” The DMK Chief was addressing a people’s gram sabha meeting at Devarayapuram in Thondamuthur constituency, represented by the minister. Referring to the memorandum submitted by the DMK to the Governor last month listing corruption charges against the CM and his colleagues, Velumani had said he would step down from his post if the charges were proved and sought to know whether Stalin was ready to quit politics if he failed to do so. “We will not only prove the charges against the minister, but also drag him to the court of law and get him punished for his corrupt deeds...” Stalin said. Stalin promised to order an inquiry into the ‘mysterious death’ of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, since the judicial commission constituted by the government has not submitted its report even after three years, immediately after assuming power. The DMK leader also mocked AIADMK for announcing K Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate, as its alliance partner BJP was yet to endorse it. Though the state government has banned gram sabha meetings, the party was holding people’s gram sabha meetings and lauded the participation in large numbers, as they had given a big mandate to DMK in the last Lok Sabha and local body elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-quit-politics-if-i-fail-to-prove-graft-charges-against-tn-min-says-stalin/story-0ADLjqkpfAqNxz2coyFWaI.html

The activity will be conducted in all state capitals in at least three session sites and some states will also include districts that are remote. Maharashtra and Kerala are likely to schedule the dry run in major cities other than their capitals. “The dry run will also equip the State and UT administration in the management of vaccine supply, storage and logistics including cold chain management,” the Union health ministry has said.The government has already conducted a two-day pilot Covid-19 vaccination drive in eight districts in four states from December 28-29. Meanwhile, India’s Covid-19 tally has mounted to 10,286,709 and 148,994 people have succumbed to the viral disease, according to the Union health ministry.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayHere is all you need to know about the dry run:1. The Union health ministry has said that the objective of the dry run for Covid-19 vaccine introduction is to “assess operational feasibility in the use of COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) application in a field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide way forward prior to actual implementation”. This is also expected to give confidence to programme managers at various levels, it said.2. During the dry run, for each of the three-session sites, the concerned medical officer-in-charge will identify 25 test beneficiaries, who will be healthcare workers. The states/UTs have been asked to ensure that the data of these beneficiaries is uploaded in Co-WIN. Also read | Why India could catch up quickly on Covid vaccination3. These beneficiaries will also be available at the session site for the dry run. The states and Union territories will also prepare the facilities and create users on CoWIN application, including uploading the data of health care worker beneficiaries.4. The states and Union territories have been asked to ensure physical verification of all proposed sites for the adequacy of space, logistical arrangements, internet connectivity, electricity, safety etc for demonstration.5. The model sites will have separate entry and exit in the three-room set-up – one waiting room, one vaccination room, and an observation room – with adequate space outside for awareness generation activities.Also read | Despite vaccine, don’t lower guard: Experts6.

02-01-2021||India||TMC suffers setback after more leaders switch sides||The Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress celebrated its 23rd foundation day on Friday amid fresh setbacks in two of its prestigious citadels in poll-bound West Bengal. Soumendu Adhikari, former chairman of Kanthi municipality and brother of Suvendu Adhikari, joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday. Suvendu, the party’s former MLA from Nandigram in East Midnapore, had defected to the BJP on December 20. Rabindranath Bhattacharya, TMC MLA from Singur, skipped the party’s foundation day celebration in his constituency. It was attended by an MLA from an adjacent constituency. Singur and Nandigram are prestigious constituencies for the party because mass movements against land acquisition in these two areas during 2006-08 paved the way for Mamata Banerjees’s political resurrection. “On #TMCFoundationDay, I extend my sincere gratitude to our Maa-Mati-Manush and all our workers who continue to fight with us in making Bengal better and stronger each day. The Trinamool family will carry on with this resolve for times to come! As Trinamool turns 23 today, I look back at the journey we began on January 1st, 1998. Our years have been of immense struggle, but throughout this time we have continued to achieve our objective of being committed to the cause of only the people,” Banerjee tweeted on Friday. Earlier this week, Suvendu Adhikari had hinted at a BJP rally that all his family members would be joining the saffron party soon. “Let me tell you that the lotus will bloom in my home. Wait for Ram Navami and Basanti Puja,” Adhikari said on December 29.Three days later, his brother Soumendu joined the BJP at a rally addressed by Suvendu at Kanthi in East Midnapore. Earlier, Soumendu was removed as the civic board chief by the TMC. He moved the high court against that decision.“Those who want to leave the party are free to go. Mamata Banerjee had successfully uprooted the 34-year-old Left Front regime. We are not concerned. We would win the polls again fighting under Mamata Banerjee,” said Sheikh Sufian, senior TMC leader and deputy chairman of the East Midnapore zilla parishad. Rabindranath Bhattacharya, a party old-timer and Singur MLA, had attacked party colleague Becharam Manna, the party MLA from Haripal in the same district. Though Bhattacharya could not be contacted after he skipped Friday’s function, Manna said: “Invitation had been sent to everyone for Friday’s foundation day program. He might have some other commitments. It won’t be right to see such things in bad light especially on the foundation day.” The TMC faced its first setback in Singur when the opposition BJP got a lead in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Buoyed by its impressive gains in those polls where the party won 18 of 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-member legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-suffers-setback-after-more-leaders-switch-sides/story-YtuGiECYYPwKS43DsWQXGN.html
02-01-2021||India||Govt committed to delivering on promise of housing for all: PM Modi||The Union government’s policies over the last six years have restored the faith of consumers that they can own homes of their own and rely on laws to support them if builders fail to deliver on time, Prime Minister Narenda Modi on Friday said while laying the foundation stone of the Light House Project under the Global Housing Technology Challenge-India scheme across six states. The project aims to construct of low-cost houses using alternative global technologies, materials and processes in six cities -- Indore (Madhya Pradesh), Rajkot (Gujarat), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Agartala (Tripura) and Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh). About 1,000 houses at each location, along with allied infrastructure facilities, are meant to be constructed in a year’s time. Six chief ministers were present for the meeting, Shivraj Singh Chauhan from MP, Yogi Adityanath from UP, Biplab Deb from Tripura, E Palanisami from Tamil Nadu, Jagan Reddy from Andhra Pradesh and Hemant Soren from Jharkhand.Referring to the project, which he described as an incubation centre, the PM said the government was committed to delivering on its promise of “housing for all” by 2022, and was unwavering in its vows to provide affordable housing for the rural and urban poor, and affordable rented accommodation for migrant workers. The latest project, Modi said, will also strengthen cooperative federalism. “People were losing hope of owning a house even after putting in everything that they had saved. Houses remained on paper… People had also lost faith whether the law of the land will help them if they got into a dispute with the builder,” he said. To address these concerns, steps taken by the government over the past six years have made it easy for a hardworking, middle class family to own a house and restored their faith, Modi said. His reference was to RERA, or the Real Estate Regulation Act, introduced in 2016 to protect the interest of homebuyers from malpractices and builders defaulting on deliveries. “RERA has helped the people believe in reality projects again and that the projects will be completed. Today, 60,000 real-estate projects are registered under RERA. Thousands of cases have also been solved under the law,” Modi said. Even as the PM appreciated the efforts made by the states in providing housing for the poor; he criticised previous governments for not prioritising the sector. “Housing plans were not the priority of the central government in the past. They did not care about the details of quality of construction. There was a chalta hai, chalne do (let it be) approach… why shouldn’t the country get new technology, and the houses we build should be chust (swift) and durust (sturdy),” he said. The Prime Minister also announced the winners of the Affordable Sustainable Housing Accelerators -- Uttar Pradesh topped the list followed by Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-delivering-on-promise-of-housing-for-all-pm-modi/story-whyuUFqEFDleEFcN0q6cbN.html
02-01-2021||India||For Mahatma Gandhi patriotism and Hinduism were not separate: Bhagwat||Patriotism and Hinduism were not separate from each other for the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said at a book launch on Friday. Speaking at Rajghat during the launch of Making of a Hindu Patriot: Background of Gandhiji’s Hind Swaraj, by JK Bajaj and MD Srinivas, Bhagwat said: “Gandhi ji has said my patriotism comes from my dharma. If you are a Hindu, then it is natural that you are a patriot.” In the book, the authors have quoted Gandhi having written to Leo Tolstoy, “…My patriotism is patent enough, my love for India is ever growing but it is derived from my religion and is therefore in no sense exclusive.” Bhagwat also stressed that Hinduism believes in the existence of unity. “Difference does not mean separatism,” he said, and quoted Gandhi as having said that his religion takes all other religions along. Referring to Gandhi’s emphasis on Swaraj, or self-rule, Bhagwat said that for Gandhi the struggle for Swaraj was not only about replacing the rulers but the reconstruction of society based on civilisational values. “A country is more than just land but when we say rashtra (nation) it means everything including the forest, the rivers and all living beings. You cannot understand what Swaraj is, till you understand swadharma,” he said. Bhagwat also refuted the charge levelled by critics that the Sangh was trying to appropriate Gandhi. He said such personalities cannot be appropriated by anyone. Even as the RSS has steadfastly distanced itself from Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse, those critical of the Sangh allege that Godse’s Hindu Mahasabha was inspired by the RSS. The Sangh was banned for the first time after the assassination, but the ban was revoked in July 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-mahatma-gandhi-patriotism-and-hinduism-were-not-separate-bhagwat/story-ERtkRDbvNykuzysQvGfAQM.html
02-01-2021||India||Paddy procurement at MSP up 23%: Govt data||The Union government bought a record 47.9 million tonne of kharif (monsoon crops) paddy in its ongoing procurement operations, 23% more than it did last year, according to data released by the government. Nearly 6 million farmers have been paid minimum support prices worth Rs 9000 crore for these purchases, the data show. The higher procurement comes at a time when farm unions protesting on Delhi’s borders have demanded making federally fixed assured prices or MSP a legal right. Paddy is the main summer staple that drives the incomes of cultivators in states, such as Punjab. The food ministry’s official projections show the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will likely touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from the total quantity of 62.7 million procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%. Punjab’s share in total paddy procurement stands at 42%.  The food ministry has expanded its procurement operations, which refers to the government’s buying of farm produce at assured prices, for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised by 27% the number of paddy-purchase centres, which now stand at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year, official figures show. Farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana are protesting reforms that allow agribusiness to freely trade farm produce, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. A crucial change is that traders, agribusinesses and supermarkets can buy produce from any market, rather than only in notified markets where they are licenced to operate. The government enacted three laws on Sept 24 to usher in these changes. The laws have angered farmers, particularly in Punjab, who fear the reforms could pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers growers an assured price, leave them vulnerable to powerful agribusinesses and in an even weaker negotiating position than before. Read more| The government and farmers’ dialogue is good newsTo placate farmers, the government’s food buying agencies have launched large buying operations in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Kerala, Gujarat, Assam and Andhra Pradesh. The Centre has fixed an MSP for the so-called common variety paddy at Rs 1,868 per quintal and for the A grade variety at Rs 1,888 per quintal for the current year. The government had initially set a total rice procurement target of 49.5 million tonnes for the entire country for the 2020-21 kharif season. In addition, the government has also accelerated purchase of other crops. “Up to 30.12.2020, the Government through its Nodal Agencies has procured 251633.79 MT of Moong, Urad, Groundnut Pods and Soyabean having MSP value of Rs.1346.76 Crores benefitting 1,35,813 farmers in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan,” a government note said. To be sure, production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonne, slightly higher than the 143.4 million tonne produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-at-msp-up-23-govt-data/story-urb2hArzTjpuruIyVgAVFI.html

Governor Anandiben Patel will administer the oath of office and secrecy to the new ministers in the Raj Bhavan at 12.30 pm on Sunday, the official said.There are six berths vacant in the cabinet after three ministers losing the bypolls in November this year and two ministers - Tulsi Silavat and Govind Singh Rajput resigning from the cabinet in the run-up to the bypolls in October as they completed six months in their respective office without being members of the state assembly. One berth was already vacant.Sources said Chouhan is most likely to induct Silavat and Rajput into the cabinet. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Cabinet expansion is chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s prerogative. The party is not aware as to how many MLAs will be inducted in the cabinet as ministers.” This will be the first expansion of Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet after the assembly bypolls in November which saw Chouhan government gaining majority in the 230-member assembly with 126 members. Earlier, he had expanded his cabinet on July 2 with 28 new ministers including 20 cabinet ministers and 8 ministers of state. Twelve of the 28 ministers were ex-MLAs who later contested the bypolls. Earlier, there were just six ministers in the cabinet including CM Chouhan. While Chouhan was sworn in as the chief minister on March 23 he inducted five ministers in his cabinet on April 21. The cabinet can have a maximum of 35 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-to-expand-his-cabinet-on-sunday/story-MFVMLMDBkMFzpUSlbXRdRL.html
02-01-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s January 2, 2021, the vaccine is here, and it’s time for this column, which began on March 19, 2020, to end. The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has recommended that emergency use approval be granted to Covishield, the name given to the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine by the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making it in India, paving the way for its approval by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI). This approval is a mere formality. India now has a vaccine, and it could start vaccinating the 300 million people in its primary priority groups as early as next week. It hopes to achieve that target by July. The Covid-19 pandemic started slow in India. The country didn’t register what everyone (including the managers of the HT dashboard) counts as its first case till early March (three returnees from Wuhan tested positive in late January, but there were no cases between then and early March). India went in for a hard lockdown from March 25, a day when it registered 90 new cases, taking its total to 657 cases, with 11 deaths. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe lockdown would go on for 68 days, although some restrictions were eased in phases in between, and the number of cases continued to rise through it. When it ended, on May 31, India’s dashboard showed a total of 190,533 cases and 5,328 deaths. The number of cases soared after that, reaching its peak on September 10, when, according to the HT dashboard, the country registered 99,181 new cases. I remember writing then that it was only a matter of time before India started seeing at least 100,000 new cases a day. I was wrong (thankfully)! The number of cases started falling. Around Diwali, it looked like India was nearing the end of its first wave; but soon after the festival, the number of cases started rising and I wrote about an imminent second wave. I was wrong (thankfully), again! My colleague, Kunal Pradhan, who has edited more of these columns than anybody else, has kept me informed about Indian cricketers who scored famous Test hundreds that matched the column number (he started doing this after I crossed 100 columns), and like anyone who has scored 238, I have played and missed a few times. For the benefit of those who want to know, he couldn’t recall anyone who scored 238, although Google informs me that this is the number of Test centuries scored at Lord’s. India’s approval of a vaccine comes even as the seven-day average of daily cases has fallen to 19,828, and the number of active cases in the country is 255,584, the lowest since July 5, according to the HT dashboard. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently attributing this to the wearing of masks, but as anyone who has travelled even briefly to rural India knows that most people there do not wear masks. I took the day off on December 31 and went on a dawn-to-dusk birding expedition in rural Haryana, and can vouch for this. It isn’t just Haryana; on a trip to Uttarakhand in late October that took me through Uttar Pradesh, I saw that very few people in small towns in India’s most populous state were sporting masks. Read more| Key expert panel meet today to review data on Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech Covid-19 vaccinesSo, why have India’s numbers fallen? In Dispatch 226, on December 16, I put forth some theories; the truth is simply that no one really knows – but we aren’t complaining. If India can get its vaccination drive going soon, and build some momentum into it – drives in many other countries have run into delays – and if the numbers continue to stay low (for whatever reason), the country will likely escape a second wave. HT will maintain a dashboard of the vaccination drive, and report on it from the ground, but I had always told myself that this column would end the day India approved a vaccine. The fortuitous timing of that approval, on the first day of a new year that we all hope will be better than the one gone by, means Dispatch 238, dated January 2, will be the last edition of this column. Goodbye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-gcLOUs3Hd603b240WeRj1O.html
02-01-2021||India||Farmers to intensify stir if Jan 4 talks not fruitful||Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the farmers’ collective protesting three recent agriculture laws, said on Friday that they would intensify their agitation if the government did not accede to their demands during the next round of talks.The leaders said they had prepared their agitation schedule, which would be activated depending on how the talks would go on January 4. Taking to reporters, the leaders said the two demands agreed to by the Centre were “minor”, while the major issues were yet to be resolved. “Abhi tak poonch nikli hai, haathi baki hai (Only a small part has been resolved. The big issues remain),” Yogendra Yadav, one of the leaders, said. “I don’t believe in this statement (by the government) that 50% of the issues have been resolved. The fact is the government hasn’t showed any willingness to repeal the laws and has also not agreed in principle for a law on minimum support prices,” Yadav said. “If the talks do not progress on January 4, then the farmers will start marching from their designated camps on January 6, including the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway,” he said.Read more| Farmers continue protests outside Delhi, say no question of withdrawing 2 demandsThe boycott of goods and services of certain industrial groups, including fuel stations and shopping malls run by them, would continue, said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the farmers’ agitation. Pal said all toll gates would be picketed on major highways to allow vehicles to pass freely as part of the protests. The farm leaders also said they would hold a tractor rally on January 6 if the laws are not repealed.“It seems the government is taking farmers lightly...If the government does not make a decision on January 4 then farmers will have to take a decision,” said Yudhvir Singh of Bhartiya Kisan Union.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a platform of protesting farmer unions, on Friday blamed Niti Aayog assessments of India being a food-surplus country and government economists who use this to argue against procurement of farm produce. “They (Niti Aayog) need to know that India has the maximum and rising number of hungry people,” said Avik Saha, secretary of the AIKSCC.India slipped on a global ranking of the prevailing hunger situation this year. While a Global Hunger Index score of below 34.9 indicates acute hunger crises, India’s score has fallen from 38.8 in 2000 to 27.2 in 2020. In 2019, the score was 30.3. “This is the result of complete government apathy and the recent decision of the Cabinet to divert foodgrains for alcohol production by companies is proof of this apathy towards the poor. This is despite claims of more than required production of food,” the AIKSCC said. Read more| Protesting farmers stay put in severe Delhi cold as talks with government remain deadlockedRepeating its demand to repeal the new laws, the AIKSCC said: “The Acts will erode food procurement and undermine the public distribution system, will replace basic food production by commercial crops profitable to the corporate and will give freedom to the corporate to purchase, hoard and blackmarket food.”The AIKSCC said the New Year was observed by millions of people by taking a pledge to struggle with the farmers and against rising hunger in the country. Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations.

Amit Kumar, circle officer (CO), Rudrapur, said, “Four persons have been arrested for robbing an employee of a cash management company, while a fifth suspect is absconding. One of the students revealed during interrogation that he committed the crime to deposit his school fee.” Kumar said, “The student revealed that his father works in a factory in Rudrapur. After his father’s salary was reduced by the management due to loss to the factory, he was not in a position to deposit the school fees so he got involved in crime.” The accused looted ₹ 5.35-lakh from Sachin Sharma, a resident of Balwant Enclave Colony and an employee of a cash management company at gunpoint, the officer said. Kumar said Sharma was on his way to the bank to deposit the cash and cheques.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-blues-man-gets-pay-cut-son-robs-to-pay-school-fees/story-QT1j2LvHP3MISBhQTUj4oI.html
02-01-2021||India||Pvt firms, PSUs set to get access to crime database||In a controversial decision, the Centre has decided to give companies, including state-owned ones, access to the national database of crimes and criminals across the country for the purpose of background checks, people familiar with the development said. Currently, companies have to make such requests to the police. The idea, they added on condition of anonymity, is to monetise this data; companies will be charged for the background check. But internet activists say that the move could lead to misuse of data, and discrimination. Having access to this repository of data on arrests, convictions, ongoing investigations, court cases, and lists of proclaimed offenders, companies will be able to verify people’s criminal history on their own before hiring them. Right now, only the government and police have exclusive access to this crucial and sensitive data. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) has already given its approval to monetise the CCTNS national data centre, also called CAS (Core Application Software) Centre, located at Shastri Park, New Delhi, for background checks, the people familiar with the development said. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been asked to develop a portal for this. As part of the project, companies will have access to database of National Data Centre (NDC), National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) and Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) for which they will have to pay a prescribed fee. The fee amount has not been decided yet, the people cited above said. Read more| Rs 2.5 crore Delhi cryptocurrency scam: Dubai-based kingpin arrested from airportThe portal, once developed by NIC, will enable a user (only companies ) to register and request antecedent verification in bulk and pay online. “The system will match the given details of persons such as name, age/age range, state, district and police station of his current and permanent address, with existing criminal records under CCTNS. If a person’s name is found in the data, the user will be able to check the details, down to the level of the FIR, in the case of police cases. However, if the person’s name is not there in the database, it will show ‘no criminal record found’, ’’ said one of the people cited above. CCTNS (Crime & Criminals Tracking Network Systems) is a comprehensive and integrated system connecting all the police stations and investigation agencies across the country. It has a database that updates in real-time details of cases, criminals, courts, finger print bureaus, forensic labs etc. The database also has information on arrests, convictions, charge-sheets, lists of proclaimed and habitual offenders, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies (UIDB), registered vehicles. It even has photographs and, where applicable, screenshots. As of now, 97 % (15,620) out of 16,098 police stations across the country have already been connected to CCTNS. The database has about 280 million records till December 2020 and is being updated every minute. Read more| DDA to launch housing scheme tomorrow, most expensive flat to cost Rs2 croreIsh Kumar, former director of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), said: “The current process of antecedent verification is cumbersome as the request is sent to police, which takes time. The CCTNS data centre has national level data which can be checked within seconds. This can help companies verify if their employee has any criminal record anywhere in the country and simultaneously generate some money for the government. Similarly, at a later stage, this data can be used for passport verification, verification of private security guards/agencies across the country.” On possible discrimination by companies against employees who have been acquitted or are yet to be held guilty. Ish Kumar added: “The government can only provide information. Whether the case (against the employee) amounts to disqualification depends on the policy of the company”. MHA officials declined to comment on the matter. Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now and board chairperson, Internet Freedom Foundation, said: “There is a pattern of government collecting data and making it available for the industry. Aarogya Setu app is one such example. CCTNS itself has lot of sensitive data which is problematic and there is no oversight. Giving a third-party access to it not only infringes the right to privacy but it can lead to misuse of data, especially when the data protection bill has not been passed by Parliament”. Amber Sinha, research director at Centre for Internet and Society (CIS), said, “Such sensitive data, which already suffers from social inequality and discrimination, coming into the hands of companies can lead to further discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pvt-firms-psus-set-to-get-access-to-crime-database/story-4JqLbe8qgtOuVSujVl3n9O.html
02-01-2021||India||Despite vaccine, don’t lower guard: Experts||Experts welcomed Friday’s steps by a key government panel to approve a coronavirus vaccine but said the development must not be seen as a chance for people to begin letting their guard down in preventing Covid-19 infections soon. Their comments came after the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs and Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) cleared the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which will now need to be assessed for a formal approval by the Drugs Controller General of India.“It is fantastic news that we have a vaccine in such a short time, however it will be counter-productive if people believe that now is the time to throw the precautions out of the window. First, the vaccine will be given to a very small number of people at the moment. There aren’t enough doses to immunise everyone in the world right now. Second, even for those who do receive the vaccine, the two doses would be at least one month apart and it will take about two weeks after that for the immune response to kick in,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. Some of the restrictions and the Covid appropriate behaviours will have to remain in place for at least six to eight months he said.Read more| Why India could catch up quickly on Covid vaccinationHe added, “Third, the vaccine is 80 to 90% effective, meaning there would still be 10 to 20% people susceptible among the group that receives the vaccine. So, to protect everyone from the disease people will still need to follow the social vaccines of wearing a mask, maintaining social distance, and washing hands frequently.” Maintaining the restrictions even when the vaccine become available is essential also because even those who do get the vaccine can still keep transmitting it to others who are susceptible. Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance said, “This is possibly the best news in a while. The good thing is that we are manufacturing it and we do not need to go begging for the doses. However, people will still have to take precautions because the vaccines have shown to protect from the disease and not infection. What this means is a vaccinated person can continue transmitting the infection to a susceptible population.” Along with the vaccine roll-out in India and other countries, Dr Jameel emphasised on the need for stepping up genomic surveillance to detect mutations that can escape the vaccine. When a large proportion of the population gets vaccinated, it results in the virus selectively mutating to evade the immune response generated by vaccines. This is just like over-use or incomplete use of antibiotics results in resistant strains of the bacteria. In vaccine, it usually happens in people who do not generate a robust immune response after immunisation, said Dr Jameel. “If a virus does mutate under pressure from a vaccine, two things can happen. One, it might mutate in such a way that it is unable to infect human cells as effectively making it weaker. Or, it can still infect people effectively and dodge the antibodies, but the T cell response will still work against it, meaning it will result in milder disease,” said Jameel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-vaccine-don-t-lower-guard-experts/story-U3wK3pkPqxUkxJv55uH6OM.html
02-01-2021||India||Why India could catch up quickly on Covid vaccination||India could have access to at least 40 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ready to ship from Serum Institute of India (SII) facilities in Pune, potentially helping the country catch up with other nations that have begun vaccinating their citizens. The vaccine, which was recommended for emergency use in India on Friday, is at present the only candidate that will be readily available in mass volumes for the country, but its stockpiles may be among the largest, SII executives have said in recent days. This, coupled with the vaccine’s compatibility with the Indian cold chain network are factors that could help a quick roll-out. With the manufacturing and stockpiling license, the Serum Institute of India has already been able to stockpile 75 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and by the first week of January, we will have 100 million doses. Nobody across the world has so much stock and we can start supplying as soon as we get the approval,” said Umesh Shaligram, director of Research and Development at SII, at a webinar on Thursday.Earlier in the week, SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told reporters that 50% of doses produced will be split between India and Covax Facility, a WHO-led pool to distribute vaccines to low and middle-income countries (LMIC). “...We have always said that we will keep giving 50% of everything we make to India and to Covax at the same time. So, if we are producing 60-70 million doses every month, there will be plenty of vaccines to go around both to India and to Covax countries, including some of our neighbours like Bangladesh etc. because everybody wants the vaccine, and we are trying to give as much as we can and equitably to nations including India,” he said.  Initially, the company may give most of its production to India because to export to these countries, it would need WHO’s pre-qualification, Poonawalla said on Monday.“… that may take another month or so after it is licensed in India. That way India will have priority, and because India is such a large country that we may end up giving a majority of those 50 million doses to India first. Every month we are churning out 40-50 million doses which will go up to about 100 million doses every month by March as by then we are going to commission a third facility that is getting ready. Eventually everyone is going to get it; of course some countries will have to wait a little longer,” he said. According to Our World in Data, close to 10 million vaccinations have already taken place across the world, with China, the US, the UK and Israel having administered the most doses. Among these, Israel has the highest proportion of its population that has received the vaccine at 11%.Read more| Dry run today to test systemsIn terms of volume, China has administered the highest numbers at 4.5 million, but none of its domestically made vaccines have yet been cleared following adequate safety and efficacy trials. Globally, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ticks two crucial boxes – it has received approvals after due scientific process and has secured the most deals for production as well as distribution. According to science analytics company Airfinity, 2.6 billion doses of the vaccine are expected to be produced in 2021. In terms of committed supplies, Oxford and AstraZeneca have been given orders for 3.7 billion doses. In terms of supply volumes, the next largest volumes have been projected for the candidate by Novavax, which too is being manufactured by SII. Novavax is making a vaccine using a tried-and-tested recombinant protein platform and has shown encouraging results, it is likely to take a few more months before late stage trials show efficacy results – the key marker for an inoculation to be assessed. Novavax’s deal with SII could assure India of more supply advantage later this year, since Poonawalla has previously indicated that 50% of all production by the company will be set aside for domestic supplies. India’s other large supplies could come from Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which began its Phase 3 trials in mid-November, and is stated to have an annual production capacity of 300 million doses. A second India-made vaccine is by Gujarat-based Zydus Cadila, which is yet to proceed to Phase 3 III trials. The third highest projected global production for 2021 is for Pfizer-BioNTech at 1.3 billion, according to Airfinity’s assessments, but the dose is considered unfeasible for poorer countries because of its high price and its ultra-cold storage requirements that will need special networks to be erected. The vaccine is expected to cost $20 a dose.This has made the Oxford-AstraZeneca – which will cost $3-4 per dose -- earn the “vaccine for the world” label by several experts. The companies committed to equitable distribution when in June it reached a $750m agreement with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and Gavi, vaccine alliance to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses. Shortly after, it struck a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for low-and-middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020. The efficacy numbers reported from the Oxford-AstraZeneca trial fall below those reported for the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, but it is still well above the 50% threshold identified by regulators around the world as the bar for a vaccine to be considered effective. Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former CEO of Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance said the SEC’s recommendations are “probably the best news in a while”. “The good thing is that we are manufacturing it and we do not need to go begging for the doses. However, people will still have to take precautions because the vaccines have shown to protect from the disease and not infection. What this means is a vaccinated person can continue transmitting the infection to a susceptible population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-could-catch-up-quickly-on-covid-vaccination/story-IPbo7pndG0zUgNUIsy2xHN.html
02-01-2021||India||Happy Vaccine Year||A committee of experts assessing coronavirus vaccines for approval by the drugs regulator recommended on Friday that the candidate developed by University of Oxford and AstraZeneca (and manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India) be cleared, paving the way for Indians to receive their first doses within days.The recommendations of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) are now being assessed by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), who is likely to heed to the advice of the expert committee and issue a formal approval. The DCGI heads CDSCO, the country’s drugs regulator.“The 10-member expert panel has recommended granting EUA (emergency use authorisation) to Serum Institute with certain riders that includes stricter monitoring of beneficiaries who will be given the vaccine shots. The DCGI is going through the report,” a person aware of the process said, asking not to be named. Once formalised, the vaccine – globally known as AZD1222 but to be marketed in India by SII as Covishield – will be the first coronavirus inoculation in the country. DCGI VG Somani had hinted on December 31 that the new year would bring a positive development on the vaccine front. Read more| SII’s Covishield approval: Efficacy, cost and all about AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccineThe SEC was also assessing applications by Pfizer-BioNTech, which was the first to be approved anywhere in the world last month, and by Bharat Biotech, an Indian developer that at present is the furthest along in the process. Pfizer sought more time to appear before the committee and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was not granted approval, with the SEC seeking more data from the Phase 3 trials that began in mid-November. The expert committee’s recommendations for Oxford-AstraZeneca include certain conditions for the approval, which will require SII to closely monitor post-vaccination side-effects after immunisations begin, and to submit a report to authorities every 15 days for the first two months. After this period, the company will need to create monthly reports of observed side-effects during the roll-out, a second person aware of the recommendations said, asking not to be named. “The company will also need to create a detailed fact sheet for patient information with possible AEFI (adverse effect following immunisation) and other detailed information that will be handed out to recipients,” this person added. The company will also need to keep submitting data from ongoing clinical trials in India as well as other locations outside of the country as soon as they are received, the official said. Details about what dosing regimen will be cleared in India will be confirmed after the formal approval by Somani, but India’s approach is likely to follow that of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK, which became the first country to approve AZD1222 after a months-long rolling assessment. Read more| Centre releases Covid-19 vaccine rollout strategy; celebrities, RWA WhatsApp groups part of planIndia’s strategy of dosing recommendations will be closely watched since authorities in the UK indicated the vaccine may have a higher efficacy if the second dose is given later than the 28-day recommended by the manufacturer. The UK authorities said the vaccine can be 80% effective when there are three months between shots, an official involved in approving the vaccine said at a briefing on Wednesday, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found. Later in the same briefing, a British scientist involved in the approval of the vaccine said one dose of the vaccine is around 70% effective after 21 days and before the second dose is given. The vaccine is India’s strongest contender for early access to large volumes. An SII official said on Thursday at a webinar that the company had already stockpiled 75 million doses. SII’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday said the company will be supplying India and Covax in a 50-50 manner as and when it produces vials. It is also easier to store and transport than the other vaccines approved after due scientific process yet. AZD1222 can be kept at refrigerator temperatures (between 2-8°C) for up to six months, which makes it compatible with India’s existing cold chain network.Vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna require freezing to -70°C and -20°C respectively, requiring specialised infrastructure that will be costly to deploy. Read more| Govt’s expert panel approves AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine for emergency useApart from the UK, the vaccine has been approved by Argentina for urgent public use.In late stage trials, AZD1222 showed it had an efficacy of 62% when volunteers were given two full doses of the vaccine. A half dose followed by full dose regimen — which was initially given by accident during UK testing of the vaccine — was found to be 90% effective, but the method did not appear to stand up to the scrutiny of MHRA.The Union government has announced that India targets to vaccinate at least 300 million high-risk people against Covid-19 by July this year – a mammoth task in itself as it would involve administering the shot to 1.5 million people daily if immunisations were to begin in January. The approval now shifts the focus from the national Capital to Hadapsar in Pune, where SII has facilities. According to officials who gave details about the logistics, special cargo planes with cold boxes and refrigerated vans will start ferrying vials to various parts of the country as soon as requisite approvals and orders are in. State administrations will then distribute vials to district authorities for delivery to the hundreds of thousands of inoculation centres to be set up across India. The process will span over several weeks and drills have already been carried out in some regions, with more planned on January 2.Initial lots of the vaccine will be for the first two priority groups—health care and other frontline workers such as police personnel. After these, the government will begin vaccinating the high-risk general population – adults above 50 and those younger but with associated comorbidities. The government has targeted reaching these people by July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/happy-vaccine-year/story-22tZX2Daa629SHT6Q0uQKO.html
02-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Dry run today to test systems||As India gears up to launch world’s largest immunisation drive, the government is conducting a dry run on Saturday to assess its ability and readiness to administer shots to hundreds of millions of people, including many in remote corners of the country. The government has already successfully conducted a two-day pilot Covid-19 vaccination drive in eight districts in four states on December 28-29, but Saturday’s dry run is more ambitious in scope, covering all state capitals, with some states also testing the process’ efficiency in districts located in difficult terrain or which are poorly connected. In the national Capital, the mock drives will be conducted at three locations – the Daryaganj primary health centre, the government-run Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, and the private Venkateshwara hospital. Twenty-five beneficiaries – all health care workers – will be present at each site and the vaccination team will demonstrate how they will be registered, how vaccines will be given, and how they will be monitored for adverse events, if any. Read more| UK reactivates emergency hospitals as coronavirus cases surgeAll the sites will have a three-room setup – one waiting room, one vaccination room, and an observation room. A team of four people – one person to check the documents, one to check the registration of the beneficiaries, one to monitor the person, and one to control the crowd — will be present. The teams will have a vaccine carrier (cold box) that will be used to transport vaccines at the temperature they are meant to be stored from the cold chain points to the vaccination sites. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan also conducted a review meeting on the dry run with the Delhi authorities. “The objective of this dry run is to prepare everyone for the huge immunisation drive. There should be good communication between the medical teams and the district administration for smoothly conducting vaccination. This will also let us know whether the registered beneficiaries are getting messages to reach the booth and whether they are getting an e-certificate afterwards. This will also clear up the divisions of lists of beneficieries and any doubts regarding the CoWIN platform,” he said. “Maharashtra and Kerala are likely to schedule the dry run in major cities other than their Capital. The objective of the dry run for Covid-19 vaccine introduction is to assess operational feasibility in the use of Co-WIN application in field environment, to test the linkages between planning and implementation and to identify the challenges and guide way forward prior to actual implementation. This is also expected to give confidence to programme managers at various levels,” the Union health ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday.Read more| ‘2020 is gone, Covid-19 hasn’t’: A warning bell in Delhi CM’s New Year messageCo-WIN refers to the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network, which will help both health authorities as well as the public play their respective roles in the immunisation drive. Saturday’s dry run will involve 25 health workers eligible to receive the vaccine who will be the test beneficiaries. The states will prepare the vaccination sites, upload details of the beneficiaries on Co-WIN, and basically do everything they will do during the actual vaccination. As detailed in Thursday’s statement, the dry run will also give states an opportunity to check sites for space, electricity and connectivity, logistics etc. It will also help them figure out aspects of vaccine supply, storage and logistics including cold chain management. States have already been training vaccine administrators and preparing details of the beneficiaries. Around 150,000 vaccinators have been trained so far, covering over 700 districts. States are also augmenting the helpline 104 (which shall be used in addition to 1075) for any vaccine or software related query. The focus of the dry run will be on management of any possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). In addition, states will also emphasise adherence and management of infection control practices at the session site, to prevent disease transmission.The mock drill will also include concurrent monitoring and review at the block and district levels, and preparation of feedback. “A detailed plan with specific dos and don’ts has been shared with States. The dry run is to look at any gaps that may be seen on ground while executing the plan. It is meant to mobilize all aspects except for the vaccine,” said a senior health ministry official who asked not to be identified. The first round of the dry run was conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Punjab in two districts each. “No major issues were observed in the operational aspects during this dry run. All States expressed confidence in the operational guidelines and IT platform for large scale programme implementation,” the ministry’s statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dry-run-today-to-test-systems/story-6MftdbYWuplPt3ECbc36jK.html

He said the temple would be built using a special combination of stone and copper to keep it intact for a long time. With this method, the cost of construction would increase manifold. Therefore, a target had been set to collect funds by approaching 11 crore people. More than four lakh VHP workers would be engaged in the task of collecting money. He said that stones from Mirzapur were likely to be used in the temple foundation, as they were strong. Rai said on Thursday, Karsevakpuram was cleaned for storing the stones which would reach Ayodhya from Mirzapur soon. Coding on around 70 per cent stones, which had been shaped for temple construction in Ram Janmabhoomi Karyashala had already been done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-construction-to-start-on-jan-14-says-trust-official/story-2WtF1wVM76v4llRNi35lgK.html
02-01-2021||India||1 more Telangana Congress MLA to defect to BJP, party strength plunges to 5||In yet another jolt to the already beleaguered Congress in Telangana, party lawmaker from Nalgonda district Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy on Friday announced that he would quit the Congress and join the Bharatiya Janata Party soon. Rajagopal Reddy, who represents the Munugode assembly constituency, told reporters in Tirumala, after having a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara that the BJP was the only alternative to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, as the Congress party had failed to put up a strong fight. He said that he had predicted long ago about the growth of the BJP as a strong force in Telangana. “I stand by my statement and the recent results of the by-elections to the Dubbak assembly seat and the elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) proved it,” he said. Claiming that the BJP would get further strengthened in Telangana in the coming days, Rajagopal Reddy said he might join the BJP shortly keeping in mind the interest of the people of his constituency. If Rajagopal Reddy defects to the BJP sooner or later, the Congress will be left with just five MLAs in the 119-member state assembly. The party had won 19 seats in the assembly elections held in December 2018, but 12 of them defected to the TRS en masse. Of the remaining seven seats, the Congress lost one more in the by-elections to Huzurnagar assembly seat held in October 2019. The seat was vacated by PCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy on his election to Lok Sabha from Nalgonda parliamentary constituency in May 2019. With this, the party lost the Leader of Opposition status in the assembly. Interestingly, Rajagopal Reddy’s elder brother Komatireddy Venkat Reddy is also an MP from Bhongir parliamentary constituency and is a front-runner for the PCC chief post, following the resignation of Uttam Kumar Reddy. “My elder brother might remain in the Congress and become the PCC chief. But I am going to join the BJP,” Rajagopal Reddy said. In fact, soon after the last Lok Sabha elections, Rajagopal Reddy showered praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “People of India have given mandate in favour of Modi for the second time, showing their confidence in his decision-making. The BJP has the strength to take some revolutionary decisions, as they have strong leadership. I highly doubt how much Congress can fight against Modi,” he said then. The Telangana Congress party has strongly condemned Rajagopal Reddy’s statement that he would join the BJP shortly. “It is not correct on his part to desert the party when it is in crisis. As a responsible MLA of the party, it is his duty to stand by the party and strengthen it,” PCC vice-president Mallu Ravi said. Stating that the Congress was the only party that had been fighting on the issues concerning common people, Ravi said Rajagopal Reddy, who had won the assembly elections on Congress ticket, owned the moral responsibility to work for the defeat of the TRS and the BJP. He expressed confidence that the Congress would bounce back into power both at the Centre and the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-more-telangana-congress-mla-moves-to-bjp-party-strength-plunges-to-5/story-Q0TsPnmXaYsVeZGCIBUvVK.html

Referring to the violence witnessed during elections in the past, Dhankhar, while visiting Purulia district on Friday, said, “There is a general perception that elections in Bengal are marked by bloodshed. People are afraid that violence may mar the coming polls. I will do everything in my power to ensure that the elections are peaceful and fair. Democracy must be protected.” Dhankhar, against whom the TMC has moved President Ramnath Kovind, seeking his removal, visited the Sainik School in Purulia and also attended other programmes. “The governor feels compelled to make some comment every day. He needs sleeping pills. He forgets the fact that it is the election commission that conducts elections, not the governor. He speaks like a spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” said education minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee. On New Year eve, Dhankhar wished the people of Bengal. He made a similar remark in a statement issued by the Raj Bhawan. “Pray West Bengal exemplify its enormously rich culture, its essence and intrinsic spinal strength to secure 2021 elections shun of violence with “political neutral” stance of police and administration….,” the statement said. The TMC has demanded Dhankhar’s recall for “transgressing constitutional limits.” A team of TMC MPs wrote a letter to the President on Tuesday, listing “all such transgressions” by Dhankhar in recent times and urged him to take action as per Article 156, Clause 1 of the Constitution. “The governor holds office during the pleasure of the President as per Article 156, Clause 1. We have urged the President to withdraw the pleasure, which translates into removing this governor,” Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said in Kolkata.

02-01-2021||India||60,000 babies born in India on New Year’s Day this year, 7K less than previous year: Unicef||With the birth of nearly 60,000 babies, India will see the highest number of births on New Year’s Day 2021 across the globe. However, it is 7,390 less than the number of births on the first day of 2020. This will be followed by China with half as many births – 35,615 – on January 1 this year, as estimated by the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef). The Unicef estimates that 371,504 babies will be born across the world on this day. Of these, 52% of the births will take place in just 10 countries. This year, 140 million children are likely to be born across the globe with an average life expectancy of 84 years. Also Read: Pregnant women, infants more prone to severe risks of Sars-CoV-2-infection“The children born today enter a world far different than even a year ago, and a New Year brings a new opportunity to reimagine it. Today, as the world faces a global pandemic, economic slowdown, rising poverty and deepening inequality, the need for Unicef’s work is as great as ever,” said Unicef Executive Director Henrietta Fore. This year will mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation. Just as a comparison, the number of children estimated to be born this year is almost 78 times the number of people who have died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the globe so far. In India, the life expectancy of the babies born in 2021 will be 80.9 years, which is three years less than the global average. However, an additional 1,000 babies survive each day in India due to interventions by the government such as establishing Special Newborn Care Units (SNCU). A million newborns with special needs survive each year because of the 320 district level SNCUs set up by the government between 2014 and 2020. “Anticipating and addressing the potential impact of the pandemic is crucial if we are to prevent a rollback of gains made in saving the lives of children. As we do so, we must also think long-term, to build back a better world when the crisis finally recedes. The pandemic has shown us the need for systems and policies to be in place to protect people all the time, not just in the event of a crisis. Under its Reimagine campaign, Unicef appeals to governments, private sector entities, donors and all partners to join hands and lay the groundwork for building back better, to assure every child’s right to survive and thrive is protected and promoted at all times,” said Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, Unicef India Country Representative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-000-babies-born-in-india-on-new-year-s-day-this-year-7k-less-than-previous-year-unicef/story-MyQeUBl5f48xcamUWt6MwJ.html
