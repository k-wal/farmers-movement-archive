28-01-2021||Delhi||Farmer leaders to be charged for sedition; UAPA invoked by police||Delhi police on Thursday said they were probing a “larger conspiracy and criminal design” behind the violent tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day and that this would be done under stringent sections of sedition and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. This is in addition to investigations into the violence itself.In a statement on Thursday evening, Delhi police said their preliminary assessment suggests “there was a pre-conceived and well-coordinated plan” to break the terms of the agreement reached between police and farmer unions on the basis of which the latter were allowed to go ahead with the rally.Police said the protesters planned to “create an international embarrassment for the government on Republic Day.” The case is being investigated by the special cell, the police’s anti-terror unit. On January 14 , the cell filed a case against unknown persons for trying to fuel tension in the farmers protest at three border points in the national Capital. The case was registered on the basis of intelligence inputs that some terror organisations were trying to foment trouble. Prominent farm group leaders will be investigated in this case, and also for their role in the larger conspiracy the police said.Police will probe prominent leaders of the protest and their communication with other organisers since the farm laws were passed in September. Police will also check the source of funds for the protests. Police have already identified at least 300 handles from Pakistan, that were trying to mobilise protesters at the borders with the hashtag -- Support Khalistan. Investigating officials on Thursday collected videos of the alleged provocative speeches by farmer leaders at the protest sites.Meanwhile, starting their investigation into the incidents of violence on Republic Day, other units of Delhi police on Thursday issued notices to at least 20 leaders of farm groups or unions, asking them for names of those within their groups who had indulged in violence on Tuesday. These notices were also pasted at the protest sites. Separately, police also issued look-out circulars against 44 leaders to ensure that they do not flee the country during the investigation. Those against whom such notices have been issued include Satnam Singh Pannu, Buta Singh Burjgil, Darshan Pal Singh, and Rakesh Tikait. Until Thursday night, police had arrested 52 persons for the incidents of violence.Tikait has denied allegations that he provoked the protesters. HT contacted the other leaders but they did not respond despite repeated calls and text messages.A senior Delhi Police officer who did not wish to be named said that of the 33 FIRs related to the violence during the tractor rally, 9 cases have been transferred to the crime branch – a specialized investigation unit that does not engage itself in routine law and order duties.The 9 FIRs include the ones registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and ITO. The criminal case registered --- for the acts of violence within the Red Fort complex, hoisting of farm union and religious flags and attacks on police personnel --- is the one in which actor Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana will be investigated . Police said these two were among those allegedly leading the protesters at Red Fort who desecrated Red Fort.Police teams have started collecting dump data of cell phones that were in Red Fort area when violence was at its peak. “We will identify the individuals involved in the violence there. We will analyse their call records. We also have footage from multiple CCTV cameras,” a second officer, who did not wish to be named said.The officer added that until Tuesday morning the WhatsApp groups of the farmers were active and had discussed the siege of Red Fort on their groups. “Some protesters on horses and swords had led the violence at Red Fort. This was a well-planned move to ensure that they were not stopped by police. We have many of them on tape swinging their swords at the police,” the second officer added.The police officer mentioned above said, “So far this case has sections of rioting, attempt to murder, attempt to (commit) culpable homicide and criminal conspiracy. It was not a spontaneous move to storm the Red Fort on Republic Day. It was a conspiracy and a planned one. The special cell is separately investigating the role of farmer leaders and people such as Deep Sidhu. He will be probed by both units — one for violence at Red Fort and second of the larger conspiracy to start violence and embarrass the government.”Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava on Wednesday named four farmer leader SS Pannu, Darshan Pal, Buta Singh Burjgil and Rakesh Tikait - for either giving provocative statements or veering from the prescribed routes for the rally, leading to the violence. At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers sustained injuries during the clashes. One farmer died in the protests after his tractor overturned after ramming into a police barricade at ITOTikait a member of the Samyukth Kisan Morcha — a union of at least 40 farmer unions — denied allegations that they indulged in violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmer-leaders-to-be-charged-for-sedition-uapa-invoked-by-police-101611856547513.html

The teen was kidnapped over unpaid work bills worth ₹14 lakh, police said. The arrested men have been identified as Akash Sugriv Ghodeswar (29), and Rahul Balu Ghorpade (22), both residents of Lakshminagar in Yerawada. The contractor Jaysingh Rathod is a resident of Gadital, Hadapsar, according to officials of the crime branch. The kidnapped man was identified as Dheeraj Rajshekhar Hiremath (18), a resident of Wadgaon Dhayari, while the complainant was identified as Saikumar Shivmurti Javalkotti (51), a resident of Sinhagad road, according to the police. “Jaysingh Rathod, who is a contractor, had done work for the builder. The builder owed him ₹14 lakh. Rathod tried to utilise some middlemen, but when it did not work out, he hatched this plan and kidnapped the office boy. The anti-extortion cell team tracked and arrested them,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune. Hiremath was kidnapped from the Warje-based office of the builder on Wednesday afternoon. Post his kidnapping, the captors started using multiple phone numbers to contact the builder and demanded ₹two lakh in exchange for Hiremath’s return. However, the teenager escaped from confinement after the kidnappers started drinking alcohol, according to officials of the crime branch. “They had plans of kidnapping other people around the builder to coax the entire amount from him. Two people are still on the run in the case,” said an official close to the investigation. The arrest was made by anti-extortion team led by senior police inspector Balaji Pandhre and police sub- inspector (PSI) Vijay Zanjaad. PSI SA Gaikwad is investigating the matter further. A case under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 385 (extortion) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at the Warje Malwadi police station against at least five people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-held-in-pune-for-kidnapping-18yearold-101611856451830.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||986 doses of vaccines wasted so far in Gurugram||At least 986 doses of the two Covid-19 vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, have been wasted in the vaccination drives held till now in the district, according to the district health department data, with officials citing hesitancy among front-line healthcare workers as the main reason.As per the data, of the 18,633 of the 19,340 doses of Covishield provided to various vaccination sites since January 16 have been used, with the remaining 707 doses being wasted. A single vial of Covishield contains 10 doses, which has led to wastage of at least 71 vials, said officials.A vial has to be consumed within four hours of being opened, after which it is considered to be wasted.Similarly, for Covaxin, 921 of the 1,200 doses were used, with at least 279 doses, equivalent to almost 14 vials, being wasted. Unlike Covishield, a vial of Covaxin consists of 20 doses, which, according to the district immunisation officer, has led to increased wastage.“Going by the acceptable vaccine wastage level set by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, vaccine wastage is being calculated on the basis of wastage multiplication factor (WMF),” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.He said, “Based on a series of calculations, WMF has to be 1.1 as per the set standard. In the case of Covishield, WMF stands at 1, while for Covaxin it is almost 1.3.”Officials said that the wastage could increase if the turnout continues to remain low at vaccination sites, especially at smaller sites. Opening a multi-dose vial at these sites can balloon the vaccine wastage, they said.On Thursday, of the 1,600 healthcare workers listed for vaccination, around 970 turned up to take the shot. The health department is expecting a decrease in daily coverage after inoculating more than 55% of the registered front-line healthcare staff, as they had allowed walk-ins as well as workers to take the shot at their nearest centre.Of the 37,000 registered staff, almost 21,000 have come forward to take the jab, highlighting the existing apprehension regarding the Covid vaccines.“Currently, the vaccine wastage is under control in the district. It varies greatly from vaccination sites to the type of vaccine. Currently, the vaccination coverage has been limited since more than 55% of healthcare workers have taken the jab. There are chances footfall will remain low due to reluctance and duplicity in names. In such a situation, vials will remain unutilised in session sites of small sizes, which will ultimately lead to vaccine wastage,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.A week before the vaccination, the Union ministry of health and family welfare, in its guidelines, stated that at least 10% of the Covid-19 vaccines procured by the Centre may be wasted in different phases of vaccine management. Assuming a wastage of 10%, the guidelines stated that acceptable wastage, in WMF terms, is 1.1, exceeding which may be a cause for concern.According to Yadav, vaccine wastage can be minimised once the state health department on Friday allows the inoculation of other front-line workers from Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), revenue department and police department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/986-doses-of-vaccines-wasted-so-far-in-gurugram-101611855375875.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||NHAI hopeful of completing Sirhaul U-turn underpass by March, work on shifting toll gates to start||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Thursday said that the work on shifting the three toll collection lanes from Sirhaul toll plaza will commence from Monday and it will be completed within 10 days. NHAI officials said that with the removal of this obstacle, the authority will be able to complete the underpass at Sirhaul plaza by March 15. The NHAI had got the nod for shifting of three toll gates from South Delhi Municipal Corporation at the start of the month, but the work was delayed due to the security measures taken by the police for Republic Day, said officials. Gaurav Mittal, senior manager, NHAI, said that 90% of the work on the underpass project is completed and from Monday, they will start work on shifting the lanes. “We have already sent a letter to the traffic police regarding carving out traffic diversions so that the work can be carried out. The shifting work can be completed in 10 days and our plan is to open the underpass for traffic from March 15,” said Mittal. There are nine toll gates operational at the border, of which gates numbered 4, 5 and 6 will be shifted further towards Delhi and operated from there, said NHAI officials. They added that the traffic diversions at the toll gate have been designed in such a manner that there would be no congestion. The gates need to be shifted as the work on these would be affected when the authority starts building box-type structure for the underpass, officials said. The underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza will help motorists from Gurugram avoid taking a long detour — till Rajokri in New Delhi to take a U-turn — to reach the Ambience Mall.The flyover at Shankar Chowk, which is part of this project, has already been completed and is operational. The entire project is being constructed by the NHAI at a cost of ₹63 crore and the objective is to reduce congestion between Sirhaul, Shankar Chowk and Iffco Chowk on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. The NHAI has already got approvals for its estimate of ₹46 lakh for shifting the toll gates. The delay in this work had hampered the completion of the underpass project by almost one year, said officials, but they are hopeful to complete it by March. The work on building the underpass and the Shankar Chowk flyover had commenced in March 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nhai-hopeful-of-completing-sirhaul-u-turn-underpass-by-march-work-on-shifting-toll-gates-to-start-101611855375178.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||Feedback sought on plans to resume classroom sessions for classes 6-8||The department of school education has directed district education officers across the state to gather feedback about the current situation of schools with regard to Covid-19, amid plans to resume classroom sessions for students of classes 6 to 8. As per a directive shared with district education officers on Wednesday, the government is contemplating to reopen schools for students of classes 6-8 in February. It further said that the department had issued standard operating procedures (SOPs), directions and allocated budget with regard to the physical reopening of schools from time to time, and an assessment of the same is being done. Last week, state education minister Kanwar Pal had said that the government is planning to reopen schools for classes 6 to 8 from the first week of February, in view of the decline in Covid-19 cases. Deputy district education officer Saroj Dahiya said that the department is looking at the possibility of reopening schools for students in classes 6 to 8 from February 1 and feedback is being sought for the same. “Schools will open for classes 6 to 8 from February 1. A meeting was conducted on Thursday to discuss the modalities,” said Dahiya. Schools across the country were closed in March last year due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Voluntary visits to schools for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. In mid-November, the Haryana government decided to shut schools till November 30, over concerns of a spike in Covid-19 cases among students. Government and private schools reopened on December 14 for students of classes 10 and 12 and on December 21 for classes 9 and 11. An online form has been circulated among schools for sharing feedback. “We have been asked to share feedback through an online form. We are expecting schools to reopen soon and will have to take measures to ensure physical distancing,” said Sudesh Raghav, the principal of a government school.Shyam Raghav, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the department had sought feedback about various Covid-19 related requirements on the school campus. “We have been asked to share data about thermal scanners, sanitisers and other such facilities that are necessary,” said Raghav.Private schools said that they are yet to receive any written directive pertaining to reopening of schools. Aparna Erry, principal of the DAV Public School in Sector 14, said that the school had started calling students in classes 9 to 12 and would wait for the government to issue guidelines for classes 6 to 8. “We are yet to receive any form seeking feedback in this regard. As always, we will seek feedback from parents before calling students to school. For now, online classes are continuing,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/feedback-sought-on-plans-to-resume-classroom-sessions-for-classes-68-101611855374460.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||Mercury dips slightly but city may escape cold wave||The city experienced a perceptible nip in the air on Thursday, due a slight dip in the minimum and maximum temperatures. However, officials said that the city may escape the cold wave conditions, which is currently being recorded in other parts of Delhi-NCR.Gurugram recorded a minimum temperature of 6.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday, down from 6.6 degrees Celsius the previous day. The maximum temperature stood at 18.6 degrees Celsius, which was lower than the 20.3 degrees Celsius recorded a day prior.The city remained relatively warmer than neighbouring Delhi, where cold day conditions, which occur when the minimum temperature dips below 4 degrees Celsius, were observed in some parts. The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Safdarjung observatory, for instance, recorded a minimum temperature of 3.8 degrees Celsius on Thursday and a maximum of 19.4 degrees Celsius.As per IMD’s forecast for the next week, cold wave conditions will continue to be felt in isolated pockets across Delhi-NCR until January 31, with moderate to dense fog during early morning hours as a result. “We have issued an orange alert for cold wave over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan until January 30. This includes Delhi and Chandigarh. Friday onward, we will downgrade it to a yellow alert if the temperature does not fall sharply across the region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi.Gurugram, however, may escape the cold wave, with official forecast for the city predicting a minimum temperature of not less than 5 degrees Celsius till January 30. The minimum temperature is expected to start rising from January 31 and settle around 8 degrees Celsius by February 3. The maximum temperature, meanwhile, is expected to remain at 19 degrees Celsius until January 31 and will rise to 23 degrees Celsius by February 3.This forecast is in contrast with that of Delhi’s, where cold wave conditions (with minimum temperature as low as 3 degrees Celsius) are expected in some areas. “Dry, cold winds have been sweeping across north India and their chilling effect will be felt for at least another three to four days. It’s hard to say which parts will be affected, but the cold wave will happen in small pockets and not uniformly across north India,” said Srivastava.Air quality in the city remained in the very poor category of the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin, with an index value of 334 on Thursday. “This may be due to the fall in the temperature as well as slower wind speeds during the day. There won’t be much of a change in the situation until February, when warmer conditions will help with faster dispersal of pollutants,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality will remain largely very poor for the subsequent five days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mercury-dips-slightly-but-city-may-escape-cold-wave-101611855373915.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid vaccinations on hold for three days for polio immunisations||The Covid-19 vaccination drive will be put on hold from January 31 till February 2 because of a pulse polio drive, health department officials said. There will be no vaccination in public or private set-ups as the entire government healthcare staff will be deployed for the polio vaccination drive, at booths across the city as well as for home visits.In a district-level task force meeting on vaccination held on Thursday with the additional deputy commissioner, Prashant Panwar, the health department along with other departments were directed to achieve a target of inoculating over 359,648 children below the age of five years in three days.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “At least 1,266 polio booths will be set up across the city on January 31 to administer bivalent oral polio virus vaccine. Thereafter, on February 1 and 2, home visits will be conducted to attain the maximum coverage. In wake of the polio drive, the Covid-19 vaccination has been put on hold for three days.”In the polio drive held in 2020, the health department had to restrict its coverage due to the high volume of Covid-19 cases in the district. The health staff had to be deployed for contact tracing and home visits of isolated patients. As Covid-19 cases have sharply fallen, the department has planned to deploy all its employees for the polio drive.“More than 5,000 health workers will be part of the inoculation drive. At least 112 mobile teams and 29 transit teams have been formed. About 240 supervisors have also been designated duties to handle booths,” said Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer.As directed by Panwar, teams will focus on areas near construction sites for the inoculation. In a statement issued by the administration, Panwar has asked for the preparation of a micro plan, taking assistance of other departments concerned, including labour, women and child development, education and district development as well as the panchayat office, to cover children in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid-vaccinations-on-hold-for-three-days-for-polio-immunisations-101611855373384.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||56-year-old farmer dies due to health issues on way from interstate border protest site||A 56-year-old farmer from Maharashtra who had been protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera on the Haryana-Rajasthan border died due to cold on Wednesday evening while she was returning to her home town, protest leaders said. However, health officials could not confirm the same.A statement issued by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha identified the deceased as Sitabai Tadvi, a resident of Ambabari village in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra. Tadvi died near Jaipur while she was on her way back. Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that Tadvi left the protest site to return to her village on Wednesday. “She was ill due to the cold weather and had a fever. She died on her way to Jaipur while she was being taken to her village in Maharashtra. We were told that she could not tolerate the cold,” said Madhav. He said that Tadvi had also participated in the tractor march on Republic Day and contributed to the protest movement in various capacities.Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. During the course of the agitation, many farmers have died at various protest sites on account of cold weather conditions. According to the statement issued by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, Tadvi had been involved in farm agitations over the past 25 years. “She was at the forefront of various campaigns. Be it her involvement in the fight against farmer debt or the demand for MSP guarantee. She was fighting against the three laws and managing the protest site at Shahjahanpur since January 16 till January 27,” said the statement. Madhav said that Tadvi came from a tribal family and her contributions to various farmer agitations, including the movement against the three laws, would be remembered. He said that protesting farmers had observed two-minute silence to recognise on Thursday to remember her contributions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/56yearold-farmer-dies-due-to-health-issues-on-way-from-interstate-border-protest-site-101611855372871.html

The police said that now, commuters can head straight to Shahjahanpur and take a left before the flyover. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent, Bawal, said, “Commuters can take left before the flyover towards Jaisinghpur Khera, via Mohanpur, which connects to the NH-48. Another route is through Khandora village, which is also a three-kilometre detour. All the blockades have been removed and commuters can drive straight towards Delhi, except at Shahjhanapur, where farmers are camping.” The police said that many farmers, who were camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera, besides Shahjahanpur, returned to their villages on Thursday. On December 14, 2020, over 500 farmers from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana and members of trade unions had blocked the Delhi-Jaipur highway at the Shahjahanpur interstate border in Rajasthan, as the police did not let them enter Haryana. Prashant Dhillon, a resident of Delhi, who returned from Jaipur on Thursday, said that the alternative routes were difficult to drive on as the routes passed through remote villages that were not suited for heavy traffic. “The policemen at the outskirts of Jaipur informed us that the route is clear and we can go straight on NH-48. It saved at least one and a half hours. The protesters should be allowed to occupy vacant spaces instead of service lanes of the expressway, which results in congestion and confusion among the commuters,” he said. Another commuter, Dilkhush Juneja, an art businessman travelling from Kotputli to Manesar, said they have suffered huge losses due to the protest. “We had to pay extra to send consignments through the transporters and our clients had stopped visiting us due to the long route and congestion on the stretch,” he said.The police said they have deployed personnel along the routes to inform commuters about the current situation. Eateries located on the expressway, close to protest sites, also resumed operations on Thursday, with many claiming they suffered huge losses due to the blockades.Naresh Yadav, who runs an eatery near the Shahjahanpur petrol pump, said, “The farmers had set up their own kitchen and were on their own. No one even bought a cup of tea from us. The main source of income was through commuters, who were not allowed to use the stretch, leading to a financial crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/commute-from-jaipur-to-delhi-gets-easier-as-protesters-thin-out-101611855372226.html
28-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP razes five colonies in Farrukhnagar||Acting on a complaint of illegal colony construction in Farrukhnagar, the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) on Thursday carried out demolition of five colonies in three villages of Farrukhnagar. DTCP officials said that warehouses, residential houses and other structures were being constructed without requisite permissions. Officials said that in the last 15 days, they have resolved around 40 such complaints filed with the CM Window. The enforcement team of the DTCP started razing the structures around 11am, deploying three earthmoving machines. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that they demolished two under-construction warehouses, five under-construction houses and 50 plinths over 20 acres in Dhanawas, Patli and Hajipur. “Boundary walls and road network developed on this land was also demolished and the locals were told that construction without permission would not be tolerated. A large police team from Gurugram police supported us in this action,” said Bhath. The department, meanwhile, said that apart from demolition drives, they are laying a special emphasis on resolving complaints filed at the CM Window. “We have resolved around 40 complaints pertaining to encroachments, illegal constructions, colony construction, excess construction and building plan violations lodged by city residents. These are being handled area wise,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, Gurugram. Sharma said that a number of illegal guest houses have also been sealed upon complaints from residents. “We are also taking action against owners who violate building plans,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-razes-five-colonies-in-farrukhnagar-101611855371684.html
28-01-2021||Other||Protesters’ strength dwindles as most return home||Farmers from different states camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera returned to their base camp at Shahjahanpur on Thursday, a day after local villagers asked them to vacate the sites following the violence in Delhi.However, a majority of the farmers who have been protesting at Shahjahanpur also left for their villages, said police. Of the 1,000 protesters, hardly 100 remained at the camp at the Haryana-Rajasthan border on Thursday.Sitting on the main carriageway, farmer leaders were addressing the gathering, stating that they would not be moving from this site. They also mentioned that more farmers have been called to join them from villages across Rajasthan and Haryana.A group of farmers was seen reciting poems, sharing jokes and sharing their life experiences to keep the remaining protesters engaged, before the lunchtime.Kamaljeet Singh, a farmer from Ganganagar in Rajasthan, said that they would not vacate the site and ensure that more farmers join them by Sunday. “Rajasthan villagers are supporting us and came to meet us on Thursday morning. They have extended their support and have assured us that they will take care of our food and dry ration and will send freshly cooked food, if required,” he said.Rewari police said that they have reduced the police deployment at the Rajasthan-Haryana border from 1,500 personnel to 600, including eight companies of paramilitary forces.Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said, “We reduced deployment of forces at night after the majority of farmers left the Shahjahanpur border. During the day, we have deployed nearly 600 personnel from police and paramilitary forces and at night, only 150 personnel from all forces.”He, however, added that it is likely that the remaining farmers would vacate the site soon.Kumar said the villagers had met the protesters on Thursday and wanted to meet their leaders, who have been missing from the sites and have not returned to base camps after January 26 tractor parade, when they had gone till Manesar.Two leaders, who were not at the site, confirmed that they had returned to their villages to discuss the plans after the rally in Delhi turned violent and clashes broke out between the police and protesters.Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said they are embarrassed by the Delhi incident and have returned to their village to plan another strategy, as villagers pulled their support and asked them to vacate the sites. “There is lot of pressure on us and after Delhi violence, we are planning to do a silent and hunger protest. We have not run from the sites, but will return after two days after discussing with our counterparts. Many farmers have denied to support us,” he said.Since December 14 of 2020, protesters had occupied both sides of the carriageways and had set up tents on the service lanes, blocking the National Highway-48.On Wednesday, panchayats of 20 villages in Rewari had held a meeting and decided to give an ultimatum to the farmers protesting at Masani since January 1, asking them to vacate by Thursday or be forcefully thrown out by residents.Capt (retd) Lala Ram, sarpanch of Masani village, said that residents of Rajasthan villages have approached them for their support and soon, they would ask the protesters to vacate the Shahjahanpur border as well. “The protesters have vacated the area in Masani but they did not even clean the area before leaving. We have called people from other areas and sweepers to clean the stretch so that commuters can stop at the eateries. They have damaged our crops and fields by using the area for open defecation,” he said.Ram said a team went to check if any tents or belongings remained, but there was none and that they have vacated without even thanking them for their support.The police said that the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat have returned to their states and protesters camping at the site are from Rajasthan and Haryana only. The violence that prevailed in other parts of the National Capital Region during the tractor parade on Republic Day resulted in villagers giving an ultimatum to protesters to vacate the camp sites.Nehra said that a hunger strike is being planned to put pressure on the government. “We are discussing with our counterparts and the final decision will be taken on Friday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/protesters-strength-dwindles-as-most-return-home-101611855311654.html

Hazare, on Thursday, reiterated his intent to go ahead with an indefinite fast at his hometown Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar district, to press demands for implementation of the Swaminathan commission recommendations regarding agriculture pricing, statutory status and autonomy for the central agriculture price commission. Earlier in the day, BJP leader Girish Mahajan held talks with Hazare at Ralegan Siddhi. Last week, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also met Hazare though the activist remained unfazed. In a press statement on Thursday, Hazare said, “I will sit for the fast at Ralegan’s Yadavbaba temple. Those who want to extend support to agitation can do it from their respective locations. In view of the Covid pandemic, I urge everyone not to crowd at Ralegan Siddhi.” While the release is silent on the new farm laws, the crusader had earlier said the new farm laws do not conform to “democratic values” and people’s participation is necessary in the drafting of legislations. Hazare has also urged supporters to protest at their respective locations.

Our company moved into this new phase in February 2020 and have been in touch with the MIDC officials since then to help remove the garbage,” said Simona Jadronova, vice-director, IntorQ India Pvt Ltd.“We also approached officials to undertake an initiative to pick up the garbage and take it to the dumping station, but we were told that we need permissions and that there is already a collector for the same,” she added.Juergen Morhard, Germany’s Consul General to India, said, “The companies approached me with their concern and in a recent meeting with the MIDC officials, requested them to resolve the matter. I am confident that they will resolve the matter soon.”Atul Dhore, executive engineer, MIDC Chakan phase 3, said, “We have received complaints from the Germany companies and the consul general pointed out the garbage woes in the area.”“Our workers clean the roads daily, but the residents and hotel owners in the area throw garbage during the night time. We cannot monitor the area during the night time due to shortage of staff and it is difficult to track the culprits. We have written to the Mhalunge police station for help,” he said.“We also intend to write to the gram panchayat of Kharabwadi as they also must maintain the cleanliness of the area,” he added.Dhore added that MIDC is also in the process to float tenders for a non-hazardous solid waste plant, which will help sort out the issue of garbage menace..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-garbage-piles-up-on-roadside-at-chakan-phase-3-german-companies-approach-midc-officials-101611852731517.html

Proposed tunnels will rupture them and plug the recharge area that is contributing the water to the aquifer,” he said.“It will cause felling of thousands of trees and destruction of natural aquifers in the hills which sustain the trees,” said, Usha Rangarajan, a resident of Panchavati.The Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti has also opposed the project which they feel will do irreversible damage and is unnecessary.“The proposed project is against the objectives of the National Urban Transport Policy 2014, the Maharashtra State Urban Transport Policy 2017 and the comprehensive mobility plan of PMC which is also part of Pune’s development plan. Under the policy guidelines, it is incumbent on the government to focus on providing public transport and dissuading the use of private vehicles,” said Sushma Date, member of Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti.“The metro work is already underway in the city. The idea of the metro is to shift people from private modes of transport to the public mode. For a decade PMC fought all odds to bring success to the metro project and the routes that are approved and under construction will ease the traffic problems of the Law College road and Karve road once the metro begins. Therefore the tunnel and the irreversible damage that it will do to hills is unnecessary at this juncture,” she said.Indrabhan Randive, executive engineer, project department of PMC, said, “We already had discussions earlier with residents before we got the NOC. incase they have more to say, then we will hear their side too.”This tunnel, approved in principle by the Maharashtra State government in Pune’s development plan 2007-2027, will go through the Vetal hills complex to connect three sections of Pune - Kothrud, Gokhalenagar and Panchavati. At the Panchavati and Gokhalenagar exits, construction will require excavation of a large section of reserved forest while at the Kothrud exit, deemed forest section will be affected.In letters dated December 17, 2018, and September 9, 2020, the DCF, Bhamburda has permitted PMC to survey the forest area through the use of total station machine only. The NOC dated September 9, 2020, explicitly prohibits the use of drone cameras and bore machinery and has stringent conditions to not harm any branches/trees and undergrowth - in effect, to respect the forest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/residents-oppose-underground-tunnel-connecting-panchavati-to-kothrud-gokhalenagar-101611852671435.html

The players were picked after the conclusion of selection meet at Sant Dnyaneshwar sports complex, Indrayaninagar, Bhosari. With Baburao Sanas grounds turned into a Covid care centre, athletes used to practice at Taljai hills, Waghjai and even Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex, Balewadi. Later, Maharashtriya Mandal, Gultekdi allowed athletes from various clubs in Pune to train at their grounds. “Training schedule was not easy for Pune athletes as grounds were not available. We used to daily choose the venue for practice at night and inform athletes about it,” said Arvind Chavan, coach of Pune Athletics Club whose three athletes – Rajula Bhosale (u14; 60m), Abhar Datta (u18; high jump) and Akash Jadhav (u18 triple jump) have been selected for the nationals. Sudhakar Memane, coach of city’s sprint queen Avantika Narale, took a group of athletes by train to Dervan, Ratnagiri to help them practice on synthetic track available at the venue. “We conducted a few camps at Dervan between August and October as training on synthetic track was important. Avantika is practicing well and we hope for good performance in the upcoming nationals,” said Memane. Avantika seems satisfied with the training routine at different grounds. “Practicing on a mud track and later a synthetic track helped me to gain momentum in my running. I am targeting 11. 7 seconds finish in 100 metre,” said Avantika who’s best is 11.97 seconds. Athletics Federation of India has introduced a 60m running event for juniors till under-16 age group, instead of standard 100m. Rujula Bhonsle ran the distance in 7.78 seconds to get selected for the nationals. “One has to run top speed during the entire stretch of 60metres. It is a good event which will help me to shape up in a better way for 100 metre,” said Rujula. For Shital Bhagat, switching from cross country running to 800 metre two years back did not made much difference before the lockdown hit her practice regimen. “Not running everyday makes a difference. The long gap of no practice affected my timing,” said Shital, whose personal best is 2.21 seconds. Siddhesh Choudhari dreams to achieve the record of Kevin Young, the United States athlete, a 1992 Barcelona Olympic gold medallist with timings of 46.78 seconds in 400 metre hurdles. He follows the videos of his idol. “My personal best is 54.88 seconds and I have started taking part in the event two years back. I need to practice more to reach the highest level,” said Siddhesh, who trains under Jaikumar Tembhare. Abhar Datta entered the high jump event on fitness level as he could not practice since grounds were unavailable. He was picked for the nationals with the distance of 1.90 metre. “Since my body was fit for the event it helped me deliver a good performance. Turning out for the tournament without practice was a challenge,” said Abhar.

A co-accused, who is yet to be arrested, has been identified as Suresh Bandu Kamble (32), a resident of PMC Colony, Gunj peth, Pune. “Some time back the city police had received an application from Amol Kolhe that some person personated him and demanded assistance from a reputed builder. It was being investigated by the anti-extortion cell of the crime branch. In this matter, anti-extortion team has detained one person namely Vishal Shendge, who impersonated MP Kolhe,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Crime, Pune. A case under Sections 170 (personating a public servant), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code has been registered at Wanowrie against the two men. “He called up the owner of Gera Constructions and posed as the MP and asked for money. He told the builder that the money will be used to help poor people during lockdown. Gera builder’s office staff was asked to cross-check with people in MP Kolhe’s office. After they learned that the call was from an impersonator, the MP’s office lodged a complaint,” said DCP Singh. Shendge has been booked in seven criminal cases in the past. Three of the seven cases registered against him are after he impersonated Chandrakant Patil, BJP’’s Maharashtra chief. Two of the three cases are regsitered at Kothrud, while one is registered at Alankar police station. While Kamble arranged for a SIM card with which Shendge called the realtor. The police are now investigating if any of the people that Shendge tried to cheat by impersonating politicians had paid him any money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-man-impersonating-mp-amol-kolhe-asks-builder-for-money-arrested-101611833410778.html
28-01-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Mini-publics within the Republic||The date we gave ourselves the Constitution, is an occasion to celebrate our democracy, acknowledge its challenges, and consider how we might evolve further as a Republic. The word itself refers to the ‘common good’ rather than for ‘private profit’, when referring to the realm of public decision-making. One promising development for improving democratic public decision-making is deliberative ‘mini-publics’ – temporary forums of ordinary people that help develop potential solutions on topics of concern. Deliberative mini-publics are taking place around the world for climate action, developing municipal budgets, constitutional reform processes, and even in India. They could be convened in Pune and other cities too. People can get a chance to go beyond complaints, and become problem solvers contributing to policies and programmes for the ‘common good’. ‘Mini-publics’ can operate between the ‘public’, that is the entire body of citizens, and the government, of elected corporators and officials taking final decisions. Multiple mini-publics may be convened in different localities or at city scale, on local civic and sustainability issues. The task for mini-publics is to consider information about the issue, weigh options, identify and prioritise actions. Elected and municipal officials, NGOs and other experts may provide technical knowledge, good practice examples, inform about on-going municipal initiatives and public budget availability. Universities and trusted civic groups could help facilitate the deliberation process as a neutral third party. Such innovations for participatory planning are also recommended in government of India’s Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) guidelines. Such approaches get people from different walks of life involved, bringing their varied knowledge and experience. With good facilitation, we can develop a shared and rich understanding about issues. Developing solutions together can also increase trust between stakeholders and help evolve partnerships for civic issues. Villages are doing better than cities with gramsabhas already constituted for citizens’ deliberations. Shri Mohan Hirabai Hiralal shared his experiences from Mendha-Lekha village, Gadchiroli district that is practicing such deliberative democracy for years. He said that people already have the right to decide on issues that concern their lives, resources etc; this is on the first page of our Constitution. He suggests the decision-making forum should be different from the deliberation forum; the decision-making forum should occur after the issue is thoroughly explored and options for action developed. A provision for Area Sabhas of residents exists in Maharahtra’s municipal law and awaits implementation. Another difficulty in cities is of assembling large groups. The electoral ward, the smallest unit of governance, is several thousand people. Mini-publics could help in the meantime as these can include more than residents and also address city-scale issues. Unlike the Area Sabha conceived of as a permanent institution of residents in the area, a mini-public can be an inclusive small group of about 50 people, randomly selected by lottery, for a few weeks or months. The deliberations of an operating mini-public could be communicated to the city at large though the media. A suitable ‘Civic Tech’ app, a term for software for e-governance and connecting people to government, could help in communication between the forum and the public. Mini-public deliberations must apply three principles: 1. Inclusive – of different views and people from different walks of life; 2. Deliberative – participants engage in respectful open dialogue on the range of views and information to develop recommendations and 3, Influence – formal governance processes must seriously consider and incorporate mini-public outputs in city plans and budgets. Would mini-publics succeed? We can’t be sure they will, but there are reasons for optimism: first, a focused, well-intentioned process of a deliberation on a civic issue, bringing together expert knowledge and the everyday wisdom of ordinary citizens is likely to yield some good outcomes. Second, ordinary citizens are not worried about being re-elected, so the solutions they develop may be more guided by longer-term sustainability than short-term populist options. How about convening mini-publics around Pune’s air quality, transport issues, river restoration, or climate resilience? They may help deepen and enrich our democracy.

28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Political ambition fuels Charuni’s rise as Haryana farmer leader||Gurnam Singh Charuni, 60, the face of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana and chief of the state’s Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), nurses political ambitions that has fuelled his rise during the stir. A commission agent-cum-agriculturist, Gurnam Singh belongs to Charuni Jattan village in Shahbad tehsil of Kurukshetra district. He unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly elections from Ladwa as an independent candidate. He finished a poor eighth and forfeited his security deposit, getting less than 1% of the 1.37 lakh votes polled. Charuni’s wife, Balwinder Kaur, also unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Kurukshetra constituency on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ticket. His primary area of influence is the paddy bowl of Haryana, comprising the northern districts of Ambala, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and Karnal. Charuni was nowhere in the forefront till the time firebrand Haryana BKU president Ghasi Ram Nain was leading the union. However, he gradually filled the void after Nain became too old and later passed away in 2017. Charuni shot into prominence during the 2010 Ganna Andolan when he led the farmers protests against the then Congress regime to press for an increase in state advised price (SAP) of sugarcane. He has been leading agitations against private sugar mills in Haryana who failed to pay the cane dues of the farmers. “Charuni was a little-known farm leader around 10 years ago. Ambitious and outspoken, he has been over the years able to position himself as the emerging voice of the farmers rights and issues,’’ said a Congress leader from Jind who has seen his ascendancy closely. According to his poll affidavit, Charuni has spent considerable time in jail having been convicted and sentenced by the court in three cases — for attempt to murder in 1979, voluntarily causing grievous hurt in 1982 and for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant in 2002. His sentences were reduced by the Punjab and Haryana high court in the 1979 and 1982 convictions. The BKU leader nurses political ambitions and has been on the lookout for an opportunity to jump onto the political bandwagon, his tryst with the AAP, which fielded his wife for the Lok Sabha elections, stands testimony to the fact. During the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws, the BKU leader has made headlines every now and then –the BKU activists showing black flags and blocking the cavalcade of chief minister ML Khattar at Ambala and the recent episode of disrupting Khattar’s programme to hold a kisan mahapanchayat in Kamila village in his own assembly constituency, Karnal. The ruling BJP though has tried to negotiate with him on the issue of farm laws, holding a series of parleys with him at the political and officer’s level. However, he has been unyielding, adamant that the laws be repealed. BJP leaders say Khattar also probably made a tactical mistake by blaming him after the Kaimla kisan mahapanchayat disruption episode, an accusation which Charuni gleefully lapped up. “It became chief minister versus Charuni and the latter enjoyed the leverage he got out of it,’’ said a BJP functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-ambition-fuels-charuni-s-rise-as-haryana-farmer-leader-101611832870671.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Additional police forces deployed at protest sites, farmers fear eviction||Agitating farmers on Thursday accused the government of trying to intimidate them and feared force could be used to evict them amid heavy police deployment at Singhu and Ghazipur farmer protest sites.Additional personnel from the Uttar Pradesh police and Rapid Action Force wearing anti-riot gear and carrying sticks, firearms, and tear gas have been deployed at Ghazipur since Wednesday night. Farmers said the power supply was disconnected around 8 pm on Wednesday while the water tankers for them, too, were stopped on Thursday morning.Also Read: Republic Day violence: FIRs, blame-game, infighting mar farmers’ protestThe farmers said the sudden stoppage of the power supply triggered panic at the Ghazipur protest venue, and they spent a sleepless night guarding their tractors, trollies, and tents. They added they had to switch on the headlights of their tractors and lit bonfires to keep themselves warm as nobody was able to sleep inside the tents or trollies throughout the night.“The administration is trying to intimidate us by disconnecting power and water supply at the Ghazipur protest venue. Many representatives of police and intelligence wing are here. If they have anything to tell us, if they want to evict us from here, they should come and talk to us. If the government wants to talk to us, we are ready for it. The solution can only be through dialogues and not by bullets and sticks. We will not leave the protest venue even if the police administration use force on us,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait while addressing the gathering of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/additional-police-forces-deployed-at-protest-sites-farmers-fear-eviction-101611832330413.html
28-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress slams CM’s markaz reference for Covid threat to Mahakumbh||Opposition Congress has termed Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s remark that Haridwar should not become Wuhan or Markaz as irresponsible and claimed it was meant to deflect attention from unpreparedness for Mahakumbh.Rawat on Wednesday had said he doesn’t want any such risk taken which makes Haridwar—the venue for Mahakumbh -- Wuhan or Markaz. He said it should not happen as India has done record-breaking work on the containment of Covid-19 pandemic. Markaz means centre or focal point.Rawat said this to reporters in Dehradun before leaving for a tour of Almora district.“Even in the past, there had been an epidemic during the Kumbh, in which thousands of people had died. So no such thing should happen which makes it risky,” he had said.Congress termed the CM's statement as “very irresponsible” and deliberate targeting of a particular community.Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, "By Markaz, Rawat meant Tablighi jamaat. Now, what has Tablighi jamaat got to do with the Kumbh pilgrimage. Earlier also they were targeted, but as everyone knows we have had many waves of the epidemic, which are not due to one reason or a community. Taking the name of Markaz like this sends a very wrong signal”Dhasmana added that CM's statement was very “irresponsible” and aimed at deflecting attention from the failures of the government."The government has failed to complete the preparations for the mega-congregation which will result in fewer devotees attending it. Hence, it is now preparing to cite Covid-19 as an excuse to cover up their ill-preparedness for the Mahakumbh. So far, over 1600 people have died in the state due to Covid," he said.On January 22, the Central government released standard operating procedure (SOP) on organising Mahakumbh. According to the SOP, negative Covid-19 RT-PCR report will be mandatory along with registration for all pilgrims, who wish to attend the fair, scheduled from February 27.The guidelines further state that all devotees who are desirous of attending the Kumbh Mela shall register with the government of Uttarakhand and obtain a compulsory medical certificate from the nearest community health centre/ district hospital/medical college in the state.Also Read: Government will not take any risk that will turn Haridwar into WuhanThe SOP further stressed on following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour of wearing face masks and strict adherence to six-feet social-distancing norm. The state government has been asked to keep a provision of distributing free masks and establishing contactless hand washing and sanitising stations.Around 10 lakh people are expected to attend the Mahakumbh on a regular day and about 50 lakh on auspicious days.There are six auspicious days: Magh Purnima (27th February 2021), Mahashivratri (11th March 2021), Somvati Amavasya (12th April 2021), Baisakhi (14th April 2021), Ram Navmi (21st April 2021), and Chaitra Purnima (27th April 2021). These days are expected to witness a large surge of crowds congregating at Har Ki Pauri Ghat, Haridwar, to take the holy bath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-congress-slams-cm-s-markaz-reference-for-covid-threat-to-mahakumbh-101611830966992.html
28-01-2021||Pune||Taste of life: A food magazine that went beyond the ‘starter’, into the main course||In January 1947, two enterprising restaurateurs, Nanasaheb Sarpotdar and Kakasaheb Tambe, met in Pune to discuss the future of the restaurant industry in Maharashtra. Sarpotdar owned a restaurant and a flourishing catering business in Pune, while Tambe ran a couple of eateries in Mumbai and was known all over India for manufacturing innovative “swadeshi” drinks, like Vitogen and Gandhi-peya.The food industry in India was then at a nascent stage. More people were moving to cities and living spaces were soon going to get smaller. Sarpotdar and Tambe knew that soon restaurants would play an important role in the business, social, intellectual and artistic life in the thriving society. A healthy, thriving restaurant industry was not only critically important to the fabric of society through obvious stakeholders – the owners, employees and guests – but to an entire network of groups who might not have traditionally thought of themselves as stakeholders – the farmers, retailers and housewives. Eating out was looked down upon and restaurateurs were the new outcasts. The duo wanted this to change.The outcome was “Aahaarmala”, the first mouthpiece of the food industry in Maharashtra and probably India, the first issue of which was published from Pune in April, 1947. Sarpotdar wrote in the editorial – “This magazine would not limit itself to recipes and preach to its readers what, how and where to eat. We understand that beyond the basic purpose of restaurants to provide food and drink, in Western countries they have always fulfilled a human need for connections and shaped social relations. Our aim is to gain respect for restaurants and the workforce associated with it, and to make the common public aware of the challenges faced by the industry. We also want to talk about the food production in India, agriculture, retail and hospitality industry, household management and health. We want our readers to understand that the food industry will be an integral part of the development of this nation, and hence, initiatives like ‘Aahaarmala’ are in the interest of our beloved nation”.Unfortunately, Sarpotdar passed away a month later. Born in 1896, he had run away from his home as a child and joined a theatre company. In 1927, he established Aryan Film Company and went on to produce and direct 24 silent, and six talkie, movies. Lalita Pawar, Hirabai Barodekar, Chandrakant, Shahu Modak, Ratnamala acted in movies he directed. He gave it all up to start the “Poona Refreshment House” and “Poona Guest House” on Lakshmi road in 1935.Tambe took over the magazine and rechristened it “Aaahar” in June 1947. Anand Antarkar was the editor. The absolute genius of Tambe and Antarkar lies in the fact that almost seven decades later, issues of “Aahaar” are still immensely enjoyable. While the articles are informative, analytical, expressive and even persuasive, they often try to address human experiences directly. It must have been challenging for Tambe to find an inclusive way to cover all aspects of food production and sale in the magazine.“Aahaar” regularly featured articles by stalwarts like Prabodhankar Thakarey, RD Karve, Durga Bhagwat, NS Phadke and VA Buva. It had interviews of eminent restaurateurs like Bandopant Joshi, Velankar, Veerkar and Pathare. These and several other restaurateurs wrote about their experiences in countries like Japan and the USA.“Aahaar” taught its readers to use “modern” equipment like a pressure cooker, electric grinder and ovens. It told them how to arrange the kitchen and keep fruits and vegetables fresh. Several articles taught new restaurateurs how to cook, talk to guests, maintain cleanliness and make sense of the complex laws. There were translations from “Royal Institute of International Affairs” and “Financial News” which dealt with agriculture, land reforms and market economy.It did not stop at printing recipes for “new” dishes like samosa and masala dosa. All the while it existed, “Aahaar” regularly kept urging women to become a part of the food industry. There were several articles which provided blueprints to women for starting an eatery.The most spectacular aspect of “Aahaar” was its empathy for the restaurant-staff and workers. Many of them were young children and men who would work long hours without food. They had absolutely no support in cities like Mumbai and Pune. “Aahaar” publicised their plight. It urged the owners to treat them with dignity and pay them well.Mahatma Gandhi was a regular reader of “Aahaar”. Tambe would send him translated articles. They shared a warm bond and this reflected in the articles printed in “Aahaar”. Tambe was inspired to start a restaurant after reading a booklet written by Gandhi promoting “clean” eating. Gandhi later praised his efforts to popularise buttermilk as a drink in Maharashtra.“Aahaar” ceased to exist in 1954. It is a testimony to the dazzling pragmatism of Sarpotdar and Tambe. That they desired that restaurants be woven into city planning, neighborhood development, and real estate in 1947, talks volumes about their foresight. They wished to see their country prosper and created “Aahaar” to further their cause.It took only a few decades for restaurants, from being considered anti-religion and anti-national, to be an important part of the national economy. Sarpotdar, Tambe and “Aahaar” definitely deserve credit for being an important part of this journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-a-food-magazine-that-went-beyond-the-starter-into-the-main-course-101611831310567.html
28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Javadekar trying to shift Red Fort blame on Congress: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday hit out at Union minister Prakash Javadekar over his “disgraceful and desperate” attempt to shift the blame for the Red Fort violence on the Congress. In a statement, Amarinder alleged that the Red Fort violence was evidently instigated by supporters and members of the BJP in collusion with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress was nowhere in the picture. “Workers and supporters of BJP and AAP, and not the Congress, have been caught on camera waving the Nishan Sahib at Red Fort,” he claimed in response to Javadekar’s unfounded allegations against the Congress, and his own government in Punjab. Not a single Congress leader or member was seen at Red Fort indulging in any kind of lawlessness, Amarinder said, adding that even farmers were not responsible for the January 26 trouble, which was, in fact, the doing of anti-social elements who infiltrated the tractor rally. Conduct fair probe, don’t harass farmers: CM “The Centre should also get a free and fair probe conducted into the possible role of any political party, or even a third country as is being alleged by BJP leaders, to ensure that the guilty are punished and the genuine farmers are not unnecessarily maligned or harassed,” he said. Lashing out at the Union Minister for accusing Rahul Gandhi of inciting the violence, Amarinder said, “Did the Congress leader ask anyone to climb Red Fort? He did not. It was BJP and AAP men who did that”. Rahul had promptly condemned the violence and clarified that violence was no solution to the crisis, he said. “These allegations are nothing but a cover-up attempt by the BJP leader for his own party’s role in the violence, and for their utter failure to manage the situation, which they had created in the first place with the unilateral implementation of the black farm laws,” he said. On the Union Minister’s statement that the Punjab government failed to stop farmers from joining the tractor rally, the CM said: “How could I stop peaceful farmers from going to their own national capital to exercise their democratic right of protest?” He said permission for the tractor march was given by Delhi Police and there was no reason for Punjab to prevent farmers from joining the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/javadekar-trying-to-shift-red-fort-blame-on-congress-amarinder-101611830770916.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi government says at least 3 to 5 years needed to upgrade sewage treatment plants to reduce frothing in Yamuna river||The upgradation of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi to "substantially" reduce foaming in the Yamuna will take three to five years, the city government has said.The presence of phosphates and surfactants in untreated sewage from Delhi, Haryana and UP is a major reason behind frothing in the river."The upgradation of all STPs in UP, Haryana and Delhi to treat the wastewater as per the latest standards, which will substantially reduce the problem of foaming (in the Yamuna), will take about three to five years depending upon the availability of funds etc," the government said in an affidavit submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).It said the delay in tree cutting permission, Covid-19 lockdown, financial hardships and migration of labour slowed down the construction and upgradation of four major sewage treatment plants (STPs) – Kondli, Rithala, Okhla and Coronation Pillar -- in Delhi.The Coronation Pillar STP is to be completed by March 31, while the deadline for Kondli, Rithala and Okhla STPs is December 2022, as per the contract agreement."The STPs at Rithala, Kondli, Coronation Pillar and Okhla with a total capacity of 279 million gallons a day are under rehabilitation/upgradation and likely to be completed by June 2023," the Delhi government said in the affidavit."In case of Rithala and Okhla, the files for tree cutting permissions, complete in all respects, are pending final approval in the Environment and Forest Department since September 23, 2020 and September 29, 2020, respectively," it said.The construction of Coronation Pillar STP slowed down mainly due to the delay in handing over the site, appointment of project management consultant, construction ban imposed by Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, Covid-19 lockdown and migration of labour etc, it said.An action plan has already been prepared for the upgradation of the remaining 16 STPs in Delhi, and submitted to NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee.The work will be completed in three to four years subject to availability of land and funds which are beyond the jurisdiction of the DJB, the affidavit read.The government said the "cash flow problem resulted from the exigencies of Covid-19 crisis and were totally un-anticipated and unprecedented."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-at-least-3-to-5-years-to-upgrade-sewage-treatment-plants-delhi-government-101611828748878.html
28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder writes to PM to include Punjabi in J&K Official Languages Act||Citing Punjab’s historical links with Jammu and Kashmir since Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s time, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention for the inclusion of Punjabi in the official list of languages of the UT. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Amarinder urged him to advise the Union ministry of home affairs to reconsider and review the official list and include Punjabi also as one of the official languages of J&K. Voicing the resentment of the Punjabi community over the exclusion of Punjabi from the list of official languages, he pointed out that J&K was a part of Punjab during the era of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, with Punjabi one of the vernacular languages of the region. When Jammu and Kashmir came into existence as an independent state, Punjabi was a widely spoken language in the state and is now the mother tongue of Punjabis in the Jammu region, besides being spoken by the Punjabi community living in the Kashmir Valley, he wrote. The CM said that under the Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020, which was passed by both Houses of Parliament with a voice vote in September 2020, Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi were included in the list of official languages in the UT, in addition to the existing Urdu and English. Unfortunately, Punjabi was not included in the list of languages which are not just official languages now of the UT but will also be taught in schools as compulsory subjects, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-writes-to-pm-to-include-punjabi-in-j-k-official-languages-act-101611825849725.html

Savadi should understand the history. The boundary dispute with Karnataka is to protect Marathi language and culture," the Shiv Sena MP said."Savadi should come to Mumbai and Maharashtra and ask the Kannada-speaking people, who will tell him that Belgaum and other Marathi-dominated areas in his state should be merged with Maharashtra," Raut claimed.The Maharashtra government provides grant to Kannada schools, libraries and cultural organisations in the state, he said."Does this happen in Belgaum?" he asked.He said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will implement the state's development agenda only.Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belagavi, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending the majority of population in these areas is Marathi-speaking. On its part, as an assertion that Belagavi is an integral part of the state, Karnataka has built the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha, modeled on the Vidhana Soudha, the state secretariat in Bengaluru, where the legislature session is held once a yearMaharashtra chief minister had on Wednesday said areas dominated by Marathi-speaking people on the state's border with Karnataka should be declared as a Union Territory till the Supreme Court gives final verdict on the issue.Meanwhile, when asked about the violence in Delhi on the Republic Day during the farmers' tractor rally, Raut said the police should investigate if those who entered the Red Fort were cultivators."The government wants to crush the farmers' agitation and split them.

28-01-2021||Patna||Bihar teachers’ appointment probe: Onus now on teachers to prove bona fides||With Bihar’s vigilance investigation bureau’s (VIB) inability to finish the probe in suspicious teachers’ appointments due to the education department’s failure to provide over one-lakh missing folders, the state government has now shifted the onus of document verification on teachers.The Patna high court, which ordered the vigilance probe in 2015 into appointments made on the basis of forged documents, will hear the matter again in the first week of February. During the hearing earlier this month, the court had expressed its displeasure over the unending probe. It had also threatened action.Following this, director primary education Ranjit Kumar Singh wrote to all the district education officers (DEOs) and district programme officers (DPOs - establishment) about an alternative mechanism for verification of documents of teachers’ appointment made between 2006 and 2015, necessitated due to non-cooperation by many recruiting agencies under the panchayati raj system.The alternative mechanism puts the onus of verification of documents on the teachers, that too, 10-15 years after they joined service. The teachers have to upload the certificates for minimum eligibility required for their recruitment, along with their mark sheets attached with the application and the recruitment letter on a web portal designed for the purpose.The uploading will be done by the office of the DEO within a specific timeframe. The appointments of teachers, whose documents are not uploaded on the portal, will be deemed irregular.“Prime facie, their appointment will be considered illegal and irregular and suitable action will be taken. The teachers will be served show cause notice and their service will be terminated and the process initiated for recovery of salary drawn by them as per the provisions in the public demand recovery act,” said the letter from the director.However, it is silent on how teaching and evaluation by such teachers over the years would be compensated for and what if the teachers, suspected to have been appointed on forged documents, now furnish original documents.Vigilance officials had earlier said that in the absence of a merit list made at the time of recruitment, it would be tough to find out who benefited from forged documents.However, in the fresh recruitment of around 94,000 teachers, cleared by the chief minister following huge protests by aspirants, the department has decided to tread cautiously. “All the documents will be verified before issuing appointment letters. For the new exercise also, all documents will have to be uploaded on the portal,” said Singh.Last month too, the director had written to all DEOs and DPOs – (establishment) to coordinate with the vigilance officials and hand over the desired documents, as the folders of 110,410 teachers were yet to be submitted. But things still did not move in the desired manner.Also Read: Bihar home department makes 1st move to remove dead wood from government officesA total of 3.52 lakh teachers, including 2082 librarians were appointed in Bihar, between 2006 and 2015. Of them 3.11 lakh were elementary teachers, including 1.04 lakh Shiksha Mitras appointed for ₹1500/month honorarium and later elevated to the rank of Panchayat teachers. Maximum cases of forgery are suspected to be in the ranks of elementary teachers.The HC bench of the then chief justice L Narasimha Reddy and justice Sudhir Singh, while ordering a vigilance probe, had observed: "The extent to which the candidates with fake certificates have been appointed as teachers in the past decade is a matter of deep concern. The state government has soft-pedalled the issue for the past one decade…We direct the director general, vigilance, to immediately swing into action and verify the genuineness of certificates of the teachers who have been appointed since 2006.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-teachers-appointment-probe-onus-now-on-teachers-to-prove-bona-fides-101611822342849.html

His statement comes a day after the BJP and JD(S) indicated joining hands to oust the Congress out of power in the legislative council. “BJP and JD(S) together have a majority so there is no question of defeating the bills,” he said, adding that he will support the anti-cattle slaughter bill “100%”. Also Read: CM Yediyurappa braces for stormy Karnataka assembly sessionPrabhu B Chauhan, Karnataka’s minister for animal husbandry, said that the government is aiming to get this bill passed in the state during this session. The government managed to pass the anti-cattle slaughter bill in the Lower House but it is yet to be taken up in the Upper House. The BS Yediyurappa-led state government has already promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance that widens the existing provisions for punishment on killing of cattle and offers protection to those “acting in good faith” to save them. The Congress said that the JD(S) is a party of convenience and their decision to support the bill will deal a heavy blow to the state’s farming community. “We oppose this blanket ban on cattle slaughter as it will be a big blow to the farmers who look at it as an alternative mode of income,” Rizwan Arshad, the legislator from Shivajinagar in Bengaluru, said. He added that JD(S), which calls itself a party with “farmer focus”, will be exposed before their core support base.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/jds-to-back-bjp-s-anti-cattle-slaughter-bill-in-karnataka-101611822009716.html

At 15.2 degrees Celsius, Mumbai experienced the year’s coldest morning on Thursday, 0.1 degree below Wednesday’s temperature. The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 15.2 degrees Celsius, which was 2.3 degrees below normal. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature at Santacruz was 15.3 degrees Celsius. Before that, the lowest minimum temperature of the season was 15 degrees Celsius on December 29 last year. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 17.6 degrees Celsius, which was 1.9 degrees below normal. Also Read: Mumbai Metro: Fadnavis, Congress leaders engage in war of words over ‘delay’The drop in temperature was in line with the forecast by IMD. “Minimum temperatures in and around Mumbai were expected to drop owing to cold winds from the north,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Meanwhile air quality improved marginally on Thursday with an overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator—of 293 (poor). Over the past weekend, air quality had plummeted to the “very poor” category with AQI measuring 320 on Saturday and 310 on Sunday but improved to 283 (poor) on Monday. It had deteriorated to 305 (very poor) on Wednesday. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. The poor air quality is because of dust storms coming in from the deserts as well as the cold conditions which trap pollutants in the air, said a spokesperson from SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-15-2-c-mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-year-101611820029270.html

They were arrested on January 1 for allegedly hurting religious sentiments and violating Covid-19 protocol during a New Year event during a show in Indore.Faruqui was arrested on January 1 on the complaint of Hindu Rakshak Sangathan convener Eklavya Singh Gaud, who is also a son of BJP MLA Malini Singh Gaud, in Indore just before he was about to start his performance at a local restaurant.He has been in jail since January 2 along with the four other co-accused. The court heard his bail application on January 25 and reserved the order on merit.Rejecting the bail application, a single-bench of judge Rohit Arya observed that “In the light of statements of the complainant and the witnesses referred above, the seized articles via video footage of the show and the seizures memo detailed above, at this stage, it is difficult to countenance to the submission of the learned counsel for the applicant as complacency of the applicant cannot be ruled out, besides vulnerability of his acts in public domain. It is no case of no evidence. More so, the investigation is in progress. The possibility of collection of more incriminating material and complacency of other persons cannot also be ruled out. Further, it has come on record that similar nature offence has been registered against the applicant at a police station in Prayagraj, UP.”Also read | Why Munawar Faruqui matters | HT Editorial“That apart, there is also specific assertion by the learned counsel for the complainant that the applicant along with other co-accused persons allegedly made filthy jokes in social media deliberately against Hindu Gods, Lord Shri Ram and Goddess Seeta, hurting religious sentiments of Hindus for the past 18 months, despite protest on various social media platforms. There is nothing contrary on record,” the order reads.“Be that as it may, this court refrains from commenting upon contentions of the parties touching on merits but regard being had to material seized and the statements of witnesses and that the investigation is in progress, no case is made out for grant of bail. Both the cases stand dismissed,” said the order.Faruqui’s advocate Anshuman Shrivastava said, “We believe in our law and judiciary and will decide the future course of action accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-high-court-rejects-stand-up-comedian-of-munawar-faruqui-s-bail-application-101611817509251.html

On Republic Day, farmer groups had clashed with police in several part of the city including the ITO intersection and the iconic Red Fort.“Farmers are distressed. Every party has cheated farmers for years. Now, it has become a question of existence for farmers after the government passed the three contentious farm laws… What happened on January 26 was unfortunate. Those who are actually guilty should be punished. I emphasise the word ‘actually’… But that incident does not put an end to the protest. The concerns still exist and we should all support farmers in a peaceful way. We cannot be a happy nation with unhappy farmers,” said Kejriwal, addressing party members at the AAP national council meet in Delhi’s Kapashera.Also Read: AAP to contest elections in 6 states, says Arvind KejriwalOn Tuesday (January 26), the party had condemned the violence.

Both parties alleged that supporters of the other were involved in provoking farmers and instigating violence.The violence left hundreds injured, including at least 394 police officials. It has so far led to 25 cases and the FIRs mention several farm union leaders. The violence took place after farmer groups organised a tractor rally – to coincide with Republic Day celebrations – on Tuesday, as part of a larger ongoing protest against the three contentious farm laws. The clashes happened when the groups deviated from the designated routes and marched towards central points such as India Gate and Red Fort.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The AAP had voted against the three laws in both Houses of the Parliament when they were passed in September.The AAP has also been helping the farmers who have gathered at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and several other border points in Delhi with basic amenities ranging from tents and food to free WiFi internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-violence-unfortunate-but-farm-laws-still-an-issue-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101611816609141.html

Several leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have publicly expressed their displeasure for either being overlooked for Cabinet berths or allocated undesirable portfolios. Yediyurappa, 77, had to reshuffle portfolios four times in five days to calm tempers.“There are issues of corruption, infighting that is affecting governance, Covid-19 response and farm laws...,” said an opposition Congress leader. “We are going to protest during the governor’s address itself.”Also Read: SC stays arrest of Yediyurappa in 2012 forgery caseThe session will start with governor Vajubhai Vala’s address to the assembly.The Supreme Court on Wednesday admitted a petition filed by Yediyurappa and minister Murugesh Nirani against a Karnataka high court order allowing restoration of a criminal case against them in the alleged illegal land de-notification matter.The Congress is also likely to protest the decision against holding the session in Belagavi, about 500 km from Bengaluru.

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Tractor rally violence: Centre provoked farmers, says Shiv Sena's Saamana||Shiv Sena on Thursday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government, with an aim to discredit farmers’ peaceful protest against the three new farm laws, provoked them to commit violence. In an editorial in Saamana, Sena said that nobody supports the violence that erupted in the national Capital on Republic Day but the farmers alone can’t be blamed for it.Farmers participating in the January 26 tractor rally broke the police barricades and entered Delhi, going right up to Red Fort.“For the last 60 days, the farmers’ movement has been going on in a peaceful manner seeking repeal of three agricultural laws that are opposed to the interests of the country’s farmers. Despite this, there was no split in the movement. Despite being called Khalistani, the farmers remained calm,” the editorial said.It added , it was the “desire of the government to discredit the movement by provoking the farmers to commit violence. If it had fulfilled its desire on January 26, then it has brought the country disrepute. It is easy to say that farmers took law in their hands.”“The crowd which gathered at the Red Fort was led by a young man named Deep Sidhu. It has been revealed that Sidhu belongs to the camp of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah. He is also an aide of BJP’s Punjab MP, Sunny Deol. Farmer leaders like Rajesh Tikait say that Sidhu had been talking about revolt and separatism for the past two months while addressing the crowds,” the editorial said.Also read | Cops register 25 cases after violence on Republic DayThe Sena mouthpiece added that the tricolour at Red Fort was untouched, unlike what the “BJP-backed media” was saying. “BJP-backed media started shouting that agitating farmers insulted the tricolour.

A religious flag was hoisted on the second dome of the Red Fort, no one is ready to show this truth,” it said.It added that those who attacked the police should be apprehended and prosecuted.

28-01-2021||Patna||Bihar home department makes 1st move to remove dead wood from government offices||In keeping with Nitish Kumar government’s announcement in July last year to compulsorily retire inefficient government employees over 50 years of age, the state home ministry, headed by the chief minister, has taken the lead and set up high-level committees to implement the order in its own jurisdiction.The first committee to be headed by the additional chief secretary of the home department will deal with Group-A employees. The committee also comprises secretary, special secretary and the home department’s chief vigilance official.The second committee, to be headed by secretary of the home department, will identify the dead wood from amongst the Group B, C and D employees. It will also comprise joint secretary-cum-chief vigilance official and the additional secretary.The meetings of the committee will be called every year in June and December to deliberate on the proposals to retire identified officials in the light of the notification issued last year by the general administrative department (GAD). All the offices and directorates under the home department have also been asked to set up such committees at their level.Last year, GAD had asked the departments to hold a yearly screening committee meeting to review performance of officials and employees above 50 years of age, to find those unfit to discharge their duties or to remain in service.The notification stated that the decision on compulsory retirement would also take into consideration the work done by the employees in the past years. However, it had generated a lot of political heat ahead of elections, with the Opposition making it a big issue. It remains to be seen how other departments act on the notification issued last year.Taking a serious note of poor results in matric and intermediate exams in 2017, the government had announced to compulsorily retire non-performing headmasters, teachers and education department officials above the age of 50 years. However, it was not implemented on the ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-home-department-makes-1st-move-to-remove-dead-wood-from-government-offices-101611813203907.html
28-01-2021||Other||Why Kerala is reporting nearly half of India’s Covid-19 cases||Up to 44% of Covid-19 cases in India have of late been reported from Kerala, which was once cited as the role model for management of the disease. Kerala health ministry statistics show that the state’s Covid-19 positivity rate is five times the national average.Most states are reporting Covid cases as low as the May-June levels. But in Kerala, intensive care unit (ICU) beds in several hospitals are almost full. According to the ministry, there are 3,050 ICU beds -- 1,200 in government hospitals and 1,850 in the private sector --- and of them about 90% are occupied.“As of now, the situation is under control but if the situation aggravates the health ministry will have to find other alternatives like makeshift hospitals for Covid patients,” said health expert Dr SS Lal.Also Read: 70% of India’s Covid-19 cases from Maharashtra, Kerala: Harsh VardhanHealth experts blamed the over-confidence of the state government and its over-dependence on antigen tests, considered to be less accurate, than the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests believed to be the gold standard for Covid-19 diagnosis, for the rising number of cases and high positivity rate. Worse, they say, the state is still flaunting old records to paint a rosy picture.“The state failed to go after the virus, but it went after records of the pandemic. The situation is serious. We have been warning the government about it for quite some time,” said Lal, a US-returned public health expert, adding the state was paying the price for ignoring early warnings.Statistics show that the situation has turned serious in the last three months. Covid-19 cases started to rise after a brief lull in October (called the second wave). The average test positivity rate (TPR) rose to 13% and on October 13 it went up to 18.16%. In November, the TPR came down to 8% and in December it went up to 9%, shows the ministry data.In the second half of January, the cases started rising again with the TPR increasing to 12.48% on January 25 from 10.88 in mid-January.As the positivity rate rose, the number of active Covid cases also increased. Average active cases in the last three months were between 65,000 and 70,000, statistics show. On Wednesday, the active caseload was 71,607.According to the Union health ministry, out of the 20 worst-affected Covid districts, 12 are in Kerala now.Ernakulam and Kozhikode top the state in Covid-19 cases. The Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s Kerala chapter has asked the state government to take stringent measures in Ernakualm including a lockdown to check the spread. The state government appears to be reluctant because it could impact upcoming assembly polls, which are three months away and has rejected the demand.“The state is treading dangerously and some districts like Ernakulam need strict measures including a lockdown,” said IMA Kerala president PT Zacarias. “Situation is really fluid. Some people behave as if with the arrival of vaccine, everything is normal now,” said S Mini, a nurse at Ernakulam district hospital.The only silver lining is the low mortality rate. “We need a genetic study to find out whether in Kerala a less lethal strain has developed which is not causing many deaths but the infection is spreading faster,” said public health expert and epidemiologist Dr B Raman Kutty.Experts, however, alleged fudging and under-reporting of cases and deaths. “Total deaths are 3,643 as on Tuesday. Since December first week I collected data from government and private hospitals and health volunteers and posted a difference every day on social media. According to my estimate, Covid-19 deaths will be at least thrice the official tally,” said Dr NM Arun, an internal medicine expert who has studied Covid-19 deaths extensively.A government doctor at Thiruvananthapuram medical college, who did not want to be named, admitted that there was a huge disparity in official tally and the ground situation. Even the names of a legislator and a youth leader, who died of post-Covid-19 complications, did not figure on the official mortality list. Health ministry officials said they were Covid-19 negative during their last days.“We have a standard protocol, and we enumerate deaths based on this. We agree some deaths failed to figure in the official list,” said a health official, debunking claims of data fudging.Lal said dependence on unreliable and cheap antigen tests despite repeated directives from the Union health ministry was the reason for this rise in cases.A close look at the Covid dashboard shows that out of 9,289,304 tests conducted till Monday, antigen tests accounted for 66%. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu, all 15.2 million crore tests were RT-PCR tests. In Karnataka, 70% of close to 18 million tests were RT-PCR tests.Health experts say antigen tests are only 50% sensitive while RT-PCR 90%.“It seems home quarantine of those who came from outside did not work and the virus started spreading in the community. The state surveillance machinery either failed to detect this or ignored it. There were tell-tale signs of community spread and the state should have taken those warning signs seriously,” said G Pramod Kumar, a former senior advisor to the United National Development Programme.State health minister KK Shailaja said it was wrong to blame the government alone for the surge in cases. “We admit cases are on the rise. Our intervention delayed the peak and we kept strict tabs on the mortality rate,” she said, adding the year-end festive season and local body elections were responsible for the rise.“We can’t remain in lockdown ever; life has to go on. We have streamlined our measures again. We have strengthened our surveillance and contact raising. We hope the surge will be contained by next month,” she said.But experts said going by the present infection rate, it will take two-three more months to subside.As cases pile up, a worried state government has launched a fresh programme, Back to Basics, to tide over the crisis. The Union health ministry has asked the state government to scale up tests before it gets out of control. Since almost all sectors have opened up, it will be difficult for the government to impose another lockdown now.What worries health experts is that this particular wave of infections is showing no downward trend in the state with a high population density (859 people per sqkm) and a large number of elderly (at least 15% of the population are above 60 years of age). A study conducted by CADI (Coronary Artery Disease among Indian Asians) has shown that Kerala’s diabetes prevalence is 20% against the national average of 8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/why-kerala-is-reporting-nearly-half-of-india-s-covid-19-cases-101611813368890.html

Talking to media persons, Das made it clear that he wanted to see the Congress regain its past glory in the state and not be an also ran contestant.The latest programme also assumes considerable significance since Das had hinted that the state party unit would be revamped and important party leaders with mass support would be given prime positions in the organisation. About a dozen AICC delegates from Telangana, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have also been roped in to collect feedback on prominent faces of the party before the reshuffle.Beginning his drive on Tuesday, Das led a padyatra-cum-tractor march of party workers and farmers sympathising with the Congress in Bikram sub-division of Patna. Local legislator Siddharth had organised the programme to support farmers’ agitation against the farm laws and the tractor rally in the national capital on the Republic Day.Also Read: Bihar BJP spokesperson shot at in Munger; 1 arrestedDas and senior party leaders including Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha will go to Champaran on Thursday to oversee the preparation for Padyatra to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30.

28-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: State govt prosecutor hiding relevant info, cops tell SC||Delhi Police on Wednesday alleged before the Supreme Court that a city government prosecutor had been deliberately hiding relevant information from the department about the February 2020 Delhi riots cases, resulting in the grant of bail to an accused. Even as the top court sought to steer clear of controversy, a new chapter unfolded in the Delhi Police versus Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government saga before a bench led by justice Ashok Bhushan when the police claimed that one of the accused in the riots cases got out on bail because the prosecutor withheld the information about the case before the high court. Also Read: 700 victims of Delhi riots file claims for damagesAdditional solicitor general (ASG) Vikramjeet Banerjee, appearing for the police, complained that the city government’s additional public prosecutor was well aware that the Central government had appointed special counsel to deal with the Delhi riots cases, but the former chose not to communicate this to the investigating agency when bail petition of the accused, one Iliyas, came up for hearing. Challenging the bail order of August 25, 2020, the ASG added: “It is a completely strange situation where the additional public prosecutor does not communicate it to the police officials attached with the high court and instead he makes a wrong statement that he had informed a deputy commissioner of police about it.” He added: “My lords are well aware about the situations in Delhi. Here, the special prosecutor is not even informed and the high court also gives bail to the accused without issuing a notice to the special prosecutor.” The petition, filed by the Delhi Police, had alleged that the city government’s prosecutor “withheld” the information from the investigating agency, appeared in the matter without authorisation and made statements which led to a propitious order for the accused in question. According to the Delhi Police, this was not an isolated incident and the same prosecutor had been acting in this manner in other cases too wherein he had not intimated either the special prosecutor or the police officials present in the high court. Banerjee also submitted that the two police officers have filed their personal affidavits to state that they were not informed about the bail hearing of Iliyas, who has been booked under charges of attempted murder, rioting and arson in a first information report lodged at Dayal Pur police station. The ASG also called the high court order “strange” as it failed to take into account the charge sheet filed against the accused and the presence of several pieces incriminating evidence against him. The bench, however, told Banerjee that the correct course of action for the Delhi Police would be to persuade the high court to review its order and seek a cancellation there. “We have a limited scope here. We cannot entertain your petition here. You should persuade the high court to review its order. It shall also be open for you to seek cancellation of the bail,” the bench, which also included justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah, told the ASG. The order then recorded: “We do not find any ground to entertain this special leave petition. The special leave petition is dismissed. We, however, observe that it shall be open for the prosecution to make an application for cancellation of bail, if appropriate grounds are made out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-state-govt-prosecutor-hiding-relevant-info-cops-tell-sc-101611809288821.html
28-01-2021||Lucknow||Bird Flu: Over 7,100 birds culled in UP’s biggest-ever operation since 2013||Mass culling of poultry birds was carried out in Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday even as half a dozen other wild birds tested positive for the disease in the Deoria district.In what was being said to be the third and the biggest culling operation in UP since 2013, a total of 7,177 birds were killed after some of them tested positive for avian influenza. Of these, 7,122 were poultry birds, 49 were ducks and six were pigeons.“We had to cull more than 7,100 birds, mostly poultry, within one km radius from the epicentre, as per the government’s guidelines, after some birds were found infected in Lakhimpur Kheri on January 26,” said RP Singh, director, animal husbandry (animal diseases).“As per the guidelines, once infection is confirmed in birds at an epicentre, all birds within 1 km radius from that place are killed to arrest the spread of the disease,” he explained.In this case Mohammadi town was found to be the epicentre of the bird flu.Twelve vehicles equipped with audio systems made continuous announcements about the operation and appealed to locals for cooperation, said district chief veterinary officer TK Tiwari, who along with sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Shwati Shukla, led the entire operation.“We convinced people in a way that we did not face any resistance from them. On the contrary, people started offering their bird to us for culling,” he said.Explaining the process of culling, Saket Yadav, a doctor, said, the birds were first sedated with a medicine and then decapitated, after which the dead birds were put into special poly bags and buried deep into the ground with layers of lime and salt, as per the guidelines.Barring 177 poultry birds, which were domestic, all other poultry birds culled in the state’s biggest bird flu culling operation were from poultry farms.Prior to this, culling of poultry birds was done on a very small scale in Sherpur area in Pilibhit district and wild birds were culled in Kanpur zoo earlier this month. The first operation to cull poultry birds due to avian influenza was said to have been launched in 2013.Also Read: Bird flu confirmed at third poultry farm in Dera BassiA few days ago, traces of avian influenza were also found in some wild birds in Deoria district, creating a scare. “We sent samples of some sick wild birds for testing. Half a dozen crows and one heron were found to be infected with bird flu,” said RP Singh.He said random samples of birds from various districts were being sent regularly to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly.“But the positivity rate in UP is still very low,” he added.The state government had banned import of all live birds from other states through a notification on January 20. But it rolled back the ban after a week following the Central government’s advice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bird-flu-over-7-100-birds-culled-in-up-s-biggest-ever-operation-since-2013-101611808340138.html

I didn’t lead people to the Red Fort. This was the decision of the public who had come all the way from Punjab to protest. Nobody was leading them,” said the 36-year-old, going live on Facebook.Also read: Republic Day violence: FIRs, blame-game, infighting mar farmers’ protestHe said farmer union leaders who had called him a traitor should be ashamed as they are doing the government’s bidding. “The farmer union leaders should have supported the people unfurling the farmer’s and Khalsa flag at Red Fort because it was done only and only to mark our protest in this fight. The Tricolour was not demeaned, and there was no violence till I was there. Their support for what the public did at the Red Fort would have pressurised the government to repeal the black (farm) laws,” Sidhu said. “They should have conveyed to the government that if the farmers can reach Red Fort, they can do anything in protest,” he said.FARMER LEADERS INSTIGATED PEOPLE: SIDHU The actor said the farmer leaders had called the public to Delhi by giving instigating speeches from stages. “They even said they will hit Delhi to open the eyes and ears of the Centre,” he said.“The mood of the people was to reach inside Delhi, and they did it. The so-called peaceful marches by the farmer leaders had few participants on tractors. However, lakhs of people were inside Delhi,” the actor said.He said he reached Red Fort when thousands of people were already there.Sidhu, who was reportedly chased away by farm union activists at Singhu border after the violence at Red Fort, said he was “very much near Singhu border and those who chased him are loyalists of the farmer leaders”.TAKES ON FARMER LEADERS FOR CALLING HIM RSS AGENT “Farmer union leaders had been claiming that Sidhu has no support and now they say I instigated and led people to enter Delhi. If I was so unpopular how I could lead so many people?”The actor also took on the farmer leaders for calling him an agent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). “If those who reached Red Fort were RSS men, who were they who called the public to Delhi and followed the routes dictated by the Centre?” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deep-sidhu-surfaces-on-fb-objects-to-being-called-traitor-101611808388727.html

Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Wednesday apologised for the violence that erupted in the national capital, however, they claimed there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” to thwart the protest.Meanwhile, the Centre has said it will keep its communication channels with farm unions open and its offer to put the three legislation in abeyance for 18 months will stay. “It was the final offer from the government and it has not been withdrawn. The violence will be dealt with as per the law but talks with farmers can always continue,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-tractor-rally-violence-entry-gates-of-delhi-s-lal-quila-jama-masjid-metro-stations-closed-says-dmrc-101611798592913.html

28-01-2021||Delhi||Confusion led to chaos at Ghazipur, says farmer leader||hFarmers protesting at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border on Wednesday expressed grief over the farmer who died in Tuesday’s clashes while their leaders maintained the violence was a conspiracy to defame their agitation against the new agriculture laws.Many of the tents set up on the roads at the border were vacant, most of the tractors and other vehicles were missing, as several farmers packed their bags and left the protest site on Tuesday night itself, following the violence.Some farmers said people panicked and left after rumours spread about possible raids and arrests by police for Tuesday’s violence. A three-hour condolence gathering for the dead farmer was also organised at the main stage at the expressway from where farmer leaders address participants every day.Apart from the government, the leaders blamed the Opposition parties and the police, alleging that they sent hooligans impersonating as farmers to disrupt the protest through violence.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said the chaos started because the police barricaded the approved route going towards the Ghazipur roundabout.“Farmers were mostly from outside Delhi and they were not well aware of the roads in Delhi, especially NH-24, NH-9, and the Delhi-Meerut expressway, which has multiple carriageways and are very confusing. As the police had barricaded the road on which they had asked us to take our tractor rally, it confused some of the farmers and they entered the carriageways going towards Sarai Kale Khan. Other farmers followed them and that is how the confusion started,” said Tikait, adding that nearly 400 tractors were damaged and many farmers were injured in the violence.Without naming the person who hoisted a religious flag or the political party he was associated with, Tikait said the flag hoisting was part of a “larger conspiracy” to defame Punjab. “Everyone knows who that person was and which political party he belonged to. There are videos and photos of him with leaders of that party. I will not be taking anybody’s name,” said Tikait.Sunil Choudhary, a farmer from Noida, said he was present near the MCD toll booth on the NH-24 service lane when some farmers began the tractor rally around 9.30am, much before the scheduled time. He said the entire confusion started when four men who were dressed like leaders asked the farmers to move their tractors on the NH-24 and the expressway by saying that police had given them a new route.“As the farmers were getting impatient, they broke the barricades with their tractors and went on to the restricted roads. Others followed. I believe that the four men were agents of the government who were sent to disrupt our rally. They all disappeared after the creating the chaos,” said Choudhary.DCP (east) Deepak Yadav refuted the allegations and said, “We had given them the route but they did not follow it. If the scheduled road was barricaded, why they only broke the barricades of the restricted routes?”The Capital descended into chaos as thousands of farmers protesting against the three laws passed in September stormed the Red Fort after breaking barricades and driving tractors through roadblocks.While the farmer leaders continued explaining to the media the entire sequence of events, many of them looked apologetic while others were angry as they felt some anti-social elements were behind the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/confusion-led-to-chaos-at-ghazipur-says-farmer-leader-101611795800230.html

28-01-2021||Bhopal||Parents of 24-yr-old among 11 booked under anti-conversion law||The parents of a 24-year-old Hindu woman and nine others have been booked under the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Ordinance, 2020, for allegedly forcing her to convert to Christianity in a ceremony held in Indore on Tuesday night, the police said.The FIR was registered on a complaint by the woman, Shalini Kaushal, at the Bhanwarkuan police station against her parents Rakesh Kaushal and Rani Kaushal under Section 3 and 5 of the MP Freedom of Religion Ordinance, said HN Mishra, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Indore. Nine others were named in the FIR.Police have arrested the parents and seven others. The accused were produced before a court on Wednesday and were sent to judicial custody, said a police officer.According to the FIR, “Shalini said that her parents Rakesh and Rani lied to her and took her to a church Satprakashan Sanchar Kendra, Indrapuri, Indore to attend a programme of Christian missionary. In the programme, the accused were saying that God will help you...Some women beat me up. They were forcing people to adopt Christianity. I am Hindu by religion but my parents and others were forcing me to convert. Like me, there were two more people, who were being forced for conversion.”DIG HN Mishra said, “We are checking the background of accused and also the involvement of the centre’s office-bearers. We are also investigating to know whether it was a mass conversion programme or not as most of the participants were Hindu.”The Centre’s director, Father Babu Joseph, said: “There is a convention centre in the Church premises, but I don’t know about any programme. People are free to organize any programme without taking any permission, but we don’t promote conversion. I will look into the matter.”Bajrang Dal workers entered in the hall in large number and created a scene. Bajrang Dal, Indore leader Tannu Sharma said, “We came to know that more than 150 people from across the state had been brought to Indore for conversion. We reached there and stopped the accused from doing so. Many people told us that they were being forced to convert.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/parents-of-24-yr-old-among-11-booked-under-anti-conversion-law-101611794813335.html

The airport on Wednesday said it was working with airlines and the Indian Air Force to ensure minimal disruption to the existing schedule during the reduced operating hours. "In order to ensure safety and pave the way for the success of the event, BLR Airport will partially close commercial flight operations and also standby as the diversionary airport for flying display during the days of practice and the main show," the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), which manages the airport, said in a statement. To avoid passenger inconvenience, the respective airlines will share timely communication on the change in airport operations and the revised flight timings during the Aero India show, a prestigious event recognised globally. The BIAL said that ancillary support such as airport taxis and bus services will be aligned to accommodate the anticipated increase in passenger traffic.

28-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A South Extension survivor||The wall is partitioned into light and shade. The lit portion is splattered with moving shadows of tree leaves. A tiny wooden temple is clamped on one corner of the wall, containing the idols of Ganesh and Lakshmi.This wall and the counter running along it constitute a tea stall in South Extension II, just behind the Metro station exit. It’s called... well, Tea Stall. “This was started 40 years ago by my dadi (grandmother), Basanti,” owner Pammi informs, while slicing a sprig of ginger, in a gruff tone as if he can’t waste his time on idle chat. He wordlessly transfers the ginger pieces into a little mortar and pestle, crushes them into a paste, and tosses the gooey mess into a pan of boiling chai. The pan is thoroughly chipped, its sooty surface evocative of those forgotten Delhi ruins, whose stones acquire an ethereal cover of patina after centuries of exposure to changing seasons.The establishment is noteworthy because it comes with a kind of lounge—with benches plonked across the footpath. This sunny afternoon two friends are sitting on one of the sun-soaked benches, chatting over chai and mathri (noodles and omelette are also served). A third person is perched on another bench. Wearing an executive-style pant-shirt-and-tie, he is tapping on his laptop.The stall’s counter is as absorbing as a museum display. A lower shelf is crammed with tea kettles of various sizes. Another shelf is filled with thermos flasks. “I also supply the chai to various shops, and it remains hot in the thermos,” he explains.The tea shack is also special because it has survived the drastic changes South Extension has undergone over the recent years. A great number of landmarks in the area that one took for granted have become history—the Ebony showroom, the Planet M music shop, a Mills & Boon kiosk, and the Kitkat dhaba that served most excellent rajma chawal for an obscenely cheap price.Now, another round of chai is ready and Pammi starts to pour it into a thermos.For best experience, hit the stall in the afternoon, take over the bench, give repeat orders of ginger chai and spend hours reading a book, or reading the fashionable people walking past the expensive showrooms. And yes, look out for a first floor glass-fronted empty space across the street. It was a chic coffee shop until last year, and is history.The shop opens daily, including Sunday, from 6am to 8pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-south-extension-survivor-101611794062290.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Vaccination turnout dips to 80.8% after 91% got Covid jabs on Monday||Delhi saw a dip in the vaccination rate on Wednesday with 6,545 of 8,100 targeted beneficiaries receiving the shot, reflecting a turnout of 80.8%. This is a drop of almost 10 percentage points from the 91% turnout the city saw on Monday.An out-of-schedule vaccination drive was conducted on Wednesday in Delhi to make up for Republic Day holiday.However, with the turnout seeing an increase since the 53.3% recorded during the nationwide roll-out on January 16, more vaccination sites are likely to be opened from Thursday. At least two of the 81 hospitals conducting the Covid-19 immunisation drive confirmed that additional sites will start at their facilities on Thursday.“Now that more people have started coming in, to quickly vaccinate as many people as we can, another site will start functioning at the hospital from tomorrow,” said a senior doctor from Lady Hardinge Medical College. The hospital vaccinated 74 people on Wednesday, down from 110 on Monday.Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in Dilshad Garden will also call in 200 beneficiaries for vaccination on Thursday. “We started a second vaccination counter Wednesday itself, post-lunch, and were able to achieve the target of 110. From tomorrow (Thursday), both counters will be open and 200 people will be called in for vaccination,” said a senior doctor at the hospital, not wishing to be named.With 110%, north-east district saw the highest turnout among the 11 revenue districts on Wednesday. New Delhi saw the lowest with just 60.8% of the targeted people turning up for vaccination, as per the government data.So far, 39,715 health-care workers have been inoculated against a targeted 58,778.The government is planning on adding 25 more sites soon, according to a senior official from Delhi’s health department. “However, not all might start functioning from Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccination-turnout-dips-to-80-8-after-91-got-covid-jabs-on-monday-101611791595829.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Nationwide public meets, fast on Jan 30: Protesters||Nationwide public meetings and a fast will be organised at all protest points on January 30 to mark the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, leaders of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said at a press conference on Wednesday evening, a day after violence was reported at a tractor parade taken out by the farmers on Republic Day.“Our movement will continue. On February 1, we will organise a day-long fast. The public’s sympathy that we lost will be regained,” said Yogendra Yadav of the Jai Kisan Andolan and an organizer of the protests.On Monday, the SKM, an umbrella body of at least 30 farmer bodies, had announced they would carry out a tractor rally to Parliament on February 1 as well, days after their rally to Delhi on Republic Day. But farmers called off this rally on Wednesday.Overall, the movement against three farm laws will continue, farmer leaders said. “The farmers should not feel demotivated. We will have more programmes in the near future,” said Rakesh Tikait, another farmer leader.At the press conference, the leaders also questioned why the Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee (Punjab) was allowed to set up a fresh stage on the police side of the barricades.“We were all on one side of the barricades. Then, 13 days after we arrived, the KMSC was given a special enclosure on the police side to set up their stage,” said Yogendra Yadav.The SKM leaders blamed the KMSC and actor Deep Sidhu of leading the violence. “Since November 26, there was not a single incident of violence. But the KMSC was allotted a space ahead of us. There was no blockade for them and they sabotaged our movement,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal).Savinder Singh Chautala, senior vice president of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), said that his organisation led the rally on Tuesday as the SKM had backed off a day before the rally. “Our plan was to go to Outer Ring Road (rather than on the planned route), but it was to be done by convincing the police and not by force. We sat before the barricades to request the police, but the SKM farmers arrived at the scene to break through the barricades,” said Chautala.At the Singhu Border on Wednesday, leaders of both camps delivered speeches against each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/nationwide-public-meets-fast-on-jan-30-protesters-101611791392598.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Property worth crores destroyed, still gauging damage, say officials||At least eight closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras placed at the ITO intersection, nearly 200 metres of railing on road dividers, two traffic signals and handrails of bus stops in the busy intersection have been destroyed as farmer protestors broke ranks at the different tractor rallies held near the city’s borders on Tuesday.And that’s just one intersection.Civic and police officials, who are still taking stock of the extent of the damage caused by the protestors who deviated from their pre-planned routes and entered the city on tractors, estimated on Wednesday that public property worth crores of rupees had been destroyed.This does not include over 40 Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses, crash barriers in at least 12 bus stands and several potted plants and portions of road dividers.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior PWD official said that steel and iron railings of nearly 200 metres were damaged at ITO, 100 metres of cement railings were pulled down at the Netaji Subhash Marg near Red Fort, and the iron railing on the central verge was broken on Vikas Marg. Tractors rammed into public property on the Ring Road and on the Noida Link Road. At Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, ITO and Vikas Marg, plants and flower pots were also severely damaged. Similarly, the plants on the central on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg, Noida-Link Road, and the Ring Roadwere also destroyed by tractors and other vehicles.“The cameras at ITO and Delhi Gate were installed as part of the Delhi traffic police’s intelligent traffic management system (ITMS) plan between 2010 and 2016. The protestors broken the glass of some signals and damaged the poles of some others. A proper assessment in the coming days will bring out a clearer picture,” said a senior official of the Delhi traffic police.Police said while the process of identifying the culprits has begun, those identified for the damages will be booked under relevant sections for the destruction of public property.Some of main stretches where such a drive was started include DDU Marg, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, on Ring Road between Bhairon Marg T-point and Chandgi Ram Akhara, Minto Road, IP Extension flyover, road in front of ISBT Kashmere Gate and Tis Hazari Court, Vikas Marg and Noida Link Road —most of which were targeted by the protesters on January 26.“Grills near the ITO skywalk were removed; plants were uprooted at many stretches. All these were developed as part of beautification projects. It will take us at least one month to repair broken grills, central verges and dividers on these stretches. However, we can grow the greenery but it will take time. It’s not just about the loss of money but also about waste of time, efforts and resources. Whenever such incidents take place, they push us many months back in terms of development,” the PWD official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/property-worth-crores-destroyed-still-gauging-damage-say-officials-101611790899231.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||AAP spars with BJP over violent twist to farm rally||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the violence that unfolded on Tuesday in several parts of Delhi, including the ITO intersection and Red Fort, alleging that it “infiltrated” farmer groups to derail what was meant to be a peaceful march on the occasion of Republic Day.The party’s spokesperson, Raghav Chadha, also accused Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu of instigating violence, and alleged that he was close to the BJP — and shared several photographs of Sidhu with multiple BJP leaders as evidence of their nexus. Sidhu was seen leading the mob that hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag at Red Fort.The BJP, while dismissing these allegations at a separate press briefing by the party’s Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta, in turn accused the AAP government in Delhi of supporting the farmer groups with WiFi connections which were used by “miscreants” to spread misinformation through social media.Both parties also ended up identifying a man named Amrik Singh, who purportedly shared photos and videos on social media and claimed to have taken part in the violence at Red Fort.Gupta alleged that Singh was close to the AAP, sharing his photographs with leaders such as Tilak Nagar MLA Jarnail Singh and the party’s Lok Sabha MP from Punjab Bhagwant Mann. Chadha hit back not long after, accusing Singh of being a BJP supporter and shared his photos with BJP MPs like Parvesh Verma and Hans Raj Hans.There was no clarity on where either sets of photos were clicked, and HT could not check their veracity.“Supporters and agents of the BJP infiltrated the tractor rally and turned it violent. The BJP has plans to malign the image of farmer groups who have been protesting against three contentious farm laws. It is also BJP’s attempt to divert attention from the controversy surrounding the anti-farmer laws,” Chadha alleged.“The BJP-led central government is now using the police against leaders of the ongoing peaceful protest. And, people who actually instigated yesterday’s violence are yet to be arrested. Deep Sidhu is one of them and is an agent of the BJP,” said Chadha who is also the AAP’s joint in-charge of Punjab unit.BJP leader Gupta, meanwhile said the AAP leaders and supporters have a “direct hand” in the Republic Day violence, especially what unfolded at Red Fort. “The AAP government openly collaborated with the violent groups by providing them with free WiFi internet at Singhu border which was used for spreading misinformation by miscreants,” he said.“This is a well-planned conspiracy of AAP to wipe out the constitutional arrangements in Delhi. It should be thoroughly probed by agencies,” he added.Deep Sidhu’s phone number was switched off when Hindustan Times tried to reach him for a response on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-spars-with-bjp-over-violent-twist-to-farm-rally-101611790316360.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Two cops with head injuries still in ICU||At least two police personnel who had suffered head injuries in Tuesday’s violence continue to be in the intensive care unit of two hospitals. One farmer had died and at least seventeen protesters had been injured in the incident. According to the Delhi Police, 394 police officers suffered various injuries in Tuesday’s rally.One of the police personnel admitted to Lok Nayak hospital’s ICU continues to be in “critical” condition. “He is conscious and talking, however, he is in a critical condition and needs intensive monitoring. We will continue to do CT scan and other diagnostic tests to monitor his condition. He had also sustained a fracture,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, which had received over 20 persons from the incident in its emergency department.Another police personnel with fractured hand is also admitted in the hospital. Two protesters – one has a facial laceration and another with a blunt injury – continue to be in the hospital wards as on Wednesday evening.Another police personnel is recuperating in the ICU of Sushruta trauma centre. “He had a head injury and is currently stable. We are monitoring his condition and he needs an MRI to rule out any other injuries. He will be moved to Lok Nayak or GB Pant hospital for the same,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.Another cop who has a fractured leg is in need of a surgery. “The cop will undergo a planned orthopaedic surgery to fix the fractured bone. It will be done after 48 hours,” the doctor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-cops-with-head-injuries-still-in-icu-101611789562142.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Barricades gone at ITO but police deployment continues at the busy junction||The police on Wednesday removed concrete jersey barriers, iron barricades and DTC buses, placed at ITO — one of Delhi’s busiest traffic junctions — where a protester died and several policemen and farmers were injured in clashes on Tuesday, even as heavy deployment of security personnel continued at the junction.As thousands of farmers stormed into Delhi on Tuesday while conducting the “tractor march” that resulted in clashes between the police and the protesters, at least 22 security personnel, including one paramilitary official, were injured at ITO, which witnessed a riot-like situation. One protesting farmer died at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg close to the ITO junction. Police said the CCTV footage showed that he rammed his speeding tractor into a police barricade, as a result of which the vehicle toppled, killing him on the spot.However, till Wednesday evening, no arrests were made in connection with the violence at ITO.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said the security arrangements were stepped up on Wednesday. “Deployment of security forces was already high because of the Republic Day. We have strategically fortified the district in such a way that no protester will be allowed to make its way through the central district. In case protesters gather again, the arrangements are in place to not allow them to head towards New Delhi district,” Singh said.The DCP said so far only one FIR has been registered in central district at the IP Estate police station for rioting, damage to public property and other relevant sections. “Five of our police vehicles, eight buses of Delhi Transport Corporation and several barricades were damaged by the protesting groups at ITO. Further damages are still being assessed,” Singh said.Officials said smooth traffic flow at the junction was restored by Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/barricades-gone-at-ito-but-police-deployment-continues-at-the-busy-junction-101611789266405.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Cops register 25 cases after violence on Republic Day||The Delhi Police have registered over 25 cases, including those of rioting and criminal conspiracy, in connection with the violence that erupted during a tractor rally by farmers in the Capital on Republic Day, officials said on Wednesday. The officials added that 19 people were arrested and about 50 detained.One of the FIRs — filed on Tuesday — mentions Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, social activist Medha Patkar and Bharatiya Kisan Union-Tikait (BKU-Tikait) leader Rakesh Tikait among 37 leaders of the protest who had “a pre-planned objective of not following the mutually agreed route and timing of their rally” and “disrupting the Republic Day parade”.To be sure, these 37 people were not named as accused in the case registered at Samaipur Badli police station on a complaint by inspector Anil Kumar. They were identified as those being involved in multiple rounds of talks with the government and the police, and also those who issued threats to break barricades.Trouble began on Tuesday after a section of protesters deviated from the routes agreed upon with the Delhi Police and began their tractor rally before scheduled time.“I have yet not received any intimation from the police regarding the FIR. This (FIR) is nothing new for us who have been part of many movements in the country in the past decades. Whenever their (the government) violence gets exposed, they hold non-violent people accountable for it. I believe that state-planted persons instigated the violence, while all the leaders of this farmers’ agitation have always remained peaceful and followed every conditions of the agreement we had with the police,” said Patkar, adding that she was with Yadav at the Shahjahanpur border during the violence that broke out in Delhi.Yadav said he could not comment on the development since he had not seen the FIR. Speaking to news agency PTI on Tuesday, Yadav said he was “ashamed of the way things proceeded” and took responsibility for it. He said “violence impacts any kind of protest in a wrong way, and that he “appealed continuously” so that farmers did not deviate from the routes agreed upon.Dharmendra Malik, a spokesperson for BKU-Tikait alleged that the government was “misusing” its powers by registering FIRs against farmers and farm leaders. “But we are not scared of the cases and our agitation against the three farm laws will continue peacefully,” he said.The FIR that mentioned their names also said “the protesters were riding on tractors, trollies, and even horses”, and that most of them were “carrying sticks, iron rods, and some of them were also carrying swords”. It added that the protesters “started rioting, causing injuries with swords and lathis and running the tractors over the police officials with the intent to kill”. It also mentioned that the protesters “robbed a pistol with 10 rounds and two gas guns” from police personnel.Another FIR mentioned Deep Sidhu and Lakha Sidhana.The 25-plus cases were registered between Tuesday and Wednesday at police stations across at least nine police districts, where violence erupted during the tractor rally.At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured as the Capital plunged into chaos and clashes broke out at the Red Fort, ITO and Ghazipur, among other places. A 25-year-old farmer died when his tractor overturned after crashing a police barricade near ITO.A majority of the cases were registered for rioting, causing hurt by dangerous weapons, and obstructing police from doing their duty, among other sections. Police also filed some of the cases under sections pertaining to criminal conspiracy, attempt to murder, and attempt to culpable homicide.In an FIR registered in connection with the ITO violence, police were probing protesters for allegedly destroying CCTVs on the road. A special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to investigate all the cases.In an FIR registered at the IP Estate police station for the ITO clashes, officials mentioned how nearly 10,000 protesters on tractors reached the key intersection, broke barricades using their tractors, and dismantled the central verge railing. It also mentioned the firing of tear gas shells by police, and a tractor driver “driving rashly and dangerously with intent to kill police personnel”. He died after his vehicle toppled outside the Andhra Education Society school. Police identified him as Navreet Singh from Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh.Addressing a press conference in the city, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava said farmer unions did not follow conditions set for the rally that was supposed to be held from 12pm to 5pm.“Police had many options but remained calm. We dealt with the situation in a proper way that is why no one was killed due to police action during the tractor rally violence,” the commissioner told reporters.“We are using the facial recognition system and taking the help of CCTV and video footage to identify the accused. Strict action will be taken against those identified. No culprit will be spared,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-register-25-cases-after-violence-on-republic-day-101611789005846.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||No one will be spared: Top cop||Delhi Police on Wednesday said “no one will be spared” for the violence during the tractor march organised by farm unions, accused them of “betrayal” by not sticking to the pre-decided routes, and said the force was taking a “serious view” of the hoisting of flags by protesters on the ramparts of Red Fort.Briefing the media at the Police headquarters, Delhi’s police commissioner SN Shrivastava said at least 25 cases have been registered, and multiple farm leaders would have to join the investigation. Among the leaders he named at the briefing were SS Pannu, Darshan Pal, Buta Singh Burjgil and Rakesh Tikait — for either giving provocative statements or actively veering from the prescribed routes.Shrivastava said that the police, on January 25, had an inkling that some “aggressive and militant people” taking control of the stage and giving provocative speeches at the protest sites. “…We understood their intent but still maintained restraint. We placed barricades but they started removing barricades right from the morning... The farmer leaders did not behave responsibly and stick to the terms and conditions on which they were given permission to hold the rally.”At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers sustained injuries during the clashes. One farmer died in the protests after his tractor overturned after ramming a police barricade at ITO.The police commissioner said sleuths were looking at videos of the violenceto identify the unruly protesters.Shrivastava said the police had first urged the farmers not to carry out the rally on Republic Day; they refused. He said that it was then suggested that they restrict the rally to the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway on the periphery of Delhi; they refused this as well. Finally, he said, three routes were decided on the conditions that the farm leaders would be present at the head of the respective groups to ensure order, and that no firearms, swords or deadly weapons would be carried. These conditions, he said, were all violated.Detailing the role of the farmer leaders, who flouted the conditions of the rally, he said, “The protesters at Singhu started the rally early at around 7.30 am. They were to take a right turn near Mukarba chowk but did not. Their leader Satnam Singh Pannu made provocative speeches after which farmers broke barricades. Another leader, Darshan Pal Singh, also reached there and sat down. His group also refused to go back…In Tikri, farmer leader Buta Singh Burjgil had started early(before noon) and accompanied protesters from Tikri border up to Nangloi T-point but instead of taking a right turn and returning, they removed barricades,” he said.Shrivastava said that in Ghazipur, Rakesh Tikait along with other farmer-leaders got protesters right up to Akshardham — a route not approved in the meeting — and indulged in violence.Pannu, Singh, and Burjgil were not available for comment despite several phone calls and text messages. Tikait, a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, said, “Farmers shouldn’t be flustered by the multiple FIRs registered by the police. They are not a problem. If there is a movement, there will be FIRs.”A police officer, requesting anonymity, said on Wednesday night, a notice was sent to Darshan Pal, asking him to give names of those who indulged in violence among the protesters and explain why action shouldn’t be taken against him.On questions if it was a police intelligence failure, Shrivastava said: “If we did not have intelligence, we would not have identified the 300 Twitter handles, that was fanning tension and mobilising people. Let me say that despite all the provocation, police maintained extreme restraint. We had all options but we choose restraint. We did this else there would have been loss of lives. Not a single bullet was fired by police anywhere.”In response to a question on the role of Punjab actor, Deep Sidhu, whose has been accused of leading the violent mob at Red Fort, Shrivastava said that police would probe the role of everyone and question them as per the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-one-will-be-spared-top-cop-101611788771673.html
28-01-2021||Budget||‘Hope govt fulfils dream of a respectable salary’: Sumitra Devi||Sumitra Devi has been an anganwadi worker in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj city for about three decades. In this time, the 50-year-old woman became somewhat of a multi-tasker. She kept records of dry ration for distribution to children and would-be mothers , counselled them on the importance of and ways to maintain personal hygiene and a balanced diet, managed distribution of food, and ensured that women and children in her area got adequate nutrition and primary health services.Covid-19 added more duties to her already full roster. She learnt how to check people’s temperature and symptoms, raised awareness about the virus and hygiene practices, distributed masks to migrant workers, and informed authorities about people with Covid-like symptoms.And, late last year, she even learnt to administer vaccination as part of the government’s plan to use anganwadi workers to inoculate the rural population.But for Devi, there was little material improvement in her life. “Only the colour of my uniform changed in these years,” she said.It was sky blue when the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was in power between 2007 and 2012, then became green when the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party assumed office in 2012 and changed to pink after the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in the 2017 elections.“My dream of getting respect and wages like a regular employee remained unfulfilled,” she added.A mother of five, Devi gets a fixed salary of ₹4,500 per month. Additionally, she gets ₹250 a month as performance-linked incentive if her supervisor and officials are impressed with her work. “This comes to ₹150 per day, less than even the wages of an unskilled worker,” she said.The pandemic upended her personal and professional life. “Suddenly, I had to learn about Covid-19 and ways to protect from it so that I could guide dozens of women and around 50 kids registered at my centre. Ration and food distribution became a challenge as we were instructed not to call women and kids to the centre,” she said.Instead, she went to their homes to counsel and distribute food packets.”My retired husband helped me manage the home and even in distribution work,” she added.Devi’s work also included implementing missions such as Anaemia Mukt Bharat, administering iron and folic acid supplements and vitamin-A supplements.Several states such as Odisha and Delhi provide additional money to anganwadi workers, taking the monthly allowance to up to ₹10,000 per month. The Centre provided ₹20,532 crore for Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), under which anganwadi centers come, for the financial year 2020-21, 3.5% percent more than the allocation in the previous financial year. Uttar Pradesh has roughly 375,000 anganwadi workers and helpers who work in 188,149 centres.For the Union budget, she wants the finance ministry to recognise the work done by anganwadi workers during Covid-19 to bolster the country’s health infrastructure, and provide them with regular salaries. She also seeks an increase in allocation for ICDS so that the infrastructure of anganwadi centers can improve.“I hope the new budget finally fulfils my dream of a respectable salary of ₹18,000 to ₹20,000 per month, acknowledging the importance of the work we do in ensuring health and well-being of would-be mothers and new born kids,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/hope-govt-fulfils-dream-of-a-respectable-salary-sumitra-devi-101611787967987.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||At Singhu protest site, a battle of two factions||Fresh barricades and restrictions by the police, heightened security arrangement by farmers, a determination to continue their agitation at the border, an all-pervading sense of distrust between two key factions, and grief over two horses killed allegedly during the tractor rally, marked the protest site at the Singhu border on Wednesday — a day after the farmers’ tractor rally unleashed widespread violence and vandalism in several parts of Delhi.Tuesday’s violence was the topic of discussion among most farmers at the venue, and the only subject of speeches delivered by their leaders from stages set up at the site.The larger Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and the smaller Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee (Punjab), two factions of farmers protesting here from separate stages, blamed each other for being involved in the violence. But their anger had two common targets — actor Deep Sidhu and activist Lakha Sidhana, whom both sides accused — one of leading the farmers to Red Fort, and the second for misleading the protesters.The SKM blamed both Sidhu and the KMSC for the violence. “The government joined hands with them to sabotage our movement...Sidhu insulted the national flag and hurt the sentiments of ours and the entire country,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal).“Deep Sidhu led away many farmers from the Outer Ring Road to the Red Fort. He felicitated the man who hoisted the flag from Red Fort. He was the cause of all the trouble,” said Savinder Singh Chautala, senior vice president of Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Committee (KMSC).Singhu is the most prominent location of the farmers protest sites. The rally took off from here before other sites; the first violence was initiated by farmers from here; and it was mostly protesters from the Singhu rally who stormed Red Fort.On Wednesday, most farmers said that while they regretted the violent turn of events, it would not deter them from continuing their agitation. “None of us who has been camping here for long is leaving. The only ones who went back are those who had joined us exclusively for the tractor rally. In fact, we have asked more farmers from our villages to join us,” said Chautala.Several farmers who were agitating at Singhu for two months had planned to return home for a few days after the rally, a plan that has now been postponed, said Dharmendar Singh, a volunteer and an SKM member. “We would be labelled as traitors and cowards if we returned without victory,” he said.ANGER AGAINST SIDHU AND SIDHANAOn Wednesday, Sidhu and Sidhana were the primary targets of the farmers’ ire.“Deep Sidhu Murdabad, Lakha Sidhana Murdabad,” rang chants from the SKM stage. Some groups took out marches shouting slogans in which they called Sidhu a “traitor”.The farmers accused the two of taking control of the SKM stage on Monday evening, and instigating farmers to march onto the Outer Ring Road rather than the pre-decided route. “From the stage, Sidhu asked the crowd what they wanted. The crowd said they wanted to go to Ring Road. He then instigated them to go right ahead,” alleged Dharmendar Singh, who claimed to have witnessed it.There was also a video purportedly showing Sidhu fleeing from the Singhu site on Wednesday. While several farmers claimed to have witnessed the scene, HT could not immediately authenticate the veracity of the visuals.Sidhu’s phone number was switched off when HT tried to reach him for response. Sidhana, told news agency PTI that he was not involved in the incidents at the Red Fort.But some of the farmers who actually stormed Red Fort said that their only aim was to hoist flags on the monument.“For two months we have been sitting here peacefully, but we were frustrated. We were determined to enter Delhi. But we did not begin the violence. When police began caning us, we fought back,” said Mandeep Singh, a farmer from JammuSECURITY INCREASED AMID DISTRUSTFarmers said they have increased the security to prevent any mischief mongers from taking to the stage. “Earlier we had two layers of security. Now, there are three,” said Dharmendar Singh.Volunteers on the SKM side took care to keep away KMSC-affiliated farmers away from their protest site. “We won’t allow without proper verification anyone who are not directly associated with us,” said Singh.At a press conference organised by SKM, Swaraj India founder Yogendra Yadav questioned why KMSC was allotted a separate space and stage by the police beyond the barricades, and blamed them for being hand in glove with the violators.The police, too, set up fresh barricades at the site and barricaded the entrance to the Singhu village, which was used by motorists to enter Haryana.“The violence has changed the situation. The trust factor is lost,” said a police officer about the change in police’s attitude.While farmers spoke about many of them being injured in the violence, they also grieved the deaths of two horses who were killed, allegedly on Tuesday. “One horse was killed by tear gas at the first point of conflict. The other horse which belonged to me was killed by police’s gunshot inside Red Fort,” said Daman Singh, a Nihang Sikh, while loading his dead horse on a tractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-singhu-protest-site-a-battle-of-two-factions-101611782254385.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||A wall of security around Red Fort as dust of violence settles||Additional troops were called in and more barricades were put up near the Red Fort, a Unesco World Heritage site, on Wednesday, a day after protesters barged into the monument, damaging property and hoisting the Nishan Sahib flag on the ramparts of the fort, officials aware of the development said.Union tourism and culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel visited the fort on Wednesday along with the director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) — the agency responsible for the upkeep of the monument. “Visited the Red Fort this morning with the culture secretary and director general, ASI, and directed them to submit a report and get an FIR registered under the relevant sections,” Patel tweeted in Hindi.In an order issued on Wednesday, the ASI said the fort will stay closed till January 31 for the public and general visitors.On Tuesday, several groups among thousands of farmers who were camping at Delhi’s border demanding withdrawal of three new farm laws, arrived at the Red Fort without warning and in violation of the terms of their tractor rally, and clashed with police.Officials said the protesters inflicted extensive damage at the monument -- at least three finials placed atop the rampart domes went missing, the ticket counter was vandalised and window panes were shattered, toilets were broken, air conditioners were damaged, entrance to the fort was defaced, the stone boards were uprooted, staff rooms were vandalised, railings and stairs were defaced, a police van was smashed and toppled and CCTV cameras installed within the fort were crushed.The farmers stayed at the monument till late evening before returning to the respective protest sites on the city’s peripheries.Early Wednesday morning, the police blocked the entries to the fort with police buses and fresh barricades and additional paramilitary forces which included personnel from the Central Reserve Police (CRP), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Delhi Police were deployed at the monument. Police have also stationed water cannons within the fort’s premises, officials aware of the development said.Senior Delhi Police officers also inspected the fort to review the security status. A senior ASI official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media, said since the ticket counters and other areas have been completely damaged, the reopening of the monument will take time. The Red Fort is secured by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).Security personnel who were present inside the fort at the time of clashes said at least 1,000-1,500 protesters were present inside the fort on Tuesday. The first group of farmers arrived at the main of the Red Fort around 1pm and broke it open using axes and other metal tools that they were carrying, the officers said, requesting anonymity.They said, as the doors were forced open, hundreds others barged in, outnumbering the security personnel present inside the monument, and climbed atop the fort hoisting their flags on the ramparts.A senior CISF officer, who wished not to be named, said the first group of men entered the fort between 1pm and 1.15 pm. “Usually there are 40-50 armed CISF personnel are deployed inside the fort. On Tuesday, because the security had been intensified due to the Republic Day, 100 personnel were present there. Our men were outnumbered by the protesters,” the officer said.At least three CISF personnel were injured trying to stop the mob from trespassing the highly secured monument.CISF’s deputy inspector general (operations) Anil Pandey said 40 additional personnel were deployed at the fort on Wednesday. “Our 31 companies are attached with the Delhi Police for law and order support duties for more than past one month due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation and because of the Republic Day. These companies were deployed at various locations in national capital by the Delhi Police including the Red Fort,” Pandey said.The DIG said a unit of 280 CISF personnel remains deployed at Red Fort throughout the year. “At a given time, 40-50 men are deployed inside the fort at various duty posts in one shift,” he said.(With inputs fro Deeksha Bhardwaj)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-wall-of-security-around-red-fort-as-dust-of-violence-settles-101611779272827.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Conspiracy to kill slain Matka king’s widow: Arrested accused turns approver||Rambeer Naresh Kumar Sharma alias Pandit who has been arrested by the Mumbai Police’s crime branch in connection with the alleged conspiracy to eliminate Jaya Bhagat, widow of slain Matka king Suresh Bhagat, and her sister Asha Bhatt, has turned an approver in the case. A police officer said his statement was recorded under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before a metropolitan magistrate on Monday.Pandit, a native of Madhya Pradesh, had got a contract through his associate Basheer Suleman Begani alias Mamu to kill both the sisters. Begani, who was roped in by Bhagat’s brother-in-law Vinod, is wanted in the case and is believed to be in Manchester City in England. The crime branch have issued a look-out circular (LOC) for his arrest.“LOC has been issued against Begani. So, whenever he visits any airport, ports and road borders in India, immigration authorities will alert us about his presence,” said inspector Nandkumar Gopale of unit 9 of crime branch.The unit has arrested five of the alleged perpetrators before the gang could kill Bhagat and her sister in December last year. The arrested accused are Mohammed Anwar Sabbir Darji, 31; Mohammad Javed Islamuddin Ansari, 41; Maqsood Maqbool Qureshi, 35; Rambeer Naresh Kumar Sharma alias Pandit, 39; and Vinod Bhagat.Vinod is the brother of slain Matka king Suresh Bhagat who was killed in a road accident on Alibag-Pen road in 2008. Later it was found that the road accident was a pre-planned murder orchestrated by his wife Jaya and son Hitesh.As per the crime branch’s probe, the family members were fighting to get hold on the Matka business. Besides, Vinod also wanted to take revenge of his brother’s murder. He had allegedly given ₹60 lakh contract to his friend Begani, who had then purportedly contacted Sharma and paid ₹14 lakh in advance to arrange shooters and eliminate Jaya and her sister, said police officers. Sharma had in turn engaged Darji, Ansari, and Qureshi to execute the plan. The trio accordingly came to Mumbai in October 2020 and conducted recce and discreetly recorded videos and clicked photographs of Jaya and her sister. The trio then left for their hometown in October.Qureshi, the shooter, was allegedly set to kill the sisters at the wedding of Asha’s son on December 10 last year, added Gopale. Darji and Ansari came to Mumbai on December 6 while Qureshi was supposed to come before December 10. However, as Qureshi could not come in time, the gang had to postpone the plan, said crime branch officials. Meanwhile, police got a tip-off about the conspiracy and arrested Darji on December 18 and recovered two pistols and six live cartridges from him. Police also found he had pictures of Jaya and Asha in his mobile phone. Ansari had initially managed to flee from Mumbai but after interrogation of Darji, both Ansari and Qureshi were arrested on December 21 from Bijnor.During interrogation, Vinod’s name cropped up following which he was arrested on December 21. Another team in Bijnor arrested Sharma who in turn named Begani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conspiracy-to-kill-slain-matka-king-s-widow-arrested-accused-turns-approver-101611777244661.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Mixed response as schools in Maharashtra reopen for Class 5 to 8||Schools in various parts of Maharashtra reopened for Class 5 to 8 with a mixed response on Wednesday. While some schools saw a good turnout of students, in some others, parents were still not willing to send their children to school due to Covid-19 pandemic and related risks. “While parents do want schools to reopen, there is a lot of fear among them while signing the undertaking forms as mandated by the state education department. On the first day, we only had 10-15 students in every class consisting 40-50 students,” said Balasaheb Chavan, teacher at KL Ponda High School in Dahanu, Palghar. As schools for Class 5 to 8 reopened after a gap of 10 months, the students spent the first day getting accustomed to the safety protocols. “We had given masks and sanitisers to all students and had asked them to wear their masks at all times. Since the children came out of their homes for a long period for the first time, they were struggling to keep the mask on due to discomfort. We helped them in all ways possible and are hoping that they get accustomed soon,” said Somnath Walke, a teacher from a zilla parishad school in Pargaon, Beed. The school saw nearly 80% of the children attend the school on Day 1. According to the standard operating procedures laid down by the education department, 50% students are asked to attend school on a rotational basis.At Karad Municipal School in Satara, all the 500 enrolled children attended the school on the first day. “The school has divided each division into two groups of 25 each,” said Arjun Koli, principal of the school. Children were greeted with a rose to mark the first day of reopening.The state education department is yet to share data on the total number of schools which reopened on Wednesday. There are over 106,000 schools with Class 5 to 8 in the state with nearly 8,000,000 students enrolled as per the data of the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), 2019. Barring Mumbai, schools in most parts of the state reopened on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the state education department opened helplines for free counselling of Class 10 and 12 students on Wednesday. Students can go to maa.ac.in and access a list of 426 counsellors who will be available to solve their doubts and hear their concerns.Parents to stage protest on Jan 30Parents of students from several private schools across Maharashtra have planned to protest against the state government on January 30 over their demands which are pending from the past several months. The demands include action against schools for increasing fees or harassing children for non-payment of fees.State representatives of the Indiawide Parents’ Association, a pan-India body of parents, have planned a demonstration outside education minister Varsha Gaikwad’s office. “Parents are really angry as none of their demands are met. While schools have hiked fees in the middle of a pandemic, the education department has not acted against them. Many schools are harassing children whose parents are unable to pay,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the association. The association recently wrote to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) against the state government’s failure to act against private schools. Parents said that despite complaints, the department has not audited a single school during these months. “We do not know what the entire machinery is up to. Parents are in a really vulnerable state and this government is facilitating private schools by not acting against them,” said the parent of a student of a Kandivli-based school.A government resolution (GR) released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The petitioners had argued that the government cannot regulate fees of private schools as per the current rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mixed-response-as-schools-in-maharashtra-reopen-for-class-5-to-8-101611777243144.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai colleges gear up for reopening, await clarity from govt||Even as schools in the state have already started welcoming students back on campus for physical classes, colleges are still waiting for hear from the state government on the matter. With the ministry for higher and technical education as well as state universities still mum on this matter, several city colleges have come up with their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed to ensure regular sanitisation as well as social distancing norms are maintained in order to avoid any untoward circumstances. “We have decided to first bring in students who need practical sessions, both in junior as well as degree colleges. Instead of calling students three times a week, we might end up calling one batch only once a week only for practical lecture purposes and ensure they attend class for one full day instead of calling them three times a week,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, Churchgate. She added that all students will be made aware of social distancing norms in advance and that the college will insist on use of masks and sanitisers. “We will also encourage students to bring lunch from home because our canteen will remain shut to avoid large gatherings. Students will also be informed to maintain social distancing even outside classrooms,” she said. Earlier this month, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant had said that the future course of action for higher education institutes will be shared soon, and colleges were touted to reopen by January 28. However, there is no word from the government on this matter yet and for the time being, social distancing, compulsion on masks and cleanliness around the campus will be the priority for most colleges.At Matunga’s GN Khalsa College, the authorities are hoping that the flexibility of inviting students to college should be left to the head of the institute. “Depending on the total strength of the college, the principal and management should have the authority to decide how many students should be invited to college on a daily basis. This will help ensure that only those students who need to be in college for practical lectures are invited while the rest continue online classes,” said Kiran Mangaonkar, principal. A total of 5,500 students currently study in the degree college of the institute. Some colleges also plan to continue online classes along with physical classes, even after reopening of colleges. “Since some of our students are still attending classes from their hometowns, we will continue classes online for them. Also, students cannot be forced to attend physical lectures against their will, so such students too will be given the choice of attending online classes,” said Bagla and added that the same benefit will also be extended towards senior staff members keeping their safety in mind. While most institutes already have a sanitisation programme in place, some are worried about the expenses that will be incurred by institutes once students start attending regular lectures. “We have 4,000 students plus staff to cater to, and even if only 50% of them are on campus, sanitising each and every class and ensuring sanitisers for all students and staff will be a huge cost. The government should look into offering some financial aid to colleges, especially those with large number of students,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-colleges-gear-up-for-reopening-await-clarity-from-govt-101611777063229.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||NIA supports plan to shift P Varavara Rao to Mumbai’s Sir JJ Hospital||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday supported a proposal by the state government to shift 82-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, to the prison ward of Sir JJ Hospital and opposed the petition filed by Rao’s wife P Hemlatha seeking bail for him on medical grounds. In her petition, Hemlatha had pointed out that a previous Nanavati Hospital report said that Rao was fit to be discharged and could take care of himself.Rao’s counsel submitted that shifting Rao to Sir JJ Hospital could result in a relapse, and hence the option was to either send him to Taloja jail or his house in Hyderabad. The court sought a fresh report from Nanavati Hospital and will hear the state’s arguments opposing the petition on Thursday. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA, that there was no doubt that Rao had recovered and was fit to be discharged from Nanavati Hospital, and the same had been confirmed by the counsels of Rao who had expressed their satisfaction at his improved medical condition. Singh added that in light of the apprehensions of Rao’s family that he would have a relapse if shifted to Taloja jail, NIA agreed with the state’s proposal to shift Rao to the prison ward of Sir JJ Hospital. When asked by the court whether Rao had dementia, Singh referred to the January 12 report of Nanavati Hospital and previous medical reports and said that none of the reports mentioned it. In response to the court query on the condition of brain atrophy, which was mentioned in one of Rao’s medical reports, senior counsel Anand Grover said that research reports available online suggested that it could lead to dementia. Singh, however, opposed the submission and said that it was just a presumption and could not be relied upon. He then referred to the last medical report and said that the 20 medicines which Rao was being administered daily were age-related and could be given to Rao even in the prison ward of Sir JJ Hospital. Grover then submitted that hospitals were a hotbed of infections, and if Rao was shifted to Sir JJ Hospital, there was every chance of his health getting affected adversely. He submitted that the only option was to send Rao to Taloja jail or back home. He added that Rao had complained of chest pain after the last medical report was submitted by Nanavati Hospital. After hearing about the chest pain, the bench sought a fresh report from Nanavati Hospital and posted hearing for Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/niasupports-plan-to-shift-p-varavara-rao-to-mumbai-s-sir-jj-hospital-101611777002877.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Violence at tractor rally: Actor Deep Sidhu, gangster Lakhan Sidhana named in FIR||Actor Deep Sidhu and gangster Lakhan Sidhana have been named by the Delhi Police in an FIR for the violent clashes during the tractor parade in Delhi on January 26.A video of Sidhu directing the mob at Red Fort has been circulating on social media. He released video on Tuesday night saying he was involved in the flag-hoisting, but meant no disrespect. He also said that he alone could not have instigated thousands of protesters.Farmers’ union representatives and opposition parties have condemned the act of hoisting religious flags by a mob on the Red Fort during the occasion of Republic Day. Farmers’ union representatives also chose to distance themselves from actor Deep Sidhu and his participation in Tuesday afternoon’s violence.Hannan Mollah, farmer leader from the All India Kisan Sabha and a member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that Sidhu’s acts indicate that there were elements who wanted to sabotage the protest. Actor Deep Sidhu campaigned for BJP candidate Sunny Deol when fought from the Gurdaspur constituency in Punjab. The actor-turned-politician too has distanced himself from Sidhu's actions at the Red Fort during the tractor rally. The BJP lawmaker tweeted on Tuesday that he was saddened by the scenes of violence during the tractor rally and also pointed out that in an earlier tweet on December 6 he had clarified that he and his family members do not have any connection with Deep Sidhu.He said, “Through a tweet, on December 6 [2020], I have already made it clear that I or my family has no link with Deep Sidhu.” Deol had earlier in December said that Sidhu campaigned for him in 2019 but ‘is now being driven by his own agenda.’A tractor rally organised by farmers’ unions representatives protesting against the newly passed farm laws turned violent which left nearly 400 police personnel injured as protesters deviated from the course, clashed with police personnel and stormed iconic Red Fort and hoisted religious flags.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/violence-at-tractor-rally-actor-deep-sidhu-gangster-sidhana-named-in-fir-101611776117044.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Mission Vidarbha: Uddhav Thackeray looks to increase Sena’s base||In a bid to expand the Shiv Sena’s footprint in Vidarbha, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has turned his focus on development of the region in eastern Maharashtra, where, traditionally, his party has been weak. In the past two months, Thackeray has made four visits to districts in Vidarbha to take stock of various government events and even to inaugurate some. Thackeray, during the inauguration of a zoological park in Nagpur on Tuesday, said that “Vidarbha’s blood runs through [his] veins”. Since December, Thackeray visited Amravati district to oversee the progress on the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi project. On January 4, he virtually inaugurated the legislative secretariat office in Nagpur. On January 8, Thackeray visited Nagpur, Bhandara and Chandrapur districts in the region to see the Gosikhurd irrigation project and a highway crossing project in Ghodsari, Chandrapur district. “My grandmother was from Paratwadi [in Amravati district]. No one should try to teach us love for Vidarbha. We have a blood relation with Vidarbha,” Thackeray said, adding he will do whatever is needed for Nagpur. In an apparent jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the CM said: “Some people are spreading misinformation about us [Shiv Sena], and this [campaign] will end now. Projects like Surajgad [in Gadchiroli] can change the face of the entire Vidarbha. I want to pave the way for the development of Vidarbha.” Vidarbha region has 62 Assembly seats and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies. Traditionally, a large chunk of the Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies from the region went to the BJP, in the alliance between the Sena and BJP, leading to stunted growth of the Sena in Vidarbha. Both the BJP as well as the Congress have strong presence in the region, while the Shiv Sena and the NCP have not managed to make inroads beyond a few pockets. Post the realignment of political alliances in the state, the Sena is looking to fortify its presence in the region that could help increase its numbers in the elections. “It is not that we do not have our organisation, workers and leaders in Vidarbha. But we never could convert it in electoral terms. Now that Uddhav ji is the chief minister, we can personally steer the development in the region that has been neglected by successive governments,” the senior functionary said, requesting anonymity. The BJP’s hold on the region is weakening over the period now. In 2014, the BJP won 44 seats in the region, which decreased to 29 in the 2019 elections. The Shiv Sena, which had won four seats against the BJP in 2014, managed to retain them in the 2019 elections that was contested in an alliance. Prahar Janashakti Party of Bacchu Kadu, which won two seats – Achalpur and Melghat in Amravati district – has increased the strength of the Sena in the region. A senior leader from Vidarbha said that with the BJP losing grip in the region, it would benefit the Shiv Sena and not just the Congress. The BJP lost its citadel in Nagpur to the Congress in MLC graduates’ election held in December 2020. Subsequently, the Sena performed better than expected in Vidarbha’s Nagpur district in the recently held gram panchayat election. The party claims to have won at least 10 gram panchayats in the rural areas of the Nagpur district. “When Uddhav ji spoke about developing Vidarbha, he spoke as the chief minister of Maharashtra, not as Shiv Sena president. With him being the CM and the weakening of the BJP, this would be the right time to build the party to gain electorally here. The Shiv Sena can be the alternative that people want,” the leader from Vidarbha said, requesting anonymity. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the Sena can win mass base in the region by giving more industries, jobs and alleviating farmers’ distress in the region. He added that principally, the Sena has always been against carving out Vidarbha. “Since the beginning, the Sena’s electoral footprint was Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and later Marathwada. At that time, the Congress had a sizeable influence in Vidarbha. The BJP entered late but still managed to gain a foothold. Now, if the Sena wants to gain mass base, it will have to give more economic packages to Vidarbha, create agro-industries, develop tourism and resolve farmers’ issues. Vidarbha, like Marathwada, records farmers’ suicides each year. If Uddhav Thackeray government can touch these points, it will dilute the feeling of discrimination that the people of the region have and they can gain electorally,” Jondhale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mission-vidarbha-uddhav-thackeray-looks-to-increase-sena-s-base-101611776883175.html

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body spent only 48% of allocated budget on development work||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gets ready to present its 2021-22 budget in February, it has only spent 48% of the budget allocated previous year for development works, including roads, bridges, storm water drainage, gardens, etc. Of the ₹33,441.02-crore overall budget for 2020-21, ₹11,764 crore was allocated for capital expenditure, but the BMC spent ₹5,744 crore until December 31, 2020. The number is still closer to ₹5,600 crore (45%) of the capital expenditure in 2019-20, as of December 2019. On the other hand, the revenue income of the BMC in 2020-2021 dipped – ₹11,616 crore against the target of ₹28,448 crore, which means 40% of the target, as of December 2020 – owing to poor collection of property tax, water supply tax and income from real estate premiums coming down owing to lockdown. In 2019-2020, as of December 2019, the BMC’s revenue income stood at ₹14,828 crore against the target of ₹24,983 crore, which was 59% of the total target. The BMC had in February 2020 presented a ₹33,441-crore budget for 2020-21, exceeding the 2019-20 budget of ₹30,692 crore. In any given fiscal, the civic body uses 60-70% of the capital expenditure budgetary allocation. The capital expenditure is around 30-40% of the total budget expenditure planned for several crucial departments such as roads and traffic, bridges, garden, health, hydraulics, development plan, storm water drains, solid waste management etc. Till December 2020, the BMC has spent around 63% of the amount allocated for road, traffic and bridges department, 79% of the funds allocated for the coastal road project, 34% for water supply department, 33% of health budget, excluding Covid-19 related expenditure. For Covid-19, the BMC spent around ₹1,800 crore from the contingency fund and will restructure the budget for the ongoing fiscal. In case of the storm water drainage department, the BMC spent 44% of the total allocation, solid waste management department spent 21%, sewage disposal 28%, information technology 31% and fire brigade and disaster management department 15%. The civic body has seen major fall in collection of property tax, water bills and premiums from the real estate sector owing to lockdown. In terms of income from different sources, BMC managed to collect ₹734 crore in property tax in the ongoing fiscal as of December 2020, compared to ₹1,810 crore as of December 2019 in the 2019-2020 fiscal. The income from real estate premiums fell to ₹708 crore as of December 2020, compared to ₹2,067 crore as of December 2019. The BMC also witnessed a substantial fall in income from water tax and income via investments or interests. The BMC has around ₹76,000 crore in fixed deposits, as of November 2020, and the ratio of fixed deposits has been going down. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “Our capital expenditure is as good as last year, and all work has taken off post-monsoon. Though we had lockdown, there are several expenditures that we have to make, and even during lockdown, certain works were ongoing. If we exclude the ₹1,800 crore we spent on Covid-19, our expenditure for other departments and projects has not suffered at all.” Velrasu added, “However, for some departments, the expenditure is less, for example, hospital buildings and Mumbai Fire Brigade. It is because of the nature of these departments. We are taking every step to improve the finances of the BMC through revenue income, revenue expenditure and capital expenditure. We are also looking to raise money for projects by issuing municipal bonds. The plan is at a primary stage, and we are working on the details.” Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC, said, “The BMC’s revenue has been falling constantly, its income from property tax and premiums from builders has also gone down. On the other hand, the BMC has spent over ₹1,600 crore on Covid-19. I have written to the BMC regarding coming out with a white paper on the BMC’s financial condition. The administration has to clarify how they plan to keep the finances of the BMC in a good position.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-spent-only-48-of-allocated-budget-on-development-work-101611776643799.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Declare disputed border areas of Karnataka as UT, says Maharashtra CM||While raking up the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute row, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday demanded that the Centre declare the disputed border areas in Karnataka as Union Territory (UT) till the Supreme Court’s verdict on the dispute is announced. The CM said that it was a “now or never” battle for Maharashtra and that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was committed to resolve it by inclusion of the disputed areas in the state.Since the formation of Maharashtra, the two neighbouring states have been in a dispute over Belgaum and other areas where Marathi speaking people reside in large numbers. Maharashtra has staked claim on these areas and the issue pending with the Apex court. While Maharashtra and the Marathi-speaking people in the disputed border areas have been peacefully fighting the battle, the Karnataka government has been suppressing their voice with arrogance, Thackeray said on Wednesday while speaking at Sahyadri guest house after release of a Marathi book — Maharashtra Karnataka Simawad : Sangharsh Ani Sankalp (Maharashtra-Karnataka Border Dispute : Struggle and Resolve). Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, state ministers Chhagan Bhujbal, Eknath Shinde, leader of Opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar shared the dais. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis did not attend the function. “When the issue is pending in the Apex court, the Karnataka government changed the name of Belgaum, set up their second capital there, and held legislative sessions. The Marathi-speaking mayor was booked under sedition charges for taking pro-Marathi stand. This is nothing but the oppression of Marathi-speaking citizens in the border areas. This leads to the contempt of court. There is a need to declare the disputed areas as Union Territory to restrain the Karnataka government from unilateral action,” Thackeray said. The CM said that the oppression continues irrespective of which political party rules Karnataka.Karnataka water resources minister Ramesh Jarkiholi on Wednesday said that Thackeray was raking up the issue to deflect attention from the poor performance of his government. He said that people in Karnataka have not discriminated against anyone and that no importance should be given to the CM’s statements. “The CM has failed in all aspects and he is using this border issue to emotionally sway people to deflect their attention. No importance should be given to this,” Jarkiholi, who is also the district in-charge minister of Belgaum, said. NCP chief Sharad Pawar said the petition pending in the Apex court was the last resort for Maharashtra to bring the disputed areas of Belgaum, Karwar and Nipani in Maharashtra. He said that a certain section of political leadership in Karnataka has created a picture that Maharashtra was adamant over its stand despite Mahajan Commission’s report against it. Pawar said the misconceptions needed to be weeded out to make the ground favourable for the battle. Meanwhile, Darekar said it was a battle being fought for the Marathi-speaking people and should be looked up beyond politics.Later in the day, Thackeray chaired a meeting of state government’s high-power committee constituted to take state’s legal battle on the issue forward. Thackeray directed the committee to ensure that the legal battle was expedited. “We will lead an all-party delegation to the Centre on the issue to ensure inclusion of Belgaum, Karwar, Nipani in Maharashtra at the earliest. The Centre should act neutrally as it is a dispute between two states. Marathi-speaking people from the disputed areas, too, should do away with their differences and fight the battle unitedly,” he said.Advocate Shivaji Jadhav, who represents Maharashtra government in the case and attended the meeting, said that besides appointing senior counsel, the state has decided to make a representation to the Centre with request to fairly represent them in the Apex court. “It has been experienced that the Centre is sympathetic towards Karnataka during the hearing in the Apex court. The state government has decided to meet Centre for fair representation,” he said.Talking about the status of the case, Jadhav said, “Karnataka has filed an application questioning maintainability of the suit claiming that only parliament has the right to decide demarcation of borders as per article 3. The commission appointed in September 2014 for evidence recording cannot hold hearing until the ruling on suit is given by the top court.”Political analyst Prakash Akolkar said raking up the issue again is a political gimmick by the ruling parties ahead of Mumbai civic elections. “Border dispute is a dead issue and nothing is going to happen in it. Had parties like the BJP and Congress been firm to include the disputed areas in Maharashtra, they would have done it during their tenure when their governments were in power in both the states and the Centre. The Shiv Sena and NCP are trying to undrape the issue again to stir up Marathi pride card for political gain,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/declare-disputed-border-areas-of-karnataka-as-ut-says-maharashtra-cm-101611776642720.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra leaders take potshots at Centre; launch scheme for farmers||Ministers of the state’s ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government took potshots at the Centre’s farm laws whilst unveiling a new policy for agricultural pumps and declaring an amnesty scheme for farmers to clear outstanding power bills.While talking about the policy, state public works department (PWD) minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan said, “Today, there are protests in the country because of the wrong decisions taken for farmers. However, the Maharashtra government has brought out a good policy that will benefit lakhs of farmers.”State energy minister Nitin Raut also criticised the Centre’s laws. “At a time when the Centre is forcing laws on the farmers, we are bringing light to their lives with these policies,” he said.The state on Wednesday launched the new policy through which farmers will be provided uninterrupted power supply. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “The biggest demand from farmers through the years has been that they need power supply through the day.” However, he also requested for farmers to pay their pending bills. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also instructed the energy department to be stricter with the implementation of the policy. “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s wrongdoings have resulted in the power arrears ballooning in the state,” Pawar said.According to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL), the arrears from farmers for electricity bills for agricultural pumps now amounts to ₹45,559 crore. There are 44.38 lakh farmers utilising power to run agricultural pumps in the state. Among various options, farmers will get a 50% waiver if they clear their pending amount within a year. They will also be given three years to clear their bills. Of the recovered amount, as much as 33% will be reserved for the concerned gram panchayat to improve the infrastructure of the local power network, and another 33% will be reserved for the district concerned, for the same purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-leaders-take-potshots-at-centre-launch-scheme-for-farmers-101611776462674.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Padma awards row: MVA unhappy with less awards to Maharashtra||Leaders of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Tuesday expressed their discontent over the number of Padma awardees from Maharashtra. Rajya Sabha MP and Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut told reporters that Maharashtra should have got “at least 10-12 awards” and it was “surprising” that the Central government announced only six awards for the state.“Maharashtra is such a huge state. Its contribution towards the country is so huge. Even the Covid-19 vaccine for the country is being manufactured here. Not only me, many people were surprised that the state received only six awards,” he told reporters on Tuesday.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “The state had suggested 99 names to the Centre, of which only one name was considered. The state committee had recommended Sindhutai Sapkal’s name for Padma Bhushan, but she received Padma Shri. It is unfortunate that the state’s recommendations were not given any importance.” He even alleged that one of the criteria for the awards seems to be inclination towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). A senior official from the state’s protocol department, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Maharashtra suggested 99 names for the awards, of which only one was accepted. Every year, almost 10% of the awardees are from Maharashtra, which dropped to 5% this year.”The Central government announced a total of 119 Padma awards this year which includes seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri awards. While no Padma Vibhushan was bestowed on a Maharashtrian this year, Rajnikant Shroff, the founder of leading chemical company United Phosphorus Limited received Padma Bhushan.Padma Shri awards were bestowed on Namdeo C Kamble, Parshuram Atmaram Gangavane, Jaswantiben Jamnadas Popat, Girish Prabhine and Sindhutai Sapkal.BJP leader Pravin Darekar, leader of opposition at Maharashtra legislative council, said, “The awards are bestowed by following a process and it is based on merit. It is not like it is distributed among states. MVA only seems to be angry because their recommendations were not taken in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/padma-awards-row-mva-unhappy-with-less-awards-to-maharashtra-101611776402610.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress wants cases against Arnab Goswami in all police stations||Maharashtra Congress demanded for the arrest of Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami by registering cases for sedition for leak of sensitive information related to national security through WhatsApp chat. The party also demanded that cases be registered against him in all police stations across the city under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act and National Security Act.Party general secretary Sachin Sawant and Mumbai Mahila Congress chief Ajanta Yadav handed over a letter to Samta Nagar police station demanding a case against Goswami. “It is very important to investigate the source of the information which was related to national security. The act of the leak of such information is an act of treason and serious cognisance needs to be taken,” the letter stated.Sawant said it needs to be investigated as to who gave Goswami the information related to Balakot airstrike.Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap and working president Charan Singh Sapra met Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on Wednesday and demanded cases against the journalist in all police stations. The party has submitted their complaints in 94 police stations across the city. “There was financial deal between Arnab Goswami and Broadcast Audience Research Council’s former CEO Partho Dasgupta, who has admitted to such transactions. The leak of the information is a serious breach of national secrets. Goswami should be booked immediately under National Security Act, 1980 and Official Secrets Act, 1923. We have been assured by the police commissioner that appropriate action will be taken,” said Jagtap.Republic TV spokesperson said, “It is quite clear that the conspiracy against us is totally political. Political parties are leading this protest. Political parties that do not agree with our coverage are targeting us. As a news media organisation, we understand the political intent behind this, and are determined to fight it with our head held high.”In a statement last week, Goswami had said, “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime.” On January 25, Republic Media Network’s statement stated, “Spin doctoring and false attribution of statements made by third parties to Mr Goswami has become the norm in an attempt to create prejudice is deeply conspirational. Mr Goswami has not made any of the statements which are being attributed to him by political parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-wants-cases-against-arnab-goswami-in-all-police-stations-101611776283544.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Not unjust to refuse books to Elgar Parishad case accused: Court||A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court recently disposed of an application filed by Gautam Navlakha and Hany Babu, both arrested in the Elgar Parishad case, for books in prison, saying that it was within the power of the jail to allow articles to undertrial prisoners.Babu and Navlakha, lodged in Taloja prison, had approached the court on December 29, 2020, through their lawyers Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Chandni Chawla, claiming that they were denied access to newspapers and were not allowed to get books sent by their families and friends through courier. The two, in their separate pleas, had claimed that the parcels containing books were returned by the prison authority.The court in its detailed order released on January 26, observed: “The prison authority is supposed to take care of the security of the prison. Therefore, I do think that the prison authority has committed any unjust act by refusing the parcel.” The court also said that it would not be just to (sic) pass any order as it would be within the province of the jail authority to accept articles for the undertrial prisoners if attempted to be delivered by their relatives or near ones.The special court said that family members and near ones may approach the prison authority to deliver books.Earlier, on January 12, the same court had allowed access to books from outside the prison, to activist and lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, another accused in the case.During the hearing, Babu’s wife professor Jenny Rowena and Navlakha’s friend Dr Shrimoyee Ghosh had filed an affidavit before the court claiming their parcels containing books were returned. Rowena claimed in the affidavit that she had sent parcels to her husband between September 15 and September 22, containing three books — Sea of Poppies, A Man Called Ove and Last Train to Istanbul.“A week later, the parcel containing the books was returned with an endorsement in Marathi of ‘Covid Suraksha’,” she had said.Similarly, Dr Ghosh had sent a parcel in August to the activist, containing the books The World of Jeeves by PG Wodehouse and Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States by James C Scott. Gosh claimed that the books were returned with a remark stating that they were not accepted for security reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/not-unjust-to-refuse-books-to-elgar-parishad-case-accusedcourt-101611776282304.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor held in connection with ₹200-crore loan to HDIL group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday arrested Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor in connection with a money laundering case pertaining to the sanction of a loan of ₹200 crore to Mack Star Marketing Private Limited, owned by Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan.HDIL’s promoters are accused of unlawfully availing loans from Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank and defrauding it of ₹6,670 crore.Sources said this is the third money laundering case involving Kapoor which ED is probing. Kapoor was produced in a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court and remanded in ED’s custody till January 30. ED sources said that during Kapoor’s tenure, Yes Bank sanctioned loans to Mack Star Marketing in an unruly manner. HDIL then utilised this money to clear other loans it had taken from Yes Bank, to ensure that it was not declared as a defaulter. ED suspects that Kapoor was fully aware of the illegal activity and wish to interrogate him regarding the same. Hence, he has been arrested again.In the same case, the central anti-money laundering agency had last week arrested Mehul Thakur, managing director of realty firm Viva Group, owned by the Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA) chief Hitendra Thakur’s family. BVA is a supporter of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Earlier, ED had stated that the Wadhawans and others allegedly diverted ₹200 crore sanctioned by Yes Bank to Mack Star Marketing Pvt Ltd. This loan was allegedly siphoned off by the Wadhawans by showing a fictitious purpose. The Wadhawans illegally transferred two commercial properties, of Mack Star, valued at ₹34.36 crore, in Kaledonia building, Andheri (East), to Viva Holding, a company of Viva Group. In the sale agreement, the purchase amount was shown to be paid via 37 cheques by Viva Holding to Mack Star Marketing Pvt. The investigation has revealed that these cheques were never encashed by Mack Star, and Viva Holding never made payments for the purchase of the said properties. The Wadhawans had illegally transferred these properties to Viva Group in violation of the article of association of Mack Star. Further, Viva Holding never showed these properties in its balance sheets. Kapoor was previously arrested by ED in March 2020 for allegedly wrongfully sanctioning loans to various companies in lieu of kickbacks. Since then he has been in Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. Recently, the Bombay high court (HC) also rejected Kapoor’s bail application in a loan fraud case. Kapoor, his wife and their three daughters are also accused in the case, and it was alleged that the family received ₹600 crore as kickbacks for unlawfully sanctioning loans from Yes Bank. Yes Bank had illegally sanctioned huge loans to various high profile borrowers, which later defaulted in repayments. Some of the defaulters include global tour company Cox & Kings and Dewan House Finance Ltd (DHFL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-held-in-connection-with-200-crore-loan-to-hdil-group-101611776042556.html
28-01-2021||Delhi||Infiltrators defamed our stir: Farmers at Tikri site||A day after clashes broke out between the police and groups of farmers from the Tikri border during a planned tractor parade that took a violent turn, agitators at the protest site insisted that those who indulged in the incident were “infiltrators” sent to “defame and derail” their movement against three contentious new farm laws.On Tuesday, a group of farmers who started the tractor march from the Tikri border broke police barricades to veer away from the agreed-upon route between the farm unions and Delhi Police. The police resorted to a lathi charge and fired tear gas shells to stop the farmers, but sporadic clashes and stand-offs continued between them till late evening at Nangloi Chowk.Hundreds of tractors managed to break the barricades and marched to Red Fort.A day later, the protesting farmers at the Tikri border alleged that those involved in the clashes were not part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions that has been leading the agitation at the Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur entry points to the Capital for 63 days.Jaswant Singh, a member of one of the unions, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Kadiya), said: “It is questionable how the police installed the barricades only at one place (Nangloi in west Delhi) to stop the protesters. Besides, how is it even possible that adequate security was not deployed at the Red Fort on Republic Day? It all shows that the government wanted this to happen to divert the attention of people and defame our movement.”Rajvinder Singh, 22, another volunteer at the protest site, said that he was among those who were given the charge of maintaining “discipline” during the tractor march. “Our leaders had announced that we should start the march only after 11am, as suggested by the police. But a group, which was carrying flags of different farm unions, started breaking the police barricades at around 8:30am, and moved ahead. We ran for over 10 kilometres to stop them, but they did not listen to us. I did not recognise them. I think they were trying to reach the Nangloi Chowk before the real protesters in order to complete the task assigned to them,” Singh said.To be sure, the farm unions were responsible for ensuring the protests were peaceful and did not resort to violence or desecration of national symbols, and the onus of Tuesday’s mayhem rests with them. Even the Samyukt Kisan Morcha accepted this at a media briefing at Singhu on Wednesday evening, when it took “moral responsibility” for the violence.Through Wednesday, several farmer leaders called for “peace” and “discipline” from a stage set up at the site.“There are attempts to break the unity of farmers but we won’t let that happen. They (police) also provoked some of our youngsters and made them do whatever happened on Tuesday. We should not let that happen again. I request you all to only follow the directions issued by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha and not by people who do Facebook Live from Red Fort displaying their shameful deeds,” said a farmer leader Jiya Lal, addressing the crowd from the stage.His reference appeared to be to Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who was part of the mob that led the hoisting of the Nishan Sahib flag at Red Fort, and whom the unions blame for matters getting out of hand.Joginder Singh, the president of another prominent farm group, BKU (Ugrahan), alleged that Tuesday’s incident was a part of a “larger conspiracy” and requested farmers not to get disheartened by it.“Those who travelled to Red Fort and hoisted several religious flags they were not part of any farmer group,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/infiltrators-defamed-our-stir-farmers-at-tikri-site-101611775120291.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Standing committee seeks clarity on sale of bonds by Mumbai civic body||Slamming the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for its plan to raise funds through bonds for its infrastructure projects, members of the standing committee on Wednesday demanded that a status report on the entire plan be submitted to the committee. Corporators of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) said that the civic administration cannot bring in such a crucial policy without getting approval from the standing committee.Rais Shaikh, SP leader who raised a point of order on the subject, said, “The civic body must disclose how much financial deficit there is since they are raising funds from the market. They need to submit a white paper to the committee on the same.”The BMC had recently decided to raise funds by floating infrastructure bonds owing to the financial trouble it faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. A senior civic official confirmed that the BMC has planned to float municipal bonds and raise ₹4,000 crore to fund infra projects. “The plan is to raise money from the market and fund major infrastructure projects in the future. The policy has not been finalised, and everything about it is still under consideration,” the official said.In Wednesday’s committee meeting, members demanded that the administration submit a detailed planned report on the bonds and its budget. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP leader, said, “The ruling party and the administration should stop such gimmicks and involve public representatives in crucial policies like these. There has been a lack of clarity on the income and expenditure related to Covid-19 and the representatives are being kept in the dark about the BMC’s finances.”Echoing Shinde’s view, Vishaka Raut of the ruling Shiv Sena, said, “The standing committee is a financial body of the BMC, and it is surprising that the administration is not taking the committee into consideration. The opinion of the public representatives needs to be there in key-policy decisions. A status report of the BMC’s finances needs to be submitted to the committee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/standing-committee-seeks-clarity-on-sale-of-bonds-by-mumbai-civic-body-101611775321601.html
28-01-2021||Chandigarh||Improper staff utilisation a concern during vax drive in Chandigarh||With many sites reporting a low turnout for Covid-19 vaccination, a fresh concern has emerged for the UT health department in the form of improper utilisation of workforce deputed for the drive.The authorities had recently activated two new sites for the vaccination drive, with the deployment of more workforce to vaccinate priority beneficiaries. However, due to low response, the staff capacity is not being utilised to its fullest.“We have to make arrangements for inoculating a minimum of 100 people in a day, which includes deputation of doctors, nurses, and supporting staff. It makes it a team of at least 10 professionals. The staff on almost half of the sites do not see many beneficiaries coming in and thus, they don’t have much to do,” said a senior official of the UT health department.Only half the target achievedOut of a total target of 4,895, so far only 2,464 persons have been vaccinated in Chandigarh.On Wednesday, only eight people came forward for a jab at the civil hospital in Manimajra. Only 51 were vaccinated at the two sites of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32. Similarly, 87 were inoculated at the two sites of Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, and 50 people at civil hospital in Sector 45. Each of these sites has a capacity to inoculate 100 people.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that they had apprised the central government to increase the number of beneficiaries to be inoculated at one site, however, they were not granted permission for the same.“At a few sites, we have the capacity to inoculate more than 100 beneficiaries so that the capacity of the staff deployed there can be utilised. During routine meetings, we have requested the central government to allow us to increase the number of beneficiaries at one site, however, we were not given the go-ahead,” he said.Another UT health official said that the idea was to broaden the base of the beneficiaries to be called in for vaccination. “If 50 people are coming forward for vaccination out of 100, we expect the number will be pushed up to at least 70 if 200 people are invited. We can stop wastage of resources this way,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/improper-staff-utilisation-a-concern-during-vax-drive-in-chandigarh-101611774120883.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||200,000 frontline workers in Mumbai sign up for vaccination phase 2||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to conclude the first phase of Covid-19 immunisation by February 14, the civic body is gearing up for subsequent phases. As of Wednesday, 200,000 frontline workers have registered on the centralised app, CoWIN, for the second phase.Following the completion of the first phase, the civic body will seek approval from the Centre to start the second phase. “Along with its requisite permission, we will also have to wait to get vaccines to inoculate frontline workers in the second phase. As soon as we get both, we will kick-start the second phase,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.After healthcare workers (HCWs), BMC will vaccinate frontline workers, including police personnel from the state and central police departments, armed forces personnel and disaster management volunteers.“200,000 frontline workers have registered on the app, which will further increase to over 300,000 in the coming days,” said Kakani.In the first phase, BMC has a target to inoculate around 125,000 on HCWs registered on the CoWIN app. So far, 23,399 HCWs have been immunised in the city, as against the target of 34,394 accounting for a 68% turnout.After February 14, HCWs who missed their first appointment will get a chance at vaccination. “If they don’t come forward, we will initiate the second phase without waiting any further. We cannot force anyone since it [inoculation] is a voluntary process,” said Kakani.In a bid to fasten the process of mass inoculation, BMC is increasing vaccination centres. In addition to the existing ten centres, the civic body has started another centre at SevenHills Hospital. The civic body has also increased vaccination units to 90 from 72.On the first day of vaccination at SevenHills hospital on Wednesday, all 376 shortlisted candidates at the hospital got the first jab.Along with SevenHills hospital, BMC also has plans to start vaccination centres at the NESCO Covid-19 jumbo centre. “We are trying to include as many vaccination centres as possible to provide better accessibility to potential beneficiaries, which can help attain a better turnout. Later, we will also include dispensaries, which are already equipped for immunisation programmes,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.In the third phase, senior citizens above 60 years will be inoculated. BMC during their door-to-door survey found that more than 3 million civilians fall into the category. “Their details are already available with us. When we start the second phase, we will open the registration process for them,” said Kakani.Meanwhile, private hospitals are yet to hear from the civic body to open their doors as vaccination centres.Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital and member of the Association of Hospitals, a trust of private hospitals, said, “BMC has asked us to give hospital-wise data on our total number of vaccinators, details of cold storage facilities and the capacity of per day vaccination. We are in the process to compile all data.”As per BMC, no one has developed any severe side effects of the vaccines in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/200000-frontline-workers-in-mumbai-sign-up-for-vaccination-phase-2-101611773580829.html

28-01-2021||Chandigarh||No Rose Festival in Chandigarh this year||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) on Wednesday decided against organising Rose Festival this year in the wake of pandemic.The decision was taken in the MC’s General House meeting where most of the councillors raised their concern over the event, which generally draws huge crowds. The civic body has decided to “symbolically” organise the event and honour Covid-19 frontline workers, including doctors and MC staff, who worked to bring the infection under control in the city.The MC will also felicitate gardeners and other workers of Rose Garden.Since the MC took over the event in 2012, this is the first time it has been cancelled. The civic body had brought an agenda for the general House’s approval for spending ₹89 lakh on the three-day event. The highest amount — about ₹26 lakh — was to be spent on waterproof tents and furniture. A sum of ₹5.15 lakh was proposed to make horticulture arrangements, while ₹7.67 lakh was to be spent on decorations, security, lights and sound system. The remaining amount was reserved for prizes, competitions, fun activities and high tea among others.

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra inoculates 41,470 healthcare workers in a day||Maharashtra inoculated 41,470 healthcare workers (HCWs) — highest in a day so far — on Wednesday. It has also increased the number of centres to 528 from 477 centres, where the vaccination drive was held on Monday. With this, the number of HCW’s inoculated till date has increased to 178,371 since January 16, said Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department.The state government has planned to finish the first dose of all 784,000 health workers by mid-February and start the second dose, which has to be given after a gap of 28 days. It had planned to give Covid-19 shots five days a week (except on Tuesday and Sunday), but this week it will be held for four days, owing to preparations for a pulse polio immunisation programme.On Wednesday, the state recorded a turnout of 77%, which shows an improvement in response from HCWs. The turnout has started increasing after HCWs, who are not on the list for that particular day’s session, were allowed to take their vaccination shot, the officials said. On January 25, the turnout recorded was 74%.The state has also continued giving shots of Covaxin to HCW’s at six centres and vaccinated 219 people on Wednesday.In the two districts of Mumbai, 22,631 HCWs have been vaccinated so far, the health department said. Mumbai reported a 68% turnout on Wednesday with 5,197 HCWs vaccinated at 11 centres and 77 vaccination teams were in action.According to data released by the health department, Gadchiroli, Dhule, Jalna, Buldhana and Wardha districts reported over 100% turnout. Gadchiroli reported the highest turnout with 126% turnout as 885 HCWs were vaccinated.Dr Archana Patil, director, directorate of health services said that they have planned to hold the drive five days a week, except Tuesday and Sunday, and at 511 centres at least across the state. However, this Saturday it won’t be happening because of pulse polio immunisation drive. “This week we won’t be holding the drive on Saturday, as we have to make preparations for the pulse polio immunisation drive to be held across the state on January 31,” she said.“Covid vaccination of a person will be completed only after receiving two shots at a gap of 28 days. Our target is to complete the first round of shots of all the health workers by mid-February and start with the second round of shots of the vaccine from February 13 for all those who have got the first shot 28 days ago,” Dr Patil said.However, it would be difficult to achieve the target considering the pulse polio immunisation programme. “On January 30, we won’t be holding the vaccination drive, so that we can prepare for the pulse polio drive. Also from February 1, we would be holding Intensified Pulse Polio Immunization (IPPI) programme, in which, house to house pulse polio drive would be conducted for five days. The healthcare workers would be visiting every household and ensure polio drops be given to all those children in the age group of 0-5 years who have not reached immunisation camps. It is going to be conducted for three days in rural areas and two in urban areas,” said another official, requesting anonymity.Last week, the state received a second stock of 839,000 lakh doses of Covishield vaccines from the Centre. It needs over 1,700,000 doses to cover 784,000 healthcare workers. With over 1,800,000 doses, the state has more than enough stock to complete two doses of healthcare providers, the officials said.The state had received a batch of 983,000 lakh doses on January 12.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Wednesday reported 2,171 fresh infections, pushing the count to 2,015,524. Toll reached 50,894 after 32 casualties were reported. Of them, 17 occurred in the last 48 hours and four in the last week, the health officials said.Mumbai has clocked 435 cases on Wednesday, taking the case count to 307,175. Of them, active cases are 5,645. There were six deaths reported and the toll in the city has reached 11,323||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-maharashtra-inoculates-41-470-healthcare-workers-in-a-day-101611772980756.html
28-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police rescue kidnapped twin sons of builder in 2 hours||The DN Nagar police on Tuesday rescued 10-year-old twins of a city builder within two hours of their kidnapping by his 46-year-old driver and his brother-in-law.According to police, the accused had planned, executed the kidnapping and allegedly demanded a ransom of ₹1 crore as the driver needed money for his daughter’s wedding.The accused driver lives in Malwani with his family and worked as a driver for the developer, a Juhu resident. He ferried the developer’s twins for tennis coaching at Four Bungalows in Andheri (West) three days a week.On Monday around 7:30pm, the driver approached DN Nagar police, claiming that four people had stopped his car near Juhu and allegedly kidnapped him and the twins, said an officer. “The accused also informed us that the four kidnappers assaulted him and were talking amongst themselves to call the developer for ransom. Meanwhile, he got a chance to flee the spot after a few people were walking towards them. He claimed he managed to flee and directly approached the police station,” said senior inspector Bharat Gaikwad.Police, however, suspected some foul play. They took the driver to the spot that he had mentioned and found the car parked near PVR Cinema in Juhu. We found one of the twins inside the car and searched the other in nearby areas. The police team found the other boy tied to a seat in a school bus parked nearby. Police also found the brother-in-law keeping watch on the child. We then took both the boys to a hospital to ascertain that they were not harmed in any manner and informed their parents,” said Gaikwad. Gaikwad added that after sustained interrogation the duo revealed that the 24-year-old brother-in-law of the driver used to live in Mumbai earlier and worked with a telecom service provider as a salesman and knew how to make phone calls using some mobile phone apps. By the time the police team found the kidnapped child and him in the school bus, he had used an app downloaded in his mobile app to make a call to the Juhu developer and demanded a ransom of ₹1 crore. He had used the app to make the call, to make the call look like an international call.After 18 hours of questioning both the accused separately, they revealed the truth. The driver allegedly confessed that he made kidnapping plan with his brother-in-law as he required money for his daughter’s wedding. Driver’s brother-in-law lives in Delhi and came to Mumbai a week ago to execute the plan, added Gaikwad.The driver and his brother-in-law were produced before a magistrate on Wednesday and remanded to police custody till February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-rescue-kidnapped-twin-sons-of-builder-in-2-hours-101611772860045.html

As the scheme is about to end this month, officials of the power distribution company said that out of 12,000 big defaulters, only 900 have opted for the scheme. PVVNL chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) had asked all the power discoms in the state to launch the one-time settlement scheme for the consumers who could not clear their outstanding dues owing to the Covid-19 crisis. “The scheme was applicable for two months between November 30, 2020 and January 31, 2021. Under this scheme, the consumers in commercial and industrial categories had to get 100% waiver on surcharge on pending electricity bills up to November 30. Earlier, the scheme was applicable for urban and rural domestic consumers only,” he said. Singh further said that the discom had high hopes to recover at least ₹100 crore through the scheme as the defaulters had to clear the pending dues at one go. “But the response is not very encouraging for us, as out of 12,000 big defaulters, only 900 have opted for it so far. The scheme is ending on January 31,” he said.The officials said that along with shops, hotels and restaurants, commercial establishments like cinema halls, banks, private hospitals and nursing homes, and schools, among others, were eligible to take benefit of the scheme.The chief engineer also said that the overall figures of consumers, who opted for the scheme, would rise up to 1,000 as some of the small and medium industrial units having a contracted load less than 75 kW have been reported to clear their outstanding dues directly (offline) at the offices of their areas concerned. “We expect to recover ₹25 crore, which is around 25% of the total dues on these consumers till January 31,” he said. PVVNL has around 3.5 lakh consumers in Gautam Budh Nagar district, including 35,000 industrial and commercial consumers, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/discoms-one-time-settlement-scheme-fails-to-attract-defaulters-101611772506335.html

Eight people experienced minor giddiness, called adverse event following immunisation (AEIF), and were kept under observation for 30 minutes before being discharged. The civic body increased its vaccination centres from 10 to 11, by starting vaccination at the Seven Hills hospital in the western suburbs, along with the 10 existing vaccination centres that have been functional since January 16. In the coming days, the BMC will also add more vaccination centres, including the Jumbo Covid-19 facilities at NESCO in Goregaon, Dahisar, Mulund, and the jumbo facility at Richarson and Cruddas (RC) in Byculla.

Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of the public health department in the civic body, said, “We are scaling up slowly. Initially we started with 40 booths at 10 centres. We have got permission from the government to increase the booths. We will start vaccination at NESCO jumbo facility on Thursday or Friday, and eventually also start vaccination at the jumbo facilities in Dahisar, Mulund, and RC Byculla in a phased manner, so we can cover more healthcare workers.” The vaccination drive will also take place in the city on Thursday. On the first three days of the vaccination drive, on January 16, 19, and 20, Mumbai saw a relatively low turnout for vaccination, between 50% and 52%, which increased to 92% on the fourth day (January 22), and 90% on the fifth day (January 23).

28-01-2021||Noida||Noida may experience cold wave till Jan 31: IMD||Residents of Noida and adjoining areas will experience spells of cold wave for the next two days, along with icy cold northwesterly winds and clear skies, said officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday.The IMD has forecasted cold wave conditions on Thursday and Friday, which may extend till January 31, depending on the wind speed and its direction. The mercury is likely to drop and hover around 4 degrees Celsius during this period. “The wind direction has changed from south-westerly to northwesterly. There will be cold wave conditions in isolated areas of the NCR areas, including parts of western Uttar Pradesh, as the northwesterly winds picks up speed. The minimum temperature is likely to drop to nearly 4 degrees Celsius,” said an official at IMD. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 7.6 degrees Celsius as against 6.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 21 degrees Celsius as against 20.2 degrees Celsius a day prior. The average minimum for NCR, based on Safdarjung observatory, was 5.4 degrees Celsius — three notches below the season’s average of 8-9 degrees Celsius. The average minimum temperature a day earlier was 2.2 degrees.The average maximum for NCR on Wednesday was 21.5 degrees Celsius as against 20.4 degrees Celsius a day before. The meteorological department has also forecasted moderate fog during the morning hours. According to weather analysts, while the minimum temperature will see a drop, respite from cold conditions is possible only around February 1, when another round of western disturbance will change the wind direction from the icy cold northwesterly to the relatively warmer easterly and south-easterly winds. “The city is currently experiencing northwesterly winds, along with clear skies. As such, the mercury is plummeting. Clear skies allow earth’s heat to escape the atmosphere quickly. This cold condition will prevail till February 1 or 2, till another western disturbance changes the wind directions and leads to a spike in the mercury,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. He added that a layer of thick fog will also dissolve earlier, leading to better visibility during the last few days. “The northwesterly winds are also dry or carry less humidity, leading to a quicker dispersal of the thick layer fog. So, open areas like expressways may experience foggy conditions in the morning that might disperse by 8am,” said Palawat. Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad continued to be in the “very poor” category as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) bulletin.The air quality of Greater Noida, however, showed a marginal improvement from “very poor” to “poor” category. “The wind speed has increased from 8-10 kmph yesterday to an average of 15 kmph on Wednesday. The wind speed will remain almost the same for the next few days,” Palawat added. According to the CPCB’s AQI index, Noida recorded an AQI reading of 342 on Wednesday as against 370 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was 300 against 365 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 357 as against 395 a day earlier. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), no significant improvement in air pollution is expected. “Wind direction is forecasted to shift to North-westerly. Due to cold dry winds, the temperature is likely to decrease for next two days. No significant change is ventilation index is forecasted for the next three days.

In August last year, the authority had roped in RITES as consultant for the project. “The DPR has been prepared. But the selection of an agency will take time. The project is likely to be ready by September next year,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority.The DPR contains an economic feasibility survey, finalisation of site, preparation of design and other technical details related with the project. The heliport project is spread on 10 acres of land and its terminal building is to be built on 500 square metres, the officials said. As per the initial planning, it will be having a capacity to land 172 helicopters at a time, they said. With three helicopter parkings, the facility will also be having maintenance and repair services.The authority hopes that this facility will immensely help business groups and developers in the city. After approvals from the state government to allow commercial operations, the authority will offer land to the selected developer. The Noida authority sees an opportunity in this project because apart from the proposed international airport at Jewar, several other mega realty projects such as Film City, multi-modal logistics hub, and Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, among others, are also scheduled to come up in Gautam Budh Nagar district.“The heliport with a repair facility will be in huge demand once it becomes operational. It will not only bring revenue to the authority, but will also provide much needed services to corporate houses. The selected developer will have to invest ₹43 crore in the project to be built under the public-private partnership model,” said an authority official, not authorised to speak to media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-heliport-project-to-be-ready-by-sept-2022-101611772379748.html
28-01-2021||Noida||Noida authority expedites work on Sector 96 underpass||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Wednesday said that it has expedited the construction work of a ₹50 crore underpass being built near Sector 96 on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. Rajiv Tyagi, chief general manager of the Noida authority, conducted an inspection at the construction site and directed the staff to make sure the project gets completed before the scheduled deadline. The authority has planned to complete the underpass project by September this year.“So far we have completed 19% work of this project and we have a target to finish this by September 2021. We have directed the staff to put the work on fast-track as we want to open it for the public use much before the deadline,” said Tyagi.The underpass is being constructed at 2.3 km from zero point. Once constructed, it will help motorists cross over to other side of the expressway smoothly without experiencing traffic congestion, said the authority officials.Initially the work was in slow mode and later work got affected due to Covid-19 restrictions. Therefore now the authority wants to make for the delay, said officials.The authority had in March-end 2020 started the work on this project that will ease traffic pangs between sector 44, 96, 97, 98, 99 and sector 124, 125 and 127 among other areas, said officials.This underpass is being built exactly in front of Sector 96 site, where the authority’s new administrative building is being constructed. It will be a six-lane underpass that will offer smooth ride to thousands of motorists, who need to cross over from Sector 96 side to Sector 126 side, said officials.The authority is carrying out construction work in such a manner so that the normal traffic on the 25km Noida-Greater Noida Expressway is not disturbed. “We are using push-back construction method to construct this underpass so that the work is kept going on without disrupting the regular vehicular movement on the expressway,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-expedites-work-on-sector-96-underpass-101611772379190.html

We have also removed the barricades from the DND Flyway loop leading to the Chilla border,” he said.Earlier, Thakur Bhanu Pratap Singh, chief of BKU (Bhanu), said that he was deeply pained at the turn of events in Delhi. “I am pained as some flags other than tricolour were hoisted at the Red Fort by a group of people. I am also pained at the assault on the police personnel. I had started the protest for the welfare of farmers. The situation is volatile, and hence we are ending our protest,” Singh said.The members of BKU-Bhanu had been protesting against the Centre’s three new farm laws at the Chilla border since December 1. The farmers had also set up tents and kitchens to keep the protest going.After the announcement of withdrawal from the stir, the farmers were seen loading their belongings on tractors and cars and moving to their native places. On Tuesday, around 300 farmers from different districts of Uttar Pradesh had gathered at Chilla border and marched to Delhi in their tractors on the Republic Day. Some of these protesters had left on January 26 evening after the tractor rally turned violent in Delhi.However, the BKU-Bhanu’s UP president and Singh’s son Yogesh Pratap Singh did not appear satisfied at the withdrawal of the protest. “I am leaving the protest site since the senior BKU functionary announced its withdrawal. I smell a conspiracy in breaking farmers’ protest. The Delhi police did not allow us to march towards Akshardham on the Republic Day and they forced us to return to Noida from Mayur Vihar Extension metro station. Why did not the Delhi police stop other farmers from entering Red Fort?” he said.Meanwhile, Saha said that the traffic police have also tweeted the info so that people can start using the route for commuting to Delhi and vice-versa.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Zone 1, said that the farmers’ protest in Noida on the Republic Day remained peaceful and no case was registered against them. “We have not received information of any FIR against them in Delhi as well. The BKU-Bhanu group has called off its protest around 4.30pm. They were removing their belongings from the protest sight on Wednesday evening,” he said.Since the protest had gone violent in Delhi on Tuesday, the farmers’ stir in Noida also lost momentum. However, the Lok Shakti faction of BKU whose about 20 members are protesting at the Dalit Prerna Sthal said on Wednesday that it would continue with its peaceful stir.SK Giri, spokesperson of BKU-Lok Shakti, said that some anti-social elements had tried to hijack the farmers’ protest on Tuesday. “Our protest has been completely peaceful since day one. Our tractor rally was also disciplined and there was no unwanted incident. A Noida police team had come to us and asked to withdraw the protest since the BKU-Bhanu has withdrawn. But we have planned to continue the protest. We also want the government to add our faction in the negotiation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traffic-resumes-at-chilla-border-as-one-group-calls-off-protest-101611772259130.html

However, it was supposed to be open for visitors on January 27, but it did not, sources said.Sources said after the violence that erupted in the Red Fort premises on January 26, the ASI has taken a decision to keep the gates shut to take stock of the damages.Earlier on Wednesday, culture and tourism minister Prahlad Patel visited the site and has sought a report on the incident from the ASI."Visited the Red Fort today morning and instructed the ASI DG to prepare a report on the incident and also lodge an FIR," tweeted Singh after his visit.While it is not clear if the iconic structure was damaged in any way, during the minister's tour one could see vandalised metal detector gate and ticket counter, and broken shards of glass at the premises of the Red Fort.The minister had on Tuesday condemned the actions of the protesting farmers who entered the Red Fort and said it violated the symbol of dignity of India's democracy."I do not want to say anything on the issue yet. I have sought a report, let it come," Patel told PTI.There are 173 monuments in Delhi protected under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It includes UNESCO World Heritage Sites -- Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb and Qutub Minar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-fort-to-remain-closed-for-visitors-till-january-31-asi-order-101611769294549.html

Thus states a pamphlet released by the organisation ahead of the conference on Wednesday.The Abhiyaan, an umbrella body of 56 organisations will hold the conclave at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch, after they were granted permission to conduct the event by the Pune police.Earlier, the conference was scheduled to be held on December 31, 2020, but was postponed after the police denied permission.Booker prize winner and outspoken critic Arundhati Roy; and former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan, will be the main speakers at the event.Other speakers include former high court judge BG Kolse Patil; jailed JNU student leader Umar Khalid’s father - SQR Iliyas; former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) leader Sharjeel Usmani, documentary filmmaker Randeep Madhuke, Ladeeda Farzana ( Sakhaloon ) and Ayesha Ayesha Renna N , all faces of the Jamia Millia protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in New Delhi; activist Satyabhama Suryavanshi; incarcerated IPS officer Sanjeev Bhat’s wife Shweta and daughter Akashi; journalist Prashant Kanojia and Abeeda Tadvi, mother of student Dr Payal Tadvi who committed suicide in Mumbai following harassment by senior doctors in 2019. Similarly, revolutionary songs will be sung by Bant Singh (Punjab), Pariah (Tamil Nadu), Samta Kala Manch and Kabir Kala Manch.Justice (retd) BG Kolse Patil said, “We will continue our fight against the oppressive and repressive policies of the central government which is curbing freedom of speech. The Elgar conference has been defamed by right wing forces who don’t want equality to prevail amongst all sections of society. The country requires a new politics which guarantees socio-economic empowerment of the countrymen. Earlier, permission was declined to conduct the conclave at Shaniwarwada. The police have given permission for only 200 persons as a condition for holding the conference. We have shown the police videos of different public meets which were jam packed and told the home minister about it. We will ensure there is maximum attendance for this meet which espouses the secular values of the country,” he said.The Elgar conference was first held on December 31, 2017, ahead of the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon, which was observed on January 1, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/arundhati-roy-among-others-to-attend-elgar-parishad-on-january-30-101611763497377.html
28-01-2021||World||Apple CEO slams internet giants ahead of new privacy features||Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook lambasted tech giants for “data exploitation” and called for reform around the practices of selling user data to target ads.The iPhone maker is rolling out new privacy features that restrict how mobile apps such as those from Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google gather data about users to target ads.“If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are not choices at all, then it doesn’t deserve our praise, it deserves reform,” Cook said Thursday at the online Computers, Privacy & Data Protection Conference.Without naming specific businesses, Cook criticized companies’ algorithms for perpetuating the spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, saying “we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that all engagement is good engagement.”The Apple CEO also reiterated calls for a US privacy law much like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. He said it’s time for “worldwide laws and new international agreements that enshrine the principle of data minimization, user knowledge and data security around the globe.”Following an update to Apple’s iPhone and iPad operating system software this spring, users will be prompted to explicitly permit or deny developers the ability to track their data across apps or websites.It’s expected many consumers will choose not to allow this, making it harder for apps to show users ads based on their past online activity, drawing the ire of Facebook and other advertising companies that rely on such abilities.In full-page newspaper ads in December, the social network attacked Apple over the plans, saying the features would hurt small businesses and on Wednesday, Facebook told analysts the iOS changes could curb its revenue growth. A group of French online advertisers last fall filed an antitrust complaint against Apple, warning publishers’ ad revenue could plunge by as much as 50% as result of the update.Apple says the features will give users more transparency about how their data is used, and in a way that still enables advertising.The remarks come after Apple on Wednesday issued a cautious outlook for its wearables and services sales, despite posting quarterly revenue that topped $100 billion for the first time. The company also published a separate report detailing how companies track user data across websites and apps, alongside quotes from privacy advocates supporting Apple’s new measures.The Apple CEO last spoke at a Brussels privacy conference in 2018, when he lashed out at Facebook and other Silicon Valley competitors that collect user data, equating their services to “surveillance.”Since then, the regulatory situation for Apple in Europe has only darkened. Apple faces EU antitrust investigations concerning its app store and payments system and, along with other tech giants, a threat of steep fines and business break-ups loom as part of legislation proposed by the European Commission in December. It’s also facing lawsuits in several European countries over misleading claims about the battery life of older iPhones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-ceo-slams-internet-giants-ahead-of-new-privacy-features-101611856017544.html

These are the first two cases of this variant in the United States," the release said.The release said the two patients who contracted the South African coronavirus strain have no known travel history and no connection between each other.The spread of new coronavirus variants has raised fears over the efficacy of already-developed vaccines against the disease. Public health officials in many countries have said that there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the new strains will undermine ongoing mass immunization campaigns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-cases-of-south-african-covid-19-variant-detected-in-us-101611855374138.html
28-01-2021||World||A new White House under Biden: Discipline, diversity, dogs and social distancing||On the morning of Jan. 20, hours before Joe Biden arrived at the White House as the 46th US president, a clear plexiglass shield was erected at the guard's desk at the entrance to the West Wing housing the executive offices.It was a small but noticeable sign that things were changing: Covid-19 protections missing during Donald Trump's last year in office would be a regular part of White House life in the Biden administration.From required mask-wearing to a new public information approach, the Democrat's steady hand-on-the-tiller style marks an abrupt change from the bombast and volatility under the Republican Trump, a businessman and former reality TV star."This is what normalcy looks like," said Ambassador John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, when asked about the Biden administration. "It’s certainly true that if a president can’t manage the White House, he can’t manage the rest of it."A White House governing strategy assailed as chaotic by both political parties is gone, replaced by message discipline and a disinclination toward leaks.New presidents typically benefit from a honeymoon period. Morning Consult Political Intelligence showed that, during Biden's first few days in office, 56 percent of voters approved of his job performance. But popularity can be fleeting.Dogs and briefings are backThe White House changes are myriad, from the mundane to the profound. Dogs are back on the South Lawn. Regular media briefings, with follow-up questions and data-driven answers, have returned to the briefing room.Biden himself has made unity and civility his main messages."We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature," Biden said in his inaugural address. "For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury; no progress, only exhausting outrage; no nation, only a state of chaos."Trump dominated the news cycle largely as a one-man show, shifting topics regularly in a frenetic, seesaw fashion. The Biden team has stuck to a specific theme nearly every day, with Biden systematically signing executive orders to roll back one Trump policy after another.Trump's Twitter account, a mainstay of his presidency with aggrieved and inflammatory messages on a daily if not hourly basis, was suspended in the aftermath of a Jan. 6 riot by his supporters on the US Capitol.Biden's tweets are used to advance his policy objectives and to share the occasional lighthearted comment, such as when he cleared up any confusion about his favorite ice cream flavor: “Can confirm it’s chocolate chip.”White House Masks and diversityThe Biden White House approach to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 430,000 people in the United States, is one of the sharpest departures.Trump routinely eschewed masks, and most officials did the same when around him. The virus infected multiple members of his White House staff, and Trump himself.Biden has mandated mask-wearing in government buildings. At public events, he and other officials adhere to public health guidelines for social distancing.The new president has required appointees to sign stringent ethics pledges that include a ban on accepting gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations.He also has showcased diversity. Vice President Kamala Harris - the first woman, Black person and Asian American to hold the role - is on hand for event after event.Although Biden has his share of white male advisers, other team members, from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first woman and the first Black person to hold the roles, respectively, have projected a tableau of America in a way that Trump's team did not.Biden's call to move past the polarizing Trump years will be tested as his legislative agenda encounters resistance from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from liberal lawmakers who seek bolder reforms."In the short term very clearly the temperature has been taken down, and despite what we’ve seen in the Capitol just a few weeks ago, people are calming down," said Republican strategist Doug Heye.“Moving forward, Biden is in a perfect position to cut the deals that Trump always said he could but never did," he said, but added, "that’s not to say it’s going to be easy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-white-house-under-biden-discipline-diversity-dogs-and-social-distancing-101611853669317.html
28-01-2021||World||One third of Africa will be vaccinated this year: WHO||Africa can expect to see at least 30 percent of its population immunised against coronavirus by the end of 2021, the World Health Organization said Thursday, as vaccines begin trickling into the continent.It is estimated Africa will need 1.5 billion vaccine doses to immunise 60 percent of its 1.3 billion inhabitants, the threshold for herd immunity against Covid-19.But the continent has fallen behind in the global vaccine scramble, as wealthier nations have been accused of bulk-buying excess doses directly from manufacturers.Most African countries are relying on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the African Union (AU) to shoulder at least part of their innoculation campaigns -- providing vaccines and helping to finance their roll out.WHO Africa's immunisation coordinator Richard Mihigo said the WHO-backed Covax vaccine sharing facility and the AU's African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT) would jointly deliver enough doses to vaccinate between 30 to 35 percent of the continent's population this year."Given the latest developments within the Covax facility, there is a very good prospect that the objective to supply 600 million doses by the end of 2021 will definitely be reached," Mihigo told a virtual press briefing.The Covax vaccines will cover at least 20 percent of the population, with the rest "complemented" by AVATT, he added.While the AU has so far secured 270 million doses through AVATT, Mihigo warned "some of those may not become available soon" and that the initiative could "realistically" only expect to reach between 10 and 15 percent of the continent in 2021.The bulk of Covax and AVATT provisions will be shots of Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine, followed by a few million Pfizer-BioNTech jabs.Mihigo said the WHO was exploring "additional candidates", with particularly high hopes for Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine.So far only a small handful of African countries have started vaccinating their populations, including Guinea, Mauritius and the Seychelles.Morocco is expected to begin administering the shots this week, while South Africa announced on Wednesday that a first batch of 1.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines would arrive on February 1.Mihigo said the first Covax doses were likely to reach the continent by mid-February, and that "by March we will definitely see most of the countries start vaccinating"."It is a slow start but we are expecting that in the coming months things are going to ramp up."To date Africa has recorded close to 3.5 million coronavirus cases and 88,000 deaths, according to a tally compiled by AFP.A new virus variant first detected in South Africa that is thought to be more contagious has cropped up in at least six African countries and 24 worldwide, according to the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-third-of-africa-will-be-vaccinated-this-year-who-101611844142269.html

28-01-2021||World||Travesty of justice: India after Pak upholds acquittal of Daniel Pearl's killer||India on Thursday described the Pakistan Supreme Court’s decision to free Omar Saeed Sheikh, one of three terrorists freed by New Delhi in 1999 in exchange for a hijacked airliner who was later convicted of beheading journalist Daniel Pearl, as “a travesty of justice”.A three-judge bench upheld the Sindh high court's order of April last year to acquit Sheikh and three other men convicted of the 2002 abduction and murder of Pearl. The apex court also dismissed the Sindh provincial government’s appeal against the high court’s ruling.The bench said in a brief order it was acquitting Sheikh by “extending the benefit of doubt to him”, and it directed authorities to release the four men “forthwith if not required to be detained in connection with any other case”. One of the three judges opposed the decision.Hours after the verdict was announced in Islamabad, India said the development reflected Pakistan’s lax attitude towards prosecuting known terrorists. India reiterated its demand for Pakistan to take “sustained, verifiable, credible and irreversible action” against terror and terrorist funding emanating from all territory under its control.“It is also a travesty of justice not to find Omar Saeed guilty of any charges in this heinous act of terror,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.“I’d mentioned earlier about the very low conviction rate in Pakistan when it comes to sentencing of terror accused and this case truly demonstrates the lack of any seriousness on the part of Pakistan on taking action on terror-related issues,” he said.Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani-origin, was the main suspect in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl.Pearl, 38, was South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while researching links between militants in Pakistan and Richard C Reid, known as the “shoe bomber” for trying to detonate a bomb while on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001. Pearl was later killed by his captors in Karachi.Sheikh was arrested in India in 1994 and imprisoned over the kidnapping of one American and three British tourists. He was freed with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.The US state department expressed strong concern last month after the Sindh high court ordered the release of Sheikh and the three other convicts. Thursday’s development is unlikely to go down well with the new US administration at a time when Islamabad is seeking to rebuild ties with Washington under President Joe Biden.The US had said it may seek to try Sheikh if efforts to keep him in prison fail. Pearl’s family, which also challenged the Sindh high court’s order to free Sheikh, was in “complete shock”, the family’s lawyer, Faisal Siddiqi, told Reuters.“No amount of injustice will defeat our resolve to fight for justice for Daniel Pearl,” Siddiqi said, adding there were no further legal avenues to pursue in Pakistan.The Pakistan Supreme Court’s order came a day after it emerged that Sheikh had acknowledged playing a "minor” role in Pearl’s killing. Sheikh admitted to limited involvement in the murder in a handwritten letter, dating to 2019, which was submitted to the Supreme Court nearly a fortnight ago.Following Sheikh’s acquittal by the high court last year, the Sindh government had detained him under the Maintenance of Public Order ordinance and Anti-Terrorism Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lacks-seriousness-india-after-pak-upholds-acquittal-in-daniel-pearl-murder-case-101611848567977.html
28-01-2021||World||New US jobless claims drop; still at 847,000 as pandemic rages||The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell but remained at a historically high 847,000 last week, a sign that layoffs keep coming as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage.Last week’s claims dropped by 67,000, from 914,000 the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. Before the virus hit the United States hard last March, weekly applications for jobless aid had never topped 700,000.Overall, nearly 4.8 million Americans are continuing to receive traditional state unemployment benefits. That is down from nearly 5 million the week before and from a staggering peak of nearly 25 million in May when the virus — and lockdowns and other measures to contain it — brought economic activity to a near halt. The drop suggests that some of the unemployed are finding new jobs and that others have exhausted state benefits.The job market remains under strain even though the spread of Covid-19 vaccines offers hope for an end to the health crisis and a return to normal economic life.The United States is now recording just under 150,000 new coronavirus cases a day. That is down from nearly 250,000 a day early this month but still more than twice the levels seen from March until a resurgence in cases in late October. So far, more than 425,000 Americans have died from the pandemic.The virus has forced state and local governments to restrict operations of restaurants, bars and other businesses and has discouraged Americans from venturing out of their homes.Since February, the United States has lost 9.8 million jobs, including 140,000 in December.Americans who lost work because of the pandemic can get aid from extended relief programs, which now offer up to 50 weeks of benefits, or from a new program that targets contractors and the self-employed. Altogether, 18.3 million people were receiving some type of unemployment benefit the week that ended Jan. 9, the latest period for which data is available.A new government financial aid package provides, among other things, a $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit on top of regular state jobless aid. The new benefit runs through mid-March.Once vaccines become more widely distributed, economists expect growth to accelerate in the second half of the year as Americans unleash pent-up demand for travel, dining out and visiting movie theaters and concert halls. Such spending could boost hiring.But for now, the economy is floundering. Retail sales have fallen for three straight months. Restrictions on restaurants, bars and some stores, along with a reluctance of most Americans to shop, travel and eat out, have led to sharp spending cutbacks.The Ultimate Kronos Group, a company that provides time-tracking software to small businesses, said the number of shifts worked by its clients dropped 2.5% in the second to last week of January from a month earlier. The drop was biggest — 4.3% — in the Southeast. “As we near the end of January, it’s clear that the national labor recovery is still struggling to return from the slow holiday season,′ said David Gilbertson, vice president at UKG.The data firm Womply reports that as of Jan. 21 spending at local businesses is down 23% from a year earlier and that 26% are closed, including 30% of restaurants and 42% of bars. Hotels report a 51% drop in revenue.President Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9 trillion coronavirus plan that would provide, among other things, $1,400 checks for most Americans, which, on top of the $600 checks already being distributed, would bring the total to $2,000 per adult.The new plan would also make available $400 a week in federal benefits for jobless Americans and extend a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures through September. Biden’s proposal will require congressional approval, and congressional Republicans are already balking at its size.“Additional fiscal stimulus and broader vaccine diffusion should support an improved labor market in the spring,'' economists Nancy Vanden Houten and Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note. “But claims are expected to remain high in the near term as the pandemic continues to restrict activity, with new strains of the virus a concern.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-jobless-claims-drop-still-at-847-000-as-pandemic-rages-101611844955212.html
28-01-2021||World||EU warns it could block vaccine exports, wields legal threat at drugmakers||Europe's fight to secure Covid-19 vaccine supplies intensified on Thursday when the European Union warned drug companies such as AstraZeneca that it would use all legal means or even block exports unless they agreed to deliver shots as promised.The EU, whose member states are far behind Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States in rolling out vaccines, is scrambling to get supplies just as the West's biggest drugmakers slow deliveries to the bloc due to production problems.As vaccination centres in Germany, France and Spain cancelled or delayed appointments, the EU publicly rebuked Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca for failing to deliver and even asked if it could divert supplies from Britain.European Council President Charles Michel said in a letter to four EU leaders that the EU should explore legal means to ensure supplies of Covid-19 vaccines it contracted to buy if negotiations with companies over delayed deliveries are unsuccessful."If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal under the Treaties," Michel said in the January 27 letter.EU rules on monitoring and authorising exports of Covid-19 vaccines in the 27-nation bloc could lead to exports being blocked if they violated existing contracts between the vaccine maker and the EU, an EU official said.The European Commission is to lay out the criteria under which such exports would be evaluated on Friday.VACCINE CRUNCHUnder fire from the EU, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the EU was late to strike a supply contract so the company did not have enough time to iron out production problems at a vaccine factory run by a partner in Belgium.Britain, which has repeatedly touted its lead in the vaccine rollout race since leaving the EU's orbit on Jan. 1, said its deliveries must be honoured."I think we need to make sure that the vaccine supply that has been bought and paid for, procured for those in the UK, is delivered," Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove told LBC Radio.Asked if the British government would prevent AstraZeneca diverting essential vaccine supplies from Britain to the EU, Gove said the crucial thing was that Britain received its orders as planned and on time.The swiftest mass vaccination drive in history is stoking tensions across the world as big powers buy up doses in bulk and poorer nations try to navigate a financial and diplomatic minefield to collect whatever supplies are left.In the northern French region of Hauts-de-France, France's second-most-densely-populated region, several vaccination centres were no longer taking appointments for a first jab. In several other French regions, some online appointment platforms closed booking options.Spain's Madrid region has ceased first vaccinations for at least this week and next and was using the few doses it has to administer second shots to those who have had the first one, said deputy regional government chief Ignacio Aguado.Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, last week postponed opening its vaccination centres until February 8, while the state of Brandenburg has also had to push back vaccination appointments originally scheduled for the end of January due to delivery delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-it-could-block-vaccine-exports-wields-legal-threat-at-drugmakers-101611843927641.html

28-01-2021||World||US economic growth moderated to 4% in final quarter of 2020||The US economy downshifted in the final three months of 2020 after record third-quarter growth, as the pandemic battered the labor market and limited Americans’ ability and willingness to spend.Gross domestic product expanded at a 4% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, according to a preliminary estimate released by the Commerce Department on Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 4.2%.While output of goods and services was far slower than the record 33.4% rate in the previous three months, the growth pace still exceeded the average of the decade-long expansion that ended early last year.The deceleration in overall growth largely reflected a sudden moderation in consumer spending after a third-quarter splurge. Personal consumption, the biggest part of the economy, increased at a 2.5% rate, trailing projections for a 3.1% rise.A separate report on Thursday showed applications for state unemployment benefits eased by 67,000 last week to 847,000. Claims are still about four times pre-pandemic levels and highlight ongoing labor market stress.Contracts on the S&P 500 pared losses after the morning data. The dollar pared gains, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose.At the same time, other parts of the economy continued to shine. Non-residential investment expanded at a 13.8% pace, driven by firm spending on equipment, while residential outlays grew 33.5%.The latest figures highlight the dichotomy of the economic recovery. Households have grown more cautious about spending, most notably on service-related activities but also merchandise.Yet, still-surprising momentum in home sales is powering construction, and companies continue to invest in equipment. That’s helping to sustain a manufacturing rebound at the same time factories boost output to replenish lean inventories.Pandemic YearThe report marks the end of a tumultuous year. The global Covid-19 pandemic and government efforts to curb it sent the economy tumbling into recession in a matter of weeks. While continuing to make headway as the year drew to a close, real GDP still contracted 2.5% in 2020 from the pre-pandemic output peak in the fourth quarter of 2019.The economy’s prospects this year have improved nonetheless. A $900 billion pandemic relief package was signed in late December that included both stimulus checks for millions of Americans and financial help for small businesses.There are expectations for even more aid in the wake of a $1.9 trillion plan put forth by President Joe Biden. Lawmakers are split. Democrats see the growth slowdown and weakening job market as reason to move forward on a larger aid bill, while many Republicans prefer to wait and allow financial aid from the December bill to filter through the economy as coronavirus vaccinations increase.The fourth quarter started on solid ground, but a resurgent pandemic quickly led to a re-imposition of restrictions on businesses and activity in some states and cities in November and December. In that two-month period, employers in the leisure and hospitality sector cut hundreds of thousands of jobs -- another black eye for an already struggling labor market -- and retail sales declined.The latest GDP figures help explain the Federal Reserve’s characterization of the economy. On Wednesday, after leaving their benchmark interest rate near zero, officials said in a statement that the “pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.”There are some signs in high-frequency data that the economy is gaining some momentum in the new year as Covid-19 infections stabilize. Metrics such as mobility, restaurant bookings and spending have all seen some improvement.Consumer spending may get a boost in the first quarter after the latest round of stimulus payments and supplemental jobless benefits. In the fourth quarter, disposable incomes decreased at an annualized 8.1% pace, but pandemic aid for Americans should help bolster savings and incomes.Other Details||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economic-growth-moderated-to-4-in-final-quarter-of-2020-101611842387905.html
28-01-2021||World||Germany recommends AstraZeneca's Covid shot only for people under 65||Germany cast doubt on AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 shot for the elderly in a move that could perpetuate the European Union’s (EU) vaccine supply shortages.The country’s immunization commission recommended that the drugmaker’s inoculation be authorized only for people between the ages of 18 and 64, according to a draft assessment released Thursday by the country’s health ministry.The group, which evaluates vaccines for the German government, said there was insufficient information on the shot’s effectiveness for people over 65 years old, though it added that “beyond this limitation, the vaccine is also considered to be equally suitable.”The recommendation comes a day before the European Union’s drug regulator is expected to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine, which would be the third shot cleared for use in the bloc.While the panel’s recommendations aren’t legally binding, they’re the basis for state and federal vaccination guidelines. AstraZeneca shares traded 2.2% lower at 1:10 p.m. in London.The EU has struggled to scale up its vaccine program with the UK administering three times as many doses per capita as the most advanced country on the continent, Denmark. The bloc has purchased as many as 400 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine and is in a dispute with the company over delivery delays.The UK regulator approved the shot for all adults last month. Although few people over 65 were included in broad studies, the vaccine showed a strong immune response in older people in earlier-stage trials.People over the age of 65 are a key population for Covid shots, as the disease is more deadly in older people, particularly those with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease that are more common in the elderly. The company has said that its studies show the shot is effective among the aged.More data on the efficacy of the vaccine for older adults will come from Astra’s US trials, with results expected in March. About a quarter of the roughly 30,000 participants in that trial are aged 65 and over.The EU, along with the UK, is also facing delays for a shot from Pfizer Inc. and German partner BioNTech SE, as the companies renovate a factory in Belgium.AstraZeneca has said production of doses at the site is slower than expected, which will affect planned deliveries. The warning late last week has since escalated into a tense standoff, with the company and the EU accusing each other of fault.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-recommends-astrazeneca-s-covid-shot-only-for-people-under-65-101611842181074.html
28-01-2021||World||Chinese victim’s son seeks answers as WHO virus probe team starts work||As the 13-member WHO team stepped out of their two-week quarantine in the central Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday to begin probing the origin of the Covid-19 virus, a motley group of Chinese citizens will be tracking their activities and statements.They want answers – primarily, why was there a delay last January in making the information public that a contagious virus was spreading in Wuhan?Zhang Hai, 51, thinks he lost his father to the deadly infection because that critical piece of information was missing when he brought the senior citizen for a leg surgery from Shenzhen city to Wuhan last January.Though not very optimistic, Zhang hopes that he would get an opportunity to talk to the WHO team – a prospect which is increasingly looking bleak after he and other disgruntled family members of victims were blocked out of Chinese social media to begin with.The itinerary of the 13 WHO experts, expected to be here for two weeks under global glare, wasn’t revealed by the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday. It is expected that they will interact with Chinese scientists and experts, visit the seafood market linked to the first cases and interact with doctors at hospitals that dealt with the deluge of Covid-19 patients in Wuhan. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Thursday that all activities of the group should comply with the principles of scientific traceability of the virus and should be used to prevent future risks and protect the safety and health of the people’s lives are the highest goals. “Highest goals”. That’s the phrase Zhang did not agree with during the interview with the Hindustan Times. Zhang said when he reached and admitted his father to a hospital on January 17, nobody told him about the coronavirus – by January 17 at least one person had already died of the virus.Zhang’s father died of the infection on January 30 after slipping into a coma.Since then, he has been trying to get some answers.“I openly advocated to pursue the responsibility of Wuhan authorities on Weibo (China’s Twitter-like service). But my Weibo account was censored. Wuhan authorities covered up the epidemic…The cover-up was deliberate murder, I think,” he said.“My six Weibo accounts were deleted”.The family’s lawsuits were not accepted by the court, Zhang said.“Our WeChat group was blocked when the WHO team came to Wuhan. This means that Wuhan authorities are afraid of the families contacting the WHO experts. I think authorities here have a guilty conscience.”Zhang hopes that the WHO team could meet the families of the victims and hear their experience.There seems to be little chance of that happening though with Washington and Beijing already involved in a war of words over the team’s visit.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, new White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said it was “imperative we get to the bottom” of how the virus appeared and spread worldwide.A “robust and clear” probe is required, Psaki said.Beijing expectedly snapped back on Thursday, warning the US to “respect facts and science, respect the hard work” of the WHO experts.They must be allowed to work “free from political interference”, Zhao said.For people like Zhang, the geopolitics involving the deadly virus is meaningless.“I believe if they did not cover up and took measures earlier, the virus could be controlled. I am not afraid because I am telling the truth. I want to tell the authorities that I will continue to talk until they… meet our demands. I did not frame the story. Everything I said just now is true.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-victim-s-son-seeks-answers-as-who-virus-probe-team-starts-work-101611842351297.html
28-01-2021||World||Pope Francis to meet Iraqi Shiite leader Ali al-Sistani on first ever Papal trip to Iraq||Iraq’s top Catholic official said Thursday that a deadly suicide bombing in Baghdad hasn’t thwarted Pope Francis’ plans to visit, and he confirmed the pontiff would meet with the country’s top Shiite cleric, Ali al-Sistani, in a significant highlight of the first-ever papal trip to Iraq.The Chaldean patriarch, Cardinal Louis Raphael Sako, provided the first details of Francis’ March 5-8 itinerary during a virtual press conference hosted by the French bishops' conference. The Vatican has confirmed the visit, but it still could be called off given the coronavirus pandemic.The trip is aimed primarily at encouraging the country’s beleaguered Christians, who faced decades of discrimination by the Muslim majority before being targeted relentlessly by Islamic State militants starting in 2014.But the first visit by a pope to Iraq also has a strong interfaith component. Francis is scheduled to travel to Najaf on March 6 to meet with al-Sistani, one of the world’s leading Shiite leaders, and to host an interfaith meeting that same day in the ancient city of Ur, the birthplace of the prophet Abraham, according to Sako.Francis has spent years trying to forge improved relations with Muslims. He signed a historic document on human fraternity in 2019 with a prominent Sunni leader, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand imam of Al-Azhar, the seat of Sunni learning in Cairo.Brother Amir Jaje, an Iraqi Dominican who is an expert on Shiite relations, said he hoped Sistani would also sign onto the fraternity document, which calls for Christians and Muslims to work together for peace.Francis' meeting with Sistani will be enormously symbolic for Iraqis, especially its Christians, for whom the encounter will mark a turning point in their country's often fraught interfaith relations.Christian communities that date to the time of Christ were run over by IS militants, and thousands of people were forced to flee in search of safety and a better life. The Vatican has called for Iraqi authorities and the international community to provide the security, economic and social conditions to allow them to return, arguing that Christians are a small but crucial part of Iraqi society.The meeting’s implicit message of coexistence would resonate among members of the Christian minority, who have expressed fears of demographic change following liberation from the Islamic State. Most blame militia groups for erecting checkpoints near their villages and homes, deterring many from returning.Sistani is a powerful religious figure whose opinion holds sway over the predominately Shiite street. He rarely intervenes in political affairs, but his 2014 fatwa was instrumental in the creation of Shiite militia groups who fought the Islamic State alongside Iraqi forces. In 2019, his sermon led to the resignation of Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi amid pressure from anti-government protests.The Vatican has confirmed Francis’ intention to go to Iraq and made all the pre-trip arrangements, including sending front teams to Iraq to work out logistics and security, and accrediting media to travel on the papal plane.A rare twin suicide bombing last week, however, has sparked fears of an IS resurgence. The attack struck a busy Baghdad commercial center, killing 32 and wounding over 100. It was the deadliest attack to strike the capital in years.Sako dismissed the significance of the bombing on the overall security situation in Iraq and said, “There is no risk for the pope."However, the coronavirus pandemic could force the trip to be suspended at any minute.“The risk is not for him, it’s for others,” Jaje said, noting that while Iraq’s daily confirmed caseload is far lower than in European countries, it’s testing capacity is also lower. Francis and the Vatican delegation will have been vaccinated by the time of the trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-to-meet-iraqi-shiite-leader-ali-al-sistani-on-first-ever-papal-trip-to-iraq-101611839547677.html

He spoke via video link from the Moscow jail where he was taken after being arrested upon his return to Russia Jan. 17.Police detained Navalny’s brother Oleg and several other activists Wednesday night ahead of a planned nationwide protest Sunday to demand the Kremlin critic’s release.Allies Lyubov Sobol and doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva were also detained for 48 hours, Ivan Zhdanov, director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, wrote on Twitter. Investigators have said the rallies organized Jan. 23 allegedly violated sanitary regulations aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19.The authorities also opened a criminal case against one of Navalny’s top aides, Leonid Volkov, alleging he encouraged minors to participate in the unsanctioned protests, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement Thursday.“As usual, black is white, freedom is slavery and two times two is five,” Volkov said on Twitter in response to the charges. He denied appealing to underage protesters.Tens of thousands of people in cities across Russia joined protests last Saturday to demand Navalny be freed from jail, where he is being held for 30 days over alleged parole violations. They were some of the largest unsanctioned rallies under President Vladimir Putin’s 21-year rule. The Kremlin has rejected calls from Western leaders to release Navalny.At the Feb. 2 hearing, a Moscow court will rule on a motion by authorities to convert a suspended sentence Navalny received in a 2014 case into as long as 3 1/2 years of prison time. Authorities argue he failed to check in as required, including during the time last year he was in a German hospital recovering from an August nerve-agent attack that he and Western governments blame on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny any involvement.Moscow prosecutors Thursday issued official warnings to organizers of the Jan. 31 protests, as well as five internet companies distributing calls to join the actions, Tass reported.Oleg Navalny was let out of prison in 2018 after serving a 3 1/2 year sentence for embezzlement that the opposition says was used to put pressure on his brother. The European Court of Human Rights in 2017 ruled the brothers’ right to a fair trial was violated in that case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-orders-navalny-to-remain-in-jail-ahead-of-trial-101611840326780.html
28-01-2021||World||Biden to rescind Mexico City Policy: Know all about contested ‘global gag rule’||US President Joe Biden is set to sign a memorandum to rescind the contested Mexico City Policy which was reinstated and expanded by the previous administration. The policy, which is also referred by critics as the global gag rule, bars the federal government from funding foreign non-profits involved in global health efforts if the organisations also perform and promote abortions. The presidential memorandum will be a part of a series of executive actions taken by the administration as promised during the poll campaign.What is Mexico City Policy?The policy was first announced by the Ronald Reagan administration in 1984 and came to force in 1985 and since then, it has been rescinded and reinstated multiple times strongly along party lines. On January 23, 2017, Trump signed a memorandum expanding the scope of the Mexico City Policy and a plan named ‘Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance’ was approved by the secretary of state to implement the expansion.In order to receive US global health assistance, the foreign nongovernmental organisations need to certify that they do not use their own non-US funds to promote or provide abortion. The promotion of abortion includes counselling patients about the option of abortion, referring them for abortion, or even advocating for the liberalisation of abortion laws. The policy has been, for the most part, reinstated or rescinded through executive actions and has been in effect for 20 of the past 35 years.Watch | Biden targets drilling, fossil fuel subsidies with new orders on climate changeWhy critics deem the amended policy worse than previous versions?The previous versions of the Mexico City Policy applied only to US family planning funds which, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, was around $575 million. The expansion of restrictions to US global health assistance amounting to an estimated $8.8 billion, which includes aid for family planning and reproductive health, maternal and child health, prevention and treatment of tuberculosis, infectious diseases, and sanitation among others.The policy would have forced the organisations to either lose funds from the United States for health assistance or restrict its reproductive health programs largely underway in the middle- and low-income countries. According to Human Rights Watch, the policy triggered reductions in key sexual and reproductive health services from well-established organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-rescind-mexico-city-policy-know-all-about-contested-global-gag-rule-101611840181615.html
28-01-2021||World||UN goal to end child labour by 2025 deemed impractical, out of touch||A goal to stamp out child labour by 2025 is out of touch with global realities and could push many working children into worse poverty and marginalisation, a group of academics said this week as they called for more realistic targets.The United Nations launched the International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour last week, saying urgent action was needed to meet the goal as Covid-19 puts more children at risk of underage work and threatens decades of progress.According to the academics, the objective was unrealistic even before the pandemic disrupted schooling and increased hardship for millions of children around the world."Removing them from work is no help if this drives them deeper into the famine and broken lives that the work was undertaken to mitigate," said an open letter signed by 101 professors and researchers and published by Open Democracy.Also read| Why Kerala is reporting nearly half of India’s Covid-19 casesInstead of basing anti-child labour targets on "emotional and ideological convictions", the academics said policies should consider the varied experiences and coping mechanisms of working children and their families, as well as scientific research."The current global effort to eradicate child labor is based on the experiences of the ideal of white, Western, middle-class childhoods," said Tatek Abebe, professor of childhood studies at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim."It draws on the belief that children should go to school, and not participate in labour. However, the reality of children's lives in most parts of the world is not labour-free. Child labor is not necessarily bad," said Tatek, one of the signatories.Also read| Dubai puts more curbs on travel, hospitals as virus cases climbAppropriate work can bring educational benefits and should be encouraged, the letter said, calling for long-term strategies to eliminate harmful child labour in ways that improve children's wellbeing rather than striving for an outright ban.Tatek said improving children's working conditions rather than banning them from working, and ensuring access to institutional and legal support to protect them from harm and exploitation were more realistic approaches."Eliminating child labour as a resolution without addressing fundamental structural problems of poverty and inequality will not be successful," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Interventions should also be adjusted to other challenges such as climate change, which will further worsen children's lives and conditions in the post-pandemic world, the letter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-goal-to-end-child-labour-by-2025-deemed-impractical-out-of-touch-101611837077605.html

There has to be some other solution."The November 23, 2020 order had been passed on a plea moved by a man who had contended that a photograph of his deceased wife was being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.On Thursday, during the hearing, the counsel for the husband told the court that all the links to the objectionable content have not been removed by Facebook and sought time to place on record the existing links/urls.The court, thereafter, gave him time till April 12 to place on record the links/urls which are yet to be removed.The petitioner has also contended in his plea that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14, 2020.

It is number 88 of 290 decanters bottled by the company, and will be auctioned off by Bonhams with a book estimate of 300,000 to 380,000 Hong Kong dollars ($38,000 to $49,000).Despite the economic uncertainty brought by the pandemic, interest in rare whiskies remains high. Compared to other investment commodities, collectable whisky has done well in the past 10 years with a four-fold increase in prices, said Christopher Pong, wine and whisky specialist at Bonhams.“We have seen huge interest from all over the world, especially from young collectors,” Pong said.He said the Glen Grant whisky being auctioned is the oldest from the distillery. It comes in a Dartington crystal decanter with an American black walnut presentation box.Other whiskies featured in Friday’s auction include a 50-year-old Macallan Lalique, which is expected to sell for as much as 950,000 Hong Kong dollars ($122,500), and a 35-year-old Hibiki whisky from Japan in a Kutani ceramic decanter that is estimated to bring as much as 260,000 Hong Kong dollars ($33,500).Bonhams expects to fetch about 10 million Hong Kong dollars ($1.3 million) in the auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-72-year-old-scotch-whisky-to-be-auctioned-in-hong-kong-101611835593028.html
28-01-2021||World||Novartis seeks partners to make more Covid-19 vaccines, therapies||Novartis AG is in talks to help produce other companies’ coronavirus vaccines or treatments as the industry mobilizes to boost supply amid fights over access.The company is “in conversations with a range of different players,” Chief Executive Officer Vas Narasimhan said on Bloomberg TV, with an agreement possible in the coming days or weeks. “We have production capacity across our network that we’re willing to make available,” he said, for everything from monoclonal antibodies to vaccine production.The talks come amid a global scramble for vaccines that’s raised tensions as countries seek to nab supplies in the hope of securing a way out of the one-year-old pandemic. Sanofi threw its manufacturing weight behind Pfizer Inc.’s and BioNTech SE’s vaccine on Wednesday, saying it would give access to a production facility in Frankfurt after its own research stumbled.Merck KGaA is also considering several ways to help BioNTech increase capacity, including in the so-called “fill and finish” stage of vaccine production, a spokesman said. The company already supplies raw materials and research products to more than 50 coronavirus vaccine developers, including BioNTech.Germany’s Health Ministry has been talking with companies about increasing production, a spokesman said in an e-mail earlier this month. A spokeswoman for BioNTech declined to comment on potential partnerships.Tension Over SuppliesPfizer and BioNTech cut shipments of their vaccine, which was the first to market at the end of last year, to some governments this month due to renovations at a factory in Belgium. Then AstraZeneca Plc -- which may get EU approval for its shot on Friday -- announced delays to previously scheduled deliveries to the continent.The supply crunch has raised political tension between the European Union and Astra, which rejected demands that it take supplies from its U.K. factories to increase doses going to the bloc.Novartis’s Narasimhan, a physician who once led the company’s vaccines unit, has some personal experience being in the hot seat over pandemic shots. He oversaw the Novartis response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009 and was called to testify before the House Oversight Committee about why vaccines weren’t ready on time.Road Bumps“The early stages of scaling up from a few tens of thousands of doses to hundreds of millions of doses in general is a challenging scale-up,” he said in a separate interview. “It’s not surprising that we have some bumps in the road. What’s important right now is that we manage public expectations appropriately, and then I think the supplies will start to come through.”The fact that there are several shots available so soon into the pandemic is already a feat, he said.Unlike Sanofi, Novartis isn’t working on developing its own pandemic vaccine. The company sold its vaccines unit to GlaxoSmithKline Plc -- Sanofi’s partner for the shot that’s suffered delays -- several years ago.But Novartis makes more than 70 billion doses of medicines each year across 50 facilities, and the Swiss drugmaker is investigating how best to deploy that capacity, according to Narasimhan.“We have the capabilities to make many of these different technologies available,” he said.Novartis shares traded about 1% lower in Zurich amid a general stock market retreat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novartis-seeks-partners-to-make-more-covid-19-vaccines-therapies-101611834788967.html

She might not have expected the seismic impact at home.But Cheney's vote against Donald Trump has put her home state of Wyoming — by some measures the most Republican state in the country — on the front lines of the GOP civil war. The rising GOP leader and daughter of a former vice president is now facing the prospect of censure from the state party, a primary challenge and the wrath of Trump and his loyalists vowing to make her pay.On Thursday, Rep. Matt Gaetz, an ardent Trump ally from Florida, will stage a rally in Cheyenne at the Capitol, taking the fight to oust Cheney from her leadership post to her home turf and calling on “patriots” to turn out. House Republicans are expected to decide next week whether to strip Cheney of her job as House conference chair.Cheney's fate at home and in Washington will be one indicator of whether GOP traditionalists or Trump-aligned activists determine the direction of the party. Her troubles have already served as a warning for Republicans in the Senate, most of whom signaled Tuesday they would vote to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting an insurrection. Meanwhile, Trump’s political action committee, Save America, is using a poll it commissioned on Cheney’s popularity with Wyoming voters to taunt her — and show other Republicans what may lie ahead when they don’t support Trump.Cheney's defenders have sought to cast the blowback from her vote as ginned up by attention-seekers. “Wyoming doesn’t like it when outsiders come into our state and try to tell us what to do,” said Amy Edmonds, a former Cheney staffer and past state legislator, pointedly at Gaetz.But there’s little doubt the lawmaker in her third term is facing homegrown opposition in a state where the establishment’s once-firm grip has been slipping.Republican state Sen. Anthony Bouchard, a gun rights activist, announced his primary challenge against Cheney one week after her impeachment vote, making a clear effort to rally Trump fans.“The swamp was after me,” Bouchard said of his recent reelection to the statehouse despite being badly outspent by a Democrat. “I just don’t think that works any more in Wyoming. I think the people have figured it out.”To be sure, Bouchard, who is little known outside the Cheyenne area, has a steep climb ahead. He is a relative political newcomer who raised just $12,000 for his last race. (Cheney amassed $2.5 million.) He says he may show up at the rally Thursday, one way to start raising his profile. Other Republicans are likely to jump in during the coming months.Still, few imagined Cheney would draw a challenger after winning the state's only congressional seat with a majority close to Trump’s — 70%, more than any other state.Cheney spent the last four years dancing around Trump. She largely dodged questions about his racist comments and hard-line immigration moves, while occasionally criticizing his foreign policy. She called his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria “sickening." When Trump began urging lawmakers to reject the Electoral College vote, she wrote a memo warning of a "tyranny of Congress.”But Cheney, whose father held her seat for 10 years and who was raised in part in the Washington suburbs, described Trump's actions on Jan. 6 as a breaking point. Trump called on supporters to “fight” to overturn his election loss, in a speech shortly before rioters stormed the Capitol in an insurrection that led to five deaths. Notably, Trump called Cheney out by name in his speech, telling his backers they should work to get rid of the lawmakers who “aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world.”Cheney says she voted her conscience without regard for political consequences."It was something that I did with a heavy heart, but I did with a real understanding of the seriousness and the gravity of the moment," Cheney said the day of the vote. “My oath to the Constitution is one I can’t walk away from, is one I can't violate.”She has since sought to marshal the state's sizable Republican establishment in her defense. Aides have circulated approving editorials and letters to the editor, and long lists of supporters. Those backers include Gov. Mark Gordon, Sen. John Barrasso and Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who was one of just eight senators to vote against certifying Electoral College results in battleground states in the riot’s aftermath.Cheney also has the support of two influential state interest groups: the Petroleum Association of Wyoming and Wyoming Mining Association.That backing may be crucial as Wyoming prepares to fight new regulations from President Joe Biden’s administration that could hurt the struggling oil, gas and coal industries that are a pillar of the state’s economy.“Intraparty fighting and blind obsession with retribution for perceived slights are not going to bring back one single job,” said Matt Micheli, a Cheney ally and former state GOP chair.But in Wyoming, as in many states, the divide between traditional GOP interests and Trump-aligned, far-right activists is wide.Local Republican Party officials in three of Wyoming’s 23 counties have voted to censure Cheney for her impeachment vote. In a fourth, Republicans at an informal meet-and-greet Monday held an unofficial straw poll ahead of plans for a formal censure vote.“Based on what I saw last night, whew, it’s going to be overwhelmingly anti-Liz Cheney,” said Bob Rule, a radio station owner and GOP precinct committee member in western Wyoming's sparsely populated Sublette County, a gas-drilling hotspot. “They felt she used her own personal feelings about the situation and not the feelings of the people of Wyoming.”Several of the three dozen or so people at the meet-and-greet in the town of Marbleton, population 1,400, were newcomers there out of opposition to Cheney’s vote, Rule added.The Republican State Central Committee could take up censuring Cheney when it meets in early February, though state GOP Chair Frank Eathorne declined to speculate whether it would happen.Plenty of voters are suddenly receptive to the idea of not just politically dinging Cheney but also giving her the boot.“I made a mistake voting for her,” said Misty Shassetz, 43, a grocery store employee in Casper.“This is Trump country, you know, that’s who we voted for. What she did was wrong. I just feel like the voters need somebody who actually speaks for the voters,” Shassetz said. “And she is not it.”Cheney has some time to try to win back voters like Shassetz, notes Don Warfield, a retired public relations consultant.“If people are still as angry in the summer of 2022 as they are now, Liz Cheney faces some real problems,” Warfield said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liz-cheney-faces-blowback-for-vote-to-impeach-trump-101611831232471.html
28-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s new CDC director takes over institution in crisis||The new leader of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is confronting two difficult missions at the same time: Leading the agency’s Covid-19 response amid the pandemic and trying to restore the agency’s stature after its profile was diminished during the Trump administration.Rochelle Walensky, who most recently was chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, has treated patients on the front lines of the Covid-19 outbreak. The director’s post doesn’t require Senate confirmation, and Walensky took office last week.She arrives in an accelerating crisis: More than 140,000 Americans have died from Covid since her appointment was announced Dec. 7. While new cases have slowed over the past two weeks, new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are spreading faster, threatening to sicken and kill even more.Walensky inherits an agency whose reputation has been tarnished. Early in the pandemic, the Trump administration halted the CDC’s briefings and the agency faded from view. By the fall, mounting evidence showed how administration officials interfered in the agency’s work, slowing down publication of guidance and stalling access to $1 billion in pandemic aid Congress intended for the agency.Hours after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, Walensky ordered a “comprehensive review” of all CDC guidance on Covid. Guidelines would be updated “so that people can make decisions and take action based upon the best available evidence,” she said in a news release.“We recognized, early on, that getting the right person to lead CDC was really, really important,” said Jeff Zients, who served as Biden’s transition co-chair and now is White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator. “It was important because we were in the middle of a pandemic, and also for returning CDC to where it should be -- which is science- and fact-based. That was an important thing to do overall.”Biden’s national Covid response strategy released on Jan. 21 describes some of the work ahead for the agency: the CDC should update guidance with ways to monitor Covid’s spread in settings like health-care facilities, schools, workplaces and the broader community. The recommendations should include “metric-driven reopening guidance that the federal government communicates widely,” according to the plan.The CDC also will deploy support teams to help schools with Covid testing, create a testing plan for the federal workforce and work with states to address inequities in Covid response.Practicing PhysicianWalensky, a Harvard medical school professor and practicing physician before taking the CDC post, is new to government leadership. Raised in Maryland, she went to Washington University in St. Louis, medical school at Johns Hopkins University, and Harvard University for a master’s of public health.She began her medical career in the midst of the HIV crisis and advised US and global health authorities on the virus. Before taking over the CDC, she occupied the prestigious position of chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital.Biden’s transition team conducted a wide search for a new CDC director, and Walensky’s name was mentioned by several people, according to an official familiar with the process. For some, she was a surprise choice. Yet among those recommending her was Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who is serving as a medical adviser to Biden.“One of the key people we talked to was Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Fauci really believed that Dr. Walensky was the right person to lead the CDC, so that was obviously an important recommendation,” Zients said. “In Dr. Walensky, we were able to find someone with the experience and the background to lead the CDC and that turnaround.”Celine Gounder, an assistant professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine who served on the Covid Advisory Board for the Biden transition, worked at Mass. General under Walensky, and considers her a mentor.“She’s just a really warm, empathetic, funny person, and I think is a pleasure to work with and work for,” she said. “If you’re looking for somebody that’s going to lead with science, but also with empathy and kindness and will be a good leader, I think she’s an excellent choice.”The CDC declined to make Walensky available for an interview. In a live-streamed interview with JAMA Network on Jan. 19, she said the agency’s scientists and civil servants need to have their value recognized.“They have been diminished. I think they’ve been muzzled, that science hasn’t been heard,” Walensky said. “So I have to fix that.”Reputation RepairRepairing the agency’s reputation also will require reckoning with early missteps that set the US response behind during crucial weeks. Problems with test kits left authorities blind to the virus’s spread.The CDC should “have a very open internal and external assessment of the things that went wrong, particularly the rollout of the laboratory tests, which was very problematic,” said Tom Frieden, who led the agency in the Obama administration and now serves as president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global health nonprofit. (The group receives funding from Bloomberg Philanthropies.)Part of the CDC director’s job is navigating between the agency’s Atlanta headquarters, filled with labs and scientists, and the power centers of Washington.“If Washington gets too far ahead of Atlanta, there’s going to be a disconnect,” said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, who worked at the CDC for five years.Walensky also will have to face dissatisfaction among some career officials and staff at the CDC that goes beyond its role in pandemic response. In July, more than 1,000 employees signed a letter protesting “acts of racism and discrimination” at the agency and calling for more Black representation among leadership, according to media reports.The new director acknowledged that her status as an outsider to the CDC confers both advantages and handicaps.“I will have all of the benefit of coming in from the outside and being able to look in and say: This feels really broken,” she said in the JAMA interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-new-cdc-director-takes-over-institution-in-crisis-101611832545577.html
28-01-2021||World||Explained: How experts will hunt for Covid-19 origins in China||After a two-week quarantine, the real work can begin. Maybe.A World Health Organization team of researchers emerged from their hotel Thursday for the first time since their arrival in the central Chinese city of Wuhan to start searching for clues into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.The visit has been shrouded in secrecy: Details of their itinerary have not been released, and it's unknown how much access China will give the researchers to the sites they want to visit and the people they want to talk to.Why is the team in China?Scientists hope that information on the earliest known cases of the new coronavirus — which was first identified in Wuhan — will help them better understand where it came from and prevent similar pandemics in the future.Researchers around the world are eager for access to samples taken from the Huanan Seafood Market, which had an early outbreak, and Wuhan hospital records.The team may visit the market itself as well as the locations of other early cases.It could also go to a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that was built after the 2003 SARS pandemic and maintains an extensive archive of genetic sequences of bat coronaviruses. US officials in the previous Trump administration suggested without offering evidence that the virus could have escaped from the institute.Experts say it’s unlikely that the new coronavirus emerged from the lab in Wuhan and overwhelmingly say analysis of the new coronavirus’s genome rules out the possibility that it was engineered by humans.The researchers might also visit the hospitals that were overwhelmed at the height of the pandemic in China and the local branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.The seafood market and other places where early cases emerged remain important because the virus is constantly changing, as the new strain found in the United Kingdom shows.Read | WHO China mission set to begin as US demands 'robust' virus origin probeWhat do researchers hope to learn?Wuhan is where Covid-19 cases were first detected, but it is highly possible that the virus came to the industrial city of 11 million people from elsewhere.Genetic sequencing shows that the coronavirus started in bats and likely jumped to another animal before infecting humans. The closet known relative of the virus can be found nearly 1000 miles (1,600 kilometers) southwest of Wuhan, near China’s border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam — at a site The Associated Press was blocked from visiting.People began falling ill in Wuhan in December 2019, and many had links to the seafood market. Scientists initially suspected the virus came from wild animals sold at the market, prompting China to crackdown on the wildlife trade.But the subsequent discovery of earlier cases challenged that theory. China's CDC said that samples taken from the market indicate it was likely a place where the virus spread, not where it started. The WHO team’s ability to further our understanding of the virus — and its credibility — could hinge in part on getting access to those samples.Studying the genes of the earliest known cases in Wuhan could provide clues to how it got from bats to people and whether it was through a mammal such as a bamboo rat or a civet.What obstacles does the team face?The big question is what China will allow the researchers see and do. The ruling Communist Party is concerned the research could shed light on its handling of the virus that could open it up to international criticism — and even demands for financial compensation if it is found to have been negligent.China has stifled independent reports about the outbreak at home and published little information on its research into the origins of the virus. An AP investigation found that the government has strictly controlled all Covid-19-related research and forbids researchers from speaking to the media.Another AP investigation found WHO officials privately complained that China had dragged its feet on sharing critical information about the outbreak, including the new virus’s genetic sequence, even as the UN health agency publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response.China, stung by complaints it allowed the disease to spread, has suggested the virus could have come from abroad. A government spokesperson has said the origins hunt will require work beyond China’s borders, including in bat habitats in neighboring Southeast Asia. An expert on the WHO team has suggested the same thing, and this is a possibility researchers are exploring.When will we know the answers?The search for the origins of Covid-19 is likely to take years. It took more than a decade to find the origins of SARS, and the origins of Ebola, first identified in the 1970s, remain elusive. But knowing where the virus came from could help prevent future outbreaks of viruses from wild animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-how-experts-will-hunt-for-covid-19-origins-in-china-101611832727578.html
28-01-2021||World||WHO warns "too early to ease up" from Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe||The World Health Organization's European director Hans Kluge said on Thursday Covid-19 transmission rates in Europe remained too high, putting health services under severe strain, and therefore it was "too early to ease up"."We need to be patient, it will take time to vaccinate," he told an online briefing. "We have learned harsh lessons - opening and closing, and reopening (societies) rapidly is a poor strategy" in seeking to curb coronavirus contagion, he said."Transmission rates across Europe are still very high, impacting health systems and straining services, making it too early to ease up," Kluge said. "Pushing transmission down requires a sustained, consistent effort. Bear in mind that just over 3% of people in the region have had a confirmed Covid-19 infection. Areas hit badly once can be hit again."Kluge said a total of 35 countries in Europe had launched vaccination programmes with 25 million does administered so far."These vaccines have shown the efficacy and safety we all hoped they would...This monumental undertaking will release pressure on our health systems and undoubtedly save lives."He said continued high rates of transmission and emerging variants of the virus made it urgent to vaccinate priority groups, but said the rate of vaccine production and distribution was not yet meeting expectations."This paradox, where communities sense an end is in sight with the vaccine but, at the same time, are called to adhere to restrictive measures in the face of a new threat, is causing tension, angst, fatigue, and confusion. This is completely understandable in these circumstances."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-too-early-to-ease-up-from-covid-19-lockdowns-in-europe-101611830090324.html
28-01-2021||World||Trump admin’s final wage rules will not apply for upcoming H-1B filing season||The final wages rule issued by the US department of labour (DOL) during the Trump administration will not apply for upcoming H-1B filing season. The registration for H-1B applications is likely to start in March and the rule, which was scheduled to take effect from March 15, has been postponed to May 14 in accordance with President Joe Biden’s regulatory freeze.The final wages rule would have forced American companies seeking H-1B, H-1B1 or E-3 visas for foreign workers to offer the same, or higher, wages as their local counterparts. The final wages rule also directed employers to recruit US workers for the position on the prevailing wage issued by the department when seeking to hire an immigrant under an EB-2 or EB-3 classification.The rule was intended to prevent US employers from hiring low-cost foreign workers and push Trump administration’s “protectionist” policy. During the last days of Trump administration, secretary of labour Eugene Scalia had said in a statement that the department was taking those steps to strengthen “wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour.”The department has now said that the proposed delay of 60 days will “allow agency officials the opportunity to review any questions of fact, law, or policy, the rule may raise”. This means that the wage hikes may be implemented but only after the DOL finishes its review process.Read | Biden admin withdraws Trump-era move to rescind work permits for H1-B spousesThe DOL had also issued an office of foreign labour certification H-1B program bulletin and a wage and hour division field assistance bulletin (FAB) on January 15 that revised interpretation of the regulations and accompanying guidance for companies that sponsor H-1B visa holders. However, the department is now also withdrawing the bulleting and FAB for “the purpose of considering the process for issuing this interpretation as well as reviewing related issues of law, fact, and policy.”“Accordingly, the requirements of the Bulletin and FAB are no longer in effect. The Department will notify the public of any further actions as appropriate once it completes its review,” the DOL website says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-s-final-wage-rules-will-not-apply-for-upcoming-h-1b-filing-season-101611829763275.html
28-01-2021||World||Belgium inspects AstraZeneca vaccine factory amid EU dispute||Belgian health authorities announced Thursday they have inspected a pharmaceutical factory in Belgium to find out whether expected delays in the deliveries of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine are due to production issues.The European Commission had asked the Belgian government to inspect the factory amid a heated public dispute between the 27-nation bloc and the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker. EU officials are under tremendous political pressures because the bloc's vaccine rollout has been much slower than that of Israel or Britain.The Novasep’s factory in the town of Seneffe is part of the European production chain for the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine.AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to cut initial deliveries in the EU to 31 million doses from the 80 million it had planned due to reduced yields from its manufacturing plants in Europe. The EU claimed Wednesday that it will receive even less than that — just one quarter of the doses that member nations were supposed to get during January-March 2021.According to the EU, the Belgian factory is one of four AstraZeneca sites included in the contract sealed by the European Commission and the company to produce vaccines for the EU market.“The Novasep teams worked hard to meet its obligations to AstraZeneca with unprecedented speed and commitment," Novasep said in a statement to The Associated Press. “Manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine is a pioneering process in terms of scale, complexity and quantity. We have worked closely with AstraZeneca and conducted regular and coordinated reviews of the production processes to ensure the active drug substance was delivered on time and met the highest standards for quality and stability."France Dammel, a spokesperson for Belgium's health minister, said experts from the federal medicine agency inspected the Novasep site. They will now work with Dutch, Italian and Spanish experts before delivering a report in the coming days.The EU said it expects to deliver the full amount on time and has threatened to put export inspections on all vaccines made in its territory. Stella Kyriakides, the European Commissioner for health and food safety, said AstraZeneca should provide vaccines from its UK facilities if it it is unable to meet commitments from factories in the EU.After a third round of talks with AstraZeneca aimed at resolving the dispute on Wednesday evening, Kyriakides regretted the “continued lack of clarity on the delivery schedule” and urged AstraZeneca to come up with a clear plan for a quick delivery of the doses reserved by the EU for the first quarter.A spokesman for AstraZeneca said after the meeting that the company has “committed to even closer coordination to jointly chart a path for the delivery of our vaccine over the coming months as we continue our efforts to bring this vaccine to millions of Europeans at no profit during the pandemic.”The EU, which has 450 million people, has signed deals for six different vaccines, but so far regulators have only authorized the use of two, one made by Pfizer and another by Moderna. The EU’s drug regulator will consider the AstraZeneca vaccine on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belgium-inspects-astrazeneca-vaccine-factory-amid-eu-dispute-101611829460248.html
28-01-2021||World||North Korea, US should aim for initial nuclear freeze: South Korean PM||North Korea and the United States should seek an initial denuclearisation deal that includes a halt to the North's nuclear activity and a cut in its programme in exchange for some sanctions relief, South Korea's prime minister said on Thursday.Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, in his first interview with a foreign media outlet since taking office a year ago, told Reuters "creative" thinking and mutual incentives were needed to get negotiations going again and prevent another breakdown.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former US President Donald Trump vowed to build new relations and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula at their first summit in 2018, but a second summit and ensuing working-level talks fell apart.North Korea had offered to dismantle its main nuclear complex in exchange for the lifting of major UN sanctions but the United States said abolishing the facility was not enough and North Korea should hand over its nuclear weapons and bomb fuel."We can begin with a freeze in all nuclear activities and reduction of some of their programme," Chung said. "It would be best if we could get rid of all of it, once and for all, but it's not easy and we need an alternative."The new US administration of President Joe Biden has not announced any new policy for North Korea. Biden said in a presidential debate in October he would meet Kim only if he agreed to "draw down" North Korea's nuclear capacity.Chung said limited sanctions relief could help revive and sustain the momentum of any talks as that was the most attractive incentive for North Korea."It makes an incentive only when you give what your counterpart wants, and that's what keeps up the negotiations," he said."South Korea and the United States know what North Korea wants."Chung's remarks came days after South Korea's President Moon Jae-in called for new US President Joe Biden to build on progress made by Kim and Trump.But it was the first time a South Korean official offered details about a potential interim deal that both sides should pursue.Chung said the Biden administration might implement a new policy but it had shown interest in the North Korea issue and would ultimately seek talks with it.South Korea plans to hold in-depth discussions with new US officials soon on how to revive the negotiations and whether the allies should postpone or scale back annual joint military exercises which North Korea has long condemned as preparation for war."Everyone knows that the problem cannot be solved without dialogue," Chung said. "Our job is to come up with creative ideas so that talks will be held as quickly as possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-us-should-aim-for-initial-nuclear-freeze-south-korean-pm-101611828382502.html
28-01-2021||World||'New historical starting point' with US military; China||Putting frictions aside for now, China says relations between the Chinese and US militaries are at a “new historical starting point” and should focus on cooperation and avoiding confrontations.Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Wu Qian said Thursday that under former President Donald Trump, military-to-military relations "faced many risks and challenges” but the sides now have an opportunity to reset ties.Wu said the two sides held a teleconference on Tuesday and Wednesday on the tracing of US prisoners of war and those missing in action from previous Asian conflicts, and “exchanged in-depth views on cases of concern to the US side and cooperation between the two militaries, reflecting the importance China attaches to US concerns in the humanitarian field.”“At present, China-US military relations stand at a new historical starting point," Wu told reporters at a monthly briefing.Such positive-sounding language fuels perceptions that China's leaders are hoping for a fresh start in relations and a more civil discourse with Washington after years of rancor, even while deep divisions remain.China resents US support for Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy it claims as its own territory to be conquered by force if necessary, along with the US military presence in the South China Sea and what it sees as a broad-based US campaign to restrain its growth.The US says it does not recognize China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea, accuses China of bullying its neighbors and maintains strong alliances or other relationships with Chinese regional rivals such as India, Australia, South Korea and Japan.The two sides have sought to reduce the chance of conflicts through agreements on unexpected encounters at sea and in the air, but risky incidents continue to occur. While the US disinvited China from its multinational RIMPAC naval drills in 2018, the two sides have had a limited amount of cooperation in non-traditional military fields such as search and rescue and anti-terrorism.“It is hoped that the US side, in the same spirit of professionalism, will meet China halfway, properly handle China’s concerns in the field of military-to-military relations, strengthen communication, control risks, avoid crises and push forward bilateral military-to-military relations on the right track," Wu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-historical-starting-point-with-us-military-china-101611827354604.html
28-01-2021||World||WHO China mission set to begin as US demands 'robust' virus origin probe||World Health Organization experts emerged from quarantine in China Thursday to begin a long-awaited investigation into the origins of the devastating coronavirus pandemic, which has shown no signs of slowing down.Global infections have shot past 100 million and governments are scrambling to get their hands on scarce vaccine doses, with a bitter row erupting between the European Union and Britain over the supply of AstraZeneca shots.Beijing has so far frustrated international efforts to track the origins of the virus, which has killed more than 2.1 million people globally, and only recently allowed the WHO team into China after repeated delays.The experts left their Wuhan quarantine hotel in a bus, wearing masks and peering at the media crowded outside, but it was not confirmed when they will get to start their investigation in the ground-zero city, or what they will be allowed to see.China has sought to deflect blame for the massive global human and economic toll by suggesting -- without proof -- that the virus emerged somewhere else. It has also been enraged by calls led by the United States and Australia for an independent probe."It's imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemic in China, and we've been supportive of an international investigation that we feel should be robust and clear," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday.She also expressed concern about the "misinformation" from "some sources in China".Beijing shot back Thursday, warning against "political interference" in the WHO mission.Relatives of those who died in Wuhan have accused Chinese authorities of deleting their social media group and putting pressure on them to keep quiet, apparently to avoid any embarrassment during the WHO probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-china-mission-set-to-begin-as-us-demands-robust-virus-origin-probe-101611825431679.html
28-01-2021||World||Russia detains allies of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny||Several allies and supporters of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were detained in Moscow early Thursday after mass protests last Saturday demanding his release from prison drew tens of thousands to the streets in over 100 Russian cities.Navalny's top ally Lyubov Sobol, Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva from the Alliance of Doctors union backed by Navalny and Maria Alyokhina from the Pussy Riot punk collective have been detained for 48 hours along with Navalny's brother Oleg.All four are reported to be suspects in a criminal probe into alleged violations of coronavirus regulations during the mass rally in Moscow. The raids came four days before new protests that Navalny’s supporters have called for Sunday.The 44-year-old Navalny, the most well-known critic of President Vladimir Putin's government, was arrested Jan. 17 upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusations.The overnight detentions of his supporters came after more than a dozen raids on apartments and offices of Navalny's family, associates and supporters in connection to the probe. Searched locations included Navalny’s apartment, where police detained his brother, and a rented apartment where Navalny’s wife, Yulia, has been living.Also Thursday, Russia's Investigative Committee said it opened a criminal probe against Navalny's top strategist Leonid Volkov, accusing him of encouraging minors to participate in unauthorized rallies.In a further challenge to Putin, two days after Navalny's arrest, his organization released an extensive video report on a palatial seaside compound allegedly built for Putin. It has been viewed over 98 million times, further stoking discontent.Demonstrations calling for Navalny's release took place in more than 100 cities across the nation last Saturday, a strong show of rising anger toward the Kremlin. Nearly 4,000 people were reported arrested at those protests.Navalny fell into a coma while aboard a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow on Aug. 20. He was transferred from a hospital in Siberia to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.Russian authorities have refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, citing a lack of evidence that Navalny was poisoned.Navalny’s arrest and the harsh police actions at the protests have brought wide criticism from the West and calls for his release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-detains-allies-of-jailed-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-101611824950860.html

It wasn’t clear how long it may be in place.The hold includes one on the UAE’s long-sought effort to acquire Lockheed Martin Corp.-built F-35s, a request that was granted in the final months of the Trump administration after the Gulf Arab nation reached a peace deal with Israel. The arms agreement has already cleared Congress, although even without the latest delay it could take years to finalize.The Biden administration would likely be loath to cancel the UAE deal because it could put at risk that nation’s peace agreement with Israel -- a Trump administration accomplishment that’s been praised by President Joe Biden.The UAE ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, tweeted that his country “will work closely with the Biden Administration on a comprehensive approach to Middle East peace and stability.“As in previous transitions, the UAE anticipated a review of current policies by the new administration,” he added. There was no official Saudi reaction.The UAE deal includes $10.4 billion for 50 F-35A model jets, $10 billion for different models of air-to-ground and other munitions and $2.9 billion for 19 MQ-9 Reaper drones capable of carrying munitions plus ground equipment.The US pause also includes a hold on issuing a formal commercial license to Raytheon Technologies Corp. to sell Saudi Arabia 7,500 precision-guided, air-to-ground munitions valued at $478 million. Raytheon can sell the weapons directly to the Saudi government after receiving the license.Raytheon officials previewed the sales pause to analysts on Tuesday during the company’s fourth quarter earnings call, though they didn’t name the country or munitions involved.Raytheon’s Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said “we had assumed that we were going to get a license to provide these offensive weapon systems to our customer.” But “with the change in administration, it becomes less likely that we’re going to be able to get a license for this and so we appropriately decided that we could no longer support the booking of that contract” as a sale.Included in the pending sale are Raytheon’s Paveway IV smart bomb, the most advanced version of which includes inertial navigation/GPS and laser-guidance for all-weather attacks. The US had sold about 8,000 earlier model Paveways as part of a 2015 deal that included about 5,000 other munitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slows-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-uae-for-review-101611823771750.html
28-01-2021||World||Polls shows Hong Kong residents' distrust of Chinese vaccines||Hong Kong people are less trusting of Chinese novel coronavirus vaccines than those made in Europe and the United States, with fewer than 30% of people questioned in a survey finding China’s Sinovac vaccine acceptable.The survey by the University of Hong Kong, in which up to 1,000 people were polled this month, showed that general acceptance of vaccines in the Chinese special administrative region was low, with only 46% likely to take a Covid-19 vaccine.Trust was significantly lower in the Sinovac vaccine, with 29.5% of respondents accepting it compared with 56% of people who would take one produced by Germany's BioNTech and 35% who would take one produced by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University.Hong Kong's government has ordered 7.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine and said it would be the first to arrive in the Asian financial hub, in January.But the arrival of the vaccine has since been delayed and the government said it is waiting for more clinical information.Before the pandemic arrived in Hong Kong in January 2020, the former British colony was roiled by months of anti-government and anti-China protests driven by a perception that Beijing was pushing the semi-autonomous city onto a more authoritarian path."How do you repair a trust deficit? I think there’s no quick and easy way,” Professor Gabriel Leung, dean of the University of Hong Kong's medical school, told a press briefing on the survey results, referring to the Sinovac vaccine."I think there is only one way, and that’s openness and really allowing science to lead."Hong Kong formally approved use of a Fosun Pharma-BioNTech vaccine on Monday, the first vaccine to be accepted in the city. The first batch of one million doses is expected to arrive in the second half of February.Hong Kong has secured a total of 22.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Fosun Pharma-BioNTech, Sinovac and Oxford-AstraZeneca, the city government leader Carrie Lam said in December.Fosun Pharma is German drug manufacturer BioNTech's partner in Greater China and is responsible for the cold-chain management, storage and distribution. The vaccines are being manufactured in Germany.Hong Kong has largely managed to keep the coronavirus under control. It has had 10,283 cases and 174 deaths over the past year.(Reporting by Farah Master; Editing by Robert Birsel)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polls-shows-hong-kong-residents-distrust-of-chinese-vaccines-101611824168573.html

The company has been accused by Washington of being capable of spying on customers, as well as intellectual property theft and sanctions violations. Huawei has denied wrongdoing.Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, placed the company on a trade blacklist and led a global campaign to convince allies to exclude it from their networks.The remarks come after Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, Biden's nominee to head the US Commerce Department, raised red flags among China hardliners in Washington on Tuesday by refusing to commit to keeping Huawei on the US economic blacklist overseen by the agency.Republican Congressman Michael McCaul, a China hardliner with no role in the confirmation proceedings, called on the Senate on Wednesday to put a freeze on the Raimondo process until the Biden administration gives a clear answer on whether it plans to keep Huawei on the blacklist."We need a Commerce Department with strong national security credentials and a Secretary with a clear understanding of the (Chinese) threat," he said in a statement. "Until they make their intentions clear on whether they will keep Huawei on the Entity List, I urge my Senate colleagues to hold Ms. Raimondo’s confirmation."The Senate Commerce Committee said Wednesday it will vote Feb. 3 on Raimondo's nomination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-vows-to-protect-us-telecoms-network-from-huawei-security-threat-101611823902805.html
28-01-2021||World||Joe Biden seen likely to keep US Space Force, a Trump favourite||To the last moments of his presidency, Donald Trump trumpeted Space Force as a creation for the ages. And while President Joe Biden has quickly undone other Trump initiatives, the space-faring service seems likely to survive, even if the new administration pushes it lower on the list of defense priorities.The reason Space Force is unlikely to go away is largely this: Elimination would require an act of Congress, where a bipartisan consensus holds that America's increasing reliance on space is a worrying vulnerability that is best addressed by a branch of the military focused exclusively on this problem.The new service also is linked to an increasing US wariness of China, which is developing capabilities to threaten US satellites in space and which has become, in the minds of some, the singular national security challenge. Russia, too, stands accused by Washington of seeking to challenge American dominance in space.“They’re building capabilities to use space against us. We have to be able to respond to that," Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the National Security Space Association, an advocacy group, last week, referring to Russia and China.As a career space officer, Hyten says he often gets asked what will become of Space Force under Biden. And while he offered no prediction, he clearly believes Space Force should remain.Biden has not publicly commented on his intentions with Space Force. His defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, has been noncommittal while stressing the strategic importance of space. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Biden's view.Although some see it as a Trump vanity project, Space Force is not the farcical force of the public imagination. In the military, it's seen soberly as an affirmation of the need to more effectively organize for the defense of US interests in space — especially satellites used for civilian and military navigation, intelligence and communication.While far smaller than any other branch of the military, Space Force is acquiring the standard trappings of a service, including an official flag, logo, seal and doctrine. It has launched commercials to attract recruits. After lengthy debate, it was decided last month that Space Force members would be called guardians, although they don't yet have an official dress uniform. The force is planning to expand its ranks from 2,400 active-duty members to 6,400 by the end of this year.Kaitlyn Johnson, an expert on space policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says bipartisan congressional support for Space Force makes it likely that Biden will not push for its undoing.“I think this is a good thing, as the Space Force has had barely a year to set itself up and get to work,” she said. Adds her think-tank colleague, Todd Harrison, “The odds of it being repealed are close to zero.”Space Force was launched in December 2019 as the first new military service since establishment of the Air Force as an independent entity in 1947. Its leader, Gen. John W. “Jay” Raymond, has a seat at the table with the other Joint Chiefs, although Space Force operates as part of the Department of the Air Force, much like the Marine Corps is a separate service but is overseen by the Department of the Navy.The push for more emphasis on space has gone beyond Space Force. A separate but related move in August 2019 reestablished US Space Command; it is not a military service but a central command for military-wide space operations. Space Command had been dissolved in 2005 and absorbed by US Strategic Command, a post-9/11 move aimed at freeing up resources to strengthen homeland defenses.Trump also reconstituted the National Space Council, which coordinates policy in civil, commercial and national security space matters. It had been dormant since the administration of President Bill Clinton.The push to create a military space service began well before Trump entered the White House. But his relentless advocacy dulled what remained of opposition inside the Pentagon, where some officials — especially in the Air Force — believed a separate service was unwarranted and duplicative. Gen. Charles Q. Brown, who became the Air Force chief of staff after Space Force was born, says it is time to stop debating and instead focus on making the best possible use of Space Force.Biden has said little about the military’s role in space, but he did bring with him to the Oval Office a symbol of his interest in space exploration — a moon rock brought home by Apollo 17 nearly half a century ago.Austin, the new defense secretary, has been noncommittal on the question of keeping Space Force. Asked by the Senate Armed Services Committee prior to his confirmation hearing whether he thought creation of the new service was “warranted,” Austin demurred. He noted dryly that Space Force emerged after years of study by Congress and other groups. He sounded unenthused.Austin didn’t suggest he would recommend scrapping it. He said he would study it, noting that space is a vital interest.“Looking ahead, the DOD space enterprise is still not well-integrated with other services and terrestrial commands, and there are several other challenges that will need to be addressed, as would be expected when establishing a brand new military service,” Austin wrote.The nonpartisan Secure World Foundation, which advocates for the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space, has urged Biden to build on the space policy decisions of the Trump administration, including Space Force.“Consistency across key national space efforts ... will help move the United States forward and demonstrate stability to international partners by avoiding the constant reset and lack of strategic direction that has happened in the past during presidential transitions,” it said in a report last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-seen-likely-to-keep-us-space-force-a-trump-favourite-101611823479477.html

"Absolutely, there will be no interruption to that.""But again, I think that the right approach to take with our friends in Europe is to make sure that we foster cooperative dialogue to see how we can do everything we can to help."British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday it would have been a "great pity" if the United Kingdom had stayed in the European Union's vaccine programme rather than set up its own plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-want-the-vaccines-we-ve-ordered-uk-says-after-eu-row-with-astrazeneca-101611823336012.html

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam dismissed the Sindh government’s appeal against the Sindh high court’s ruling to overturn Saeed’s conviction for the 2002 beheading of Pearl and directed authorities to release him. One of the judges opposed the decision, according to reports in the Pakistani media. A letter written by the UK-born Sheikh in 2019, in which he admitted limited involvement in Pearl’s killing, was submitted to the Supreme Court about a fortnight ago. On Wednesday, Sheikh’s lawyers confirmed he had written the letter. Sheikh had denied his involvement in the crime for the past 18 years. In an order issued on April 2 last year, the Sindh high court had overturned Sheikh’s conviction for killing Pearl, who was then the South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal. The high court also acquitted three men – Fahad Naseem, Sheikh Adil and Salman Saqib – who were sentenced to life imprisonment by an anti-terrorism court in Karachi. Also read | US says ready to try Pak terrorist Omar Sheikh in Daniel Pearl caseFollowing this, the Sindh government and Pearl’s parents filed separate appeals against the high court’s order in the Supreme Court. Sheikh was held in prison as the appeals were heard. Pearl, 38, was South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while researching links between militants in Pakistan and Richard C Reid, known as the “shoe bomber” for trying to detonate a bomb while on a flight from Paris to Miami in 2001. Pearl was later killed by his captors in Karachi. Sheikh, a British citizen of Pakistani-origin, was arrested in India in 1994 and imprisoned in connection with the kidnapping of three British and one American tourists. He was freed along with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar in exchange for passengers of Indian Airlines flight IC-814, which was hijacked by a group of Pakistani terrorists from Kathmandu to Kandahar in December 1999.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-case-pakistan-court-orders-release-of-omar-saeed-sheikh-101611821949580.html

The activists were brought in as the rallies they organized Jan. 23 allegedly violated sanitary regulations aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19.Tens of thousands of people in cities across Russia joined protests last Saturday to demand Navalny be freed from jail, where he is being held for 30 days over alleged parole violations. They were some of the largest unsanctioned rallies under President Vladimir Putin’s 21-year rule. The Kremlin has rejected calls from Western leaders to release Navalny.Oleg Navalny was let out of prison in 2018 after serving a 3 1/2 year sentence for embezzlement that the opposition says was used to put pressure on his brother.

It wasn’t immediately clear where they were headed.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. A major question is where the Chinese side will allow the researchers to go and whom they will be able to talk to.Yellow barriers blocked the entrance to the hotel, keeping the media at a distance. Before they boarded, workers in full protective gear could be seen loading their luggage onto the bus, including two musical instruments, a dumbbell and four yoga mattresses.Earlier this month, former WHO official Keiji Fukuda, who is not part of the team in Wuhan, cautioned against expecting any breakthroughs, saying it may take years before any firm conclusions can be made on the virus’s origin.“This is now well over a year past when it all started," he said. "So much of the physical evidence is going to be gone. The memories of people are imprecise and probably the physical layout of many places are going to be different than they were and how people are moving about and so on.”The mission only came about after considerable wrangling between the sides that led to a rare complaint from the WHO that China was taking too long to make final arrangements.China, which has strongly opposed an independent investigation it could not fully control, said the matter was complicated and that Chinese medical staff were preoccupied with new virus clusters Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.While the WHO was criticized early on, especially by the U.S., for not being critical enough of the Chinese response, it recently accused China and other countries of moving too slowly at the start of the outbreak, drawing a rare admission from the Chinese side that it could have done better.Overall, though, China has staunchly defended its response, possibly out of concern over the reputational or even financial costs are being lacking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-in-wuhan-departs-quarantine-for-covid-origins-study-101611819413979.html
28-01-2021||World||Why it's hard to make Covid-19 vaccines and boost supplies||With demand for Covid-19 vaccines outpacing the world’s supplies, a frustrated public and policymakers want to know: How can we get more? A lot more. Right away.The problem: “It’s not like adding more water to the soup,” said vaccine specialist Maria Elena Bottazzi of Baylor College of Medicine.Makers of Covid-19 vaccines need everything to go right as they scale up production to hundreds of millions of doses — and any little hiccup could cause a delay. Some of their ingredients have never before been produced at the sheer volume needed.And seemingly simple suggestions that other factories switch to brewing new kinds of vaccines can't happen overnight. Just this week, French drugmaker Sanofi took the unusual step of announcing it would help bottle and package some vaccine produced by competitor Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. But those doses won't start arriving until summer — and Sanofi has the space in a factory in Germany only because its own vaccine is delayed, bad news for the world's overall supply."We think, well, OK, it’s like men’s shirts, right, I’ll just have another place to make it,” said Dr. Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, a vaccine adviser to the U.S. government. “It’s just not that easy.”DIFFERENT VACCINES, DIFFERENT RECIPESThe multiple types of Covid-19 vaccines being used in different countries all train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, mostly the spike protein that coats it. But they require different technologies, raw materials, equipment and expertise to do so.The two vaccines authorized in the U.S so far, from Pfizer and Moderna, are made by putting a piece of genetic code called mRNA — the instructions for that spike protein — inside a little ball of fat.Making small amounts of mRNA in a research lab is easy but “prior to this, nobody made a billion doses or 100 million or even a million doses of mRNA,” said Dr. Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania, who helped pioneer mRNA technology.Scaling up doesn’t just mean multiplying ingredients to fit a bigger vat. Creating mRNA involves a chemical reaction between genetic building blocks and enzymes, and Weissman said the enzymes don't work as efficiently in larger volumes.AstraZeneca’s vaccine, already used in Britain and several other countries, and one expected soon from Johnson & Johnson, are made with a cold virus that sneaks the spike protein gene into the body. It's a very different form of manufacturing: living cells in giant bioreactors grow that cold virus, which is extracted and purified.“If the cells get old or tired or start changing, you might get less,” Weissman said. “There’s a lot more variability and a lot more things you have to check.”An old-fashioned variety — “inactivated” vaccines like one made by China’s Sinovac — require even more steps and stiffer biosecurity because they’re made with killed coronavirus.One thing all vaccines have in common: They must be made under strict rules that require specially inspected facilities and frequent testing of each step, a time-consuming necessity to be confident in the quality of each batch.WHAT ABOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN?Production depends on enough raw materials. Pfizer and Moderna insist they have reliable suppliers.Even so, a U.S. government spokesman said logistics experts are working directly with vaccine makers to anticipate and solve any bottlenecks that arise.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel acknowledges that challenges remain.With shifts running 24/7, if on any given day “there’s one raw material missing, we cannot start making products and that capacity will be lost forever because we cannot make it up,” he recently told investors.Pfizer has temporarily slowed deliveries in Europe for several weeks, so it could upgrade its factory in Belgium to handle more production.And sometimes the batches fall short. AstraZeneca told an outraged European Union that it, too, will deliver fewer doses than originally promised right away. The reason cited: Lower than expected “yields," or output, at some European manufacturing sites.More than in other industries, when brewing with biological ingredients, “there are things that can go wrong and will go wrong,” said Norman Baylor, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief who called yield variability common.HOW MUCH IS ON THE WAY?That varies by country. Moderna and Pfizer each are on track to deliver 100 million doses to the U.S. by the end of March and another 100 million in the second quarter of the year. Looking even further ahead, President Joe Biden has announced plans to buy still more over the summer, reaching enough to eventually vaccinate 300 million Americans.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told a Bloomberg conference this week that his company will actually wind up providing 120 million doses by the end of March — not by speedier production but because health workers now are allowed to squeeze an extra dose out of every vial.But getting six doses instead of five requires using specialized syringes, and there are questions about the global supply. A Health and Human Services spokesman said the U.S. is sending kits that include the special syringes with each Pfizer shipment.Pfizer also said it's factory upgrade in Belgium is short-term pain for longer-term gain, as the changes will help increase worldwide production to 2 billion doses this year instead of the originally anticipated 1.3 billion.Moderna likewise recently announced it will be able to supply 600 million doses of vaccine in 2021, up from 500 million, and that it was expanding capacity in hopes of getting to 1 billion.But possibly the easiest way to get more doses is if other vaccines in the pipeline are proven to work. U.S. data on whether Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose shot protects is expected soon, and another company, Novavax, also is in final-stage testing.OTHER OPTIONSFor months, the chief vaccine companies lined up “contract manufacturers” in the U.S. and Europe to help them crank out doses and then undergo the final bottling steps. Moderna, for example, is working with Switzerland’s Lonza.Beyond rich nations, the Serum Institute of India has a contract to manufacture a billion doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine. It's the world's largest vaccine maker and is expected to be a key supplier for developing countries.But some homegrown efforts to boost supplies appear hobbled. Two Brazilian research institutes plan to make millions of doses of the AstraZeneca and Sinovac vaccines but have been set back by unexplained delays in shipments of key ingredients from China.And Bottazzi said the world simultaneously has to keep up production of vaccines against polio, measles, meningitis and other diseases that still threaten even in the midst of the pandemic.Penn’s Weissman urged patience, saying that as each vaccine maker gets more experience, “I think every month they’re going to be making more vaccine than the prior month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-it-s-hard-to-make-covid-19-vaccines-and-boost-supplies-101611814126606.html

Safety and security of Indian diplomats and diplomatic premises are the responsibility of the host government," sources added.The Indian government further expressed hope that the Italian authorities will take action against the perpetrators and prevent such incidents from happening in the future, sources said.On Tuesday, members of Khalistani separatist groups and others were seen in support of farmers outside the Indian embassy in Washington DC.A protest hosted by Sikh DMV Youth and Sangat saw a few dozen people gathered in front of the Indian mission to criticise the new rules, which the Narendra Modi government passed in September as part of a broader effort to deregulate the nation's massive agriculture sector.Many in the crowd held saffron-coloured 'Khalistan' flags and chanted anti-India slogans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prokhalistani-supporters-vandalised-indian-embassy-in-rome-on-republic-day-101611813685827.html
28-01-2021||World||US demands 'robust' Covid-19 origin probe as pandemic surges worldwide||The United States demanded a "robust and clear" international probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, as a team of World Health Organization experts in China waited Thursday for the green light to begin its long-awaited Covid-19 probe.The call came as coronavirus infections shot past 100 million and governments scrambled to get their hands on scarce vaccine doses, with a bitter row erupting between the European Union and Britain over the supply of AstraZeneca shots.Beijing has so far frustrated international efforts to track the origins of the virus, which has killed more than 2.1 million people globally, and only recently allowed the WHO team into China after repeated delays."It's imperative that we get to the bottom of the early days of the pandemic in China, and we've been supportive of an international investigation that we feel should be robust and clear," White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday.President Joe Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had enraged China by accusing it of a botched response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and had led calls for an independent investigation.China has sought to deflect blame for the massive global human and economic toll by suggesting -- without proof -- that the virus emerged somewhere else.The highly anticipated WHO mission was expected to begin its work under tight security on Thursday as team members finished their 14-day quarantine after arriving in China.But relatives of those who died in Wuhan have accused Chinese authorities of deleting their social media group and putting pressure on them to keep quiet, apparently to avoid any embarrassment during the WHO probe. EU-Britain vaccine rowThe pandemic has surged despite many nations kicking off mass vaccination programs, and one major issue in recent weeks has been of demand for jabs far outstripping supply.With cases surging across Europe, the EU has demanded that AstraZeneca make up for delays by supplying doses from its factories in the UK.But Britain has told the firm to honor its delivery promises too as it tries to accelerate its program, even using historic sites such as the Salisbury Cathedral and Lord's cricket ground as vaccination centers.AstraZeneca has said there is simply not enough to go around.At least 90 million doses of that vaccine, which AstraZeneca developed with the University of Oxford, will be produced in Japan, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said Thursday, but local media said they may not be distributed until May.Pfizer, which developed its successful vaccine with BioNTech, has revised higher its production target for this year from 1.3 billion doses to 2 billion.While part of that is down to increased production, it is also impacted by a change in how the firm counts doses -- after initially saying each vial contained five, the pharma giant now says six shots can be extracted.Olympics doubtsVaccines are considered critical to eventually defeating Covid-19, which has continued to re-emerge even in nations where it was brought under control.New Zealand confirmed two new cases of the more virulent South African coronavirus strain on Thursday, days after an initial case that ended a run of more than two months without any community transmission.The Pacific nation topped a list published Thursday by the Lowy Institute, a top Australian think tank, assessing almost 100 countries on how they managed the pandemic.Brazil was ranked the worst, at number 98, with Mexico, Colombia, Iran and the United States also near the bottom.Vietnam, which made the top 10, on Thursday reported its first community transmission in nearly two months.The lack of success globally in containing the pandemic sparked doubts about whether the delayed Tokyo Olympics can be held at all this year.But the head of the International Olympic Committee insisted organizers were focused on how -- not if -- the Games will be held."Our task is to organize Olympic Games, not to cancel Olympic Games," said Thomas Bach."And that is why we will not add fuel to this speculation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-demands-robust-covid-19-origin-probe-as-pandemic-surges-worldwide-101611813315688.html

But he also said China would not yield on matters concerning sovereignty and territorial integrity."China will not back down. We hope the United States will respect China's core interest and refrain from crossing the red line," Cui said.Hong Kong, the western region of Xinjiang, the South China Sea and Taiwan were points of intensifying contention between China and the United States during the Trump administration.With the Biden administration expected to take a more multilateral approach to China, Cui warned that a coalition of allies against China could create "new imbalances".He said China welcomed Biden's decisions to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, and said China hoped to work with the United States on fighting the coronavirus pandemic and on global policy coordination to fend off economic and financial risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-treat-china-as-strategic-rival-says-china-s-ambassador-to-us-101611813079941.html

The organisation estimates that approximately 20,000 Holocaust survivors are still living in Europe."Throughout their lives, they have shown mighty strength of spirit, but in the current crisis, many have sadly died alone and in pain, or are now fighting for their lives, and many others are suffering from extreme isolation," Dr. Cantor said, speaking during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day event held online this week as quoted by NYT.NYT further reported that Holocaust survivors will be vaccinated this week in accordance with the program set up in Austria and Slovakia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survivors-receive-coronavirus-vaccine-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-101611811606943.html

Here is what we know about the matter:• This comes as a relief for the Indian community in the US that lived with uncertainty after the Trump administration sought to take away their work authorisation as part of a larger effort to protect jobs for Americans.• Certain H-4 visa holders, spouses of H-1B visa holders with approved applications for Green Cards, were granted authorisation to work by President Barack Obama in 2015• This was done primarily to help families cope with prolonged waiting time for applicants from India (because of a country-cap on annual Green Cards). • Nearly 90% of H-4 workers are highly paid women from India with college degrees.Also read | Joe Biden drilling ban leaves majority of US production untouched• The 2015 Obama-era regulation, which the Trump administration opposed but failed to rescind, applies to H-4 visa holders who are spouses (not children) of H-1B visa holders with an approved green card petition.• Trump wanted to rescind the order as part of his larger plan to reform the legal immigration system to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs and not foreigners, under his “Buy American, Hire American” policy. • His administration had joined a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era rule and later issued a rule rescinding it.• Trump and other immigration hawks in his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, for instance, by alleging it had been used by American companies to outsource jobs to foreigners on lower wages. • Indians have been the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the annual 85,000. • Trump administration had rescinded work authorisation for H-4 visa holders arguing they were taking away jobs from Americans, despite bipartisan pushback from Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-let-h-1b-spouses-work-what-it-means-101611811688637.html
28-01-2021||World||WHO team in Wuhan set to leave quarantine in investigation of Covid origins||A World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic was expected to leave their quarantine hotel on Thursday to begin field work, two weeks after arriving in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in late 2019.The mission has been plagued by delay, concerns over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused Beijing of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and has criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research."Slightly sad to say goodbye to my 'gym' & my 'office' where I’ve been holed up for last 2 wks!!," team member Peter Daszak tweeted, along with photos of exercise equipment and a desk in his hotel room."Moving into next phase of work now w/@WHO mission team & China counterparts," he said.The team, which worked by videoconference while in quarantine, is led by Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's top expert on animal diseases that cross to other species, and is expected to remain in China for two more weeks.The WHO has tried to manage expectations for the investigation."There are no guarantees of answers," WHO emergency chief Mike Ryan told reporters earlier this month. "It is a difficult task to fully establish the origins and sometimes it can take two or three or four attempts to be able to do that in different settings."The origins of Covid-19 have been highly politicised.The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric" early in the outbreak.China has been pushing a narrative that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.China's foreign ministry has also hinted on several occasions that the sudden closure of the US army laboratory at Fort Detrick in July 2019 is linked to the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-in-wuhan-set-to-leave-quarantine-in-investigation-of-covid-origins-101611810549034.html

This was the first call between the two national security advisers.“Sullivan reaffirmed President Biden’s commitment to a strong and enduring US-India strategic partnership based on our shared commitment to democracy,” said the National Security Council of the White House in a statement on Wednesday.The statement said that they discussed the importance of continuing close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, promoting regional security, and renewing efforts to collaborate on global challenges, including Covid-19 and climate change.India's external affairs ministry said that the two NSAs agreed to work closely to advance India-US relations, which are built on shared values and common strategic and security interests. They also highlighted the need to further expand the comprehensive global strategic partnership between the two sides.The external affairs ministry said that India and the US highlighted the need to collectively address challenges in the post-Covid-19 era and also agreed to work closely on key issues such as counter-terrorism and stability in the Indo-Pacific.The external affairs ministry added that in his conversation with Sullivan, Doval said that as leading democracies with an abiding faith in an open and inclusive world order, India and the US were uniquely positioned to work closely on regional and international issues, including combating terrorism, maritime security, cyber-security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nsa-dials-indian-counterpart-discusses-efforts-to-unite-on-global-challenges-101611800824995.html
28-01-2021||World||San Francisco to strip George Washington, Abraham Lincoln from school names||The names of Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and other prominent figures including California Sen. Dianne Feinstein will be removed from 44 San Francisco public schools, a move that stirred debate Wednesday on whether the famously liberal city has taken the national reckoning on America’s racist past too far.The decision by the San Francisco Board of Education in a 6-1 vote Tuesday night affects one-third of the city's schools and came nearly three years after the board started considering the idea. The approved resolution calls for removing names that honored historical figures with direct or broad ties to slavery, oppression, racism or the “subjugation” of human beings.In addition to Washington and Thomas Jefferson — former presidents who owned slaves — the list includes naturalist John Muir, Spanish priest Junipero Serra, American Revolution patriot Paul Revere and Francis Scott Key, composer of the “Star Spangled Banner.”Changing the name of Dianne Feinstein Elementary school, named for the Democratic senator and former mayor of San Francisco, has raised eyebrows. The trailblazing 87-year old’s star has dimmed in recent years with dismayed liberals joining calls for her retirement last year after she embraced Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham at the end of heated confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Judge Amy Coney Barrett.Feinstein's spokesman Tom Mentzer said the senator had no comment.The committee that selected the names included Feinstein on the list because as mayor in 1984 she replaced a vandalized Confederate flag that was part of a long-standing flag display in front of City Hall. When the flag was pulled down a second time, she did not replace it.“I want to ensure people this in no way cancels or erases history,” San Francisco Board of Education President Gabriela Lopez said, commenting specifically about Feinstein and the wider group as well. “But it does shift from upholding them and honoring them, and these opportunities are a great way to have that conversation about our past and have an opportunity to uplift new voices.”Lopez said the decision is timely and important and sends a strong message that goes beyond racism tied to slavery and condemns wider “racist symbols and white supremacy culture we see in our country.”For some San Francisco parents, the brush stroke was too broad.“This is a bit of a joke. It’s almost like a parody of leftist activism,” said Gerald Kanapathy, a father of two young children, including a kindergartener at a San Francisco school not on the list.“I don’t particularly mind the notion that some of the schools need to be renamed. There are a lot of questionable choices out there,” he said. “But they sort of decided on this and pushed it through without much community input.”A group called Families for San Francisco opposed the vote for similar reasons, calling it a “top-down process” in which a small group of people made the decision without consulting experts and the wider school community.“We think it is very important for the community at large to be engaged to figure out who should be honored with public school names,” said Seeyew Mo, the group's executive director.“We would like to have historical experts to provide historical context as we are evaluating people from the past with today’s sensibilities,” he said.San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who is Black, called the move poorly timed given the coronavirus pandemic that has kept the city’s schools closed since March.“Our students are suffering, and we should be talking about getting them in classrooms, getting them mental health support and getting them the resources they need in this challenging time,” Breed said, adding that she supports the discussion of renaming schools but feels it should include parents, students and others and take place when classrooms reopen.The renaming process was led by a committee created in 2018 to study the names of district schools amid a national reckoning on racial injustice that followed a deadly clash at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.The committee was asked to identify schools named for people who were slave owners or had connections to slavery, colonization, exploitation of workers or others, and anyone who oppressed women, children, queer or transgender people. They also sought to change names of schools that honored anyone connected to human rights or environmental abuses or espoused racist or white supremacist beliefs.Lopez said the schools have until April to suggest new names, which the board will vote on, and the actual renaming “could take a couple of years."Historian Harold Holzer cautioned against what he called “a danger of excess” if the country takes a wrecking ball to its past.“I think there’s a danger in applying 21st-century moral standards to historical figures of one or two centuries ago," he said. “We expect everyone to be perfect. We expect everyone to be enlightened. But an enlightened person of 1865 is not the same as an enlightened person of 2021.”Holzer disagrees with the renaming of Abraham Lincoln High School, which the San Francisco committee said was due to the treatment of Native Americans during his administration.In the midst of the Civil War in 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation that freed slaves in the Confederacy.“No one deserves more credit for the destruction of slavery,” said Holzer, a Lincoln Scholar and director of Hunter College’s Roosevelt House of Public Policy Institute. “Lincoln is much more liberator than he is an abuser on the subject of racial justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/san-francisco-to-strip-george-washington-abraham-lincoln-from-school-names-101611801216289.html
28-01-2021||World||English Covid-19 infections starting to fall, but prevalence still high: Study||The number of Covid-19 infections in England is starting to fall, possibly reflecting the impact of a new lockdown, but cases are not coming down quickly enough and prevalence remains very high, a large study showed on Thursday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday indicated that the Covid-19 lockdown in England would last until at least March 8, dashing any lingering hopes that schools would be able to fully reopen in February.The Imperial College London study found that the numbers infected with coronavirus are at their highest since the study began last May.The authors of the study, which is known as REACT-1, said they had found that any effect of the English lockdown, introduced on Jan. 5, had been slow in lowering prevalence of infections, with the impact uneven across regions."It seems to be coming down in the last few days so we are heartened by that," Professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial, told reporters, after interim results published last week found no evidence of decline in the first days of lockdown."But ... we really need to get prevalence down more quickly, because the pressure on the NHS (National Health Service) is very extreme right now."For the study for the period of between Jan. 6 and 22, national prevalence was 1.57%, or 157 per 10,000 people infected, with prevalence highest in London at 2.83%.But by the end of the period, London and other areas of the South were showing declines in prevalence, whereas there was clear evidence of a growth in cases in the East Midlands. The pattern in other regions was that prevalence was flat.Health Minister Matt Hancock said the findings were "a stark reminder of the need to remain vigilant".The United Kingdom as a whole has recorded 101,887 deaths from Covid-19 - the world's fifth-highest official toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/english-covid-19-infections-starting-to-fall-but-prevalence-still-high-study-101611800181946.html
28-01-2021||World||Joe Biden takes sweeping measures to curb climate change, vows job creation||President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a new raft of executive actions to combat climate change, including pausing new oil and gas leases on federal land and cutting fossil fuel subsidies, as he pursues green policies he billed as a boon for job creation.The orders map out the direction for the Democratic president's climate change and environmental agenda and reverse the policies of his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, who sought to maximize U.S. oil, gas and coal output by removing regulations and easing environmental reviews."In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis," Biden told a White House ceremony, noting the threats the nation faces from intensifying storms, wildfires, floods and droughts linked to climate change as well as air pollution from burning fossil fuels. "It's time to act."Biden unveiled a "whole-of-government approach" to put climate change concerns at the center of U.S. national security and foreign policy as well as domestic planning. He said building a modern and resilient climate-related infrastructure and a clean energy future for America would create millions of good-paying union jobs."This is a case where conscience and convenience cross paths, where dealing with this existential threat to the planet and increasing our economic growth and prosperity are one and the same. When I think of climate change and the answers to it, I think of jobs," added Biden, who faces pressure from liberals in his own party for aggressive action on climate change.Biden's measures to address climate change have cheered international partners and environmental advocates, but have drawn opposition from Big Oil, which argues his moves would cost the United States millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue with the U.S. economy still battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.“With a stroke of a pen, the administration is shifting America’s bright energy future into reverse and setting us on a path toward greater reliance on foreign energy produced with lower environmental standards,” said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the nation's biggest oil industry association.OIL, GAS LEASESU.S. special climate envoy John Kerry said the United States plans to announce a target for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under the Paris climate accord before an international climate summit that Biden will host on April 22.Biden last week announced plans to rejoin that accord after Trump abandoned it, part of a previous series of climate actions that included blocking TC Energy Corp's Keystone XL oil pipeline project from Canada.China leads the world and the United States is second in greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists link to climate change. Kerry indicated the United States would work with China but would not trade other pressing concerns to make climate progress.Biden directed the Interior Department to pause new federal oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters "to the extent possible" and undertake a "rigorous review" of existing leasing and permitting practices. The pause will not restrict energy activities on lands that the government holds in trust for Native American tribes.Biden also set a goal to conserve 30% of federal land and waters to protect wildlife by 2030 and seek to double renewable energy production from offshore wind, also by 2030.The orders affect large swaths of land onshore in mostly Western states, as well as offshore drilling acreage located mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which combined, make up about a quarter of the U.S. oil and gas supply.The Western Energy Alliance, which represents drilling companies that operate in Western U.S. states, sued to block the federal drilling freeze hours after the order was signed.Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Democratic governor of New Mexico, which relies heavily on revenue from federal lands drilling, said her office would work with the Biden administration for a policy that “takes into account the individual circumstances and near-term financial reality of states like ours.”Lujan Grisham told Reuters in 2019 that she would seek an exemption from the White House if a federal drilling ban were ever imposed, but has not commented on the idea since.FOSSIL FUEL SUBSIDIESBiden also directed federal agencies to "eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law." It was not clear which subsidies could be stripped away under the order, given many of the industry's tax breaks are congressionally approved. Biden also said he would ask Congress to end the $40 billion in fossil fuel subsidies through legislation.The president said his goal was to achieve an electric energy sector fully without carbon pollution by 2035. He cited "environmental justice" in his plan to spur investment in low-income and minority communities disproportionately affected by pollution. He also vowed to help revitalize the economies of coal, oil and gas and power-plant communities.Environmentalists welcomed Biden's moves. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the president's action "makes clear he is serious about restoring and strengthening American leadership on climate solutions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-takes-sweeping-measures-to-curb-climate-change-vows-job-creation-101611799970825.html
28-01-2021||World||In multiple messsages, Joe Biden warns Beijing over expansionism||One week into the job, US President Joe Biden has sent a clear warning to Beijing against any expansionist intentions in East and Southeast Asia.In multiple calls and statements, he and his top security officials have underscored support for allies Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, signalling Washington's rejection of China's disputed territorial claims in those areas.On Wednesday, Biden told Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga that his administration is committed to defending Japan, including the Senkaku Islands, which are claimed both by Japan and China, which calls them the Diaoyu Islands.That stance was echoed by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who told Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi on Saturday that the contested islands were covered by the US-Japan Security Treaty.Austin affirmed that the United States "remains opposed to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea," according to a Pentagon statement on the call.Meanwhile, three days into the Biden administration, State Department spokesman Ned Price warned China about menacing Taiwan after it repeatedly sent more than a dozen military fighters and bombers through the island's air defense zone."We will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity security and values in the Indo-Pacific region -- and that includes deepening our ties with Democratic Taiwan," Price said in a statement."Our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid."Those comments and others sought to emphasize that the new Biden administration will not deviate from the firm security stance towards China that it inherited from ex-president Donald Trump.- 'A free and open Indo-Pacific' -Washington has long sided with allies such as South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia in rejecting disputed Chinese territorial claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea.But the Trump administration raised the tone of that rejection when then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo declared last July that most of Beijing's maritime claims in the South China Sea were "completely unlawful."In his first overseas contacts after taking office, Austin included not only Japan but also counterparts in Australia, South Korea and India.Over the past three years, Washington has expanded defense cooperation with India, which sees China posing a military threat both on its northern border and in the seas to the south.In a call with Indian defense minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday, Austin observed that the two countries' defense partnership "is built upon shared values and a common interest in ensuring the Indo-Pacific region remains free and open," said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby.A similar China-directed refrain echoed through Austin's call with Australian defense minister Linda Reynolds on Tuesday.Austin "emphasized the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific, founded on existing international law and norms in a region free of malign behavior," Kirby said.To underscore the unchanged US stance in Asia, on January 24, the fourth day of the new Biden administration, the US aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a so-called "freedom of navigation" mission in the South China Sea, sailing in or close to waters that China claims to underscore Washington's rejection of those claims.In addition, even as his initial focus for the US Defense Department is battling the coronavirus, Austin is expected to make Asia his first destination on an international trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-multiple-messsages-joe-biden-warns-beijing-over-expansionism-101611799053899.html
28-01-2021||World||US terrorism alert warns of politically motivated violence||The Department of Homeland Security issued a national terrorism bulletin Wednesday warning of the lingering potential for violence from people motivated by antigovernment sentiment after President Joe Biden's election, suggesting the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol may embolden extremists and set the stage for additional attacks.The department did not cite any specific plots, but pointed to “a heightened threat environment across the United States” that it believes “will persist” for weeks after Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration.It is not uncommon for the federal government to warn local law enforcement through bulletins about the prospect for violence tied to a particular event or date, such as July 4.But this particular bulletin, issued through the department’s National Terrorism Advisory System, is notable because it effectively places the Biden administration into the politically charged debate over how to describe or characterize acts motivated by political ideology, and suggests it regards violence like the kind that overwhelmed the Capitol as akin to terrorism.The bulletin is an indication that national security officials see a connective thread between different episodes of violence in the last year motivated by anti-government grievances, including over Covid-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results and police use of force. The document singles out crimes motivated by racial or ethnic hatred, such as the 2019 rampage targeting Hispanics in El Paso, Texas, as well as the threat posed by extremists motivated by foreign terror groups.A DHS statement that accompanied the bulletin noted the potential for violence from “a broad range of ideologically-motivated actors.”“Information suggests that some ideologically-motivated violent extremists with objections to the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or commit violence,” the bulletin said.The alert comes at a tense time following the riot at the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump seeking to overturn the presidential election. DHS also noted violent riots in “recent days,” an apparent reference to events in Portland, Oregon, linked to anarchist groups.“The domestic terrorism attack on our Capitol earlier this month shined a light on a threat that has been right in front of our faces for years,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. “I am glad to see that DHS fully recognizes the threat posed by violent, right-wing extremists and is taking efforts to communicate that threat to the American people.”The alert was issued by acting Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske. Biden’s nominee for the Cabinet post, Alejandro Mayorkas, has not been confirmed by the Senate.Two former homeland security secretaries, Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano, called on the Senate to confirm Mayorkas so he can start working with the FBI and other agencies and deal with the threat posed by domestic extremists, among other issues.Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush, said attacks by far-right, domestic extremists are not new but that deaths attributed to them in recent years in the U.S. have exceeded those linked to jihadists such as al-Qaida. “We have to be candid and face what the real risk is,” he said in a conference call with reporters.Federal authorities have charged more than 150 people in the Capitol siege, including some with links to right-wing extremist groups such as the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers.The Justice Department announced charges Wednesday against 43-year Ian Rogers, a California man found with five pipe bombs during a search of his business this month who had a sticker associated with the Three Percenters on his vehicle. His lawyer told his hometown newspaper, The Napa Valley Register, that he is a “very well-respected small business owner, father, and family man” who does not belong to any violent organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-terrorism-alert-warns-of-politically-motivated-violence-101611797409945.html

The number of brokers reporting higher office vacancy rates was the highest since the depths of the last financial crisis.UK retail landlords were already grappling with falling rents and values before lockdowns accelerated the shift to online shopping and forced more stores to close. The pandemic has also dented the outlook for office landlords as companies grapple with the economic fallout of the virus and question the need for staff to come in to work every day.Warehouses were the bright spot in the survey, with more brokers reporting an increase in demand and forecasting rents will rise. The world’s biggest real estate investors including Blackstone Group Inc. have been investing heavily in warehouses, betting the growth in e-commerce will underpin strong demand for distribution space.“Both the office and retail sectors continue to see occupier and investor demand diminish, with expectations for rents and capital values remaining deeply negative for the time being,” RICS economist Tarrant Parsons said in a statement Thursday. “The industrial sector seems to go from strength to strength.”Here’s a roundup of comments made by agents in the RICS survey:Kirsty Keeton -- Richard Watkinson & Partners in Newark, Nottinghamshire:“Understandably, the retail and office market has been quiet. Industrial sector is holding up with good demand. Office lettings have been agreed for companies downsizing/reducing overheads, with increasing tech, decreasing office numbers and increasing home working.”Simon Penny -- Altus Group, Norwich:“Very tough and uncertain times all round. Very little market faith and certainty. Companies that had planned to improve and take on more stock have put plans on hold.”Duncan Owen -- Schroders, London:“Offices are unduly hit negatively in the short term, and industrial warehousing may now be close to the top of the market for investment values.”Giles Hall -- Orchard Street Investment Management, London:“The impact of the pandemic has not yet fully filtered through into rent and capital values as government intervention has offset some of the downside. As the support and protection from debt recovery unwinds, I expect office and retail rents and values to fall further, unfortunately, as the full extent of tenant distress becomes clear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-high-streets-are-emptying-at-the-fastest-pace-on-record-101611795875177.html
28-01-2021||World||US will join nuclear deal if Iran complies with provisions: Tony Blinken||The United States is ready to rejoin the Iranian nuclear deal and start negotiations with it only if Tehran joins and complies with its provisions, US Secretary of State Tony Blinken said on Wednesday.The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), popular as the Iranian nuclear deal, was one of the key foreign policy achievements of the Obama-Biden Administration. The Previous Trump Administration withdrew from it.“With regard to Iran, President (Joe) Biden has been very clear in saying that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing and then we would use that as a platform to build, with our allies and partners, what we called a longer and stronger agreement and to deal with a number of other issues that are deeply problematic in the relationship with Iran,” Blinken said.“But we are a long way from that point. Iran is out of compliance on a number of fronts,” he said.With regards to how the US would engage in this issue if Iran decides to come back into compliance, Blinken said the administration will build a strong team of experts and bring to bear different perspectives on the issue.“One of the things that I feel very strongly about is that in any of the issues we’re engaged on, in any of the issues that we’re tackling and that our foreign policy has to confront, that we are constantly questioning our own assumptions and premises, that we do not engage in groupthink, that there is as much self-criticism and self-reflection as we get from, appropriately, the outside, whether it’s from you or whether it’s from people who disagree with the policies we’re pursuing,” he said.“So I think you can expect to see that as we move forward both with regard potentially to Iran and, for that matter, to just about any other issue we tackle,” Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-join-nuclear-deal-if-iran-complies-with-provisions-tony-blinken-101611795649284.html

And, increasingly, that relationship has some adversarial aspects to it. It has competitive ones and it also still has cooperative ones,” he said, adding that the cooperative ones are in areas like climate change where it's in their mutual interest to try working together.“I think and hope that we'll be able to pursue that. But, that fits within the larger context of our foreign policy and many issues of concern that we have with China, issues that we need to work through. And, so I think you'll see us doing just that, even as we pursue the climate agenda that is so important to our country and the future of our planet,” Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uschina-can-work-together-on-areas-like-climate-change-tony-blinken-101611794624683.html

Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in the new South African variant.The scientists are currently engineering a virus with the full set of mutations and expect to have results from that in around two weeks, according to Pei-Yong Shi, an author of the study and a professor at UTMB.The results are more encouraging than another non-peer reviewed study from scientists at Columbia University earlier on Wednesday which used a slightly different method and showed antibodies generated by the shots were significantly less effective against the South Africa variant.One possible reason for the difference could be that the Pfizer findings are based on an engineered coronavirus, and the Columbia study used a pseudovirus based on the vesicular stomatitis virus, a different type of virus, UTMB's Shi said. He said he believes that finding in pseudoviruses should be validated using the real virus.The study also showed even better results against several key mutations from the highly transmissible UK variant of the virus. Shi said they were also working on an engineered virus with the full set of mutations from that variant as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-only-slightly-less-effective-against-key-s-african-variant-study-101611794198867.html
28-01-2021||World||Facebook to stop recommending political groups to users||Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said the social network will no longer recommend politics-themed groups to users, a measure already taken in the US due to election tensions.The social media giant is aiming to shine up an image tarnished by the political controversy, including Donald Trump's rise the White House."We plan to keep civic and political groups out of recommendations for the long term and we plan to expand that policy globally," Zuckerberg said in an earnings call.He added that Facebook would also reduce political content in users' main news feeds as part of a push "to turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversation."The move makes permanent steps taken by Facebook to guard against being a platform for violent or misleading messages during the US presidential election.Facebook last week said it is asking its independent experts to rule on whether former president Trump's suspension for "fomenting insurrection" should stand.Facebook and Instagram suspended Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an attack on the seat of democracy that led to Trump's unprecedented second impeachment.The platform is referring the decision to its independent oversight board, which is tasked with making final decisions on appeals regarding what is removed or allowed to remain on the world's biggest social network."We believe our decision was necessary and right," Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said in a blog post at the time.Members of the oversight board come from various countries and include jurists, human rights activists, journalists, a Nobel peace laureate and a former Danish prime minister.Launch of the panel came late last year amid rising concerns about misinformation and manipulation around the US election.Reaction to the Trump ban has ranged from criticism that Facebook should have booted him long ago to outrage over his online voice being muted.Zuckerberg said the decision to dial down politics related recommendations stemmed from user feedback, and will apply globally to the social network."We want these discussions to be able to keep happening," Zuckerberg said."But one of the top pieces of feedback that we are hearing from our community right now is that people don't want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-stop-recommending-political-groups-to-users-101611792473152.html

"Mutual cooperation across the UK throughout this pandemic is exactly what the people of Scotland expect and it is what I have been focussed on."Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday criticised Johnson’s planned trip to Scotland, questioning whether his reasons for visiting are "really essential" and arguing it sets a bad example to the public.Sturgeon, who runs Scotland's semi-autonomous government, is hoping a strong performance by her Scottish National Party in an election for the country's devolved parliament in May would give her the mandate to hold a second referendum.If Scotland voted for independence it would mean the United Kingdom would lose about a third of its landmass and almost a tenth of its population - just as the world's sixth-biggest economy is grappling with the impact of Brexit.Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, has said there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a 2014 referendum. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the European Union in the subsequent 2016 Brexit vote, stoking demands by Scottish nationalists for a new independence vote after the UK as a whole voted to leave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-heads-to-scotland-amid-fears-of-break-up-of-uk-101611791343891.html
28-01-2021||World||Families of Covid-19 victims in Wuhan say they are being silenced||Relatives of Wuhan's coronavirus dead on Wednesday said Chinese authorities have deleted their social media group and are pressuring them to keep quiet while a World Health Organization team is in the city to investigate the pandemic's origins.Scores of relatives have banded together online in a shared quest for accountability from Wuhan officials who they blame for mishandling the outbreak that tore through the city one year ago.The effort has thus far been thwarted by official obstruction, monitoring of social media groups and intimidation, say next-of-kin.But pressure has escalated in recent days, apparently to muzzle any criticism and avoid embarrassment during the highly sensitive WHO investigation.A group on social media platform WeChat used by 80 to 100 family members over the past year was suddenly deleted without explanation about 10 days ago, said Zhang Hai, a group member and a vocal critic of the outbreak's handling."This shows that (Chinese authorities) are very nervous. They are afraid that these families will get in touch with the WHO experts," said Zhang, 51, whose father died early in the pandemic of suspected Covid-19.The WHO experts arrived in Wuhan on January 14 and are due to emerge from a 14-day quarantine on Thursday."When the WHO arrived in Wuhan, (authorities) forcibly demolished (the group). As a result we have lost contact with many members," Zhang added.Other next-of-kin confirmed the group's deletion. WeChat is operated by Chinese digital giant Tencent.Popular platforms routinely censor content deemed objectionable by the government.'Same old tune'Relatives accuse the Wuhan and Hubei provincial governments of allowing Covid-19 to explode out of control by trying to conceal the outbreak when it first emerged in the city in December 2019, then failing to alert the public and bungling the response.According to official Chinese figures, it killed nearly 3,900 in Wuhan, accounting for the vast majority of the 4,636 dead China has reported.Many next-of-kin distrust those numbers, saying the scarcity of testing in the outbreak's chaotic early days meant many are likely to have died without being confirmed as having the disease.More than two million people have died so far globally.While China has broadly controlled the pandemic on its soil, it has frustrated independent attempts to trace its origins.Instead, it has sought to deflect blame for the horrific worldwide human and economic toll by suggesting, without proof, that it emerged elsewhere.A team of WHO virus experts were finally allowed into Wuhan a fortnight ago.Their highly watched probe into the virus origins is due to start on Thursday, under tight security.Another family member, a retiree who says her adult daughter died of the virus last January, told AFP she was summoned last week by authorities and warned not to "speak to media or be used by others".Authorities came to her door on Tuesday "and sang the same old tune and gave me 5,000 yuan ($775) in a 'condolence payment'", she added, requesting anonymity.Official obstructionThe Communist Party government smothers anything that reflects its governance in a poor light, and the early days of the outbreak remain among the most sensitive topics in China today.Several Wuhan relatives have tried to file lawsuits seeking compensation and punishment of officials, but say courts have refused to accept them.The Wuhan government has repeatedly failed to reply to AFP queries regarding the families and their demands.Zhang called on the WHO experts to "bravely" meet with next-of-kin, saying the investigators are likely to be misled or obstructed by Chinese authorities.He said the families' hard-earned knowledge of how the virus played out could aid the investigation, though he acknowledges such a meeting is highly unlikely.The virus is believed to have emerged from bats and to have initially spread from a wet market in Wuhan where wild animals were sold as food.But little else is known.Another theory, amplified by former US President Donald Trump, is that it leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan where researchers were studying coronaviruses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/families-of-covid-19-victims-in-wuhan-say-they-are-being-silenced-101611788252425.html
28-01-2021||World||Biden admin to let H-1B spouses work||The Biden administration has withdrawn a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for spouses of some H-1B visa holders, a large number of them from India.The reversal comes as a huge relief for a community that had lived with mounting uncertainty after former President Donald Trump’s administration sought to take away their work authorisation purportedly as part of a larger effort to protect American jobs for Americans.“Withdrawn,” said a government regulatory posting from the Office of Management and Budget on Monday, for the order, “Employment Authorization for Certain Classes of Aliens With Final Orders of Removal.”Certain H-4 visa holders, spouses of H-1B visa holders with approved applications for Green Cards were granted authorisation to work by President Barack Obama in 2015, primarily to help families cope with prolonged waiting time for applicants from India (because of a country-cap on annual Green Cards). This was called H-4 Employment Authorization Document (H-4EAD). “Nearly 90% of H-4 workers are highly paid women from India with college degrees,” Cato Institute, a US think tank, said in a 2020 report.“It’s significant — though not unexpected — that the Biden administration wants to continue the Obama-era policy of allowing spouses of H-1B workers to apply for work permits,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship. “The 2015 Obama-era regulation, which the Trump administration opposed but failed to rescind, applies to H-4 visa holders who are spouses (not children) of H-1B visa holders with an approved green card petition.”Trump wanted to rescind the order as part of his larger plan to reform the legal immigration sysstem to ensure Americans had the first shot at American jobs and not foreigners, under his overarching “Buy American, Hire American” policy. His administration had joined a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era rule and later issued a rule rescinding it.The former president and other immigration hawks in his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, for instance, by alleging it had been used by American companies to outsource American jobs to foreigners on lower wages. Indians have been the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the annual 85,000. And the former administration had rescinded work authorisation for H-4 visa holders arguing they were taking away American jobs from Americans, despite bipartisan pushback from Congress.“We commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administration’s disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to the United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, a group founded by Facebook to lobby the government on immigration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-to-let-h-1b-spouses-work-101611778763690.html
28-01-2021||World||Former ISI chief Asad Durrani in touch with RAW since 2008: Pakistan||Pakistan’s defence ministry on Wednesday opposed former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen (retired) Asad Durrani's efforts to get his name removed from a no-fly list, saying he had been interacting with India’s external intelligence agency since 2008.Durrani has faced problems from Pakistan’s military establishment since he co-authored the book The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace with former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief AS Dulat in 2018. The government put Durrani on the Exit Control List (ECL) and the military stripped him of his pension, allowances and other benefits.The former ISI chief had petitioned the Islamabad high court to get his name removed from the ECL but the defence ministry told the court in its response on Wednesday that his name was included in the no-fly list because of “his involvement in anti-state activities”.The ministry said Durrani’s book contained material concerning Pakistan’s national security that was in “contravention of the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, 1923” and that there could be more publications “supported by hostile elements which contains content to create misperception, confusion, question marks against the top leadership circles...and to target the common people”.The ministry further said Durrani was “affiliated/interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW, since 2008. It contended that Durrani had submitted an “affidavit committing to refrain from such activities” but this was “still not seen in tangible terms”.Placing Durrani’s name in the ECL was not “malafide nor without jurisdiction” and hadn’t infringed his fundamental rights, the ministry argued. It also argued that the freedom of movement and speech were “subject to reasonable restrictions...in the public interest and integrity, security or defence of Pakistan”.The ministry said Durrani's name couldn’t be removed from the no-fly list because inquiries were still being conducted against him. It said he wanted to travel abroad to participate in conferences, forums and talks that will have “serious national security implications” as was evident from his latest book Honour Among Spies, which was published “through Indian publishers/RAW supported elements”.After The Spy Chronicles was published in 2018, Pakistan’s Military Intelligence had asked the interior ministry to put Durrani’s name in the ECL. Durrani had challenged the move in the Islamabad high court in 2019.Durrani's petition is expected to be heard again by the high court in the second week of February.In 2019, the Pakistan Army had said Durrani was found guilty of violating the military’s code of conduct. A military court later stripped him of his pension and other benefits. Durrani challenged this order in the Lahore high court. He informed the court last October that his pension had been restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-isi-chief-asad-durrani-in-touch-with-raw-since-2008-pakistan-101611773501103.html

The French-made jets were part of the latest batch of Rafales to join the Indian Air Force (IAF).UAE’s move reflected the growing defence ties between the two sides. Last month, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane became the first head of one of the three services to visit Saudi Arabia and the UAE.Modi and the crown prince, who is also deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces, discussed the impact of the pandemic in the region and expressed satisfaction that cooperation between the two countries hadn’t halted during the crisis.“They agreed to continue close consultations and cooperation to further strengthen the India-UAE partnership in the post-Covid-19 world. In this context, they discussed the opportunities for further diversifying trade and investment links,” the external affairs ministry said.Modi expressed his special appreciation for the personal attention and care that the crown prince has “always shown for the well-being of the expatriate Indian community”.“The two leaders shared their confidence that the Covid-19 crisis would soon be overcome, and looked forward to meeting in person in the near future,” the ministry said.The UAE is home to 3.42 million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. Experts believe the recent normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE could open up new opportunities for trilateral cooperation with India, which has close relations with both countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-abu-dhabi-crown-prince-discuss-ways-to-boost-post-covid-19-partnership-101611857401145.html

Addressing mediapersons, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that while the situation in the state was serious, the government was taking steps to contain the surge. On Thursday, the state reported 5,771 fresh cases, with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 9.87%, and 19 deaths. The active case load in the state is 72,392. In the last one week, almost 45% of the fresh cases in the country have been reported from Kerala. The state’s test positivity rate is five times the national average.“After 10 pm, [only] people with urgency will be allowed to travel. We have deployed 25,000 police officials for surveillance and activated grassroots health machinery,” the CM said while announcing the new “Back to Basics” programme to contain the pandemic. The CM said that a complete lockdown was not feasible at this juncture.The daily test rate will be hiked to 100,000 and at least 75% tests will be conducted by the RT-PCR method, the CM said. Experts earlier questioned the state’s dependence on the rapid antigen tests. Of the 9,459,222 tests conducted in the state, about 66% were rapid antigen tests, data from the state health ministry shows.“After last month’s local body elections people lowered their guard. Slackness gripped all sectors. And after the arrival of the vaccine many thought remedy is around,” Vijayan said. A study conducted by the community medicine department of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College showed that 54% people were infected in their own houses, the CM said. “It clearly showed home quarantine facilities did not work properly and many who came from outside transmitted the disease to their families.”A genome study is being conducted to find the reason for the surge, Vijayan said.He also denied any laxity on the part of the government, citing the example of European countries which are still struggling with second and third spell of pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-announces-new-covid-19-restrictions-as-cases-surge-101611857531925.html

They came with the problem of Seemanchal. Nothing more transpired other than the development issues of the Seemanchal,” said Vijay Chowdhary, while denying rumors of their joining the party.AIMIM MLA from Jokihat and late Md Taslimuddin’s son, Shahnawaz Alam, also ruled out changing sides.“There is no plan to change sides. We handed over a letter underlining the development initiatives needed for the region. No political discussion took place,” he said.The AIMIM, which contested polls in alliance with the BSP and Upendra Kushwaha-led RLSP, won on five assembly seats, mostly in the Seemanchal region.The lone LJP MLA from Matihani MLA Raj Kumar Singh also met chief minister Kumar “for development works,” on Thursday.A few days back, Singh had visited to state education minister Ashok Choudhary’s home during a book launch event, raising many eyebrows.Singh had won the seat by defeating JD (U) MLA Narendra Kumar Singh by a slender margin of less than 100 votes.“It was purely a visit to discuss development related works in my region. He is the CM of the state and we need to take up things with him. It was an unofficial visit, and no political meaning should be construed out of it,” Singh told a channel.A JD (U) party official, however, said that the ground has been prepared for their defection to JD (U) and “this is one reason why cabinet expansion is getting delayed. Development issues are just an alibi.”JD (U) sources said that if Singh joins Nitish Kumar's party, it would be a big setback for Chirag Paswan’s LJP, which not only contested the assembly polls independently but harmed the prospects of the JD (U) on many seats.Only recently, the lone BSP MLA Jama Khan has joined the JD (U).The JD (U) has 43 members in the present as against 74 of alliance partner BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-mlas-meeting-with-nitish-kumar-sparks-speculations-of-defection-101611856689967.html
28-01-2021||India||Two arrested at Guwahati airport for violating Covid-19 protocol||The police in Guwahati have arrested two people at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on Thursday evening for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols.According to the police, personnel on Covid-19 duty at the airport had lodged an FIR against 12 people who forcibly came out of the airport without taking the necessary tests. All of them had arrived on a flight from Delhi.The two arrested people have been identified as Dinesh Das and Jayanta Gogoi. It is reported that Das, a resident of Palasbari near Guwahati, is a peasant activist and was returning to Assam after taking part in the protests by farmers in Delhi on January 26.“The passengers violated Covid-19 protocol and prevented personnel on duty at the airport from carrying out their job. We have no idea if these passengers had taken part in the farmers’ protests. They have been arrested for not following Covid-19 safety measures,” Nabaneet Mahanta, DCP (West Guwahati), said.A case under Sections 353, 188, 270, 269, 294 of the Indian Penal Code and 51(B) of the Disaster Management Act for assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging duty, malignant act likely to spread infection etc. has been lodged at the Azara police station.Efforts are underway to arrest the 10 others named in the FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-arrested-at-guwahati-airport-for-violating-covid-19-protocol-101611856936043.html

If they are disturbed, so will the rest of the relationship.• While both nations are committed to a multi-polar world, there should be recognition that a multi-polar Asia is one of its essential constituents.• Each state will have its own interests, concerns and priorities, but sensitivity to them cannot be one-sided as relationships between major states are reciprocal in nature.• As rising powers, each will have their own set of aspirations and their pursuit too cannot be ignored.• There will always be divergences and differences but their management is essential to bilateral ties.• Civilisational states like India and China must always take the long view.Jaishankar said he didn’t have a definitive answer to the question of where bilateral ties were headed as the “events of 2020 have actually put our relationship under exceptional stress”.He also listed other issues that bedevilled ties in recent years – the issuing of stapled visas, China’s reluctance to deal with some Indian military commands and its opposition to India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, denial of market access, blocking of UN listing of Pakistani terrorists involved in attacks on India, and the violation of Indian sovereignty by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the harsh winter along the LAC in Ladakh sector after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failed to lead to a breakthrough in disengagement. A clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Naku La in Sikkim sector on January 20, which resulted in injuries on both sides, has added to concerns about possible expansion of the dragging standoff.Jaishankar spoke of “painstaking and arduous” efforts to rebuild ties after the 1962 border war, saying the two sides had exchanged ambassadors only in 1976, and the first prime ministerial visit to China since 1954 had happened in 1988. “The quality of our ties in many ways was impacted both by the border conflict and the lost decades thereafter,” he said.Over the past three decades, China became one of India’s largest trading partners and a “complex but practical” set of agreements focused on the management of border areas while both sides conducted negotiations on the boundary dispute, he said.“The advancement of ties in this period was clearly predicated on ensuring that peace and tranquillity was not disturbed and that the LAC was both observed and respected by both sides,” he added.Jaishankar said the agreements explicitly stated the two countries would refrain from massing troops on the border.“But at the same time, there was also increasing construction of border infrastructure, especially on the Chinese side. Since 2014, there may have been more efforts by India to reduce this very considerable gap, including greater budget commitments and a better road-building record,” he said. “Nevertheless, the infrastructure differential remains significant and as we saw last year, consequential.”Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said a lot will now depend on China’s response to the proposals made by Jaishankar and how they are received in Beijing.“There is a lot of talk globally on decoupling from the Chinese economy, diversifying supply chains and how the Belt and Road Initiative leads to debt diplomacy but the world is finding it difficult to change China’s behaviour. A lot will depend on critical mobilisation by India’s partners to change China’s behaviour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-lists-8-principles-to-repair-ties-with-china-stresses-mutual-respect-101611855097140.html
28-01-2021||India||Issuance of lookout notices against farmer leaders 'absolutely wrong': Punjab CM||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday said the Delhi Police issuing lookout notices against farmer leaders over the tractor rally violence is "absolutely wrong".He also said treating the farmers as "flight risk" was not only “illogical but condemnable"."Where will they flee?" asked the chief minister, adding that most of them are small farmers with small land holdings and not some "big corporate raiders" who had fled over the past few years after "looting" the country of billions of rupees."You failed to stop these bigwigs but are now targeting these small farmers fighting for their survival," he said and appealed to the Centre to immediately direct the Delhi Police to withdraw the lookout notices.The Delhi Police has issued lookout notices against farmer leaders who have been named in an FIR filed in connection with the violence that broke out during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital on Republic Day.A lookout notice is issued to prevent an accused from leaving the country.In a statement here, the chief minister also questioned the Delhi Police's decision to name farmer leaders in the FIRs in connection with the violence without any evidence against them."How can you blame all the farmer leaders for the mischief done by a breakaway group or the handiwork of some anti-social elements, who instigated the violence at the Red Fort and other parts of the national capital,” he asked.He reiterated his demand that the Delhi Police not use the violence as an “excuse to harass” farmer leaders in order to “weaken” the agitation of the farmers.Singh said that all the prominent leaders named in the FIRs had already distanced themselves from the lawlessness of January 26.Not a single one of them had reportedly been found so far to have made any inflammatory speeches or seen indulging in any provocative acts, he said. If the police have any evidence of the involvement of any of these leaders, they should make it public, the chief minister added.Amarinder urged the Centre to ensure a free and fair probe into the incidents of January 26 so that the real culprits could be identified and stern action initiated against them.Victimisation of farmer leaders was neither justified nor honourable, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issuance-of-lookout-notices-against-farmer-leaders-absolutely-wrong-punjab-cm-101611855551372.html

28-01-2021||India||Bengal CM Mamata meets Hindi-speaking people, urges them to elect TMC||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday directly appealed to people from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states to vote for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and campaign against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls due in March-April.“I have always accepted people who speak Hindi, Punjabi and other languages as our brothers. Have any of you ever faced any problem in Bengal? I never differentiated between languages and regional backgrounds. Support us and we will take care of you as always,” Banerjee said at the TMC headquarters in Kolkata while addressing members of communities who speak Hindi or other regional languages. They were invited to the TMC office for the first time. Senior leaders, including TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee, were present.Banerjee’s move was described as significant by party leaders since she has branded the BJP’s central leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minster Amit Shah, both of whom hail from Gujarat, as “outsiders”.On Thursday, Banerjee accused the BJP of creating a divide between Bengalis and non-Bengalis. “First they tried to split Hindus and Muslims. Now they are creating a divide between Bengalis and non-Bengalis. We have always believed in humanity and not divisions,” she said.Bengal has a sizeable number of Bihari voters who are mainly based in Kolkata and the districts of North 24 Parganas and West Burdwan. People from Punjab and Gujarat have also been living in Bengal for centuries. Bengal sends out millions of migrant workers while many Bengali families have permanently settled in other states.Last year, Banerjee announced that a Hindi language university will be set up by the TMC government. She has also revamped the party’s Hindi cell that was set up by Barrackpore Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh before he joined the BJP in 2019 and retained the seat.Last year, Banerjee also announced two state holidays during Chhath Puja, a popular religious festival in Bihar and the Hindi heartland. “Has anybody else done that? Nobody asked for it. I did it on my own. I am setting up the Hindi university so that you can study in Hindi. If I can study in Bengali, why can’t you study in your language? I have given recognition to all regional languages,” she said on Thursday.Without taking names, Banerjee said that while she manages to speak and read Hindi, some BJP leaders speak the language by reading Gujarati script from teleprompter machines. Banerjee read out a few lines in Hindi and talked of her love for thekua, litti, puri and similar snacks popular in Bihar and other states.“Virender Ji, the man who drives my car and the man in charge of my security speak Hindi and make the best littis. Have faith in Didi (as Banerjee is popularly called). This time around, we will win more votes. We will give a befitting reply to those who insult farmers. I want you to give me more votes than Bengali-speaking people,” said Banerjee, referring to the farmers’ agitation and the violence in Delhi several times in her speech.“Who are they to teach me Hindi? I will hold their ears and teach them Hindi,” said Banerjee who described herself as a “street fighter.” She even read out a Hindi sentence in front of the audience that applauded intermittently.Former minister Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP on December 19, held a massive roadshow at Arambagh in Hooghly district on Thursday afternoon.Reacting to Banerjee’s bid to reach out to Hindi-speaking voters he said, “She is free to address anyone. Ask her why she calls Hindi-speaking people outsiders. The BJP does not do that.”“People from all regions are my family. I made Rajiva Sinha, a Bihari, our chief secretary. Virendra, our director general of police, is from Haryana. We have so many officers from Bihar. They are doing good work. If i live with you all the time why should there be divisions during the election? You divide yourself in groups and campaign against the BJP in every neighbourhood. This is one promise I want you to make. Tell me that you will carry out this campaign while I tour the districts. After the elections I will take care of you,” Banerjee told the audience.Incidentally, Bhawanipore, Banerjee's assembly constituency in south Kolkata, has a sizeable number of Hindi and Punjabi speaking voters. Analysis of the last Lok Sabha poll results showed that the TMC was trailing in one of the civic body areas in Bhawanipore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-cm-mamata-meets-hindi-speaking-people-urges-them-to-elect-tmc-101611849755595.html

28-01-2021||India||All you need to know about Maharashtra-Karnataka border row||The leaders of Maharashtra and Karnataka are engaged in a war of words over which state should have the ownership of certain border areas. In a fresh attack Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi demanded that Mumbai be made part of his state.Savadi's Maharashtra counterpart Ajit Pawar said Mumbai belongs to Maharashtra and will always be its part.The issue is pending before the Supreme Court. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had earlier said that areas in north Karnataka which are dominated by Marathi-speakers be declared a union territory till the Supreme Court gives final verdict. The dispute is pending before the top court.Here is everything you need to know about the border dispute that has led to emotional attacks:The origin of the border dispute and Maharashtra's claimThe border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The law made Belgaum and 10 talukas of Bombay State, once part of colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. The act divided states on linguistic lines and became effective from November 1, 1956.Maharashtra opposed the move arguing that Belgaum, Nipani and Karwar had a majority of Marathi speaking population and should have been part of the state. The actual dispute is over 800-odd villages in two Karnataka border districts, Gulbarga and Belgaum.The Marathi speaking people in these areas have been protesting for inclusion in Maharashtra for five decades and have often alleged that Karnataka government has been trying to suppress their agitation as well as imposing Kannada language on them.Karnataka's standThe government of Karnataka has maintained that the villages are an integral part of the state. Chief minister Yediyurappa had ctiricised Thackeray's statement in which he said that areas of Karnataka where Marathi-speaking people are in majority will be incorporated in Maharashtra.Yediyurappa said it is painful that the chief minister of Maharashtra is trying to sabotage an amicable atmosphere.The Karnataka government has said that it considers the Mahajan Commission report to be final on the issue.What is the Mahajan Commission report?The government of India had constituted the commission in 1966 under the chairmanship of former former Chief Justice of India Mehr Chand Mahajan at the insistence of the Maharashtra government.A year later, when the Mahajan Commission gave its report, it recommended merger of some villages in Belgaum district in north Karnataka with Maharashtra, but rejected merger of Belgaum. While Maharashtra rejected the report, Karnataka welcomed it and has ben pressing for its implementation.What is MVA government doing?The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which is the ruling alliance in the state, is keen to take up the issue. Ajit Pawar, a leader of MVA constituent Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), had said earlier that Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray had struggled his entire life to unite Maharashtra by including Belgaum, Karwar and Nipani.Chief minister Thackeray too had said in a tweet on January 17, “Including Karnataka-occupied Marathi speaking and cultural areas in Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who were martyred in the boundary dispute. We are united and committed towards it.” Incidentally, the day was observed as martyrs day by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, the organisation fighting for the inclusion of Marathi speaking areas in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-maharashtra-karnatka-border-row-101611851981247.html

28-01-2021||India||ED books Amazon to probe alleged FEMA, FDI violations||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case against US e-commerce giant Amazon to investigate alleged violation of India’s foreign exchange and foreign direct investment laws, people familiar with the development, requesting anonymity, said on Thursday.The investigation, launched under various sections of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) is based on a recent Delhi High Court observation that the US-based Amazon’s attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements it has with an unlisted unit of a Indian company without government’s approval will be considered a violation of FDI (foreign direct investment) rules and FEMA, they said.On Amazon’ plea to challenge the acquisition of Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd for ₹24,713 crore in August 2020, the high court had said in its judgment last month that Amazon appeared to have indirectly obtained control of Big Bazaar without the government’s approval.Subsequently, the agency had received a reference from the Centre seeking action against e-commerce players including Amazon on the complaint of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which has alleged that these companies were violating norms in multi-brand retailing and indulged in malpractices.In a response to an email query by HT, an Amazon spokesperson said - “We are not aware of any new case by the ED against Amazon India.”ED officials dealing with the probe said they will examine all the issues pertaining to Amazon’s investment in Future Retail and points highlighted by CAIT in its complaint to the commerce ministry. “We will seek details from Amazon and other stakeholders,” an officer said, requesting anonymity.CAIT had alleged that these e-commerce companies were in violation of FEMA and FDI rules by adopting illegal structuring/investments and practices.CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal welcomed the ED probe. “It’s a welcome step that ED has registered a case against Amazon. We had complained directly to the ED as well as the commerce ministry seeking action against malpractices of the e-commerce company. Delhi high court has clearly said that there is a violation of FDI and FEMA by Amazon. As complainants, we really appreciate the step taken by the ED and expect that speedy action will be taken,” he said.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.Billionaire Jeff Bezos’ Amazon had taken Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance. An interim order was passed in favour of Amazon on October 25, 2020 by an arbitrator saying the deal should be put on hold.When Future Group filed a plea with the Delhi High Court, a single member bench last month rejected the plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide on the deal.The court had also made several observations indicating that Amazon's attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements Amazon has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be violative of the FEMA & FDI rules.Amazon has filed a separate petition in the Delhi High Court seeking detention of Future Group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block the Future-Reliance deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-books-amazon-to-probe-alleged-fema-fdi-violations-101611851371466.html

28-01-2021||India||India said to forecast 11% growth buoyed by Covid-19 vaccine roll out||India is predicting Asia’s third-largest economy will expand 11% in the year starting April betting that the vaccine roll out will contain the pandemic, while low interest rates and measures to lure investment will spur business activity, people with knowledge of the matter said.The return to growth will follow an estimated 7.7% contraction in gross domestic product in the year ending March, the people said, asking not to be identified as the numbers aren’t public. The projection formed the basis of drawing up budget proposals which will be unveiled on Feb. 1, after the presentation of the Economic Survey -- an annual report card -- on Friday.The forecast for next year is in line with the International Monetary Fund’s estimate for 11.5% expansion, which will once again make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world ahead of China’s 8.1% pace.A finance ministry spokesman was not immediately available for a comment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is under pressure to shore up economic growth after the pandemic resulted in widespread job losses and pushed millions into poverty due to one of world’s strictest lockdowns that lasted nearly two months. A raft of reforms have been implemented since, including an incentive program to boost local manufacturing and tweak archaic labor laws to improve ease of doing business.The government also approved the roll out of vaccines this month. Besides, the administration has ensured a step up in spending to reverse the growth contraction and there has been a significant increase in capital expenditure in the three months ended Dec. 31, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-said-to-forecast-11-growth-buoyed-by-covid-19-vaccine-roll-out-101611849906723.html

He was 57.Toy was diagnosed with cancer last year during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and had undergone treatment in New Delhi and later in New York. He recently returned to Nagaland, family sources said.The top ranking administrator served the state government in various capacities and took over as chief secretary in 2018.He was the first among Nagas to crack the Common Admission Test (CAT), the entrance examination for admission into the country's premier business schools, and was admitted to IIM Calcutta in the 1980s. He was also an alumnus of St. Xavier's College in Mumbai.Describing the late bureaucrat as a "humble, upright and dedicated government servant", chief minister Neiphiu Rio said his demise is a huge loss for the government of Nagaland and for the Nagas as a whole."We lost an able administrator and one of the finest human being! May his soul rest in peace.

While the rest of the country is busy relaxing norms Kerala has tightened restrictions to tide over the crisis.Talking to the media in the state capital chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan admitted that the situation is serious and the government will do everything possible to contain the surge. He denied any laxity on the part of the government and cited the example of some European countries which are still struggling with the second and third spell of the pandemic.“After 10 pm people with urgency will be allowed to travel. We have deployed 25,000 cops for surveillance and activated grassroot health machinery,” said the CM announcing a new programme named “Back to Basics” to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. He said a complete lockdown was not feasible at this juncture.The CM said the daily testing rate will be hiked to one lakh and at least 75 per cent will be RT-PCR tests. Many experts have earlier questioned the state’s obsession with less reliable and cheap antigen tests-- about 66 per cent of total 94,59,222 tests are antigen, statistics show.On Thursday, the state reported 5771 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 9.87. The active case load is 72,392 and it reported 19 deaths taking the death toll to 3682. Almost 45 per cent of fresh cases of the country are from Kerala and its TPR is five times higher than the national average.“After last month’s local body elections people lowered their guard. Slackness gripped all sectors. And after the arrival of the vaccine many thought remedy is around,” he said adding a study conducted by the community medicine department of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College showed 54% infected from their own houses.“It clearly showed home quarantine facilities were not done properly and many who came from outside transmitted the disease to their kin,” the CM said adding a genome study was underway to find reasons for steady surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-announces-new-curbs-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge-101611848855638.html

28-01-2021||India||BJP slams opposition parties for decision to boycott President's address to Parliament||Slamming opposition parties for their decision to boycott the President's address to Parliament, the BJP on Thursday accused them of "constitutional and moral bankruptcy".BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said if these parties think that the Modi government will backtrack from its support to three farm laws due to their collective pressure, then they should know that they lack such strength and that this dispensation bows only before people.Addressing a press conference, Bhatia said opposition parties had been calling for a session all this while as he hit out at them for their decision to boycott the address.A day before the start of the Budget Session of Parliament, 16 opposition parties led by the Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena and the TMC on Thursday decided to boycott the President's address to the joint sitting of Parliament in solidarity with the farmers protesting the new farm laws.The BJP spokesperson said all major opposition parties had spoken before these laws were passed in the last session, rejecting their contention that the government had rammed through these legislations without following due consultation.What they have shown with this decision is their constitutional and moral bankruptcy, he said.Parties like the Shiv Sena had even supported these laws in Parliament before making a U-turn, so did the Shiromani Akali Dal, he said.Bhatia also lashed out at opposition parties like the Congress, TMC and the Samajwadi Party for not "condemning" the "anarchy" protesting farmers unleashed in the national capital on Republic Day and "insult" to the national flag.Some opposition leaders had disapproved of the violence but alleged that the government's refusal to heed the farmers' demand to repeal these laws was a factor in it.Bhatia said it is the government which has shown much flexibility and an open mind in its talks with farmer union leaders.He also lauded the Delhi Police for its restrain and overall handling of the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-slams-opposition-for-decision-to-boycott-president-s-address-to-parliament-101611847306476.html

28-01-2021||India||West Bengal Assembly demands repeal of farm laws, Mamata Banerjee taunts BJP||The West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed a resolution on Thursday demanding repeal of the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre and extending its support to the protesting farmers.Speaking on the resolution on the second day of the two-day special assembly session chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that either the Centre should withdraw the farm-laws or step down from power.Later in the day at a function in the Trinamool Congress headquarters, Banerjee underlined that demand. “Interest of farmers cannot be compromised. Either you (Modi) withdraw the laws or step down,” she saidShe also said that there could be ideological differences between the political parties, but it was imperative that every party should unanimously support the farmers. She urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to call a virtual meeting of all chief ministers.“When everybody was scared to speak up after the Delhi incident, I said the farmers are not at fault. They are maligning the farmers. The government of India is responsible. It was due to your (Centre) intelligence failure,” the chief minister said.So far, five non-BJP-ruled states - Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Kerala and Delhi - have passed resolutions in their respective assemblies against the contentious farm laws.Banerjee also took a swipe at the BJP over the violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital, saying, “First tackle Delhi, then think of Bengal”.“The Prime Minister should resign. The home minister should resign. Today I passed a resolution in the assembly. Two or three BJP legislators came to oppose the resolution. When they were asked by the Speaker to speak, they stood quietly. So, I delivered a strong speech, and they fled the house. The BJP will try to malign me. But I know you are there to protect me,” Banerjee told members of the non-Bengali communities at the function.Earlier in the day, BJP legislators trooped into the well of the assembly and raised slogans. Later they staged a walkout shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’.“This is unconstitutional and against the federal structure of the nation. The language which she used was in bad taste,” Manoj Tigga BJP MLA told reporters later.Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader Abdul Mannan said that the TMC government does not have any moral authority to bring a resolution against the Centre’s farm laws as the state too had passed similar laws a few years back.Members of the Left parties and the Congress also rushed to the well of the House in protest against certain comments by minister Tapas Roy when he was speaking about the Victoria Memorial controversy.The controversy had blown up at a programme to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birth anniversary at Victoria Memorial after Jai Shri Ram slogans were raised from the audience prompting Mamata Baneree not to speak.Speaker Biman Banerjee ordered that the objectionable words used by Roy against some members of the Left parties and the Congress be expunged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-assembly-demands-repeal-of-farm-laws-mamata-banerjee-taunts-bjp-101611847626505.html

Another scene shows Marathi placard of an NCC battalion."Vichari", local Marathi newspaper, a 1912 report in Marathi of the Karwar Urban Co-operative Bank and the Marathi plaque on a bridge in Belgaum constructed in 1890 also feature in the film.While the issue of Maharashtra's claim on Belgaum and other border areas in Karnataka is before the Supreme Court, a fresh war of words has broken out between leaders from the two states.On Wednesday, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi demanded that Mumbai be made part of his state and the Centre should declare it a Union Territory until then.His remarks came after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that areas in north Karnataka which are dominated by Marathi-speakers be declared a Union Territory till the Supreme Court gives final verdict.The NCP, which is part of ruling alliance in Maharashtra, asked state BJP leaders -- whose party rules in Karnataka -- to clarify their stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/border-row-maharashtra-government-releases-old-documentary-to-make-its-case-101611846319629.html

28-01-2021||India||With 1.9 lakh job vacancies, Telangana govt is working at 61% of total strength||As many as 1.91 lakh posts have been lying vacant in various government departments in Telangana for the last six years and the state government has been running the administration with outsourced and contract employees by paying them nominal wages, according to a report of the pay revision committee.Headed by retired IAS officer C R Biswal, the three-member pay revision committee which started its work in July 2018, submitted the report to the state government earlier this month. On Wednesday, the report was made available to the public.According to the report, there are 31 departments in the Telangana government with a sanctioned strength of 4,91,304 employees. However, at present, there are only 3,00,178 employees, which means there are a little over 1.91 lakh posts lying vacant in various departments, which is 39 per cent of the total strength.Three lakh-odd employees, 76.88 per cent belong to only five departments – school education, police, health and family welfare, revenue and panchayat raj. The school education department has the highest number of employees, majority of them being teachers. Out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,37,651, there are only 1,13,853 employees in this department.In the police department, which has the second highest number of employee strength, there are 61,212 employees as against the sanctioned strength of 98,394. This is followed by the medical and health department with an employee strength of 22,336 as against the sanctioned strength of 52,906.The sanctioned strength of the Revenue Department is 27,786 against which 19,825 are working. In Panchayat Raj & Rural Development Department the sanctioned strength is 26,201 against which 13,573 are working.The Biswal committee also pointed out that Telangana was lagging behind in terms of population-workforce ratio, compared to many other states. While the population of Telangana is 3.52 crore, the sanctioned employee strength is 4.91 lakh, which accounts for the population-workforce ratio of 1.40.“Nagaland has the highest population-employee ratio of 4.09, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (3.59), Himachal Pradesh (3.16), Goa (2.87), Maharashtra and Meghalaya (1.69) and Tamil Nadu (1.66),” the report said.An official in the general administration department said on condition of anonymity that there has hardly been any recruitment of employees in the last five years, except a few thousands in school education and police departments. “The government has been running the administration by hiring employees on outsourcing and contract basis, instead of regular recruitment,” he said.According to the Biswal committee’s report, there are around one lakh contract and outsourced employees in various departments working in various capacities starting from drivers, peons, junior office assistants to senior assistants with a monthly salary ranging from ₹12,000 to ₹17,500. The commission recommended enhancement of their salaries to a minimum of ₹19,000 to a maximum of ₹31,000.Besides, nearly 6,000 lecturers in various government junior and degree colleges in the state are working on contract basis with little higher wages, and the commission recommended an increase in their wages substantially.In December, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced that there would be a massive recruitment drive very soon to fill up as many as 50,000 vacant posts. An official statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said KCR had asked all the departments to furnish the details of the vacancies available which need to be filled up immediately.“The recruitment drive will be launched soon after the completion of the ongoing exercise of giving promotions to the employees, which has been pending for a long time,” the CMO had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-1-9-lakh-job-vacancies-telangana-govt-is-working-at-61-of-total-strength-101611845136079.html

His comments came at a time India and China are locked in a lingering border row in the Ladakh sector.In his customary address at the National Cadet Corps rally, the PM said whether it was the protective cover of the vaccine or dealing with those who challenge India, the country was capable on every front.He made a mention of the Rafale fighter jets while talking about the military’s modernisation. He said the three Rafales that landed in India on Wednesday were refuelled mid-air by “India's friend UAE, helped by Greece and Saudi Arabia.”He said it reflected India's deepening ties with Middle East countries. The new jets will bolster the strength of the Indian Air Force’s only Rafale squadron, which is based in Ambala. India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore. Of these, 11 have arrived and the remaining planes are expected by the year-end.The PM said the government has taken various steps to boost self-reliance in the defence sector and India will be known as a producer of military equipment, instead of being a market. India has set a target of $5 billion worth of defence exports by 2024.The PM spoke about more girls being inducted into the NCC. “NCC has seen a 35% increase in girl cadets. Every front of our defence forces is being opened for girls. India's strong daughters are ready to battle it out against enemies,” the PM said.He said modern simulators being given to the NCC will improve its training standards. “The government has increased the number of firing simulators from 1 to 98, micro-light flight simulators from five to 48 and rowing simulators from 11 to 60.”The PM paid tributes to the heroes of the 1971 India-Pak war at a time India is marking its golden jubilee. He recalled spending time with soldiers at Longewala on Diwali.“In the 1971 war, our jawans won a strategic and decisive battle in Longewala.In that war against Pakistan, India defeated the enemy on the borders. Thousands of Pakistani soldiers surrendered before India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-or-border-challenge-india-capable-on-every-front-pm-modi-101611844150666.html

The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats.The parties also announced that a rally will be jointly held at Kolkata’s historic Brigade Parade Ground on February 28. No other party in the fray has so far called a rally at the venue.“Today we took another step forward in forming a strong alliance against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Earlier, we had decided to share the 77 seats that the Congress and the Left parties won in 2016. Today we reached an agreement on 116 more seats. People of Bengal want to give a befitting reply to the ruling party as well as the BJP,” Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said after the talks.Left Front chairman Biman Bose said, “The talks on seat sharing will continue, keeping in view the ground reality. We will jointly hold the rally at Brigade Parade Ground.”Congress leaders said they will invite either Rahul Gandhi or his sister Priyanka to address the rally.TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy, who had earlier urged the Left and the Congress to support the TMC, said, “These parties have lost a lot of strength but whatever gains they make will make the BJP suffer.”Reacting to the Congress-Left seat sharing, BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “Both are spent forces in Bengal. The contest is between the TMC and the BJP.”On December 24, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) formally approved a tie-up with the Left parties in Bengal.West Bengal, along with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, will go to polls in March-April.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress and the Left suffered badly while the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats. The Left parties won none while the Congress tally came down from four to two. The CPI (M) central leadership did not give its approval to the Bengal unit’s move to share seats with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls.In October last year, the central committee of the CPI(M), the party’s highest decision-making body, approved the Bengal unit’s decision to have an electoral understanding with all secular parties, including the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-left-agree-to-share-193-seats-in-bengal-assembly-to-hold-talks-on-rest-101611842760743.html

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also said it was a political murder and asked the CPI (M) to dump its “politics of dagger”.The League said after the local body polls tension was prevailing in the area and the party made several complaints to the police but they failed to take action. “Sameer was threatened several times by CPI (M) workers. It is sad after the cold-blooded murder, the CPI (M) disowned responsibility saying some personal issues had led to the murder,” said Vallikunnu MLA P Abdul Hameed. The League has observed a shutdown in Manjeri and surrounding areas to protest against the murder.But the CPI (M) refuted the charges saying the incident was a fallout of a rivalry between two families and the party had nothing to do with the crime. The police are keeping strict vigil in the area to avert further escalation of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-cpi-m-workers-held-in-connection-with-muslim-league-cadre-s-murder-101611837112295.html

"Someone goes there and hoists a flag, why no firing was done?" asked Tikait, the spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) which is spearheading the farmers' movement against Centre's farm laws since November.Speaking about Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who has been accused of instigating the violence on Tuesday by farmer unions, Tikait said, "Police allowed him to leave and didn't arrest him. Nothing has been done even now."Also Read | Additional police forces deployed at protest sites, farmers fear evictionThe protest against the three farm laws is continuing for over two months now. But it derailed on January 26 when farmers who were carrying out tractor rally barged inside the Red Fort and hoisted their own flag at its ramparts. During the rally, agitating farmers also broke barricades and vandalised public property as they clashed with police. One farmer was killed and nearly 400 police personnel were injured during the violence.Following the violence, Delhi Police have filed 22 FIRs against farm unions in connection to the violence. Police also sent a notice to at least 20 farmer leaders including Tikait on Thursday for breaching the agreement with police regarding the farmers' tractor rally on Republic Day. The notice was served by the police to farmer leaders including Yogendra Yadav, Baldev Singh Sirsa and Balbir S Rajewal and asked them to give a reply within three days, informed Delhi Police.Meanwhile, Tikait has termed the violence as "conspiracy to malign the farmer unions and distance Punjab from the rest of the country."Tens of thousands of protesters are camping in and around Delhi to protest against Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

28-01-2021||India||India sends 6 lakh Covid vaccine doses to Sri Lanka and Bahrain||India rolled out 600,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines as grant assistance for Sri Lanka and Bahrain under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative on Thursday, a day after Nepal and Myanmar launched their inoculation drives with made-in-India doses.Two separate flights transported 500,000 doses to Sri Lanka and 100,000 doses to Bahrain as part of India’s plans to gift the AstraZeneca vaccine to friendly countries in the neighbourhood and key partners in other regions.The supplies to Bahrain marked the first such aid to a country in West Asia, which India sees as part of its extended neighbourhood. Bahrain is home to 350,000 Indians, the largest expatriate community, and New Delhi had facilitated the travel of Indian medical professionals to Manama last year to cope with the pandemic.The arrival of Indian-made vaccines in Colombo coincided with the celebration of Poya Day, which marks the first visit of the Buddha to Sri Lanka. Indian high commissioner Gopal Baglay offered prayers at Gangaramaya Temple for the well-being of the people of Sri Lanka and handed over the vaccines to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Rajapaksa said on Twitter: “Received 500,000 #COVID-19 vaccines provided by #peopleofindia at #BIA today (28). Thank you! PM Shri @narendramodi & #peopleofindia for the generosity shown towards #PeopleofSriLanka at this time in need.”The delivery fulfilled Modi’s commitment to his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, made at their virtual summit last September, for all possible support to address the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.Since the launch of the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative on January 20, India has gifted vaccines to Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Bangladesh (two million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Myanmar (1.5 million doses), Seychelles (50,000 doses), and Mauritius (100,000 doses).“Over the next few days, we plan to gift further quantities to Oman (100,000 doses), CARICOM countries (500,000 doses), Nicaragua (200,000 doses) and Pacific Island states (200,000 doses),” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Commercial supplies of Covishield have been sent to Brazil, Morocco (two million doses each) and Bangladesh (five million doses), and more supplies are planned for South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Mongolia. Another 10 million doses will be sent to Africa and one million doses will be provided to UN health workers under Gavi’s COVAX facility, he said.“We will continue to supply vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner. Decisions on these supplies will be calibrated against the requirements of the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine at home,” he added.On Wednesday, both Nepal and Myanmar launched their inoculation drives using made-in-India doses. Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, was Nepal’s preferred choice because of its compatibility with the country’s existing cold storage facilities.Nepal plans to inoculate 430,000 people, including health and frontline workers, security personnel, senior citizens and prisoners, in the initial stages of its drive. It also intends to cover six million people in the first phase of the drive and is engaged in talks with India for commercial supplies of more vaccines.Launching the vaccination drive, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said his government plans to immunise all eligible citizens in the next three months. Nepal will also receive millions of doses from Gavi or the Vaccine Alliance through the COVAX facility.Myanmar has signed an agreement with Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses, in addition to the 1.5 million doses it received as a grant last week, as part of plans to inoculate the population of about 54 million. The first commercial supplies from India are expected in early February.Authorities have said the initial stages of Myanmar’s drive will cover health workers, frontline service providers, government officials and lawmakers. Vaccinations for others will be rolled out from February 5, with first preference for people in most affected areas.Observers and experts noted India’s timely rollout of millions of doses as assistance was in contrast to China’s aid to countries in the region, including those with which it has close ties, such as Pakistan and Myanmar. China has pledged to provide 500,000 doses to Pakistan by January 31. Also, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi pledged 300,000 doses for Myanmar during a visit to the country on January 11 but supplies are yet to commence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-6-lakh-covid-vaccine-doses-to-sri-lanka-and-bahrain-101611834552954.html
28-01-2021||India||SC slams Centre for not curbing TV programs that instigate or impact a community||The Supreme Court on Thursday pulled up the Central government for doing nothing to curb TV programs which instigate or impact a community.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said, "There are programmes which instigate or impact a community. But as a government, you do nothing."The apex court observed that control over TV programs that are instigating in nature is as important as some preventive measures, and emphasised on fair and truthful reporting."Yesterday, you shut down the internet and mobile because of the farmers' visit to Delhi. I am using the non-controversial term (visit). You have shut down internet mobile. These are problems that can arise anywhere. I don't know what happened in the TV yesterday," the Bench observed while referring to the internet shut down after the tractor rally by farmers turned violent on Republic Day.The top court added, "Fair and truthful reporting is normally not a problem. Problem is when it is used to agitate others. It is as important as providing lathis to policemen. It is an important preventive part of the law and order situation."CJI Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre, that the government's power to control some news is very important."Control over some news is as important as some preventive measure and check law and order situation. I don't know why you are blind to this. I don't mean anything offensive but you are doing nothing about it," CJI told Solicitor General during the hearing.The court was hearing pleas filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party seeking action against media reports indulging in communal branding of Covid-19 pandemic in the light of Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi's Nizamuddin area. The pleas alleged discriminatory coverage by a section of the media and spreading communal hatred over the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.Solicitor General contended that the government can't control live shows or debates. "There can't be pre broadcast censorship. When there is something offending, we have taken actions by preventing channels to stop airing for a week etc.," Mehta said.The Bench said that it is not interested in people saying anything on TV but it is concerned about those programmes which have instigation effect."We are not stopping people saying anything, in any time on television, let them say that... We are on broadcast which can instigate and cause riots. There is loss of life. People say anything these days. There are situations which can destroy property, life etc.," CJI Bobde saidThe Solicitor General said that many times it is unfortunate but deliberate. He added that there are self-regulatory bodies like the broadcaster associations and News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) also has its own system.The apex court while posting the matter after three weeks asked all the parties in the case to file their affidavits in the meantime.In October last year, the Bench had observed that freedom of speech is one of the most abused freedom in recent times. It had also asked Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to file an affidavit detailing steps it had taken to stop broadcasts on TV channels which are targeting the Muslim community after Tablighi Jamaat incident.The Bench in November had expressed displeasure over the affidavit filed by the government in the case and had said that the government should consider setting up a regulatory mechanism to deal with such contents on TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-for-not-curbing-tv-programs-that-instigate-or-impact-a-community-101611834498832.html
28-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand CM dissolves district development authorities after complaints||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on late Tuesday announced that all district development authorities would be dissolved due to problems in their functioning.Rawat made the announcement while addressing media in Almora district during a three-day visit. The chief minister further said that a formal order in this regard will be issued soon.“We had been receiving many complaints regarding problems in the functioning of the district development authorities, so the chief minister has decided to dissolve the authorities. This is only being done for rural development authorities in all the districts,” the chief minister’s media coordinator Darshan Singh Rawat said.He also said that the state government would be looking into the situation and decide on the next course of action.Earlier in November, Bansidhar Bhagat, the chief of the Uttarakhand unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had submitted a memorandum to the chief minister, urging him to dissolve development authorities in the state in the public interest as they were not fulfilling the purpose for which they had been created.Bhagat had said after touring various areas of the state and interacting with people and party cadre, that one of the main complaints was that “development authorities had failed to fulfil the expectations of the people”.The BJP chief said these development authorities were not contributing much to the development of their respective areas. “On the contrary, people are facing difficulties due to them. Easy procedures are being made difficult for people. In some places, I even got complaints about corruption in the authorities. Against this backdrop, I realised there was no justification for the continuation of these development authorities in the state”, he had said.The opposition Congress reacted to chief minister Rawat’s decision said the government should have focused on why these bodies were not working properlySuryakant Dhasmana, vice-president of state Congress unit said, “Since the district development authorities are government bodies which have failed to help the public, the government should be focusing on checking why the bodies were not working properly. This government first takes wrong decisions and then takes a U-turn and praises itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-cm-dissolves-district-development-authorities-after-complaints-101611833792999.html
28-01-2021||India||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh urges PM Narendra Modi to include Punjabi in J&K official languages list||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention for the inclusion of Punjabi in the list of languages of Jammu and Kashmir.He cited Punjab's historical links with Jammu and Kashmir since Maharaja Ranjit Singh's time.In a letter to the prime minister, Amarinder Singh urged him to advise the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to reconsider and review the official list and include Punjabi as one of the official languages of the union territory.He voiced resentment of the Punjabi community over the exclusion of their language from the list.Amarinder Singh pointed out that Jammu and Kashmir was a part of Punjab during the era of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the 19th century Sikh ruler, with Punjabi being one of the vernacular languages of the region.When Jammu and Kashmir came into existence as an independent state, Punjabi was a widely spoken language there and is now the mother tongue of all Punjabis in the Jammu region, besides being spoken by the Punjabi community living in Kashmir Valley, he wrote.The chief minister said under the Jammu and Kashmir Languages Bill, 2020 which was passed by both the Houses of Parliament with a voice vote in September 2020, Kashmiri, Dogri and Hindi were included in the list of official languages of the UT, in addition to the existing Urdu and English.Unfortunately, Punjabi was not included in the list of official languages which will be taught in schools as compulsory subjects, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-urges-pm-modi-to-include-punjabi-in-j-k-official-languages-list-101611833628390.html

28-01-2021||India||Maharashtra’s MVA slams Karnataka dy CM for seeking UT status for Mumbai||The constituents of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday slammed Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi for demanding that Mumbai be declared a Union Territory with the Congress calling it Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “sinister design” to weaken Maharashtra. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) called the demand baseless and pointless while the Shiv Sena said those making it should not forget Uddhav Thackeray is the Maharashtra chief minister.Savadi’s statement came in response to Thackeray call for declaring the disputed areas between the two states a Union Territory until the Supreme Court decides on a pending petition over Maharashtra’s claims over Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka. “Earlier, we were part of the Mumbai region. My demand and the demand of the people in this region is that Mumbai be attached to Karnataka. I demand the central government to ensure Mumbai should be declared as Union Territory. The issue will be resolved once we demand Mumbai,” said Savadi.Also read | Uddhav Thackeray to release book on Karnataka-Maharashtra border disputeCongress leader Sachin Sawant said Savadi’s demand exposes the plot of the BJP-led central government to weaken Mumbai and Maharashtra. “...attempts were made to shift the international financial centre and also trade to Gujarat. The central government has been a silent spectator as its ultimate aim is to make Mumbai a Union Territory. ...[Uttar Pradesh chief minister] Yogi Adityanath came [to Mumbai] and tried to woo Bollywood to his state. The Centre is using all central agencies like ED [Enforcement Directorate] and CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] to trouble the businessmen and Bollywood. It is all the part of the design to weaken Mumbai.”Sawant warned the BJP would face the wrath of Maharashtra’s people if it tried to play with their sentiments.Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said his Karnataka counterpart wants to please the people of Karnataka. “The demand made by the chief minister [Thackeray] has no connection with what Karnataka deputy chief minister has said in his response. As the head of Maharashtra, he [Thackeray] only said that until the dispute is resolved, declare the disputed areas as Union Territory. What is the connection between those areas and Mumbai?” he asked. “His [Savadi] demand is baseless and pointless.”He said Marathi speaking people used to elect their lawmakers, corporators and even the mayor from the disputed areas but to weaken their position, delimitation of the constituencies was done, and Kannadiga-populated areas were incorporated into them. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said the Marathi speaking people in Belgaum are deprived of the independence given to the people from Karnataka in Maharashtra. “In Maharashtra, we have never acted harshly against our brothers from Karnataka residing in Mumbai and Maharashtra. They are enjoying full independence here, running Kannada language schools and also getting government aid. They are running many literary, cultural and art-related organisations here but is the situation for Marathi-speaking people in Belgaum the same?”He said Savadi’s remarks should not be given any importance. “The fight is to protect Marathi language and culture… The law will take its own course, but the Karnataka government should not forget that now the chief minister is Uddhav Thackeray.” He said a Marathi-speaking mayor was booked under sedition for taking the pro-Marathi stand. “This is nothing but the oppression of the Marathi-speaking citizens in the border areas.”The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. It made Belgaum and 10 talukas of Bombay State, once part of colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. Maharashtra opposed the move arguing Belgaum, Nipani and Karwar has a majority of Marathi speaking population and should ideally be a part of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-mva-slams-karnataka-dy-cm-for-seeking-ut-status-for-mumbai-101611833530461.html

We know the Indian central government and state government are yet to fully agree on Teesta,” he said. A planned bilateral agreement on sharing the waters of the Teesta has been held up by objections from the government of West Bengal, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee contending such a pact will affect water supplies in the dry season. A joint statement issued after the virtual summit between Modi and his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina on December 17 said the Bangladesh side had stressed the early signing of an interim agreement on Teesta waters, as agreed by both countries in 2011. During the virtual summit, India and Bangladesh signed seven agreements in areas ranging from hydrocarbons to agriculture and revived a cross-border railway line that was snapped 55 years, giving a boost to connectivity initiatives and energy cooperation. Modi, in his opening remarks at the summit, described Bangladesh as an important pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. The two sides have closely cooperated to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, and India recently provided two million doses of Covishield vaccine as grant assistance to Bangladesh. Another five million doses were rolled out this week from the 30 million doses Bangladesh has contracted for with the Serum Institute of India. Momen will deliver a lecture at the Indian Foreign Service training academy on January 30 and meet Delhi-based ambassadors concurrently accredited to Bangladesh before returning on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-foreign-secretary-in-india-to-discuss-pm-modi-s-visit-bilateral-ties-101611831850802.html

He was sentenced to five years in jail.In her judgement, Justice Ganediwala noted that while the prosecution has established that the accused entered the house of the victim with an intention to outrage her modesty or sexually harass her, it has not been able to prove the charge of 'sexual assault' or 'aggravated sexual assault'.Also read| ‘No sexual assault’ in minor’s groping: Supreme Court stays Bombay HC orderThe high court noted that the definition of "sexual assault" under the POCSO Act says that there has to be "physical contact with sexual intent without penetration"."The acts of 'holding the hands of the prosecutrix (victim)', or 'opened zip of the pant' as has been allegedly witnessed by the prosecution witness (mother of the victim), in the opinion of this court, does not fit in the definition of 'sexual assault'," Justice Ganediwala said.The high court further said that the facts of the present case are not sufficient to fix the criminal liability on the accused (Kujur) for the alleged offence of aggravated sexual assault.Also read| SC seeks Centre's reply on Congress MP's plea against farm laws"At the most, the minor offence punishable under section 354-A(1)(i) of the IPC read with section 12 of the POCSO Act is proved against the appellant (Kujur)," the court said.The prosecution's case is that Kujur had on February 12, 2018 entered the house of the victim when her mother had gone to work.When the mother returned from work, she found the accused holding the hand of her daughter with the zip of his pants open.The mother, while recording her evidence in the lower court, had said that her daughter had informed her that the accused person had removed his private part from the pant and asked the victim to come to bed for sleeping.The high court quashed Kujur's conviction under sections 8 and 10 of POCSO Act, but upheld his conviction under the other sections.The court, however, said it was modifying the sentence and noted that Kujur has so far undergone five months in prison.Also read| Why comedian Munawar Faruqui was arrested: A timeline"Considering the nature of the act, which could be established by the prosecution and considering the punishment provided for the aforesaid crimes, in the opinion of this Court, the imprisonment which he has already undergone would serve the purpose," the court said.The court said the accused shall be set free if he is not required in any other case.Another judgment passed by Justice Ganediwala this month acquitting a 39-year-old man for groping a minor girl, noting that there was no "skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent" has faced severe flak.The Supreme Court had on Wednesday stayed operation of this order after Attorney General K K Venugopal mentioned the matter submitting that it was a very disturbing conclusion by the Bombay High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holding-hands-unzipping-pants-no-sexual-assault-under-pocso-bombay-high-court-101611825649538.html

SFJ is offering monetary incentives in pursuance of the same. The farmers at the protest site along the Delhi border are also being proffered financial assistance by the radical Sikhs," a top official told ANI.Interestingly, on 26th January, around 12 noon, another input was shared that farmers protesting with tractors were likely to move towards the PM's residence, Home Minister's House, Rajpath, India Gate and Red Fort as well. This message was sent to all officers who were on ground maintaining law and order situation in Delhi.Nineteen people have been so far arrested and over 25 criminal cases registered by Delhi Police in connection with the violence that broke out during the farmers' tractor march on Tuesday, Police Commissioner (CP) SN Shrivastava had said on Wednesday.Delhi Police has named Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu and gangster Lakka Sadana in an FIR registered in connection with the violence at the historic monument on January 26.Protestors broke barricades to enter Delhi and indulged in vandalism across several parts of the national capital during their tractor rally organised to protest against the Centre's three new farm laws.Several public and private properties were damaged in acts of vandalism by the protestors.

28-01-2021||India||SC seeks Centre's reply on Congress MP's plea against farm laws||The Supreme Court Thursday sought the Centre's reply on a plea by TN Prathapan, Congress MP from Kerala, challenging the Constitutional validity of three contentious farm laws.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian issued notice to the central government on the plea and ordered tagging it with the ones pending on the issue.Prathapan, who represents Thrissur Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala, has alleged that the laws are violative of Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination) and 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution.He said the laws are "liable to be struck down as unconstitutional, illegal and void".Prathapan, in the plea filed through lawyer James P Thomas, said: "Indian Agriculture is characterised by fragmentation due to small holdings and has certain inherent weaknesses beyond control such as dependence on weather, uncertainties in production and an unpredictable market. This makes agriculture risky and inefficient in respect of both input and output management."It said the challenges faced by farmers such as dependence on weather, cannot be addressed by monetisation of the produce to increase their income, instead strengthening the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) system by infusing more capital and effective management of Minimum Support Price."The number of farmers that the Centre assumed for calculating the cost of PM-Kisan scheme is from the Agriculture Census of 2015-16, which had put the number of operational agriculture land holdings in the country at 14.5 crore."The matter is of substantial public interest and is emergent as there is need for striking down laws which violate the rights of the 14.5 crore citizens who are engaged in farming before serious financial damage is caused to them and the families of such persons," it said.The top court, on January 12, had already stayed the implementation of the farm laws till further orders and had constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers' unions protesting at Delhi borders.Prior to this, the court on September 28 last year, had issued notice to the Centre on similar pleas filed by Rashtriya Janta Dal lawmaker from Rajya Sabha, Manoj Jha and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu, Tiruchi Siva, and a petition filed by Rakesh Vaishnav.The three laws — Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 — took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-on-congress-mp-s-plea-against-farm-laws-101611823301240.html

"LAC must be strictly observed, respected; any attempt to unilaterally change status quo is completely unacceptable," he added."For all the differences and disagreements we may have had on the boundary, the central fact was that border areas still remained fundamentally peaceful. The last loss of life before 2020 was as far back in 1971 that is why the events in eastern Ladakh last year, have so profoundly disturbed the relationship," the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Jaishankar said that after the 1962 conflict, the first interaction between Beijing and New Delhi happened only in 1976. The first Prime Ministerial visit to China after 1954 actually happened only in 1988. "Rebuilding of our ties was actually painstaking and arduous," he said, according to ANI.On the relationship between the two countries going forward, Jaishankar asserted that if ties are to be steady and progress, policies must take into account learnings of the last three decades. "Whether it is our immediate concern or more distant prospects, the fact is that the development of our ties can only be based on mutuality. The three mutuals -- mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests -- are its determining factors," he added.His comments come in the backdrop of the standoff between the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the LAC for over eight months now. The soldiers of both the Indian army and PLA are deployed eyeball-to-eyeball at friction points on the contested border. As many as nine rounds of corp-commander level talks between the two sides have failed to bring a solution to the impasse.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-yet-to-explain-changed-stance-massing-of-troops-jaishankar-on-lac-row-101611821727507.html

28-01-2021||India||SC slams Centre for not curbing instigating TV programmes||The Supreme Court Thursday slammed the Centre for “not doing anything” to curb TV programmes which have “instigating effect” and said that control over such news is as important as some preventive measure and to check law and order situation.Referring to the internet shutdown in some areas of Delhi on January 26 when the tractor parade by farmers protesting against three new farm laws had turned violent, the apex court stressed upon the need for “fair and truthful” reporting and said that problem arises when it is used to agitate others.“The fact of the matter is that there are programmes which have instigating effect and you being the government is doing nothing about it,” a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, made this observation while hearing a batch of pleas which have raised the issue of media reporting of Tablighi Jamaat congregation here last year during the onset of Covid-19 pandemic.The congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in the national capital in March last year, attended by thousands of Indian and foreign nationals, was cited as being responsible for accelerating the spread of coronavirus or Covid-19, with its attendees allegedly carrying the infection to different parts of the country.“There are programmes which instigate or impact a community. But as a government, you do nothing,” the bench observed.“Yesterday, you shut down the internet and mobile because of the farmers’ visit to Delhi. I am using the non-controversial term. You have shut down internet mobile,” the CJI said, adding, “These are problems that can arise anywhere. I don't know what happened in the TV yesterday”.“Fair and truthful reporting is normally not a problem. Problem is when it is used to agitate others. It is as important as providing ‘lathis’ to policemen. It is an important preventive part of the law and order situation,” the bench said.The apex court said it is not interested in people saying anything on TV but it is concerned about those programmes which have instigation effect.“Control over some news is as important as some preventive measure and check law and order situation. I don't know why you are blind to this. I don't mean anything offensive but you are doing nothing about it,” the CJI said.“People can say anything. We are on broadcast which can instigate and cause riots. There is loss of life. People say anything these days. There are situations which can destroy property, life,” the top court said.Mehta told the bench that there are self-regulatory bodies like the broadcaster associations and News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) also has its own system.“Now, we are in the era of OTT. There was DTH, cable service etc too. We can lay down all the system before you,” Mehta told the bench.The bench asked the parties to file their affidavits in the matter within three weeks and said the matter will be heard thereafter.In November last year, the apex court had expressed displeasure over the Centre's affidavit in the case and said that the government should consider setting up a regulatory mechanism to deal with such contents on TV.Observing that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's affidavit did not deal with the applicability of Cable Television Network Act (CTNA) in the case, the top court had said that the government has the power to put a regulatory mechanism in place and it cannot be left to an agency like NBSA.The top court, which was hearing the pleas filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind and others alleging that a section of the media was spreading communal hatred over Tablighi Jamaat congregation during the onset of pandemic, had asked the Centre to file a fresh affidavit dealing with mechanism to regulate electronic media under the CTNA.The plea filed by Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind has sought directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of "fake news" related to the Nizamuddin congregation and take strict action against those responsible for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-slams-centre-for-not-curbing-instigating-tv-programmes-101611820403086.html

28-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi thinks many farmers haven't understood new laws. Here's why||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Narendra Modi-led central government on Thursday as he said the country is being operated by the Prime Minister in the interest of a few big businessmen. The Congress leader had earlier tweeted in the day that the Centre had allegedly ruined India's economy. “Mr Modi’s governance is a lesson in how to ruin one of the world’s fastest-growing economies,” he wrote.Addressing a rally at his parliamentary constituency in Kerala’s Wayanad, Gandhi said, “You know the situation in the country today, it is clear for everybody to see what is going on. India is being run by the PM in the interest of 2-3 big businessmen. Every single industry today has a monopoly controlled by 3-4 people.” Sectors such as telecom, power, airports etc are being controlled by a limited number of people, he added.Also Read| On farmers' tractor rally violence, Kejriwal says ‘incident doesn’t end protest'Quickly shifting focus towards the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s farm reforms, Gandhi said that a majority of the farmers did not understand the details of the reforms and if they knew, there would have been an agitation all across and India would be on fire.Referring to an incident from the past, Gandhi pointed out that there had been an attempt to attack the country’s farmers in Bhatta Parsaul. As a result, the Congress party came up with a Land Acquisition Bill that guaranteed compensation and protection to the farmers, he said. However, Gandhi alleged that Modi tried to kill this bill when he became the Prime Minister in 2014 and upon failing to defeat the bill in Parliament, Modi told his chief ministers to kill the bill in their respective states.#WATCH: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says, "...The truth is that most farmers do not understand the details of the Bill (the three Farm Laws), because if they did, there would be an agitation all across the country. The country would be on fire." https://t.co/Y5yooquUwR pic.twitter.com/xaAg2Hsct0“We threw out the old British Bill and brought out a brand new Bill that guaranteed compensation & protection to our farmers...The first thing Narendra Modi ji did when he became PM was trying to kill this Bill. We fought him in Parliament & stopped him from killing it,” Gandhi said.The Congress leader is on a two-day visit to Kerala ahead of the assembly elections in the state scheduled for April-May. Earlier, he was on a three-day visit to the western belt in Tamil Nadu where he interacted with farmers, weavers and the public and also talked about the Congress’ alliance with Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the upcoming assembly elections.Meanwhile, BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday sought an apology from Gandhi and alleged that the Congress had instigated the protesting farmers to carry out the tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day (Tuesday). Javadekar further alleged that the main opposition party did not want the agitation to end adding that people would give it a befitting reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-thinks-many-farmers-haven-t-understood-new-laws-this-is-the-reason-101611818956042.html

During the corona period, lakhs of cadets worked with the administration and society across the country. It is commendable," PM Modi said.He said that NCC can play an important role in adding discipline in the society. "During the parade on 26th January, you have displayed some brilliant performances and made the nation proud. We have witnessed that disciplined countries dominate across the world, and in India , NCC can play a pivotal role in adding discipline in social life," he added.PM Modi said that with the help of the NCC, Naxalism today exists in just a few districts of the nation."Naxalism today exists in just a few districts in the country and several people have left practicing it and are contributing to development in the country," he added.PM Modi said that the government has tried to widen the role of the NCC, adding that it's participation in commanding India's borders - both land and sea - is being increased."Last year, on 15th August, it was announced that near coastal and border areas, new responsibility will be given to NCC in 175 districts of the country. For this, the Army, Navy and Air Force is training 1 lakh NCC cadets. One-third of these are our girl cadets," he added.PM Modi also said that the government has increased the number of firing simulators from 1 to 98--nearly 100."The number of micro-light flight simulators, too, has been increased from 5 to 48 and rowing simulators from 11 to 60. These modern simulators will improve the training qualities of NCC," he added.The Prime Minister further said that the NCC has seen a 35% increase in girl cadets, adding that every front of India's defence forces are being opened for females. "India's strong daughters are ready to battle it out against the enemies. India needs your bravery," he added.Remembering the 1971 war, PM Modi said that the soldiers had won a strategic and decisive battle in Longewala."In that war against Pakistan, India had defeated the enemy on the borders. Pakistan's innumerable soldiers had surrendered to India. This year, we are completing 50 years of this war," he added.Stressing on the fact that the NCC digital platform already has over 20,000 cadets, PM Modi said that these cadets have started sharing their experiences and ideas. "I hope all of you would use this platform even more," he added.Portraying India's strengthening friendship with middle-east countries, PM Modi said, "India has received 3 more Rafales from France. They have the ability to refuel mid-air, which has been done by India's friend UAE, helped by Greece and Saudi Arabia."PM Modi was accorded the Guard of Honour at the rally of NCC at Cariappa ground in Delhi. He also inspected the parade at the rally and felicitated the NCC Cadets. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh was also present on the occassion.The NCC is a youth wing of India's armed forces and is open to students across all schools and colleges on a voluntary basis. The organisation comprises the Army, Air Force and Navy wing, and imparts basic military training in small arms and drills to the cadets. The NCC was formed under the National Cadet Corps act of 1948.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-ncc-s-role-in-serving-society-during-covid-19-pandemic-101611815422439.html

The protesting farmers earlier said that ‘anti-social’ elements had orchestrated the violence in Delhi in order to hijack their peaceful protests against the three farm laws- which were passed by Parliament in September. The SAD on Tuesday said it stands for communal harmony and had urged people to maintain peace at all costs“Only an international inquiry can expose the anti-social elements that had already been named by the independent media,” SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia told news agency ANI adding that the central agencies could not investigate as they were apparently involved in sabotaging the protest and ensuring that farmers and farm labourers do not get their dues.Also Read| Delhi Police issue notice to 20 farmer leaders, ask them to reply within 3 daysCondemning the violence in Delhi on January 26, the former Punjab minister said that this incident should not be used as an excuse to abandon the genuine demands of the farmers- who have been protesting at border points in Delhi for over two months.Slamming the Centre further, the SAD leader pointed out that the government agencies did not deign it fit to act immediately against the people who had incited violence and it was bizarre that they were allowed to move towards the Red Fort. “It is even more bizarre that the same persons were given a free run to enter the Red Fort which is otherwise impossible to even approach due to heavy security deployment.

This has become especially important as people turn to online interactions during the Covid-19 pandemic,” an Interpol statement said.The Central Bureau of Investigation, which is the nodal agency of Interpol in India, will alert the states about the International police organisation’s Purple Notice for awareness about the online dating scam. A Purple Notice is issued to seek or provide information on modus operandi, objects, devices, and concealment methods criminals use.Also read | Pakistan left swipes dating apps including Tinder, says it’s immoral contentInterpol said the threat involves taking advantage of people’s vulnerabilities as they look for potential matches, and luring them into a sophisticated fraud scheme. “In the initial stages, an artificial romance is established via a dating app. Once communication becomes regular and a certain level of trust is established, criminals share investment tips with their victims and encourage them to join a scheme. Victims download a trading app and open an account, buy various financial products and work their way up a so-called investment chain, all under the watchful eye of their new ‘friend’.” The statement said they are made to believe they can reach Gold or VIP status. “As is often the case with such fraud schemes, everything is made to look legitimate.

After the child was discharged following fresh hospitalisation on December 29, the neighbours asked the parents to conduct the symbolic last rites.“After we came back, the villagers tonsured him under a tree. They said my child would bring bad luck to the village.

28-01-2021||India||Island tourism, deep-sea mining highlights of India’s Blue Economy policy||India is working on a Blue Economy Policy that plans to boost island tourism, marine biotechnology, deep-sea mining and the ocean energy sector through innovative financing and business models, according to a draft of the policy released by the ministry of earth sciences on Monday for public feedback.The highlights of the policy include an accounting framework to assess the growth of the blue economy; mapping of India’s coastal zones for integrated coastal and marine spatial plans; and dealing with marine pollution, particularly by microplastics and plastics.Promotion of aqua culture, seaweed and algae harvesting and sustainable marine capture; marine biotechnology for non-food sectors; a boost to the economy and employment through development of ports, fisheries, ship building and coastal and cruise tourism (including island tourism and development) are other aspects of the policy. The last date for public comment on the draft is February 27.Also Read: South African President Ramaphosa to sign three-year road map during R-Day visit to take India ties forward“A quantum and qualitative boost to all of these would be given by suitable schematic initiatives and by encouraging the private sector to invest in new business opportunities. The new and emerging areas such as marine biotechnology, deep-sea mining and ocean energy will be promoted. Innovative financing and business models will be explored for these emerging sectors since they are capital intensive,”says the draft policy published on the India Meteorological Department’s website.The policy also underlines the need for marine clusters for port-led development as already conceptualised in the Sagarmala programme of the Centre. The ship building industry would be promoted and modernized in 30 years with a focus on Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiatives.The policy also speaks of marine diplomacy with engagements with neighbouring countries to safeguard strategic interests. One such emerging economic and strategic axis spreads from the East Coast of Africa to the Western Pacific Ocean, which can be called the Seychelles-Singapore-Samoa (SSS) axis, it states.“The draft policy aims to significantly enhance the contribution of the Blue Economy to India’s GDP in the next five years, improve lives of coastal communities, preserve our marine biodiversity and maintain the security of our marine areas and resources. Today, the Blue Economy holds the promise of being the next multiplier of economic growth and well-being, provided that the strategy places sustainability and socio-economic welfare at the centre stage,” the draft concludes.The Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) has put together the draft policy based on recommendations of seven working groups under the Blue Economy initiative.India has a unique maritime position. Its 7,517km-long coastline is home to nine coastal states and 1,382 islands. India has 12 major ports and 187 non-major ports, handling about 1,400 million tons of cargo every year, as 95% of India’s trade by volume transits by sea.India’s Exclusive Economic Zone of over two million square kilometers is rich in living and non-living resources and holds significant recoverable resources of crude oil and of recoverable natural gas. The coastal economy also sustains over 4 million fishermen and other coastal communities, the policy says.“The draft policy brings together several existing economic priorities that have long footprint in coastal and marine areas i.e. island tourism, port led development, deep-sea mining and frames as blue economy. It has two main focus areas, building over coastal lands and extracting from the sea. It pays mere lip service to the environment question and does not address the impacts on coastal livelihoods. In effect the draft document will give the policy justification to several changes that area underway to make way for the priorities envisaged in the text. Changes to regulations, approval of new projects and acquisition of land draw their mandate from policy documents of this nature, none of which has been initiated, assessed, disclosed by the government so far,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, responding to the draft policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/island-tourism-deep-sea-mining-highlights-of-india-s-blue-economy-policy-101611804488101.html

28-01-2021||India||Ministries at odds over NEET exam||The ministry of health and family welfare is not in favour of a proposal by the ministry of education to hold the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical and dental courses twice a year. This was conveyed to education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal by health minister Harsh Vardhan after consultations with the National Medical Commission (NMC), an official confirmed to the HindustanTimes.Following this, Pokhriyal made a personal appeal to the health minister to reconsider the matter. “The health minister has now assured (his counterpart) that he will reconsider the decision,’’ an official aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.Dr Aruna V Vanikar, who is the president of the Undergraduate Medical Education Board, told Hindustan Times that a final decision is awaited. “We are yet to hear the final word on this from the government of India.’’The official cited in the first instance confirmed that Pokhriyal’s pitch for holding the exam more than once , was met with apprehension by health ministry officials,although it was not clear exactly why. The official said that this was after deliberations by the National Medical Commission (NMC), which is responsible for the syllabus of the tests. HT got in touch with chairman of the commission, Dr SC Sharma, who declined comment. “Please ask the health ministry for further details,’’ he said.A health ministry spokesperson told HT: “It (the proposal) is presently under consideration of the NMC and the ministry.”’ But a second official said the health ministry’s and especially the NMC’s reluctance to give the clearance was because they felt it was within their purview to decide the course of medical exams and not the National Testing Agency’s call.Pokhriyal’s proposal raised the hopes of thousands of students who were hoping to get two options to take the exam. The education ministry has already announced that the joint entrance examination for admission to engineering colleges will be held online four times a year from this year. The ministry was hoping for a similiar decision for medical students too.Hindustan Times reached out to National Testing Agency head Vineet Joshi, who didn’t respond to queries. The agency wrote formally to the health ministry to allow online exams earlier this month. Its rationale for providing an online option and an alternative date was to make it easier for the 1.5 million candidates who had registered for the exam last time around.While there were many students who moved Supreme Court against the exams being held during a pandemic, when the exam took place in September, just around 10% of students were absent. The second official said that while fears about Class XII students being distracted by NEET twice a year was a valid concern, the real reason could be the health ministry not being thrilled by MBBS students being selected by the education ministry’s NTA instead of NMC, which controls medical education.Lawyer Shoeb Alam, who appeared for students in the NEET matter last year, said: “Increasing the frequency of the exam will be a popular move with students as they don’t have to wait another year to take the exam.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-at-odds-over-neet-exam-101611793163242.html
28-01-2021||India||Swimming pools to movie halls, more curbs relaxed||The Union ministry of home ministry affairs (MHA) on Wednesday took a fresh step towards normalcy in the country battered by the coronavirus disease, announcing further relaxation of curbs on gatherings, cinema halls and swimming pools in the first set of guidelines against Covid-19 released in the new year.The guidelines for “Surveillance, Containment and Caution”, applicable for February 1-28, also said the civil aviation ministry may take a call on further opening up of international air travel in consultation with the MHA. At present, India is operating international flights under special arrangements with 24 countries, and Vande Bharat rescue flights to pick up its citizens stranded abroad.Social, religious, cultural, sports, entertainment and educational gatherings will be subject to standard operating procedures (SOPs) by states and Union Territories (UTs), the government announced, lifting restrictions on these activities first imposed by it in March 2020, when the pandemic gripped the nation. Initially, these activities were completely banned. At present, they are permitted, but with a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity and a ceiling of 200 people in closed spaces.Cinema halls and theatres, already allowed to function with 50% of seating capacity, can now have a higher capacity, but the ministry of information and broadcasting will release SOPs to this effect in consultation with the MHA.Besides, swimming pools, where only sportspersons are allowed at present, have been opened to all. The youth affairs and sports ministry will release the SOPs with MHA inputs. Similarly, all types of exhibition halls will be permitted in February and the SOP to that effect will be released by the department of commerce. Business-to-business (B2B) exhibition halls have already been permitted in the country.All other activities are permitted outside containment zones, which are epicentres of Covid-19 infections and have restricted entry and stringent perimeter control.In a letter to states and UTs, home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said: “As you are aware, the number of active cases in the country have been declining steadily over the past four months. However, there is a need for maintaining caution and strict surveillance so as to fully overcome the pandemic.”Bhalla added that “the essence behind the graded re-opening and progressive resumption of activities is to move ahead”.Till Wednesday, India has recorded 10,702,073 Covid-19 cases and 153,903 fatalities. The seven-day average of infections now stands at 12,897, compared to the peak of 93,617 on September 16, 2020.The guidelines also said there shall be no restriction on inter- and intra-state movement, “including those for cross land-border trade under Treaties with neighbouring countries”. No separate permission or e-permit will be required for such movements.People above 65, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below 10 years are advised to stay at home. The government also encouraged citizens to use the contact-tracing mobile application, Aarogya Setu. The guidelines asked states and UTs to ensure wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing. National directives for Covid-19 management, such as fines on spitting in public places, will continue to be followed. For offices and marketplaces, the guidelines advocated staggering of work and business hours, thermal screening and proper sanitisation, and social distancing.The guidelines said containment Zones, if required, “shall be carefully demarcated by the district authorities at the micro level”. Police and municipal authorities will be responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed. After 68 days of hard lockdown (when only essential services were allowed) last year, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen business activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swimming-pools-to-movie-halls-more-curbs-relaxed-101611792913432.html
28-01-2021||India||Govt indicates offer to farmers still on table, channel for talks kept open||Although the farmers’ protest march on Republic Day took a violent turn, leaving many police personnel injured and leading to the destruction of public property, government managers indicated on Wednesday that the Centre will keep its communication channels with farm unions open and its offer to put the three controversial agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months will stay.On January 25, after the 11th round of meetings between the government and the farmers’ unions, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar maintained that the Centre’s proposal to suspend the farm laws for one to one-and-half years was the “best offer” it could make and the farmers should reconsider it.The offer, however, is seen by many farm leaders as a tactic by the government to buy time, particularly keeping in mind the Punjab assembly elections due in February 2022.At least three government managers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that there hasn’t been any thinking so far in the government to withdraw the offer to keep the laws in abeyance in the wake of the violence by a section of the farmers in New Delhi on Tuesday.“It was the final offer from the government and it has not been withdrawn. The violence will be dealt with as per the law but talks with farmers can always continue,” said an official.Another official said the government will be ready to meet farmers’ representatives whenever they are ready. The government has made its offer. It’s up to the farmers now to respond,” a second official said.Two days before the violence broke out in parts of Delhi, Tomar maintained the Centre had made its best offer and would wait for the farmers to return to the negotiating table.“The government has given the best offer to farmers’ unions. I am hopeful that they will convey their decision to us after discussing it among themselves. Once they communicate, we will take it forward,” Tomar said.The first official, however, said the government seem to have an upper hand because public sympathy for the farm law protesters has largely waned after the visuals of chaos in Red Fort, mob violence and attempts to run tractors over policemen emerged on social media.“The government crisis managers might feel they are now better positioned in the negotiations. But thousands of genuine farmers are still out in the street camps and yet to go back to their states. So, the government can’t take it easy,” said the first official.According to the three officials, another round of meetings may take place soon.The government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers staging a massive protest on several of Delhi’s border points since November 26 say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-indicates-offer-to-farmers-still-on-table-channel-for-talks-kept-open-101611792445123.html
28-01-2021||India||Jayalalithaa’s residence: Madras HC allows state to hold event on January 28||The Madras high court on Wednesday allowed the Tamil Nadu government to proceed with the inauguration scheduled on January 28 to open late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s residence ‘Veda Nilayam’ as a memorial but did not allow public entry until further hearings on the case. The court observed that it was constrained to allow the opening so that it does not cause difficulties to the government which has already made arrangements when it should have restrained from such a function.Justice N Seshasayee passed the interim order based on writ petitions filed by Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs -- her niece J Deepa and nephew J Deepak-- against the government’s acquisition and converting the late AIADMK leader’s residence into a museum and throwing it open to the public on Thursday.Even though the case was posted for February 4, the court heard the case on Wednesday based on their request, “keeping aside the consideration of the main controversy involving the legality of the acquisition.”The opening ceremony, “will not in any way confer any right to the Government, nor deprive the petitioners of their right in the subject matter of the writ petitions,” the court order said. It also placed a list of conditions-- only the main gates can be opened but the building cannot be opened, no flex boards, banners are allowed. Once the function is over the keys of the property have to be handed over to the registrar general of the court.“Since the inventory (of moveable assets) has not been completed, the right, title and the interest of the heirs cannot be marginalised, the justice said during the hearing,” said Deepak’s counsel S L Sudarsanam. The court order also noted that, “So far as movable properties of...Jayalalitha are concerned, they are not even valued, and it is unfair and impermissible for the government to declare open 'Veda Nilayam' as a memorial when the entire acquisition proceedings is not yet complete.”Jayalalithaa has been living in this property which she purchased in the 60s until the time of her death. Her close aide and expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala was her housemate for three decades until she went to a Bengaluru prison in February 2017 and was formally released on January 27. The government enacted a legislation last year establishing a foundation for the property’s upkeep to be turned into a memorial and stated that the property was acquired legally after depositing a compensation of ₹67.9 crore before the civil court in Chennai.The ruling AIADMK government on Wednesday inaugurated an 80-crore phoenix themed mausoleum at Jayalalithaa’s burial place on the Marina beach. On January 28, the chief minister will open Jayalalithaa’s residence at 10.30am following which he would unveil her statue in another complex in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jayalalithaas-residence-madras-hc-allows-state-to-hold-event-on-january-28-101611778053653.html
28-01-2021||India||Fix timeline for judicial appointments, says SC||Even as a new memorandum of procedure (MoP) on judicial appointments is pending for almost four years, the Supreme Court on Wednesday urged the central government to set a fixed timeline for clearing appointments of judges to the high courts and the apex court after receiving the recommendations of the collegium. The court said there were 189 proposals regarding appointments pending with the government as on December 31.Taking a grim view of the situation where certain proposals remain pending before the government for more than six months, an apex court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said that all endeavours should be made to ensure appointments come through in a time-bound manner.Out of the total strength of 1,079 judges in the high courts, there were 411 vacancies — more than a third of the total positions — as of January 1.In 2015, the top court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act and the 99th Constitutional Amendment, which sought to give the executive a say in the appointment of judges. This judgment held that judicial appointments will be carried on by the recommendations of the collegium, which comprises the CJI and four other most senior Supreme Court judges.In this judgment, the court had also said that a new MoP should be put in place in consultation with the government to guide all future appointments of judges. A draft MoP was sent by the SC collegium to the Union law ministry in March 2017, but the government returned it, suggesting certain improvements.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, in a written replyto a question in the Lok Sabha in March 2020, informed the House that the government’s suggestions have remained pending with the top court ever since.While the new MoP on eligibility criteria and a timeline for judicial appointments awaits finalisation, the bench, which also included justices Sanjay K Kaul and Surya Kant, on Wednesday called it a “matter of great concern” that the collegium had not heard from the government for months together after making some recommendations. According to the bench, a proposal would get stuck without knowing the reason whether the government had any objection to a certain name or there were other issues.“Suppose you have reservations and send back the names to us, then we can reiterate or can look into your objections. But if you don’t give comments for five months on a collegium recommendation, it is a matter of great concern,” the bench told attorney general KK Venugopal, who represented the Centre.Around a dozen names for appointments to high courts of Allahabad and Bombay have been pending since May and June last year.Underscoring the importance of timely appointments in the constitutional courts, the bench added: “We need to put the house in order. You need to see the bottlenecks and iron them out.”Justice Kaul, during the hearing, also gave an illustration on the pendency at the government’s end, pointing out that even a proposal to appoint some government lawyers as judges had not been cleared expeditiously.“In the last five months, the collegium cleared nine judges for various high courts. Out of them, six names are pending with the government. Out of these six, four are in fact government counsel,” the judge told Venugopal.Justice Kant, referring to a note prepared by justice Kaul about the time taken by the government in processing some appointments, told the A-G that there had been some instances in which the government took more than a year to respond.“You say something is pending with the Intelligence Bureau (IB), and in some cases chief ministers have not responded about appointments in the high courts. But we want to know what is your (Centre’s) timeline,” the judge asked Venugopal, while mentioning the proposals from the high courts of Allahabad and Bombay.On his part, the A-G said that there were attempts being made to bring down the pendency of such cases and many such proposals were now being cleared speedily. Venugopal, however, also admitted that there were some cases that had been “pending for a phenomenal amount of time”.At this point, the CJI cited justice Kaul’s note to highlight that as many as 189 proposals were pending as on December 31 and requested the A-G to study the chart.“The main purpose of the proceedings is to speed up the pendency of appointment of such judges to high courts and is pending with the government. We all need to see a timeline to achieve this target,” the CJI told Venugopal.The government has now been asked to consider laying down a timeline for judicial appointments in the higher judiciary and respond in two weeks.The law ministry did not respond for a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fix-timeline-for-judicial-appointments-says-sc-101611777768049.html
28-01-2021||India||TMC rigged the 2018 panchayat polls, alleges Suvendu Adhikari||The ruling Trinamool Congress had rigged the 2018 panchayat polls, former TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari, who recently joined the Bharatiya Janata Party has alleged.“I was then in the TMC. People of Jhargram and Purulia had voted for the lotus (symbol of BJP). But the TMC used police force that night, till around 3 am, to rig the ballots. It was the BJP who had actually won the Zilla Parishad of Jhargram and Purulia. But the public opinion was never reflected,” Adhikari, who was then the state transport minister and a trusted lieutenant of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, alleged on Wednesday.While the panchayat election in 2003 gained infamy for the death toll, the 2018 polls set a record in the number of seats won without a contest. In 2018, the TMC won uncontested in around 34.2% seats.“The opposition was not allowed to file their nomination. Goons armed with guns and bombs had surrounded the BDO offices, where nominations were to be filed. Opposition leaders were implicated in false cases and some were even abducted to ensure that they are not able to file nominations. They were not allowed to campaign, and violence was unleashed on the polling day,” Adhikari added. He was speaking at a public rally in Jhargram.The TMC, however, hashit back calling it the height of hypocrisy and refuting the charges as baseless allegations.“He is making baseless allegations of which there is no proof. If he was aware of such malpractice, why did he not raise objections at that time? Why now? He should have raised his voice then. This is height of hypocrisy,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.The BJP’s influence in Jangalmahal started growing since 2014. The TMC suffered a blow in the area in the 2018 panchayat elections.In Jhargram district, out of the 780 gram-panchayats, where elections were held, 373 and 329 seats were won by the TMC and the BJP, respectively. Similarly, in Purulia district, of the 1,921 seats, where voting was held, the TMC and the BJP won 754 and 528 gram-panchayat seats, respectively.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP gave the ruling TMC another jolt after it won all the seats that fall under ‘Jangalmahal’ (Purulia, Midnapore, Bishnupur and Jhargram).With assembly elections round the corner, the BJP has already requested the Election Commission of India to deploy central forces at least 15 days before the polls so that free and fair elections can be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-rigged-the-2018-panchayat-polls-alleges-suvendu-adhikari-101611776341177.html
28-01-2021||India||Cracks in stir after mayhem; farmers call off Feb 1 march||Farm unions protesting three contentious new agricultural laws have called off a march to Parliament when the Union government will present its annual budget on February 1, but promised to continue their two-month-long agitation, even as divisions among protesting farmers started to surface a day after the tractor rally in Delhi on Tuesday turned violent.Leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the platform of farm unions leading the protests, on Wednesday apologised for the violent events in Delhi that have dented the credibility of the movement, saying the buck stopped with them since they had given the call for the tractor march on Republic Day. They, however, continued to claim that there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” to thwart the agitation.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha also held a series of meeting late into the night on Wednesday, its confidence shaken as it wondered how to carry on an agitation that had forced the Union government to offer a series of concessions, including a proposal to put the laws on hold.It’s an offer government officials say is still available to the farmers, but that the latter will now have to make the first move.Several key farm leaders were missing from the front ranks of Tuesday’s rally, which they should have been leading, and there appeared to be coordinated action by farmers at all three entry into||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cracks-in-stir-after-mayhem-farmers-call-off-feb-1-march-101611775852629.html
28-01-2021||India||India, France to sign two agreements during French minister's 5-day visit||India and France will sign two agreements on renewable energy and urban mobility during a five-day visit to India by a key member of President Emmanuel Macron’s government to bolster bilateral cooperation on sustainable development.France’s ecological transition minister Barbara Pompili, whose post is considered number two in the government, will begin her visit on Thursday. Besides meeting her Indian counterpart Prakash Javadekar, power and renewable energy minister RK Singh and minister of state for urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, she will travel to Assam and Gujarat to strengthen cooperation on specific projects.Singh and Pompili will preside over the signing of a letter of intent between the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and the French Development Agency (AFD) for developing a floating solar plant of up to 150 MW.AFD will also sign a credit facility agreement with the finance ministry to provide 250M euros as funding for the Surat metro rail project in line with France’s commitment to supporting green urban mobility in India, the French embassy said in a statement.Pompili’s discussions with Javadekar are expected to focus on climate challenges, global efforts to protect biodiversity, air pollution and a joint initiative on single-use plastic.The two ministers will also launch the India-France Year of the Environment, which aims to amplify cooperation between the two countries on environmental issues and jointly foster global momentum throughout the year.In her meeting with Singh, Pompili will hold talks on joint efforts to promote renewable energy and smart grids. They will discuss the strengthening of the International Solar Alliance, which was initiated by India and France, bilateral technical cooperation on high-efficiency solar panels, and new investments by French companies in solar power projects and smart grids.Puri and Pompili are expected to discuss collaboration on smart cities, mobility, and water and waste management. They will also touch on civil aviation and conditions for smooth resumption of activities after the pandemic.Pompili will travel to Assam’s Kaziranga national park, one of the sites of the Assam Project on Forest and Biodiversity Conservation (APFBC). AFD has been working with Assam since 2012, providing financial and technical assistance to APFBC to support biodiversity conservation efforts, sustainable management of forests and creation of alternate livelihoods for forest-dependent communities.She will meet local communities that have benefited from skill development programmes to develop alternative livelihoods.At the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati, Pompili will interact with researchers of the Centre of Excellence-Sustainable Polymers, credited with developing India’s first biodegradable plastic.Pompili will also travel to Surat for discussions with Indian and French players involved in smart mobility and sustainable urban development projects. She will reiterate France’s commitment to the Smart Cities Mission, including expertise from French companies and financing from AFD and the European Union.She will also meet leading think tanks and companies working on climate change and clean energy and visit Indian NGOs working on sustainability, particularly waste management.Pompili is the second senior French minister to visit India amid the pandemic. Defence minister Florence Parly travelled to India last September to attend a ceremony marking the induction of the first batch of French-made Rafale combat jets into the Indian Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-to-sign-two-agreements-during-french-minister-s-5-day-visit-101611772132914.html
28-01-2021||India||Twitter suspends at least 500 accounts for ‘spam, manipulation’||New Delhi: Microblogging website Twitter on Wednesday took down at least 500 accounts for “spam and platform manipulation”, as the fall out of the farmers’ tractor rally that turned violent in Delhi on Tuesday. “We have taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm and by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends,” a Twitter spokesperson said. The suspendedaccounts included those that called for a separate Sikh state Khalistan. According to the protesting farmers, Twitter had taken down accounts linked to “Sikh/Punjabi news analysis sites, activists, local organisations and Sikh magazines”. These include Sikhsiyasat, Isamvad, Sikhsahadat, Sikhpakh, Panthsj, Malwasikhjatha, Iamparmjit and Kisaanvichaar. “The accounts that have been removed arbitrarily,” said Bhupendra Choudhary, of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, Haryana. “The government is suppressing those who are raising their voice against the government. Many people have said we were writing about farmers and our accounts have been suspended. Twitter should take action against those inciting violence, but be transparent about it. There are people saying they have been wronged. “The spokesperson added that the decision was taken using a “combination of technology and human review” and that “Twitter worked at scale and took action judiciously and impartially on hundreds of accounts .... regardless of their political beliefs, background and affiliations”. “We have also applied labels to Tweets that were found to be in violation of synthetic and manipulated media policy. We are monitoring the situation closely and remain vigilant, and strongly encourage those on the service to report anything they believe is in violation of the rules,” the spokesperson added. Twitter did not divulge details of the accounts that were suspended.The people whose accounts have been suspended can file an appeal with Twitter. People familiar with the matter, however, denied that the accounts were linked to any particular group. “It should not be linked or seen in the context of any particular group. To state explicitly, this action is not only limited to accounts that may be linked to the conversation about Khalistan,” a person familiar with the matter said. Twitter’s labelling policy include three categories -- synthetic and manipulated media, civic integrity and Covid-19 misinformation. The policy faced severe criticism after the microblogging site banned former US President Donald Trump. Trump’s account was labelled for violating the civic integrity policy and was eventually taken down. Thousands of farmers drove tractors from the borders of Delhi into the city for a massive tractor rally on Tuesday. Authorities say they defied police orders and turned towards important institutions in the centre of Delhi, creating a security nightmare on Republic Day.They hoisted Sikh religious flags atop the Red Fort from where the Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech. Riot police beat protestors with batons and fired tear gas to scatter mobs at several places in Delhi. In return, the protesters tried to run down policemen with their tractors.Asia Pacific Director at Access Now Raman Chima said that the decision was not transparent, clear and effective. “There is a large amount of content that seems to be taken down by Twitter, lately,” Chima said. “However, there is a genuine lack of transparency with respect to the content that was taken down and later labelled. Some of the content is still unavailable. There are examples, including instances of people calling for violence against protesters, that were only taken down after reports were sent to the Twitter by the media. Twitter’s lack of willingness to talk about the action they have taken is also in direct contradiction with action taken in the US.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-suspends-at-least-500-accounts-for-spam-manipulation-101611773099581.html
28-01-2021||India||Punjab villages sombre after clash, still back stir||Located roughly six kilometers from the holy city of Tarn Taran in northern Punjab, Piddi village has been in the limelight for decades as the home of Satnam Singh Pannu, a 65-year-old farm leader who founded the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), an organisation of farmers and labourers with sway in the Majha region.Pannu formed the organisation in 2007 after breaking away from the larger Kisan Sangharsh Committee and rapidly mobilised support. Though he has lived in Tarn Taran city for two decades, his hold over the region’s farm politics is unmatched, largely through the influence of his two brothers — Gurnam Singh who manages the family’s 30 acres of land holdings, and Jasbir Singh, who is an official in the board of the local agriculture market.But on Wednesday, as news spread that Pannu’s men were among those leading the violence and vandalism on Delhi’s streets on Republic Day, local residents turned increasingly critical of his organisation. Delhi Police also blamed Pannu for provocative speeches.“KMSC should have followed the four routes approved by the Delhi Police. A small mistake of the union has sabotaged the entire agitation,” said Jaimail Singh, a villager who returned from Delhi border on Tuesday.KMSC is the smaller of the two formations protesting at the Singhu border, and was blamed for breaking through barriers and deviating from a pre-determined route to unleash violence on Tuesday. Around 300 people from the village were camping at Delhi’s borders as part of the stir.Another farmer, Vikram Singh, who returned from Delhi on Wednesday, said, “The farmers and the labourers should boycott the KMSC. We are hearing that the union acted at the behest of a political party to sabotage the struggle.”They weren’t the only ones. Across Punjab’s hinterlands — especially in the home villages of senior farm leaders — there was disappointment over the violence that farm protesters unleashed when they broke through barricades, clashed violently with police, ran riot on the Capital’s streets and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts. Despite the anger, many villagers said their faith in the months-long stir against three recently passed farm laws was unshaken.“The image of the protest has been dented but we are sure that we will bounce back as we are led by leaders who actually care for our rights,” said Inderjeet Singh, chief of Ranbirpura village, which is home to Darshan Pal, the state president of Krantikari Kisan Union.At least 20 tractor trolleys returned to the village after the Republic Day tractor rally. The returnees said they felt dejected about the violence at Red Fort, but believed the clashes exposed saboteurs. They also pointed to Pal’s strong condemnation of the violence. Delhi Police alleged Pal was complicit in farmers deviating from the pre-determined route on Tuesday.“We have not done anything wrong. We are serious about our demands and will fight till the government repeals these acts,” said farmer Avtar Singh, calling on protesters to remain calm. Pal currently lives in Patiala.The mood was more upbeat at Ugrahan, the home village of Joginder Singh Ugrahan, chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta- Ugrahan). Local residents hailed the veteran leader’s political vision and commitment to peace, and alleged that violence was inflicted by infiltrators — an assertion that is not supported by any proof till now.“The religious flag created controversy. However, if it was a flag of farmer union, it would have represented peasantry’s struggle. We used to participate in the protests and will join again,” said Satgur Singh, a local resident.But the residents at Rajewal, the native village of farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, were more sombre. A tense calm prevailed as villagers condemned Delhi Police for mentioning union leaders in FIRs and those protesters who incited violence in the Capital. “We have to regroup and start afresh because if at this juncture we fall apart, then we will end up losing everything we have,” said Kuldip Singh Rajewal, a local farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-villages-sombre-after-clash-still-back-stir-101611772981281.html

28-01-2021||Today's||India’s quest for a strong, high-end State||The descent into anarchy on the streets of Delhi on Republic Day, due to the unruly protests of a set of farm unions, has sharpened the focus on the frequent eruption of protests in recent times. This has spawned a sense of uncertainty and flux. Yes, there is a churn underway, but its reasons are far deeper than recognised.For most of its history, India has not had a unified pan-Indian State. There have been few short-lived episodes of a single State ruling most of the Indian subcontinent, but, usually, different political entities have ruled various parts of India. In India, 100-150 years of a strong Centre would give way to centuries of fragmentation, unlike China, where centuries of a strong, centralised State would give way to 100-150 years of fragmentation before the rise of another centralised State.India has had what can be termed as low-end States — marked by the absence of an effective centralised salaried bureaucracy, a salaried army, and direct tax collection from the vast portions of the area under their rule. Instead, these States depended on kinship networks to govern their territories, and on regional satraps to provide troops and collect taxes. This weakened State effectiveness, and unlike the pharaohs of Egypt or emperors of China, India’s rulers could not govern people at the grassroots.This also meant that they lacked the capacity to annex and govern distant regions from the core, and preferred the acceptance of suzerainty and tributes from defeated rulers. The Indian tradition of reinstating the defeated rulers or their kin to the throne was a mere acknowledgment of the lack of State-capacity to annex those regions.So, whenever we had a pan-Indian State, it was a low-end State, and numerous autonomous regional satraps would overthrow the central ruler sooner than later. Another important feature of Indian Statecraft was the influence exercised by bodies such as the Buddhist Sangh, merchant guilds or the Brahmin priestly class on the polity.There were a few attempts to create a high-end State, but they did not last long. The 16th-century Akbar-Todarmal reforms in revenue administration, tax collection, and documentation of the population was the last attempt.It was the British who created a unified pan-India State with an extensive bureaucracy impacting lives even at the village level; a census; a unified judicial system; a central army; and the systematic co-option and suppression of local elites. But it, too, was a ghost empire with only two-thirds of India under its direct rule, and a minimalist bureaucracy interested only in extracting revenues and suppressing the population.The process of consolidation accelerated greatly under the Republic of India when, for the first-time, the central government could exercise direct control over the population and assert its power. But the process also caused resistance and backlash, manifesting itself in the form of secessionist movements, religious extremism, and a form of federalism, which often descended into a tool of blackmail by regional elites to extract concessions.The Indian polity tried to overcome this problem by co-opting local elites — first, under the Congress, as an alliance of the urban upper-caste elites and zamindars from local dominant castes and, then, by coalition politics. But it could never discipline local power centres and deep caste lobbies undermining State power.The rise of Hindutva has disrupted the status quo, as it represents a centralising, though not homogenising, force in Indian polity. The clash between the centripetal and centrifugal forces has been a constant feature of Indian polity through the millennia. One way to look at Hindutva and its vision of a unified Indian State, is as the modern avatar of centripetal forces that have found an effective vehicle in the Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The march of the BJP even in non-traditional regions is unsettling the old arrangements and challenging the rule of regional elites of dominant castes. Its push for projects such as Aadhaar, Goods and Services Tax and National Population Register-National Register of Citizens; attempt to assert control over the Byzantine bureaucracy; modernise the armed forces; and crack down on tax-evasion promises to build on the gains of the past two centuries and transform India into a high-end State. This is unprecedented and will require cutting the aristocracy or the traditional regional elite out of the equation.This is what is leading to a substantial pushback, with even allies representing regional elites walking out and taking a hostile stand. It is fuelling anxiety and unrest, and manifesting itself in the forms of protests. The most difficult challenge is the one posed by the agrarian power centres in the countryside.However, this time, India’s transformation might be irreversible. It is witnessing an economic transition, urbanisation, social change, the rise of Hindutva and increasing support for a strong Centre — all interlinked processes, leading to a strong, high end, unified State. The attempt to hoist a flag at the Red Fort is a symbol of the battle over the nature of the State.Abhinav Prakash Singh is an assistant professor, economics, Sri Ram College of CommerceThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-quest-for-a-strong-high-end-state-101611756479927.html
28-01-2021||Today's||With its inaction, the culpability of India’s political Opposition||Images of farmers, in their tractors, clashing with the Delhi police at Red Fort, far beyond the designated routes for their march, are unlikely to fade from public memory. There is little doubt that what transpired on January 26 will inflict serious damage to the popular support for the ongoing agitation that had, until then, displayed remarkable discipline with the two-month-long peaceful sit-in at Delhi’s borders.The script that has played out is not very different from what transpired in Delhi exactly a year ago. Shaheen Bagh emerged as a powerful “Occupy” movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). It inspired similar sit-ins across the country and altercation over one such protest in Delhi precipitated what were the most horrific riots in the National Capital in three-and-a-half decades. The reactions to both these chain of events have been on expected lines. Those who support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) argue that these movements have always been a smokescreen for anarchic and violent elements, which aim to disturb peace to undermine the government. Their opponents claim that events which turn violent are engineered by State and non-State actors closer to the BJP — with the blame then deflected on to protesters to erode the legitimacy of the movement.Irrespective of the merits of the argument, these developments are creating a dangerous schism in society. The majority believes that the State is justified in using its might to crush such protests, while a significant minority is developing a deep persecution complex. This is dangerous for any democracy.But there is a missing actor in this story — India’s parliamentary Opposition. Not only has its conduct been half-hearted in building parliamentary opposition to legislations — remember, the BJP still does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha — it has shown, at best, a token presence in the extra-parliamentary struggles on such issues.Neither the Shaheen Bagh sit-in nor the farm protests were led by political parties. Many celebrate the non-political nature of these protests and have described them as some sort of new wave of democratic, even revolutionary, upsurge. Such proclamations have rhetorical value but protests by non-established leaders leave an important political vacuum — the question of accountability.Is it fair to blame the Shaheen Bagh protesters for the spontaneous sit-in in another part of Delhi the night before communal riots erupted in the capital? Should the team of farmers, which had been negotiating with the government, be held responsible for the events of January 26? And if one cannot control the actions of a group claiming to champion a cause, no matter how justified, does it qualify for blanket ex-ante support?The inability of India’s current parliamentary Opposition to command the political leadership of such struggles is more a result of political weakness than sinister design. But is it even trying to engage with popular movements? Have Opposition leaders done their bit to instil a sense of discipline and organisation in return for their support to such struggles? Or are they opportunistically hoping to ride on the emotional churn these leaderless movements generate, irrespective of their fall-out? Given the experience of both Shaheen Bagh and the farmer protests, the answer would have to be the third. If it wants to be useful, the Opposition should be offering real solidarity in the short-run and political honesty in the long-run – on the ground. But its current actions appear to be that of a free-rider: Happy to take credit, while washing their hands off any blame.Two starkly different historical examples offer a lesson here. In 1922, Mahatma Gandhi called off the non-cooperation movement after protesters set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura. Seventy years later, as India witnessed the demolition of the Babri mosque, the BJP leadership claimed that it was not responsible for what transpired. India’s Opposition would do well to internalise the importance of political leadership of mass movements. Showing up will be a start.roshan.k@htlive.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/with-its-inaction-the-culpability-of-india-s-political-opposition-101611756478633.html
28-01-2021||Today's||Covid-19: The power of global cooperation||Two decades ago, we created a foundation focused on global health because we wanted to use the resources from Microsoft to improve as many lives as possible. Health is the bedrock of any thriving society. That fact has never been clearer than it has been over the last year, as the pandemic has upended lives here in India and around the world.Even though our foundation had been concerned about a pandemic scenario for a long time — especially after the Ebola epidemic in West Africa — we were shocked by how drastically Covid-19 has disrupted economies, jobs, education, and well-being. In India, Covid-19 has cost over 150,000 lives, sickened over 10.5 million people, and impacted the economy. While 2020 will be remembered as the year a global threat touched nearly every person on the planet, we hope 2021 will be remembered as the year the whole world benefitted from an equitable and effective Covid-19 response. If there is reason for optimism, it’s that over the past year, the world has seen the largest public health effort in its history: One involving policymakers, researchers, health care workers, business leaders, grassroots organisers, religious communities, and so many others around the globe working together in new ways. That kind of shared effort is important, because in a global crisis like this one, you don’t want companies making decisions driven by a profit motive or governments acting with the narrow goal of protecting only their own citizens. You need a lot of different people and interests coming together in goodwill to benefit all of humanity. Philanthropy can help facilitate that cooperation. Because our foundation has been working on infectious diseases for decades, we have strong, long-standing relationships with the World Health Organization, experts, governments, and the private sector. And because our foundation is specifically focused on the challenges facing the world’s poorest people, we also understand the importance of ensuring that everyone involved in the pandemic response is considering the unique needs of low-income countries, too. To date, our foundation has committed $1.75 billion to the fight against Covid-19. Most of that funding has gone toward producing and procuring crucial medical supplies. For example, we backed researchers developing new Covid-19 treatments, and we worked with partners to ensure that these drugs are formulated in a way that’s easy to transport and use in the poorest parts of the world so they benefit people everywhere. We’ve also supported efforts to find and distribute safe and effective vaccines against the virus. The fact that Covid-19 vaccines are already becoming available is a stunning testament to the power of global cooperation. No one country or company could have achieved this alone. Funders around the world pooled resources, competitors shared research findings, and everyone involved had a head start thanks to many years of global investment in technologies that have helped unlock a new era in vaccine development. As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India is playing a crucial role in these efforts. Our foundation, along with Gavi, has partnered with India’s Serum Institute to scale up their manufacturing capabilities for production of Covid-19 vaccines in large quantities so that populations in lower- and middle-income countries can access quality vaccines at affordable prices. We’re also looking at other partnerships with Indian manufacturers as data on new vaccine candidates emerge.Of course, developing safe and effective vaccines is only the beginning of the story. Distributing the vaccine matters, too. Now, the world has to get those doses out to everyone who needs them — no matter where they live. To make that happen, we’ll need to rely on organisations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Gavi has delivered vaccines to 822 million kids in low-income countries over the last 20 years, and now they’re helping lead the international effort to distribute Covid-19 vaccines.As hard as it is to imagine right now while so many people are still suffering from Covid-19, this pandemic will come to an end someday. When that moment gets here, it will be because of the people all over the world who came together to steer us through this crisis. Their courage and commitment will get us past this pandemic, and we owe it to them to recover in a way that leaves the whole world stronger and more prepared for the next challenge.

28-01-2021||Editorials||Security will be a key driver of India-US ties||On Wednesday, in its first official outreach with New Delhi, the Joe Biden-led administration reached out to India. The newly confirmed Secretary of Defence, Lloyd J Austin, spoke to his counterpart, Raksha Mantri Rajnath Singh while President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke to his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval. The fact that the first two calls from the United States (US) to India, under a new dispensation, revolved around issues of security is representative of both the enhanced strategic convergence between the US and India and the fact that the security-intelligence-defence matrix will remain a key driver of bilateral ties.The calls will help allay apprehensions that still permeate through segments of India’s strategic community about US intent with regard to China, under Mr Biden. The nature of US engagement may change with Beijing — and Washington will seek to find a common ground, especially on climate. But the statements of newly appointed officials in the administration indicate that Democrats will continue to treat China as the single most important strategic adversary and an increasing threat to the international order. The US emphasis on Indo-Pacific in both calls indicates that it will not dilute its position. This is good news for India.This does not mean that the relationship will not suffer from strains — indeed, whether US waives sanctions that will, under its law, apply to India’s acquisition of S-400 air defence systems from Russia will be an early test. India will also continue to take decisions in the spirit of “strategic autonomy” which will upset the US, just as the US may engage with Pakistan in a manner that upsets India. But initial conversations indicate that the story will be marked by greater agreement and a willingness to deal maturely with the disagreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/security-will-be-a-key-driver-of-india-us-ties-101611843011201.html
28-01-2021||Editorials||The politics of protest | HT Editorial||With the farm protests turning anarchic and violent on Republic Day, the debate has moved from the substance of the farm laws — which was the original point of discord between protesters and the government — to the nature of Indian democracy, the authority of the Indian State, and the possibilities and limits of the politics of protest. The dark episode — for which farm unions bear responsibility — has lessons for all sides and will have a far-reaching impact.One, any group of citizens who plan protests needs to have a more viable framework in place. Yes, oppose the government and push demands. But if the protests get too prolonged, or if there is an internal tussle where some factions are engaged in the politics of competitive radicalism, or if the protest organisers can’t control their own support base, then they need to revise their methods. In this case, the farm unions had several opportunities to claim victory but refused to do so, swayed by radicalism, only to see the gains of the movement being possibly frittered away. What happened on Tuesday was not just a mere incident of violence — but the fraying of India’s social contract, for which citizens too need to take responsibility. And this can only be repaired with maturity and restraint.Two, the State will have to relook at its approach to protests. The freedom to dissent or protest against the government, of course, is a fundamental right — and despite Tuesday’s provocation, the government must respect this right as a matter of principle. But the frequency and intensity of protests in recent years must prompt a revision in approach. The first objective should be to engage with citizens unhappy with a set of policies and legislations, allay apprehensions, and win them over. This requires a more democratic approach than the government has displayed so far. But if it does not work, and protests do go ahead, the State needs to have better mechanisms in place, including stronger intelligence gathering, to anticipate the mood on the street and prevent trouble. This is the tricky balance in a democracy, where citizen rights and civil liberties must be respected, decision-making should be participative and representative, but the authority of the State and law and order must also be preserved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-politics-of-protest-hteditorial-101611756482940.html
28-01-2021||Editorials||Why Munawar Faruqui matters | HT Editorial||Munawar Faruqui, a stand-up comic, was arrested, along with four others, on January 1 in Indore — based on the complaint of a Hindutva activist and the son of the Bharatiya Janata Party legislator — for a joke he did not crack. The complainant claimed that he had seen videos of Mr Faruqui making jokes that offended religious sensitivities and didn’t want him to do so in Indore. The Madhya Pradesh (MP) Police showed unusual efficiency in arresting Mr Faruqui; the judiciary has not granted him bail, with a high court judge saying such people should not be “spared”. In a separate complaint about a past video, a case has also been registered against Mr Faruqui in Uttar Pradesh.Make no mistake — this is an emblematic case, which brings to question India’s commitment to free speech, rule of law, and judicial fairness. First, Mr Faruqui did not crack the joke he was accused of — and arresting someone in anticipation of what the person would say, and assuming that the statement would offend religious sensibilities, is a stretch by any yardstick. Two, even if Mr Faruqui had cracked a joke, unless it was an incitement to violence or fell under the framework of the reasonable restrictions within which free speech is allowed, MP has little basis to arrest him. Three, the principle of bail being the norm, and jail being the exception, is being increasingly overturned by segments of the judiciary.It was only recently that the Supreme Court took up the arrest of Arnab Goswami — and in a significant intervention, Justice DY Chandrachud said, “If we as a Constitutional Court do not lay down law and protect liberty, who will?” He was also scathing of high courts in general for their handling of such cases. And that may be why the SC should take up Mr Faruqui’s matter and apply the same principle of safeguarding his liberty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/why-munawar-faruqui-matters-hteditorial-101611756481264.html
