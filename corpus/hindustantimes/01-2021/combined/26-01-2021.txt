It will have a 70 megawatt capacity, said officials.Before this, another investment for a data centre project had come from YOTTA Infrastructure, a subsidiary of the Mumbai-based Hiranandani Group. In this 250 MW-capacity data centre, YOTTA will make an investment of ₹6,000 crore in Sector Knowledge Park 5. The company has 20 acres of land allotted for this project.The Greater Noida authority hopes that these two investments will help lure other domestic and international investors for IT-enabled services in the city.“The project coming to Greater Noida is a huge success for us as it will bring big opportunities with it. It will create jobs and help us get more investment in this industrial town,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.According to the authority, the YOTTA project will have a 240 megawatt capacity facility with 25,000 racks across six towers. Officials of YOTTA Infrastructure were not available for comment. “These data centres will be operational by 2022. Once completed, Greater Noida will emerge as a hub of data centres in the country. These centres will store data of different social networking sites,” said Chandar.These two projects are set to create at least 1,500 jobs in Greater Noida’s IT-enabled field, said officials.YOTTA (Hiranandani Group) had applied for the project on October 15.“The project is a huge success for Uttar Pradesh and it will bring investment in this region,” said the developer’s promoter Niranjan Hiranandani on October 15, also the national president of national real estate development council and ASSOCHAM.“The building will house data centres for Google, Microsoft, Facebook and other such companies.

26-01-2021||Noida||Aqua Line metro trains may skip stations with fewer passengers||Noida: Metro trains on the Aqua Line may soon skip stations where the passenger crowd is thin. According to officials of the Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) said the plan is being considered to make metro availability at crowded stations faster during peak hours, which had been demanded by residents and commuters alike. The plan may be implemented from February 1. Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC’s managing director, on the occasion of Republic Day, hoisted the national flag at the NMRC’s office in Sector 29. “In order to reduce the travel time on the Aqua Line and to improve efficiency of services, NMRC will soon run its trains by skipping low-ridership stations during peak hours,” Maheshwari said in a press statement.Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager, NMRC, said details of the timings and the stations that will be skipped have not been finalised yet. If the new plan comes into effect, commuters will be able to travel between Noida to Greater Noida in 30 minutes. Currently, it takes 45 minutes to reach Noida from Greater Noida and vice versa. Stations with low ridership include sectors 143, 144, 145, 146, 147 and 148, among others.This year, Aqua Line saw its highest ridership yet on January 11, with 11,511 passengers, after resuming service post lockdown on September 7, 2020. The average daily ridership on the Aqua Line before the lockdown in March last year was 22,758, while the average daily ridership in December last year stood at 7,915.In her address to the NMRC employees on Republic Day, Maheshwari said that in the coming years, the NMRC should try to achieve excellence in all areas of metro operations and prove to be a model organisation for other metro companies. She congratulated the NMRC operations team for providing glitch-free services to commuters in the past two years of operations. The corporation is currently operating the 29.07 kms Aqua Line from Noida’s Sector 51 to the Greater Noida Depot. The line has 21 elevated stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/aqua-line-metro-trains-may-skip-stations-with-fewer-passengers-101611684925174.html
26-01-2021||Noida||Rioters were outsiders, say farmer leaders at UP Gate||Ghaziabad: Farmers’ leaders at UP Gate have distanced themselves from incidents of violence reported on Republic Day in Delhi, claiming that the people who indulged in these incidents were “outsiders”. They said the protest will continue as usual at the sites.Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said that the people who indulged in violence were “trying to sabotage” the protest. He arrived at UP Gate around 3pm after his tractor rally.“It is not in my knowledge if any flag was put up at the Red Fort. I will enquire if such a thing has happened. We suspect that there were some outsiders who got into our rally and were not obeying our repeated requests. They were trying to sabotage our protest. However, our tractor rally went on well and our protest will continue at the UP Gate site,” he said.“Many of the protesters who had come to attend the rally have gone home while others will stay on at UP Gate and carry on our protest,” he added.On Tuesday evening, the protesters brought in the body of the 25-year-old man who was killed due allegedly to an accident his tractor met with near ITO in Delhi.Rajkishor Singh, one of the spokespersons for the UP Gate farmers’ committee, said the man, identified as Ravneet Singh, had gone to Delhi in his tractor.“His body was brought to UP Gate and will be handed over to his family. He was from Bilaspur in Rampur district,” he added.Police personnel at the site in Delhi said the man was allegedly driving the tractor rashly before the vehicle rammed into a barricade and overturned. The farmers, meanwhile, claimed that the man sustained a hit on his head allegedly by a teargas shell, as a result of which he died, but they refused to go ahead for an autopsy.On Tuesday morning, some of the farmer leaders stood at UP Gate till 11am while many of the protestors, including those upon tractors, broke open the barricades at the border and entered the national Capital.“Those who created a ruckus with tractors and indulged in violence were quick in their actions and their body language revealed their intentions, and the fact that they could not be farmers,” BKU’s national press co-ordinator Shamsher Rana said in a statement issued Tuesday night.“We will continue our protest till the three laws are repealed. I have never seen such a big protest in my life and the government will be impacted by this agitation. From now on, they will think 100 times before taking any decision,” said 69-year-old Shankar Singh, who joined the protest from Iglas in Aligarh and took part in the 24-hour relay fast at UP Gate.For the tractor rally, officials of the Ghaziabad administration as well as the Uttar Pradesh police had held several rounds of talks with farmers’ leaders during the past couple of days. Even the local intelligence wing from Ghaziabad was active on a day-to-day basis.“The Delhi Police issued their press release about the route and plan and we also received communication on Monday. There is no intelligence failure on the part of Uttar Pradesh; besides, there has been no law and order issue in our area and many farmers have returned,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls made repeatedly for his comments.After incidents of violence in Delhi came to light, hundreds of tractors which were part of the rally made a hasty retreat as many returned to the UP Gate protest site, while others took to the Delhi-Meerut Road and NH-9 to rush to their hometowns.Officials of the traffic police said that tractors followed the designated rally route in Ghaziabad. The officials, however, said they did not have figures for the number of tractors which entered the district on Tuesday and said that the figures were not readily available.“Many of them entered the Ghaziabad district from Apsara border side and went to Hapur road, and took up the designated route to UP Gate. In wake of the situation, we have our traffic personnel deployed. The Delhi Police have barricaded four of our border points including the one at Kaushambi and Surya Nagar,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police, Ghaziabad (rural).(With input from HTC, Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rioters-were-outsiders-say-farmer-leaders-at-up-gate-101611684805202.html
26-01-2021||Kolkata||'BJP wants to establish 'Ram rajya' in Bengal': Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram||The Bharatiya Janata Party wants to establish 'Ram rajya' (rule of lord Ram), in West Bengal by winning the coming assembly polls, BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari said on Tuesday at a rally at Nandigram in East Midnapore district. He was the legislator from Nandigram before resigning from the assembly and joining the BJP on December 19.Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee has announced that she will contest the seat alongside Kolkata’s Bhawanipore, her old seat.Adhikari’s statement came days after the BJP ran into a major controversy when some supporters raised the “Jai Sri Ram” slogan during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s programme in Kolkata where legendary freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary was celebrated on January 23.“Many people contest an election but only one wins. I believe in the politics of inclusiveness wherein the victor treats the losers as part of the democratic system and treats them with respect. Our Prime Minister is the Prime Minister of all people. This is lacking in West Bengal. At the birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose, the chief minister said the “Jai Sri Ram” slogan was raised to insult her. Nothing can be more sacred than Ram’s name,” said Adhikari.Also read: Explained - As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers wantIncidentally, on Tuesday, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the (BJP), said it does not support the raising of the slogan at the event and called for identification of those involved.“Ram rajya means good ministration that treats Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians equally. Everybody gets two square meals a day, a roof on the head and a job. But our chief minister gets angry when she hears the name of 'Ram' while her nephew flares up when we call him extortionist,” Adhikari said at the rally which was held in support of the three farm laws that triggered an unruly agitation in Delhi on Tuesday.Following Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda, Adhikari had lunch at the home of a local farmer.“Many people ask why Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP. I was insulted for a long time in the TMC. Ministers and leaders mean nothing in the TMC. Only one post matters. Others have to follow orders. I have my spine intact. I could not accept it. Amit Shah welcomed me into the BJP,” said Adhikari and took jabs at the TMC by accusing its leaders of stealing money from the relief meant for victims of cyclone Amphan and food sent by the Centre during the Covid-19 pandemic.“The TMC’s boat is sinking. Nobody can save it now. The party’s young leader wears expensive shoes and uses high-end phones and SUVs,” said Adhikari without taking any name. “BJP workers are ready. I am ready to take on the challenge. I know the ground reality in Nandigram. My roots go deep,” said Adhikari, adding that the BJP will decide who will contest from Nandigram.“It is essential that the same party rules the nation and Bengal. Unless you drive out the TMC people won’t get jobs,” said Adhikari.On December 19, Adhikari and six sitting TMC legislators, a TMC Lok Sabha member, three MLAs from the Left and Congress and at least 20 other district-level leaders of the ruling party joined the BJP at Shah’s rally in Midnapore town. This marked the biggest defection of elected TMC leaders in the run-up to the assembly polls due in about five months.No TMC leader was willing to react to Adhikari’s statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-wants-to-establish-ram-rajya-in-bengal-suvendu-adhikari-in-nandigram-101611684242410.html
26-01-2021||Noida||Farmers’ rally in Noida goes off peacefully||Noida: In Noida, the farmers’ protest and tractor rally remained peaceful on Republic Day. However, a group of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) members blocked the Delhi-Noida road near Chilla border claiming that the police shortened the rally route to only two kilometres. Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president of the BKU’s Bhanu faction went on a sit-in protest with some other farmers at the Chilla border for about three hours.“We were very upset at the way the government handled the protest. First, the Uttar Pradesh government detained several farmers in different districts and also seized their tractors to stop them from participating in the rally. On Tuesday, we had planned to visit Mayur Vihar and then to Akshardham. But the Delhi police had placed multiple layered barricades on the way,” he said. The farmers used tractors to remove one barricade year Mayur Vihar. However, they were stopped again near the Mayur Vihar Extension metro station and asked to take a U-turn to Chilla border, after which the farmers returned and blocked the Delhi-Noida road in protest from 1pm to 4pm.Members of the BKU-Bhanu faction had started gathering at Chilla border since Tuesday morning. Around 300 farmers marched towards Mayur Vihar in 50 tractors and 50 other vehicles such as cars and SUVs. Some of the farmers were seen sitting on tractors’ bonnets and were chanting slogans. The tractors were seen sporting tricolours and stickers saying “I love kisan.” The BKU-Bhanu’s tractor rally was held from 12pm to 1pm. Fourteen-year-old Chand Saifi was seen participating in the rally on his skateboard. “I am a student of class VIII in Aligarh. I have come from my home to participate in the rally and extend support to the farmers,” he said. When asked about his skateboard, he said that on Republic Day, the police personnel demonstrate their skills. “I am also demonstrating my skills of skating. This is what a farmer’s son can do,” he said.Meanwhile, members of the BKU’s Lok Shakti faction organised a parallel tractor rally starting from the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal to the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway to Mayur Vihar and New Ashok Nagar, after which they returned. SK Giri, general secretary and a spokesperson of the BKU-Lok Shakti, said that over 100 vehicles participated in the rally. “We had organised a meeting before the rally and sensitised farmers to maintain discipline. The police team accompanied us throughout the way. The programme was peaceful,” he said. Satyapal Yadav, a resident of Behlolpur village in Noida, was seen mounted on a tractor and playing ‘nagara’ (large drum) in the BKU-Lok Shakti rally. “Nagara is played on big festivals like Holi. Republic Day and the tractor rally are no less than Holi,” he said.Before the tractor rally started, a tractor overturned at the Chilla border in which a farmer leader, Rajiv Nagar, received minor injuries. The driver was allegedly performing stunts but lost balance and the tractor overturned.Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Noida, said that the farmers’ protest in Noida remained peaceful. “The BKU-Bhanu members were confused over the route. They had to take a right turn from the first barricade in Mayur Vihar for New Ashok Nagar. But they breached the barricade and marched forward. The Delhi Police stopped them ahead and made them turn back,” he said. He said the police spoke to the protesting farmers after which the Delhi-Noida road at the Chilla border reopened at 4pm. The Noida-Delhi side of the road remains closed since December 1 due to the farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-rally-in-noida-goes-off-peacefully-101611684685230.html
26-01-2021||Noida||Approved route, timings for tractor rally flouted as UP Gate protesters reach Delhi||Ghaziabad: Senior farmer leaders on Tuesday expressed their displeasure after several conditions, put forth by the Delhi Police and accepted by the protesters, were flouted at the UP Gate border. This includes sticking to a pre-approved route and starting the tractor rally at an approved time, both of which protesting farmers allegedly flouted on Tuesday to reach and occupy Red Fort, before being pushed back. Many of the protesters who were headed to ITO and then to the Red Fort had entered Delhi from UP Gate on the Ghaziabad-Delhi border.Hundreds of tractors, vehicles and trolleys had lined up at UP Gate when around 9.30am, a group of protesters allegedly broke the barricades at the UP Gate flyover and entered Delhi before clashing with the police . One of the major clauses put forth by the Delhi Police was that the tractor rally will begin at noon, after the Republic Day parade was over in Delhi .Further, the protesters also allegedly played loud music with music systems installed on their tractors, and many of them were fitted with trolleys. Both had been barred as part of the undertaking.Some of the senior farmer leaders HT spoke to were upset with the developments that took place in the national Capital.“It had been planned that the protesters would need to be controlled but they wanted to enter Delhi and many even went ahead to ITO and the Red Fort, which were not on the designated route. All the chaos that took place amounts to failure of the leaders to give appropriate directions or control the gathering,” said a senior farmer leader from the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU).“Instead, they should have held a meeting Monday night when the majority of the tractors had come in at UP Gate and briefed them about the route. Majority of farmers are not locals and are not privy to the route or roads,” he added.The Delhi police Monday evening had conveyed to the farmers’ leaders in writing that the proposed route for the tractor rally from UP Gate will move from Ghazipur border, Apsara border, Hapur road, IMS College Lal Kuan and back to the UP Gate/Ghazipur border.A majority of the route was under the jurisdiction of Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad district but most of the tractors allegedly went towards Akshardham in Delhi, where certain groups of protesters allegedly pulled out and brandished swords at the security personnel deployed at the site.As per the designated route, the tractors were to move to road number 56 from the Ghazipur roundabout but a majority of tractors allegedly moved on to the expressway lanes, after breaking barricades at UP Gate, and managed to reach Delhi.Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the BKU, had on Monday said that the rally will go up to Akshardham.The route towards Akshardham was not part of the designated route that was given a nod to by the Delhi Police. Tikait was seen on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway trying to persuade protesters to follow the designated route but they paid no heed once they entered Delhi after breaking barricades at the UP Gate flyover.He returned to UP Gate around 3pm but declined to comment over the chaos and violence in Delhi, saying that he is not in knowledge of the developments.“Our andolan (movement) is peaceful and will remain peaceful. It is a conspiracy. I had called for going to Akshardham but Delhi Police had barricaded some points on the designated route. It must be inquired who were behind such incidents,” Tikait said.Thousands of protesters, which include farmers, volunteers, NGOs and other organisations, have been camping at the UP Gate protest site since November 28 and have occupied the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi Meerut Expressway since December 3.The Delhi Police in a statement said that the force worked with the farmers for the tractor rally and worked as per terms agreed upon, besides taking up required arrangements.“The Delhi Police acted with restraint for a long time but the protesting farmers violated the agreed upon conditions and started their march before the designated time and resorted to rioting and violence. The police took all the required measures to maintain law and order. This protest has led to many policemen being injured and caused a lot of damage to public property,” the Delhi Police said in a statement.(With input from HTC, Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/approved-route-timings-for-tractor-rally-flouted-as-up-gate-protesters-reach-delhi-101611684565203.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Actor Deep Sidhu denies removing tricolour, calls protest 'symbolic'||Amid a massive outrage over protesters hoisting a religious flag at the Red Fort during the tractor rally on Republic Day, actor Deep Sidhu, who was present during the incident, sought to defend their action, saying they did not remove the national flag and had put up the 'Nishan Sahib' as a symbolic protest.The 'Nishan Sahib' flag, a symbol of Sikh religion, is seen at all Gurdwara complexes.In a video posted on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Sidhu claimed it was not a planned move and that they should not be given any communal colour or dubbed as fundamentalists or hardliners.“To symbolically register our protest against the new farm legislation, we put up 'Nishan Sahib' and a farmer flag and also raised the slogan of Kisan Mazdoor Ekta,” said Sidhu.The flag represents the country's “unity in diversity”, he said while pointing towards 'Nishan Sahib', the triangular saffron flag with the emblem of 'Khanda', a two-edged sword, Chakra, a disc, and two Kirpans that cross each other at the handles.He stated that the national flag was not removed from the flagpole at the Red Fort and that nobody raised a question over the country's unity and integrity.Leaders across the political spectrum condemned the violence and the Red Fort incident, with the Congress' Shashi Tharoor saying he supported the farmers' protests from the start but cannot condone "lawlessness"."Most unfortunate. I have supported the farmers’ protests from the start but I cannot condone lawlessness. And on #RepublicDay no flag but the sacred tiranga should fly aloft the Red Fort," the former union minister said on Twitter, tagging a tweet that carried a video of the incident.         Sidhu, who has been associated with the farmers' agitation for the last many months, said "anger flares up" in a mass movement like this when the genuine rights of people are ignored.“In today's situation, that anger flared up,” he said.Sidhu was an aide of actor Sunny Deol when the latter contested from Gurdaspur seat in Punjab during 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Deol, now a BJP MP, had distanced himself from Sidhu in December last year after he joined the farmers' agitation.Swaraj Abhyan leader Yogendra Yadav, who is among the leaders spearheading the agitation against the farm laws, said Sidhu had been disassociated "from our protest right from the beginning"."When he participated in a protest at Shambu border and seeing their activities, the farmer unions had decided to keep them away from our movement," he said.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions that is leading the protest against the three central farm laws, also disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade and alleged that some "antisocial elements" infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.Sidhu, however, said that Tuesday's incident should not be seen in isolation as they have been holding their protest for the last six to seven months.“And it (today's incident) was a continuation of that,” he said.Sidhu said the protesters did not go to Delhi to hurt anyone or damage public property, nor they had any weapon.“We held a peaceful protest without destroying anything or causing any damage to the public property…we exercised our democratic right peacefully,” he claimed, adding, “If we think one person or a personality could do such a big mobilisation of people, then it will be wrong.”Wielding sticks and clubs and holding the tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, clashed with police and entered the city from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort.Over 80 police personnel have been injured in the violence.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-tractor-rally-republic-day-protests-tricolour-actor-deep-sidhu-denies-removing-calls-protest-symbolic-delhi-police-farm-laws-red-fort-firing-101611683185949.html
26-01-2021||Noida||Now, GB Nagar plans to inoculate 20,500 health-care workers in next two sessions||NOIDA: The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration, which faced dismal turnout in the first two sessions of the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive, has now planned to inoculate as many as 20,500 health-care personnel in the next two sessions to be held on January 29 and 30. For the purpose, the district health department has prepared 82 booths in 30 vaccination centres for the two sessions under the first phase, officials said. GB Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that so far 2,452 out of 24,453 health workers have been vaccinated in the district. “The response of health workers for inoculation is not very encouraging. While the turnout was 65.5% (393 out of 600) in the first session on January 16, it was 49.02% (2,059 out of 4,200) in the next session on January 22. We have decided to cover the remaining 22,001 health workers in the four sessions left in the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive,” he said. He further said that to cover maximum number of health workers, the number of vaccination booths and hospitals have also been increased. “We had 42 booths in 14 vaccination centres in the last session, which has now been increased to 82 booths in 30 vaccination centres. Not only that, we had made arrangements to inoculate 100 persons at each booth in the earlier rounds, which has now been increased to 125 persons at each booth,” Ohri said. The CMO also said that the last two rounds of vaccination for the first phase will take place on February 4 and 5. “To ensure 100% turnout in the coming sessions, the vaccination officials have already started sending text messages to beneficiaries about their mandated date of vaccination. They are also inspiring the ASHA and Aanganwadi workers about the benefits of vaccination, who had shown their reluctance in earlier rounds of inoculation,” he said. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district in-charge of Covid-19 vaccination, said that since vaccination portal was not working properly during earlier sessions of vaccination, 100% participation of health workers, marked for inoculation, could not be ensured. “Since Co-Win app is a key component of Covid-19 vaccination, the system needs a steady internet connection to upload the details of beneficiaries and their dosage. Our vaccination officials could not make any amendment in the lists made many days ago. We have decided to resolve the issue by adequate number of data entry operators with laptops at all the vaccination booths in the coming sessions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/now-gb-nagar-plans-to-inoculate-20-500-health-care-workers-in-next-two-sessions-101611684145158.html

26-01-2021||Noida||Noida police induct special commando unit on Republic Day||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar police on Tuesday inducted a team of 25 commandos who have been specially trained to handle emergency situations. The commandos clad in black uniform also participated in the Republic Day parade with other police personnel at Surajpur police lines. Alok Singh, GB Nagar police commissioner, said that these commandos have been trained by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Madhya Pradesh. “This unit is called ‘Pinaka Commandos’. The name ‘Pinaka’ has been taken from Lord Shiva’s Dhanush. This is a highly trained commando unit which will further strengthen the Noida police,” he said. Sriparna Gongulee, additional commissioner of police (crime), GB Nagar, said that the Noida police had selected the 25 personnel and sent them to MP for a commando training. “They have now joined back their duties in Noida. They have a black uniform and are equipped with safety gears. If required, they will be engaged in emergency situations like hostage and terror-like situations,” Gongulee said.While addressing the gathering after the parade, the police commissioner said that the GB Nagar police did a commendable job during the Covid-induced lockdown. “During the coronavirus outbreak, the police personnel worked as corona worriers by helping people get necessary grocery items, rushing patients to hospitals, making containment zones, and helping migrant workers, among others. In this process, three personnel also lost their lives to Covid-19 in the district,” he said.Singh accepted that the rise in cyber crime has really created a challenge to the police. “To deal with law and order issues, the police commissionerate system was launched on January 13, 2020. Now, SP/SSP level officer is heading different departments like cyber crime, women safety and the three zones of the district. The manpower and infrastructure have improved for better policing in Noida,” the CP said.Suresh Rana, UP minister for sugarcane development, attended the R-Day programme as chief guest. On behalf of the state government, Rana presented the platinum medal to the police commissioner for his excellent work. Kumar Ranvijay, addl DCP, Noida, was also conferred a platinum medal on the occasion. Besides, eight police personnel also received medals and cash prizes. On this occasion, the police also demonstrated its dog squad. The dog squad performed a mock murder scene in which a criminal killed a person and hid himself in the crowd. The police team and dog squad soon reached the spot after getting information and found the suspect’s shoe from the spot.

26-01-2021||Noida||Greater Noida authority to build 10k flats under affordable housing scheme||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority has decided to construct 10,000 units under the Prime Minister affordable housing scheme in different sectors of the city, officials said on Tuesday.The authority will build the 10,000 units with the support from the private developers willing to take up the project. To make the project economically viable, the authority will allow the developers to use 10% of total housing project for commercial purpose to earn profit, the officials said. However, the authority is likely to conduct a survey beginning February 1 to first identify those, who are eligible and interested to take up these flats for use, they said.Also, the authority will offer additional floor area ration (FAR) in order to construct more units (other than EWS flats) so that the developer can earn revenue and deliver the affordable houses to people belonging to the economically weaker section, said the officials.“We will invite applications from the interested private developers next month and then the work on this project will begin,” said Deep Chandar, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Under the scheme, the central government offers ₹1.5 lakh fund for one unit having a covered area of 30 square metres and the state government gives ₹1 lakh. The remaining expenditure will be borne by the developer or a group of developers, who will show interest in this project, the officials said.The authority has decided to allot group housing land in sectors 1, 2 and 3 in Greater Noida West. Though a developer will get to build additional units in a housing project to make profit, the EWS units should be at least 35% in the project, said the officials.The authority will give an opportunity to small developers, who can take up three, five and ten hectares to develop units. Small developers can also form a consortium and then take up the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-to-build-10k-flats-under-affordable-housing-scheme-101611682945022.html
26-01-2021||Noida||With drastic drop in bird population, waterbird census paints a grim picture of Dhanauri wetland||Noida:The Asian Waterbird Census -2021, which was held on Sunday, painted a grim picture of Dhanauri wetland — only seven Sarus cranes were spotted suggesting a drastic drop in the overall bird population. Ironically, the wetland – yet to be recognised by the government as a wetland and awaiting protection for the several years – had been proposed to be declared as a Sarus crane sanctuary and a Ramsar site or a wetland of international importancein 2017 by the district forest department.Located at Dankaur in Greater Noida, the wetland sprawls over 101.21 hectares, of which about 33 hectares was under water, as per a remote sensing exercise in 2015. However, as per this year’s survey, the wetland has witnessed a more than four times drop in its overall bird population since last year, prompting ecologists to raise concerns. On January 17, the waterbird census was conducted in the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, while Surajpur wetland saw the census on January 2. According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), 2021, held by Wetlands International South Asia and the Gautam Budh Nagar district forest department on Sunday, only 48 species of water and water-dependent birds were spotted. A total of 1,344 birds —which included 20 resident species and 28 migratory species — were spotted during the day’s census. Last year in January 2020, the first ever AWC was held at Dhanauri and had found a total of 6,227 waterbirds belonging to 59 species, of which 21 were resident species and 38 were migratory species. The AWC-2021 recorded only four species listed on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened, against 11 of last year. The census also pointed out that the waterbody has shrunk and human intervention has led to heavy habitat loss. “The situation of Dhanuari is very critical and immediate remedial actions are required to save the habitat. Against spotting of 31 Sarus cranes last year, we spotted only seven this time. Sarus cranes are what Dhanauri is primarily famous for. Apart from this, the lake has virtually disappeared and only a small marshland or pond remains. Rest of the wetland area had been converted for agricultural use. Whatever water is left has also been largely covered by water hyacinth. The wetlands are fast shrinking with larger dried area turning into grassland. There is an open cattle grazing and human disturbance. It’s time that the wetland is protected before it’s too late,” said TK Roy, ecologist and conservationist, AWC. He said that the waterbirds are one of the key indicators of a wetland’s health with a good number indicating that the wetland has adequate feeding, resting, roosting and foraging spots. Asserting that they are aware and concerned about the deteriorating condition of Dhanauri wetland, the forest department officials stated that the prime reason for the current conditions was that the area was out of their jurisdiction. “We have initiated a process of recognising it. But that is a tedious task as it requires several surveys followed by land acquisition. Meanwhile, we have written to officials concerned in the authority to manage the area and also speed up the process to acquire land so we can declare it as a protected wetland,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar.According to the AWC-2021, the major winter migratory species that flock from central, north Asia included Common Teal ( migrates from north Asia), Northern Shoveler ( migrates from north Asia), Northern Pintail (migrates from north Asia), Greylag Goose (migrates from Central Asia), Bar-headed Goose (migrates from Central Asia), Gadwall (migrates from north Asia), Mallard (migrates from Central Asia), Pied Avocet (migrates from temperate Central Asia). The IUCN Red-listed threatened species recorded in the wetland included Black-tailed Godwit, Painted Stork, Sarus Crane and Black-headed Ibis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-drastic-drop-in-bird-population-waterbird-census-paints-a-grim-picture-of-dhanauri-wetland-101611682884988.html

The police said drones were to keep a check on anti-social elements as well as to streamline vehicular movement on roads. The drones were also used to check if anybody was carrying weapons to the protest.The drone teams coordinated with the traffic police at each intersection and also with their counterparts on the ground about farmers’ movement. Drones were deployed at Sehrawan, Dharuhera, Bilaspur, Manesar, Tau Devi Lal Stadium, Sirhaul toll, Rajiv Chowk, Old City, near Kapashera border, Hero Honda Chowk, Farrukhnagar and Pataudi.Each drone was monitored by a team of four officials, headed by an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), with technical experts handling the controls.Nearly 4,000 police personnel, including deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and ACPs, were deployed at the key spots along the route taken by the farmers on Tuesday. The police said that this was the first time that so many drones were used to monitor a large-scale movement. The department owns one drone and had hired the rest from private agencies.Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), was seen monitoring the first drone at Manesar border near Sehrawan. He was checking the traffic movement, parking of trucks and placement of jersey barriers through the drone and instructed the placement of shipping containers to prevent the entry of farmers into Gurugram. “The drones came in handy and gave a distant view to know the exact movement of vehicles. We could monitor a distance of up to two kilometres and kept updating the personnel, who were on alert,” he said. The police said they decided to use drones for monitoring due to the long distances, as farmers started their march towards Manesar from Shahjahanpur in Alwar district at the Haryana-Rajasthan border, Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village, near Dharuhera. “We were expecting them to reach by 1pm but they got delayed and reached Manesar around 3.30pm as they were driving slow and were waiting for the farmers from Shahjahanpur, who started late. The police force coordinated well and passed timely information, which helped to manage the law and order situation,” said Yadav. Yadav was seen monitoring and passing information through wireless handsets, and was in constant touch with teams from Dharuhera and Bilaspur. “Drones also helped us for parking the trucks on the NH-8. We parked them on a stretch of at least two kilometres, as a security layer. Drivers were asked to park their trucks on the main carriageway and we did not allow any vehicle to pass. We were also recording the movement and were informing the PCR vans just before the rally was about to reach their point of jurisdiction,” he said. More than 300 vehicles had proceeded towards Manesar from multiple locations in Rewari and Dharuhera, to protest against the farm laws. The farmers carried out the tractor rally on two different routes skirting Manesar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/11-drones-pressed-into-service-to-keep-check-on-farmers-rally-in-gurugram-101611682585697.html

A team of enforcement wing officials that conducted the inspection were responding to complaints lodged by residents at the CM Window.“Although this is a bilateral matter, we decided that a construction audit of these structures should be carried out by structural engineers so that corrective action can be taken. A report is being sought in this matter,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, who was part of the team.Enforcement officials said that in the last 10 days, they have resolved 40 complaints, related to illegal guest houses, excessive construction, encroachments and illegal colonies, lodged at the CM Window.In a related development, the DTCP has also directed developers of affordable housing projects, where the construction is going on at a slow pace, to expedite the work.DTCP officials said that a review meeting was held to check the status of affordable housing projects. Details obtained from the developers were discussed in detail and a report prepared on its basis. The department said that while the progress of a majority of the projects was satisfactory, construction was found to be less than 30% in many.“We have issued directions to the developers not to demand more money from buyers till they carry out construction to a reasonable level. A report in this regard has also been sent to the headquarters,” said Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner. He said that the department has also recommended higher authorities to link payments in affordable housing to construction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/guest-house-sealed-unauthorised-construction-razed-in-ardee-city-101611682584988.html
26-01-2021||Gurugram||Commuters take long detours to reach Manesar, Gurugram||Hundreds of commuters who were on their way to Manesar, Gururgam and further towards Delhi on Tuesday were in for a tough time as they were forced to take a 40-kilometre detour through Jamalpur, via Sector 10, which connects Hero Honda Chowk to the National Highway-48, due to the farmers’ tractor rally.Families, with toddlers in one hand and trolley bags and suitcases in the other, were seen crossing the borders on foot as autorickshaws they had boarded were not allowed beyond Sehrawan in Manesar on Tuesday.Borders witnessed chaotic scenes with people trying to cross the barricades with heavy luggage. People from Gurugram and Delhi booked cabs at the Manesar border and walked on the service lanes to boarded their cars after crossing the border near the National Security Guard (NSG) campus gate.More than 250 people returning from Rajasthan were in for a shock as the bus they were travelling in dropped them at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, 55 kilometres away from Sehrawan in Manesar.Naveen Gope, a Delhi resident who was returning after a three-day trip to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan with his family and friends, said they were dismayed upon finding out that they had to travel 55 kilometres on foot. “Luckily, we saw an autorickshaw driver and requested to drop us at a point where we could find transport. He dropped us at Dharuhera, where we had to wait for an hour to get another transport. We had to change five vehicles to reach Sehrawan,” he said.Commuters said that autorickshaw drivers, sensing an opportunity to make a quick buck, charged them high fares. Some were charged as much as ₹600 for a drop to the border, a trip which usually costs ₹100, where they could board a bus.A Delhi resident, who was returning from a trip from Udaipur with his friends, said they walked from Shahjahanpur to Manesar. Eight persons, carrying bags on their shoulders, walked 55 kilometres with short breaks and had community lunches offered by the protesters on the route. “Thankfully, we were not carrying much luggage, else we would have been in trouble. We could not find any transport to reach Gurugram where our other friends were waiting since the morning to pick us. Never in our lives have we walked so many kilometres at a stretch. Had we known about these restrictions, we would have returned a day later,” said Simrat Singh, a final-year student of Delhi University.Many families who were travelling from Panchgaon were asked to take the Sohna route to reach Gururgam. They had to travel two extra hours to cover a stretch of 16 kilometres.Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said that the routes were already announced and the borders were sealed on Tuesday morning due to the farmers’ tractor rally. “Commuters were informed at other checkpoints as well not to enter Manesar, as both the carriageways were blocked. Still, many came to check the situation physically. Many commuters, who had arranged for vehicles in Manesar area, were allowed to cross the stretch on foot. Despite knowing the situation, people did not refrain from moving on this stretch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/commuters-take-long-detours-to-reach-manesar-gurugram-101611682525545.html
26-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers’ tableaux portray constraints posed by farm laws||On the lines of the official Republic Day parade, the tractor rally led by farmers also featured tableaux depicting different themes related to farmers and their protest against the new farm laws.While the tractor march from Dharuhera was led by one tableau, farmers camping at Shahjahanpur had prepared tableaux from different states mounted on 27 tractors. Besides the state-specific tableaux, a special tableau dedicated to farmers who had died during the course of the agitation was also displayed by protesters from Shahjahanpur.According to the protesters at Dharuhera, their tableau was meant to demonstrate why they believed the three contentious farm laws were perilous. Amandeep Singh Godara, who stood on the tableau with a symbolic noose around his neck, said that the idea behind the tableau was to visually demonstrate that the farm laws had dealt a deathly blow to farmers.“We have a noose around our neck to show that the government’s actions and treatment of farmers are killing us. While farmers are unhappy and dying under the weight of debt, the government, corporations and pro-establishment media are celebrating our misery,” said Godara, who was dressed in a white dhoti-kurta and turban.A resident of Sirsa, Godara has been involved in the protests since November.Besides the noose, farmers on this tableau had placards affixed to their chests to portray that farmers, labour and small businessmen would suffer due to the three laws. Posters of peasant leader Chhotu Ram were also plastered on the tableaux.Saddam Hussain, a farmer from Hanumangarh, said that the tableaux were a visual demonstration that farmers were not free due to the constraints posed by the three laws.Each of the tableaux led by the farmers from Shahjahanpur included pictures of important cultural identifiers of different states, besides a special tableau dedicated to farmers who had died during the protests.Sanjay Madhav, state convener, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rajasthan, said that the tableaux gave glimpses of the village life in different states. “ The tableaux encapsulated the sacrifices made by farmers who had died in the protests so far. Besides this special dedication, other tableaux were state-specific,” said Madhav.Protesters said that farmers from multiple states, including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Kerala, took part in the tractor rally on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-tableaux-portray-constraints-posed-by-farm-laws-101611682526201.html
26-01-2021||Gurugram||Tractor rally goes off without a hitch in Gurugram||Thousands of farmers from different states who have been protesting at Shahjahanpur and Dharuhera against the farm laws took out a tractor rally on Tuesday via NH-48 on the Delhi-Jaipur highway amid heavy police presence. Unlike neighbouring Delhi, where clashes broke out between farmers and police, the march remained largely peaceful. An altercation between locals from Sidhrawali and protesting farmers did take place, but the police diffused the situation. The tractor march began from Masani barrage at Dharuhera and Shahjahanpur at the Haryana-Rajasthan border around 11am and continued till 7pm. Farmers drove on the Delhi-Jaipur expressway for nearly four to five hours to reach the Government Polytechnic at Manesar, near the NSG training centre, from where they took a U-turn to return to their respective protest sites. While farmers from Shahjahanpur covered nearly 56 kilometres, farmers from Dharuhera covered nearly 29 kilometres on their way to Manesar. Farmers from Mewat also took out a tractor march in the region from Sunehra border to Punhana to Pinangwa to Shikrawa and back to Punhana and Sunehra. Maulana Arshad Meel, who is spearheading the Haryana-Rajasthan Mewati Kisan Andalon (movement) protest at Sunehra-Junehra, said that they covered nearly 50 kilometres. “We can’t estimate but many thousands of people participated in the march today,” said Meel.To prevent farmers from marching beyond the designated points, the Gurugram police had placed around 150 concrete blocks, weighing 20 tonnes each, to erect a four-foot wall. Over 100 steel containers affixed with heavy bolts and steel chains were also placed on the highway to prevent movement of tractors, said officials. The police also used drones extensively to monitor the movement of protesters and the movement of traffic. A police PCR vehicle and large teams were deployed at each kilometre point. Around 2,000 police personnel were deployed at Sehrwan and 1,200 were deployed at Manesar. Resham Singh, a farmer from Hanumangarh, said that farmers stuck to their routes and peacefully returned to their protest sites. “We followed the routes and stayed patient despite being attacked by unknown people who threw stones on our convoy. I don’t think the arrangements made by the police were strict. They were not around when people threw stones at us. The march continued peacefully because of farmers. The police had no role to play in the successful conclusion of the march. “At Dharuhera, the march started after farmers paid tribute and hoisted the Tricolour flag at the site. Master Harish, 42, a farmer from Khera Khalilpur in Nuh, who arrived at the protest site in Dharuhera on Monday, said that the tractor march would make citizens understand and appreciate the role of farmers. “Farmers are running from pillar to post to get these farm laws repealed. These laws are against farmers and need to be opposed at all costs,” said Harish, who drove a tractor during the march. Kalwant Singh Bhullar, his companion on the tractor, chimed in agreement. A resident of Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, Bhullar said that the march is the need of the hour. “We feed the country. Be it harsh winter or summer, we toil hard to produce food. We will convince the government,” said Bhullar. Labh Singh, a farmer from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, who has been camping at Shahjahanpur protest site since last December, said that the cavalcade of protesting farmers proceeded towards Manesar before returning. “Around 700-800 tractors took part in the tractor rally. The government should now understand that farmers will not give up on their demands. We will now wait for the government to repeal the three laws,” said Singh. Sanjay Madhav, state convener, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rajasthan, said, “While it’s difficult to give a number, 1,500-2,000 tractors from our protest site joined the march today.” Sukhjeet Singh, a farmer from Padampur in Shri Ganganagar, said that things were bound to change after the tractor march. “We are fighting for the rights of common people,” said Singh. The Haryana Police had deployed nearly 4,000 personnel at Manesar, Sehrawan and Bilaspur crossing to keep a check on movement of the tractor rally. A U-turn for the protesters had been carved out at Sehrawan, a kilometre before the NSG camp in Manesar. Police officials said that a divider on the Delhi-Jaipur highway was moved to ensure that tractors could take a U-turn to return. “All the traffic movement was videographed and photographed. Police personnel with water cannon and teargas shells were deployed, but were asked to use these only if required,” said Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Manesar). Varun Singla, deputy commissioner of police, Gurugram, said that the police had hoisted two large banners of the national flag so that protesters could pay respect. “We also hoped that the farmers would respect the dignity of the national flag and refrain from agitation,” he said. The police did not allow commuters from Jaipur to enter Manesar the national highway and asked them to take a detour. Even locals who wanted to reach Manesar were forced to take long detours to reach their homes, as they had to go via Jamalpur. Astha Modi, DCP (headquarters), said, “The teams managed law and order well and rally was carried out in Gurugram and Farrukhnagar. The KMP was closed on Tuesday morning by the Jhajjar police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/tractor-rally-goes-off-without-a-hitch-in-gurugram-101611682524998.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||R-Day weekend shopping therapy: Sale, discounts were a hit||For sale is the best time to shop is nothing new. But during Covid times when people have taken to online shopping more than ever before, what’s best than to shop at discounted prices over long weekend? Any shopaholic would agree! And this Republic Day, that’s what exactly happened. Most took maximum advantage of heavy discounts available at websites online and physical stores, too. Wait was worthwhile“I was eagerly waiting for the Republic Day weekend sale to buy a pair of wireless earphone and a smart watch since discounts on electronics are quite luring around this time. Even before the pandemic I used to shop mostly online since it’s convenient. But now, not just me even my parents prefer shopping online and have abandoned their old demands of going to various shops to check out the best prices available. Though online shopping we have ordered electronics, apparels, footwear and even groceries! Prompt service and a range of options with an added advantage of minimal contact has made online shopping comfortable and preferred choice for most during the last few months,” says Ritika Vaswani, a Delhi-based corporate employee. More discounts, more funKhusbhoo Wadhva, a homemaker, says she got great deals online this time around, even more than last year. She says, “For was my mother’s birthday, which went by recently, I bought everything online. I ordered for her a sweater, a hoodie and a jacket. In fact before ordering online, I went to a mall nearby my house and on checking out the discounts there I felt that the offers available online are definitely better. And the bill I paid this time around is lesser than what I had to shell out of my pocket last year around the same time. That’s a win-win situation for me!” Less crowded malls were a reliefUsually every year what makes news is the high number of shoppers who turn up at malls to avail discounts. But this time around, some shoppers say that they felt comfortable on witnessing lesser people since it allowed them to feel safe and follow Covid guidelines. Upasana Arora, an artist and designer, says, “I bought a pair of lounge wear, shoes and body mists from the Republic Day sale going on. I spent around ₹3,500 and am really happy with the discounted prices at which I bought these! I had a great time shopping at the mall as it was much less crowded unlike previous years when it used to be a struggle to even find a parking on January 26!”A Delhi-based pilot, Tej Pratap Singh Sandhu, adds, “I purchased trousers and some clothing for my wife, which was billed at about ₹5,000. I also bought some make-up for her. All this was possible for us to do because the mall wasn’t too crowded; may be because I went on the first day of Republic Day sale. But almost all stores had some or the other offer that made us save a lot. It was great fun to shop mark down.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rday-weekend-shopping-therapy-sale-discounts-were-a-hit-101611682167677.html
26-01-2021||Pune||Maharashtra CM inaugurates jail tourism in Pune||The "jail tourism" initiative was inaugurated by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray through video conferencing at Pune's Yerawada Central Jail on Tuesday. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar was present at the prison premises on the occasion of 72nd Republic Day.The launch of the event was done by 10 students from Genba Sopanrao Moze Vidyalay, chaperoned by three teachers, and were among the first few tourists at the jail premise.“Now one doesn’t need to commit a crime to visit the jail. Instead of “jail bharo”, people can now indulge in “jail firo”. This book by Balasaheb Thackeray describes the jails of yesteryears often described as containers with phenyl, aluminium cutlery with some space to sleep. That cutlery served all kinds of purposes,” said Uddhav Thackeray while speaking through video conference.He also reminisced the historical importance of the jail premise where the revolutionary Chapekar brothers were sent to the gallows for the murder of British official WC Rand and his security escort for their brutalities on citizens of Pune during the plague in the 1890s. The same yard where the Chapekar brothers were hung for their crimes was also where Ajmal Kasab, convicted in the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, was hanged to death.Also read: As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers want“Nana Patole and Aditya Thackeray had spoken about expanding tourism in Maharashtra only days before this proposal was put forth. State home minister Anil Deshmukh came up with the unique idea and came to my house one fine day to put it across. ADG (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told me about the places where various freedom fighters were imprisoned. 150 years is not a short period. Even today, it is a specimen of an architecture. Balasaheb Thackeray had also been to this jail. He had written to Late Meena Tai. I happened to come across that letter recently,” said Ajit Pawar.The prison had been home to freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Motilal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel during the freedom struggle of India."We visited the Gandhi yard, Nehru yard, the fashi (hanging) yard, and witnessed the history that we teach our children. It was an experience that brought those lessons to life," said Nathu Jagdale, teacher at Moze school.Local legislator Sunil Tingre, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, ADGP (prison) Sunil Ramanand, and police commissioner Amitabh Gupta were also present during the inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maharashtra-cm-inaugurates-jail-tourism-in-pune-101611678933937.html

However, Padmaja refused to cooperate with the police for conducting a medical examination.“She went hysterical while going to the hospital. She claimed herself to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva and that she had poison in her throat, and so, there was no need for conducting any Covid-19 test on her,” Madanapalle inspector of police Srinivasulu said.She went on saying that she had already driven away Covid-19 from her. “Shiva is back, work is done. I am Shiva,” she screamed.The police inspector said as Padmaja refused to enter the hospital, the doctors came out and took her throat swab sample at the police van. Later, the police took the couple to the police station for formal registration of the case.On Monday evening, the bodies of the two daughters were cremated at the local crematorium.

26-01-2021||Mumbai||'Maharashtra handled farmers' stir maturely': Pawar jabs Centre over Delhi clash||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra, comprising parties like Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), have condemned the violence by the farmers in Delhi, at the same time also put its onus on the Central government for its mishandling of the farmers protests at the Delhi borders.Former Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar blamed the Centre for the violence in the national capital. “No one will support such violence but then the question arises who forced them to indulge in such acts? It was squarely the responsibility of the Central government to talk to the farmers and solve this impasse,” he said.Also read: Farmers' body Samyukt Kisan Morcha calls off tractor rally with immediate effect“From the last 60 days, these farmers from Punjab and Haryana were sitting patiently at the Delhi borders asking for the farm laws to be withdrawn but the government displayed no serious intentions to solve this matter,” said Pawar. He warned the government to deal with the matter maturely or have Punjab slip into a state of anarchy.Pawar lauded Maharashtra government for handling the farmers' protest. “There was a farmers' protest in Mumbai as well but the state handled it very sensitively and in a mature manner. The Central government should have done the same with the tractors rally,” said Pawar.He said using force will not achieve anything. “Even now, the government needs to sit down with the farmers and initiate a dialogue to solve this issue. If the government feels it can achieve its goals by using violence then it’s mistaken,” he added.State Congress chief and Maharashtra revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat also pinned the violence on the Modi government. “The farmers have been camping from the last 60 days but the Central government was just wasting time instead of indulging in serious talks. Besides, the government was branding the protesters as ‘Khalistanis’. Such actions forced the protesters to the wall,” accused Thorat.The protesting farmers on Tuesday clashed with the police at several places in Delhi and entered the iconic Red Fort and ITO area in the heart of the national capital. Hundreds of them deviated from pre-decided routes, prompting security personnel to resort to lathi-charge and fire tear gas.The Shiv Sena was quick to taunt the BJP-led Central government. “This is one of the blackest days in the history of India. Now, the question is why did the farmers lose their patience? Had this incident occurred anywhere else, they (read BJP), would have demanded resignations from Sharad Pawar, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee or even from Uddhav Thackeray, now whose resignation will they demand? questioned Sena MP Sanjay Raut. “The Central government needs to introspect,” he added, saying that there was a farmers' rally in Mumbai as well which was handled efficiently by the MVA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cong-ncp-sena-condemn-violence-slam-centre-for-mishandling-farmers-protest-101611673866206.html
26-01-2021||City||Ahead of civic and panchayat polls, BJD to hold sports tournaments to woo youths||Ahead of the civic polls later this year and gram panchayat polls next year, Odisha's ruling Biju Janata Dal is planning to organise football and cricket tournaments from panchayat to the district level in places where its base is under siege from the BJP.Beginning February 8 and 9, the party would host football and cricket tournaments respectively at tribal-dominated Mayurbhanj district under the name of Mayurbhanj Premier League and then follow up with similar tournaments in the districts of Koraput, Malkangiri, Kalahandi and Nuapada. In all these districts, the BJP is proving to be its biggest challenger.BJP MLA Pranab Balabantray unveiled the logo, jersey and trophy for the Mayurbhanj Premier League at a function held at Baripada town. He said the party will later extend the programme to other districts after witnessing the success of the MPL. "The chief minister would launch some programmes to platform to the budding talents," said BJD MLA Amar Satpathy.At least 32 teams will be formed in every district for the premier league. The party has appointed an observer to select players who will take part in the tournaments. The tournaments will be organised by the youth and students wings of the BJD without the party's election symbol of conch and will carry the picture former chief minister Biju Patnaik.Also read: Amit Shah orders deployment of additional paramilitary forces in DelhiThe hosting of such tournaments comes in the wake of the state government building a brand-new hockey stadium - the largest in the country - in the steel city of Rourkela of Sundargarh district. With a seating capacity of 20,000, the stadium to be built on 15 acres of land will act as the second venue for the 2023 Hockey World Cup alongside the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.Incidentally, the districts where the BJD is promoting sports are the places where the BJP is seeing an upsurge in its electoral fortunes. In Mayurbhanj district, the BJP won the Lok Sabha seat in 2019 general elections as well as 6 of the 9 assembly seats. In 2017 panchayat polls, the BJP had won 49 of the 56 zilla parishad seats. Similarly, in Sundargarh district, the BJP had won 3 of the 7 assembly seats and the lone Lok Sabha seat. In Malkangiri district too, it won one of the 2 seats.Describing the tournament as another poll gimmick, BJP spokesperson Golak Mohapatra said the BJD usually comes up with such ideas to garner public support just before the elections. "These announcements come just before the elections. In 2019 elections, the BJD had given mobile phones to youths in the name of Biju Yuva Bahini and distributed crickets bats and balls, but once the elections are over, the party doesn’t remember the youngsters who worked for them during the polls,” said Mohapatra.However, BJD leader Subrat Chhatoi said there was no politics in holding such tournaments. "If the BJD is holding such tournaments it is only to help youngsters," he said.Political analysts said the new plan may not succeed as the youths in these districts want employment rather than sops.“It is doubtful if the youths in these districts can be wooed with football and cricket tournaments. At best, they are just short-term measures," said Gyana Ranjan Swain, political science professor at Gangadhar Meher University in Sambalpur. "The government should instead focus on creating a culture of sports across schools and colleges through various schemes."Political analyst Rabi Das said youngsters and students were seen inclining towards the BJP during last elections. "So, the programme might be a plan of the BJD to revalidate its support base among youth mass. At a time when youths are in a dire need of job, the plan of the ruling party may not yield many fruits,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-civic-and-panchayat-polls-bjd-to-hold-sports-tournaments-to-woo-youths-101611669664251.html

The Left parties and members of the Sikh community on Tuesday successfully held rallies in the districts and Kolkata.“We condemn the baton charge on farmers and use of tear gas shells by the Delhi Police. We will organise protests in all districts on Wednesday,” said Becharam Manna, president of the TMC’s peasants’ front and legislator from Haripal in Hooghly district.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee took to the social media to offer her support to the farmers."Deeply disturbed by worrying & painful developments that have unfolded on the streets of Delhi. Centre's insensitive attitude and indifference towards our farmer brothers & sisters has to be blamed for this situation. First, these laws were passed without taking farmers in confidence. And then despite protests across India & farmers camping near Delhi for last 2 months, they've been extremely casual in dealing with them. Centre should engage with the farmers & repeal the draconian laws," her tweet read.In Hooghly, a long agitation against acquisition of farm land by the erstwhile Left Front government for the Tata Motors small car plant at Singur helped chief minister Mamata Banerjee oust the 34-year-long rule of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led coalition in 2011. Ratan Tata had to shift the project to Sanand in Gujarat. Another land movement was led by her at Nandigram in East Midnapore district.Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury announced that his party would hold a road blockade in Kolkata on Tuesday afternoon in protest against Delhi Police's action.Also read: 'Violence by some elements unacceptable', says Punjab CM Amarinder SinghThe peasants' front of the CPI(M) and other Left parties held rallies with tractors, motorcycles, auto-rickshaws and cars across all 23 districts, demanding withdrawal of the Centre's recent farm laws.

The biggest rallies were seen in East Burdwan, Hooghly, Murshidabad and East Midnapore districts.Amal Haldar, senior peasants' front leader of the CPI(M) said, “More than 600 tractors and two thousand motorcycles took part in the rally that passed through Burdwan town. This is the biggest farmers’ protest in the state’s recent history.”Top CPI(M) leaders, including Bengal Left Front chairman Biman Bose and CPI(M) state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, led a huge roadshow in the heart of Kolkata along with leaders of and supporters of other Left parties on Tuesday afternoon.Videos of the Left rallies went viral on social media.Members of the Sikh community took out rallies with cars and SUVs and drove past the state headquarters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in central Kolkata.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been supporting the farmers of Punjab ever since they started the agitation outside Delhi. Banerjee even sent Derek O'Brien, the TMC's leader in the Rajya Sabha, and some other MPs to interact with the agitators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-farmers-hold-mammoth-rallies-tmc-congress-condemn-delhi-police-101611662209105.html

He visited the border on December 7 to review the arrangements made for them by the Delhi government which included tents and sanitation facilities.On December 8, when the protesting farmers had called for a Bharat Bandh, Kejriwal had alleged that he wanted to visit the farmers at Singhu but was instead put on “house arrest” by the Delhi Police.On December 27, he visited Singhu border again to participate at a cultural event organised by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-violence-has-weakened-the-farmers-movement-condemns-attack-101611663143914.html

26-01-2021||Jaipur||'Farmers’ movement arisen from distrust': Ashok Gehlot||Launching a scathing attack on the central government, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said the farmers are protesting for over two months, this has never happened in the history of the country. “The annadata (farmers) are insulted. Who has given them the right?” he said.The farmers are on dharna (protest) for the last two months, which is an unfortunate situation and not in the country’s interest, he added. "The annadata is not being heard and their sentiments aren’t understood, this is unfortunate. In such chilly weather, they are protesting and taking out tractor rally," Gehlot said.Addressing newspersons, he said, “The demands can be made by any section and there can be a way out. But the process adopted was faulty since the beginning… in Parliament also, the opposition wasn’t heard and had they submitted the matter to select committee, the opinion of farmers could be taken. The basic reason of this situation is distrust.”"In a democracy doesn’t government change its decisions? Changing or withdrawing decisions in view of public sentiments shows a big heart. Tomorrow, a new law could be brought after talks with farmers, but their approach shows they do not believe in democracy. Around 150 people got killed and had they believed in democracy, their thoughts had not been fascist and such a situation would not be there," said Gehlot.Also read: Farmer part of rally dies, protesters allege cops fired at his tractorWhen asked if the central government is afraid of Congress getting the credit, he said neither the farmers' organization, nor we want to politicise the movement.Gehlot went on to say that such a situation has come in the country where there is pressure on all institutions such as the judiciary, the CBI, IT and income tax department. "Conspiracies are done to topple the governments – earlier it was Goa, Manipur then Arunachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh - but they failed in Rajasthan as the public here was united," Gehlot stated.In a democracy, expressing disagreement should be welcomed but here if you disagree with the views of the government, then you are a traitor. These situations have been created inside the country, said Gehlot.The CM also appealed to the farmers to maintain peace and not resort to violence. He said there is no place for violence in democracy. “The farmers’ movement has been peaceful till now. There is an appeal to the farmers to maintain peace and not to commit violence. Violence has no place in democracy,” he tweeted.He said instances of violence will translate into the success of such forces that are trying to make the farmers' movement unsuccessful.On leader of opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria's claims, Gehlot said the BJP do not have much to say and they failed as the opposition. Kataria had said that the state government will topple if a cabinet shuffle takes place. Gehlot said such statements by the LoP and others are just to establish themselves in the party.“I have never seen the kind of disputes and infights there are in the BJP today. All are competing with each other and it's visible,” he said.BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the Central government constantly held dialogues with the farmers and even agreed to some of their demands. The government also proposed to suspend the new laws for one and a half years but the farmers leaders were misled by the Congress and some farmer leaders stayed adamant.He said the BJP in Rajasthan is united and the Congress will face defeat in the upcoming polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/farmers-movement-arisen-from-distrust-ashok-gehlot-101611657869634.html

26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Dealing with protesting farmers tightrope walk : Haryana DGP||Haryana Police chief Manoj Yadava has said that police have been managing the farmers’ protest through dialogue, better intelligence, preventive steps, and keeping an element of surprise in the movement of VIPs. Excerpts from an interview:How well is the state police force prepared to deal with the farmers’ protest? There is a strong presence of the police force on the ground. We have been on the job for almost two months now and have been able to maintain the situation with continuous dialogue. The march on KMP Expressway went off smoothly. So far, the situation has been managed through a combination of firmness and continuous dialogue. While respecting the farmers’ right to protest, we have made efforts aimed at confidence building measures. We are ready for a long haul.Are you seeking more central forces from the MHA keeping in view the escalation in number of protesters and vehicles?More central forces are on the way. In fact, 10 more companies of the central paramilitary forces (CPMF) arrived on Monday. These are in addition to 35 companies of CPMFs we already got (each company has 85 personnel). The more the protest intensified, the more boots on the ground we got.The police advisory cautioned on vehicular movement for three days on Delhi-bound national highways and expressways? Are there any measures in place to deal with the travel plans for case of medical emergency?There are multiple routes to reach Delhi. One can travel through Uttar Pradesh or go via Rohtak and Jhajjar to Gurugram. Though these will be longer routes and will consume more time. We have advised against movement on the KMP e-way as it will get clogged due to the return traffic of tractors once they finish the loop approved by the Delhi Police.Ruling party politicians have blamed the police for not controlling the mob during the Kaimla kisan mahapanchayat in Karnal? How is the police supposed to control agitating crowds without using force?It is a difficult situation. The government has given clear directions to the police to act in a restrained manner. It’s a tightrope walk for Haryana police. We are managing the situation through dialogue, better intelligence, preventive steps, and keeping an element of surprise in the movement of the VIPs. For over two months of agitation, we have tried to engage with the farmer leaders. The Kaimla episode was not a happy one for us. The only positive was that no one was injured or killed. We are trying to do our best.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dealing-with-protesting-farmers-tightrope-walk-haryana-dgp-101611655222581.html

26-01-2021||Kolkata||Bengal: Good people can’t work in TMC, says Hooghly district MLA; quits posts||Making things worse for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Bengal’s Hooghly district where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made deep inroads in 2019 and wrested a Lok Sabha seat, Prabir Ghosal, the ruling party MLA from Uttarpara on Tuesday spoke out against the leadership and quit the posts of district core committee member and spokesperson. “Party leaders who are eager to work for the people are always stopped by a coterie in the TMC. I have been raising several issues related to development since the Lok Sabha polls but nothing has been done. A road in my constituency, for example, is lying incomplete for a long time. I am quitting the district core committee and the post of district spokesperson,” Ghosal said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. Asked whether he would join the BJP, Ghosal said, “I have no such plans yet.” Also Read: Cases drop, Bengal’s Covid Warrior Club faces uncertain futureGhosal immediately drew the ire of the TMC after he said at the press conference that Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December, was only second to Mamata Banerjee as an organiser. He also described former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, who quit the cabinet last week, as “an honest person who did a lot of good work”. The TMC leadership cautioned Ghosal and issued a show-cause notice. “I am hearing it from journalists. I have not received any letter or message till now,” Ghosal said around 2pm. Kalyan Banerjee, TMC Lok Sabha MP from Serampore in Hooghly district, said, “Ghosal is a two-headed snake. Those who want to work for the masses find work in all circumstances. He stays home all the time.” Ghosal is a veteran journalist and is known to be close to chief minister Mamata Banerjee. He left his profession and joined politics on the eve of the 2016 assembly elections just like former Indian cricketer Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who left the TMC on January 5, saying he wants to return to sports. Shukla was the minister of state for sports and youth affairs and was elected from Howrah district, where he lives. Ghosal, on the other hand, was nominated from Uttarpara where his family is well known. Ghosal said he recently witnessed dirty politics to stop him from being invited to the inauguration of the administrative building of a local college where Kalyan Banerjee was the chief guest. “I formed the governing body of this college. In protest, I did not attend a rally of the chief minister on Monday,” said Ghosal. At Monday’s rally, Banerjee said leaders who are aware that they will not be fielded in the coming elections are flocking to the BJP. “Please leave the TMC as fast as you can. This party belongs to sincere workers,” Banerjee said on Monday, sending a message to dissidents like Adhikari who quit the assembly and the Cabinet and joined the BJP on December 19 along with six sitting MLAs and a Lok Sabha member. Asked whether he has been told that he would not be nominated for the polls due in April-May, Ghosal said, “The day Shukla left the party, the chief minister had called me up. When I told her about the problems I am facing, she said I can contest from another seat if I want to.” Another MLA from Howrah, Vaishali Dalmiya, daughter of former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmya who entered politics in 2016 and subsequently won the Bally seat in Howrah district, was expelled by TMC last week for speaking against the party. She, too, alleged that legislators with good intentions are never allowed to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-good-people-can-t-work-in-tmc-says-hooghly-district-mla-quits-posts-101611654742750.html

A local police officer who was under transfer allegedly hadn’t acted on their initial complaint.“We have launched an investigation into the case. A team is tracing the accused,” said S Sengathir, inspector general of police, Ajmer range.To underline that the police were taking the case very seriously, Sengathir added that a Deputy Superintendent of Police-rank officer had been tasked to handle the investigations.The three men had first stopped the woman when she stepped out to get buttermilk on January 19.

The three took turns to rape her, then brutalised her with a glass bottle, she told the police in her complaint.The woman told her family about the gang-rape. But they didn’t initially file the police complaint after the men showed up at their door, threatening to kill them.It was only six days later, on Sunday, that the family summed up the courage to report the crime.A senior officer said the police would also look into allegations that local officers did not register the FIR when the family first complained to the police. The officer said it appeared that the police station in-charge, who was on his way out on transfer, did not react to the complaint.“We will find out if there is any negligence,” the officer said.Rajasthan reports the highest number of rapes and crimes against women in the country, in absolute numbers and as a proportion of their population. According to data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau, Rajasthan had reported nearly 6,000 rape cases in 2019, the last year for which nationwide crime figures have been released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/3-men-gang-rape-25-year-old-woman-then-show-up-at-home-to-threaten-family-101611648333508.html

26-01-2021||Kolkata||Cases drop, Bengal’s Covid Warrior Club faces uncertain future||Nineteen-year-old Alamgir Sheikh, a Covid-19 survivor himself, was once a proud member of the West Bengal government’s Covid Warrior Club. However, with the number of cases steadily dropping, the club and its members face an uncertain future. For instance, Sheikh has recently come to learn that the Kolkata hospital where he worked with Covid-19 patients doesn’t need his services anymore. “I received a letter from the hospital authorities that my service is not needed and that I should report to the state health department. Officials of the state health department told me and some other members of the club that our services are not needed any more,” said Sheikh who served in the hospital for five months.In June 2020, when the pandemic was raging, the West Bengal government formed the Covid Warrior Club comprising survivors. The members, mostly young people, were stationed in various hospitals to help treat Covid-19 patients. There are around 680 warriors across the state. “We used to do odd jobs in the hospital wards, like helping a patient when he needed to go to the toilet, helping him take medicines, change his clothes, eat and even talk to him to boost his morale. We did all of this when most people were even scared to go near them,” said Arob Sheikh, another club member.Now that daily cases have dropped to less than 500 per day -- from around 4,000 new cases being reported every day in November 2020 -- the club is being disbanded and the members have been asked to go home.Also read | Doctors plan to set up Covid-19 museum in Kolkata to commemorate pandemic fight“Some of us have been asked to go . The state-run hospital where I was stationed along with a few other Covid Warriors, used to give us lunch. But over the past two months, that was stopped. We had to buy our own lunch. Dinner and breakfast were, however, served at Salt Lake stadium where several Warriors were staying,” said Bapan Dewan.Also, the state government gave them a stipend of ₹15,000 per month which, some of them, like Alamgir, claim hasn’t come to them since December. Additionally, not all of them will be getting vaccine shots though around 580,000 government and private healthcare workers have been enrolled for Covid vaccination programme.“Covid-19 cases are now declining. The club members were all on contract and were given stipends regularly. Only those members who are still working in hospitals would get the vaccine,” confirmed a senior official of the state health department.Facing an uncertain future, these Covid Warriors have staged a protest against the state health department. Most of them were migrant workers, who had returned to West Bengal after the pandemic started and lockdown was announced in March 2020.The club was the brainchild of Dr Amarendra Roy, an orthopedic surgeon in Murshidabad. The first club was set up in Murshidabad and then it spread to other districts. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself had announced formation of the first club.“It is unfortunate how the club members served the government during an emergency. The government should think of something for them or people would think twice before volunteering in future. They were all migrant workers. Where will they go now?” asked Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cases-drop-bengal-s-covid-warrior-club-faces-uncertain-future-101611637340373.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||50% of Delhi population has Covid antibodies: What the latest sero survey shows||At least half of Delhi’s population may have been exposed to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the latest serological study in Delhi suggests. Here is what we know about the survey: • 56% of the 28,000 people sampled during a citywide survey tested positive for antibodies. • The number was particularly high in the south-east district at 62%, and now appears to fall in a territory that experts believe is close to the herd immunity threshold. • Herd immunity is when enough people have immunity – estimated to be 60-80% of the population in the case of Sars-Cov-2 – to a disease that leaves very few vulnerable people for it to spread to, slowing an outbreak. • The figures are as per a preliminary report of the fifth round of serological surveillance that was submitted to the Delhi health secretary on Monday. Also read | India reports less than 10,000 daily Covid-19 cases, tally over 10.76 million• The detailed report is likely to be submitted by researchers conducting the study from Maulana Azad Medical College by January 28. • The survey was conducted between January 11 and 21. • Experts said the survey’s results are in sync with infection trends seen in the capital • The city went through its worst phase of the outbreak late October and early November, and the number of new infections has now plummeted to a level not seen since when Delhi was still in some form of a lockdown in the summer. • A seroprevalence of 56% would mean a good number of people have been exposed to the infection. • For an infection like Covid-19, it is thought that herd immunity would be achieved when there is a seroprevalence between 60 and 80%. • A mathematical model by the universities of Nottingham and Stockholm has shown that the number could be in the low 40s in the context of restrictions in place to slow the spread of Covid-19. • Studies have shown that even in those without detectable amounts of antibodies, there is still some protection from the infection. • This means the spread of the disease will be very slow and there is unlikely to be a surge in cases in the near future especially with the vaccination drive now adding to the number of people protected against the disease. • The latest figure indicates an over 30 percentage point jump over the last sero survey that was conducted in October, before the city entered the third wave of infections. • Serological studies can be tricky to carry out and read, with sampling design and quality of kits holding a large influence on the outcomes. • Scientists have also cautioned that herd immunity as a concept has not been studied in the context of natural infection, and only refers to protection brought on by vaccines. • The concept of herd immunity does not hold when you talk about natural infection. • Herd immunity is calculated as 1-1/R0 only in the case of vaccine-induced immunity. In case of a natural infection, anyone who is infected also passes it on to others, which is not the case with vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/half-of-delhi-population-exposed-to-covid-virus-all-we-know-about-sero-survey-101611636740197.html
26-01-2021||Patna||Bihar’s ‘Pakadua Vivah’: A tradition still prevalent among upper castes||Sambhu Yadav, 27, was returning home after meeting his sister on Raksha Bandhan when an SUV suddenly pulled up near him in Bihar’s Munger district in August 2019. Within seconds, some unknown men dragged him into the SUV and took him to an unknown destination, where he was blindfolded, and his hands were tied. Yadav, who was kept in a dark room overnight, found himself at a temple the next day with a woman in bridal make-up sitting next to him. Before he could gather his wits, the temple priest began reciting hymns as two to three gun-trotting men oversaw their marriage.Such forced marriages, or Pakadua Vivah, are not isolated but part of a tradition in Bihar’s Begusarai, Munger, Banka, Khagaria, Madhepura, Purnia, Jehanabad, Jamui. Often eligible bachelors are abducted and forced to marry women, whose families cannot afford dowries. Forced marriages were so rampant in the early 1990s in Begusarai that a film, Antardwand, was made on them in 2010. The movie won a national award.Also Read: Bihar man abducted at gunpoint and married forcefully in instance of ‘Pakadua Vivah’According to the State Crime Record Bureau, 7,194 forced marriage cases were reported in the state between January and November 2020, 10,925 in 2019, 10,310 in 2018, 8,972 in 2017. Criminal gangs are often used to kidnap men and force them into wedlock. A large number of such cases go unreported given the fear of these gangs. Pakadua Vivah was again in the news this month when Shivam Kumar, 21, was kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to marry a woman in Bihar’s Jamui district on January 7. Similarly, Vaishali-resident Vikash Kumar was abducted around a month earlier on December 14, and forced into wedlock.Pakadua Vivah is more prevalent among the upper castes, where the demand for dowry is more. “It is mainly prevalent among Bhumihars and Yadav castes,” said a police officer.Police officers say gangs thrive on these high-profit and low-risk crimes and make huge money. They added such forced marriage ceremonies are invariably video-graphed. The gangs ensure such marriages are fully solemnised and brides are sent to their in-laws’ homes. Often such marriages last. Shivam Kumar has since left for Hyderabad with his newlywed wife to join the as a general duty soldier. Yadav, who runs an ice cream parlour, too, has no regrets. He said he got a sociable, pretty wife.But a 17-year-old abducted for marriage on January 19 was rescued in Lakhisarai and his five abductors were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-pakadua-vivah-a-tradition-still-prevalent-among-upper-castes-101611636201257.html

If they miss the vaccine dose then their turn will take a long time,” he saidIn the second phase, the state government has decided to give the dose to 1.8 million frontline workers in the 75 districts.Prasad said the health department has started preparation for completing the vaccination of the health workers in four rounds. “We have adequate vaccines in the cold chains across the state, the vaccinators are trained, the vaccination centres are equipped, and the date of the health workers is being updated regularly on the Co-Win portal. The department plans to organise over 7,000 vaccination sessions at 1,537 vaccination centers in the 75 districts,” he said.When asked about the low turnout of the health workers in some districts during the first and second round, Prasad said the district magistrates and chief medical officers of the districts that recorded low turnout had been directed to take required measures to increase the turnout. The district medical officers had been told to motivate the health workers to take vaccine dose to protect themselves from Covid-19 infection, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-uttar-pradesh-to-finish-vaccinating-all-health-workers-by-feb-5-in-phase-1-101611632599619.html

Former Congress legislature party leader and party veteran Sadanand Singh, former governor Nikhil Kumar, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh, et al, were among scores of senior leaders who met Das at the BPCC office and discussed the road map for bolstering the party’s presence across the state.Also read | Rahul Gandhi accuses PM Modi of ‘leaking information’ about Balakot air strikeBeginning his padyatra from Bikram, the AICC leader will enter north Bihar region with a march in Vaishali and Muzaffarpur on Wednesday. Prominent state party leaders have been given responsibility to make the event a success in their respective regions.Das has also roped in about six-seven delegates from the AICC for feedback. “This is a unique exercise being undertaken by the in-charge to start organisational revamp later next month. The delegates are from other states, like Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, who would be able to provide Das an unbiased feedback,” said a senior BPCC leader.Party’s Republic Day celebration is also important as it is being held in presence of the AICC in-charge for the first time. Das is also likely to have an extended stay in Patna during the upcoming Budget session of the state legislature to assess performance of the party leaders inside the House.BPCC media in-charge HK Verma said Das has asked party workers to actively participate in the Opposition’s human chain formation on January 30 in support of the agitating farmers, who are demanding a repeal of three controversial farms Act by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/farmers-protest-aicc-bihar-in-charge-to-take-out-procession-in-patna-today-101611631459587.html

26-01-2021||Mumbai||HC order on ‘skin contact’ in sexual abuse to face test||The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Monday said that they would challenge the recent ruling of the Bombay high court that acquitted a man of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act because of the absence of “skin-to-skin” contact with the minor victim, even as the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) took suo moto cognizance of the case and urged the Maharashtra government to seek a review of the judgment.In a letter addressed to Maharashtra chief secretary on Monday, NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo asked the state “to take appropriate steps” over the January 19 verdict of justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC which reversed an earlier conviction of a 39-year-old Nagpur resident who pressed the breast of a 12-year-old girl.The HC stated that section 8 of the Pocso Act, which penalizes physical contact with sexual intent without penetration, did not apply here as the minor was still wearing her clothes when the accused groped her, and the section required “strict proof and serious allegations”.“The remark “skin-to-skin... with sexual intention, without penetration” also needs to be reviewed and the State should take note of this, as it seems to be derogatory to the minor victim,” the NCPCR letter stated.Taking exception to the HC’s interpretation, NCW tweeted: “The judgment will not only have cascading effect on various provisions involving safety and security of women in general but also put all the women under ridicule and has trivialized the legal provisions provided by the legislature for the safety and security of women.”Reversing a lower court’s order, the Bombay HC had observed, “Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration,” adding that the nature of punishment called for stricter proof.On February 5, 2020, an extra joint additional sessions judge, Nagpur found the man guilty under Pocso and the IPC sentencing him to rigorous imprisonment (RI) for three years.The HC reduced the man’s sentence to a year’s RI under section 354 IPC which pertains to outraging a woman’s modesty, while it upheld the previous conviction of wrongful confinement under section 342 of the IPC, which carried a sentence of six months in prison.“It has been observed by the Commission that the prosecution has failed in representing case of the victim properly,” the NCPCR chairperson wrote. “If the prosecution had made the submissions as per spirit of the Pocso Act, the accused would not have been acquitted of the serious offence against the minor,” the letter stated.According to a complaint lodged by the mother of the minor with the Gittikhadan police station, Nagpur on December 14, 2016, her 12-year-old daughter had gone out of the house to get a guava. On the way, the man stopped the daughter and told her that he would give her the fruit and took her to his house. In his house, the appellant pressed a breast of the minor and also attempted to remove her salwar.When she confronted him, he denied all wrong doing. The mother then proceeded to search his house and found her daughter locked in a room in a top floor. Upon release, the girl told her parent about what happened, following which a complaint was lodged.Responding to the NCPCR letter, state women and child welfare minister Yashomati Thakur said, “We will discuss it within the department after seeking opinion of the law and judiciary department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-order-on-skin-contact-in-sexual-abuse-to-face-test-101611621214815.html
26-01-2021||Bhopal||‘Such people mustn’t be spared’, says MP HC judge on comic Faruqui||The Indore bench of the Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday reserved its order on the bail application of stand-up comedian Munawar Faruqui, who was arrested in Indore on January 1 on charges of hurting religious sentiments and violating Covid-19 protocol during a New Year event.A single-judge bench of Justice Rohit Arya asked how someone could “take undue advantage of others’ religious sentiments”. “What is wrong with your mindset?” he asked.He said he was reserving the order on merits, after observing that “such people must not be spared.”MP additional advocate general, Pushya Mitra Bhargava, said, “We have opposed the bail prayer. All our opposition has been considered.”Faruqui was arrested on January 1 on the complaint of Hindu Rakshak Sangathan convener Eklavya Singh Gaud, who is also a son of a BJP MLA, Malini Singh Gaud, in Indore just before he was about to start his performance at a restaurant. He has been in jail since. The bail plea was moved by Supreme Court senior advocate, Vivek Tankha, and advocate Anshuman Srivastava on behalf of Faruqui and a co-accused Nalin Yadav on Monday. The order on Yadav’s application was also reserved. Tankha told the court that Faruqui has committed no offence in the case registered against him by Indore police. Srivastava said: “Police also accepted before the court that they didn’t find any evidence.” Government lawyer Amit Singh Sisodia, though, pointed to “objectionable comments” made by Faruqui in the past.“It is obvious to me that freedom of speech and expression is seriously compromised in this country,” former additional solicitor general and senior advocate Indira Jaising said.“Artists are not bound by the religious boundaries and that has been the beauty of art in the world. The Hon’ble judge viewing Munawar as a Muslim and not as an artist is being ignorant of the neutrality of artists who exercise their right of expression for or against anyone and everyone,” advocate Mehmood Pracha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/such-people-mustn-t-be-spared-says-mp-hc-judge-on-comic-faruqui-101611620154576.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Like chai by the Seine||Is it Volga or Thames, Nile or Seine? What is this watery world? With bits of dry land jutting out here and there, the landscape looks like a vast archipelago.This is Yamuna, and it is still Delhi.The river slices through the Capital, travelling from Haryana to UP. Most Delhiites, however, experience it as a bridge to be crossed. For a long time, the term ‘Yamuna-paar’ condescendingly denoted the neighbourhoods on the allegedly wrong side of the river. Indeed, the Yamuna in Delhi makes its presence felt most forcefully during the monsoon, when it floods over its banks, managing to reach the news headlines. Or when it becomes so polluted that it forms picturesque toxic foam that look like drifting glaciers. Some rooftop Tibetan momo places at Majnu ka Tilla do look over the river, but there it seems barely alive.But here on the fourth floor terrace of Cafe Karvaan, in south Delhi’s Abul Fazal Part 1, the Yamuna opens up like a grand riverfront. This foggy afternoon the watery panorama is giving the illusion of a sea—no exaggeration, you have to come here to check on the claim. The curvy road running by the river is clogged with cars and buses, and it does give the mild impression of being a poor country cousin to Mumbai’s iconic Marine Drive. Even from this distance, you can clearly see the birds flying over the river, and paddling upon its surface. A faraway tree is marooned in water, looking like the loneliest among the lonely.The terrace cafe opened this week. It is stocked with hundreds of a great variety of books, most of which are from the private collection of its founder, Asad Ashraf. Poetry collection ranges from Mirza Ghalib to Seamus Heaney. Wall portraits include writers Virginia Woolf and Qurratulain Hyder (she lies buried in a nearby cemetery). A limited selection of tea is on offer and the place still has no menu. Which really doesn’t matter. Try to be here to see Delhi’s great river at its best. The sight is breathtaking, and it just doesn’t feel like the city you know. Preferably drop by on a misty day, when the skyline of Noida’s sector 16 on the other side of the Yamuna remains hidden, and the river seems to extend to infinity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-like-chai-by-the-seine-101611619104464.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||‘Over half of city may have Covid antibodies’: Experts say after 5th sero-survey||At least half of Delhi’s population may have been exposed the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the latest serological study in Delhi suggests, with 56% of the 28,000 people sampled during a citywide survey testing positive for antibodies, according to people aware of the findings who asked not to be named.The number was particularly high in the south-east district at 62%, the people said, and now appears to fall in a territory that experts believe is close to the herd immunity threshold. Herd immunity is when enough people have immunity – estimated to be 60-80% of the population in case of Sars-Cov-2 – to a disease that it leaves very few vulnerable people for it to spread to, slowing an outbreak.“These figures are as per a preliminary report of the fifth round of serological surveillance that was submitted to the Delhi health secretary on Monday. The detailed report is likely to be submitted by researchers conducting the study from Maulana Azad Medical College by January 28,” one of the people added, asking not to be named. The survey was conducted between Jan 11 and Jan 21.Experts said the survey’s results are in sync with infection trends seen in the Capital: the city went through its worst phase of the outbreak late October and early November, and the number of new infections has now plummeted to a level not seen since when Delhi was still in some form of a lockdown in the summer.“A sero-prevalence of 56% would mean a good number of people in the city have been exposed to the infection. For an infection like Covid-19, it is thought that herd immunity would be achieved when there is a seroprevalence between 60 and 80%,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).To be sure, a mathematical model by the universities of Nottingham and Stockholm have shown that the number could be in the low 40s in the context of restrictions in place to slow the spread of Covid-19.“Studies have shown that even in those without detectable amounts of antibodies, there is still some protection from the infection. What this means is the spread of the disease will be very slow and there is unlikely to be surge in cases in the near future. Especially with the vaccination drive now adding to the number of people protected against the disease,” Dr Mishra added.The latest figure indicates an over 30 percentage point jump over the last sero survey that was conducted in October, before the city entered the third wave of infections.Serological studies can be tricky to carry out and read, with sampling design and quality of kits holding a large influence on the outcomes. Scientists have also cautioned that herd immunity as a concept has not been studied in the context of natural infection, and only refers to protection brought on by vaccines.“The concept of herd immunity does not hold when you talk about natural infection. Herd immunity is calculated as 1-1/R0 only in the case of vaccine-induced immunity. In case of a natural infection, anyone who is infected also passes it on to others, which is not the case with vaccinations. So talking about herd immunity in this case, when we don’t have a vaccine yet, will be a mistake,” said T Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, shortly after the city’s second sero survey.A particularly stark warning for Delhi could lie in the case of Manaus, a city in Brazil that was one of the hardest hit regions anywhere in the world, with its first peak in May. By mid-August, serological surveys suggested over 75% may have been infected and the city recorded a sharp turnaround with new infections reduced to a trickle.But cases began rising by October and as of the first week of January, hospitals in Manaus were overflowing with patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-half-of-city-may-have-covid-antibodies-experts-say-after-5th-serosurvey-101611614530860.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Thousands leave for Delhi ahead of rally from Punjab, Haryana||Thousands of tractors clogged key roads in north India on Monday as farmers left their homes in villages, hamlets and cities across Punjab and Haryana to join a tractor rally in Delhi on Republic Day, aimed at pressing for the repeal of three recently passed agriculture laws.Unprecedented fervour about the farmers’ show of strength swept all three regions of Malwa Majha and Doaba in Punjab. Local people reported that the ubiquitous tractor, a symbol of pride and prosperity in the breadbasket state, was missing from its usual parking spot outside houses as entire families left for the Capital.Residents of villages along the highway set up langars, or community kitchens, to serve food to those on their way to join the protests and local shopkeepers offered water, juice and refreshments.“The population of my village is around 1,100 and around 100 men have left for Delhi for the tractor parade,” said Harwinder Singh of Pallah village in Amritsar district.In the Haryana districts of Rohtak, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bhiwani and Dadri, villages emptied out as farmers drove to Delhi in tractors-trailers, cars, SUVs and motorbikes. “Over 1,000 tractors belonging to our khap have moved for Delhi border. Villages are empty as men, women and children are headed towards Delhi. We will take part in the historic parade and the world will witness farmers’ struggle,” said Tekram Kandela, head of Jind’s Kandela khap, a community organisation.Many vehicles were freshly painted and decorated with flowers, with the Tricolour affixed on one side and carrying ration, mattresses and other essentials. “It was not possible for all farmers to reach Delhi, so, it was planned that people will gather at district headquarters on Republic Day for a peaceful protest. All arrangements are in place across districts,” said Resham Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), Bathinda unit.At the Punjab-Haryana border at Shambu, local traders reported surging demand for farm union flags, badges, stickers and other pro-agitation buntings. Jang Singh, Patiala president of Krantikari Kisan Union, said an appeal was made to villagers to send at least two members of their families to Delhi.Dayanand Punia, a farm leader from Bhiwani, said 1,500 tractor-trolleys left for Delhi from Loharu, represented by Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal. “The villagers have collected money to bear all expenses and compensate loss in any vehicle, if any incident takes place. Women in our villages will look after the fields in our absence. At least 11 women from each village will take in the parade,” he added.A long queue of tractors lined the highway from Rohtak to Tikri on the outskirts of Delhi. A 30km-long traffic snarl jammed the road near the Singhu border. Tractors were seen moving at a snail’s pace along the Ambala-Delhi stretch on National Highway-44 and other arterial roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thousands-leave-for-delhi-ahead-of-rally-from-punjab-haryana-101611612077290.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||SC gives Centre two weeks to decide on Rajoana mercy plea||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the government to decide on mercy plea of death row convict Balwant Singh Rajoana in two weeks, and said this would be the “last chance” for the Centre to move ahead on a matter pending since 2012.Rajaona was convicted over the assassination of former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in August 1995, and handed the death sentence by a trial court in 2007. His sentence was upheld by the high court in 2010.The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had moved separate mercy pleas seeking pardon for Rajoana in March 2012. The President’s secretariat forwarded the two mercy petitions, along with similar appeals received from various organisations and individuals supporting Rajoana’s release, to the ministry of home affairs .In November 2020, the Centre informed the Court that the decision on mercy petition was put on hold awaiting the outcome of an appeal filed by Rajoana’s co-convicts. In January, when the matter was last heard, MHA told the court that Rajoana’s file had been processed at their end, and what remained was a decision by the President.In Monday’s hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested for a further three weeks. “The Government is examining the matter...Any decision would have some repercussions in the present circumstances,” he said.However, a three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde found no reason to grant more time. “By way of last chance, list the matter after two weeks,” the bench ordered. Rajoana’s lawyer, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, opposed the adjournment request by Centre on the ground that for over eight years, the Centre has been sitting on a slew of pleas seeking mercy for Rajoana||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-gives-centre-two-weeks-to-decide-on-rajoana-mercy-plea-101611611349310.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Furnish relevant parts of charge sheet: Bombay HC to ex-BARC CEO Partho Dasgupta||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday directed the counsel of former chief executive officer (CEO) of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) Partho Dasgupta to submit relevant portions of the 5,000-page charge sheet filed by the Mumbai Police’s crime branch against him in the television rating point (TRP) manipulation case before it can consider his bail application.Dasgupta, who is currently lodged in Taloja jail hospital, had moved HC after the sessions court rejected his bail application on January 20. He has sought bail the grounds that all the co-accused in the case including the COO of BARC were out on interim bail. However, after the state assured the court that Dasgupta was being provided proper medical care in the jail hospital and that in the event of any emergency he would be shifted to a Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation hospital or Sir JJ Hospital, the court adjourned the hearing to February 2.The bench of justice PD Naik was informed by advocate Shardul Singh, for Dasgupta, that he was suffering from an acute ailment due to which he was prone to becoming unconscious. Singh referred to a January 15 incident wherein Dasgupta had fainted in Taloja jail and had remained unconscious for nearly 17 hours. He submitted that Dasgupta was moved to Sir JJ Hospital without any medical papers or instructions from jail doctors. Singh further submitted that as all the other co-accused in the TRP manipulation case had been granted bail by different courts including the main accused Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, Dasgupta too should be granted bail.However when the court sought to know whether the charge sheet was filed, Singh submitted that it was but the same was not annexed to the bail application as it was voluminous and ran into 5,000 pages. He added that only 10 pages of the charge sheet were relevant for the purpose of the bail application.The bench then directed Singh to prepare a compilation of the relevant portions of the charge sheet and submit it to the court before the next hearing.Chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare, for the state, submitted the discharge papers of Dasgupta from Sir JJ Hospital and also the January 23 medical report from Taloja jail hospital. Thakare submitted that Dasgupta’s condition was stable and he was under continuous monitoring by experts. He added that in the event of any emergency, Dasgupta would be shifted to NMMC hospital at Navi Mumbai or Sir JJ Hospital and similar facilities were extended to accused in other cases too. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as Dasgupta’s condition was stable at Taloja jail hospital, his counsel should prepare a compilation of relevant parts of the charge sheet and submit it before the court and also serve the same to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/furnish-relevant-parts-of-charge-sheet-bombay-hc-to-ex-barc-ceo-partho-dasgupta-101611602476753.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to get five new cyber police stations on Republic Day||The city is getting five new cyber police stations that will start to function from Republic Day. Each of these cyber police stations will be located in five policing regions of the city, said joint commissioner of police (CP) (law and order) Vishwas Nangre Patil. Chief minister Uddhav Thackerey will inaugurate the stations at DB Marg police station on Tuesday.The new dedicated cyber police stations will not be entrusted with any law and order-related or regular bandobast duties and will be presently located in Shivajinagar police station, Govandi for East region; office of the additional commissioner of police at Carter Road, Bandra for West region; Samatanagar police station, Borivli for North region; DB Marg police station at Lamington Road for South region; and Worli police station for Central region.These police stations will be under the control of joint CP (law and order) while zonal DCPs and additional CPs of the regions concerned will supervise and review their functioning, said a senior police officer. Each of these stations would be headed by a senior inspector rank officer and would have four inspectors, six assistant inspectors, 10 sub-inspectors and 40 constabulary.The new cyber police stations will take up cybercrimes involving amount from ₹2 lakh to ₹50 lakh. Cases involving amount below ₹2 lakh will be investigated by the local police, whereas cases involving over ₹50 lakh would be dealt by existing specialised cybercrime police station at Bandra-Kurla Complex which comes under the crime branch.Presently, the city has only one dedicated cyber police station in BKC. “Decentralising the investigation and allocating new police stations at all the regions would make it convenient for the victims,” said a cyber police officer.The five new full-fledged police stations would also enhance the police’s response time to online frauds. In case of cybercrimes, the first two hours are considered to be golden hours, and the new police stations will help take timely action to save people’s money if all goes as planned, another senior officer said. Last year, the city’s only cyber police station managed to save ₹15 crore of cyber fraud victims who approached the police within the golden hour. The new cyber police stations will also improve the quality of investigation of online fraud cases as well as detection, conviction and recovery rate of cybercrimes. In 2020, the city police detected only 207 or 8.5% of the 2,435 cases registered with them.It is important to note here that cybercrime cases, which are registered under Information Technology Act as per government rules, have to be investigated by an inspector rank officer. “It’s important that the new police stations have sanctioned four inspectors, otherwise officers posted there would get overburdened with cases and the purpose of new dedicated police stations would not be served,” said cybercrime expert Ritesh Bhatia. Sources said that 50% of the staff at the new cyber police stations would be women.The existing dedicated cyber police station at BKC, which is overburdened with cases, has only three Inspector rank police officers. All the 95 police stations in the city also has small cybercrime units, but they have very poor detection and recovery rate, police sources said. “Limited manpower and resources are the basic issues cyber police officers face while making investigations of major professional cyber fraud gangs,” said an officer requesting anonymity. “The new cyber police stations must act proactively. Besides investigation, they should also devise a strong fraud money stopping or prevention mechanism. Also, they should regularly review newer modus operandi of cyber fraudsters and create awareness among masses. At present the police department is creating cyber awareness through its Twitter handle,” said cyber expert Prashant Mali. “The higher ups of the police department must understand the importance of training personnel at cyber police stations to detect newer types of cybercrimes as it is a fast evolving world,” cyber expert Vicky Shah said.In the past few years, cybercrime cases have increased by many folds. The cases include financial frauds by impersonating bank executives to obtains debit/credit card details, OTP, obscenity, lottery frauds, man in middle (MIM) attack cases, spoofing, card cloning, hacking, phishing, matrimonial site and frauds on social networking sites. The increasing rate of these crimes raised concerns as it directly affects masses.Cybercrime saw a rise in Mumbai in 2020 despite the Covid-19 pandemic with 2,435 cases of various cybercrime registered as compared to 2,225 cases in 2019. Cases of obscene WhatsApp chats/messages, emails, SMS, social media posts and morphing saw an increase as 247 such cases were reported in 2020 while the number was 239 in 2019. Detection of such case got poorer with only 91 cases detected in 2020 as compared to 104 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-get-five-new-cyber-police-stations-on-republic-day-101611602298270.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Senior Shiv Sena leaders, ministers didn’t attend farmers’ protest in Mumbai||Even as senior leaders of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat, joined the farmers’ protest at Azad Maidan on Monday, the Sena merely extended token support by sending Rahul Londhe, its youth wing functionary, as the party’s representative. Backing the farmers’ protests in New Delhi for the past two months, the Sena had extended support to the farmers’ march from Nashik and other parts of the state to Mumbai to protest against the Central government’s three farm laws. Ajit Nawale, Maharashtra general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha, had said that Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray would remain present at the public meeting. Instead, the Thackeray scion and Maharashtra minister was in Kalyan, about 60km from Mumbai’s Azad Maidan, to inaugurate a rail overbridge. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the overbridge via video-conferencing from Matoshree, his residence in Bandra East. “We support their show of solidarity. But we still need to be careful about Covid, not just for us or the city, but even for the farmers who have assembled there,” said a senior Sena leader. Another leader indicated the party did not wish to be viewed as the one breaching the government-laid rules of no public gatherings during the pandemic. Ironically, Aaditya, urban development minister Eknath Shinde and Sena MP Shrikant Shinde were present at the government function in Kalyan, where hundreds had gathered. Speaking at the inauguration, when the protest at Azad Maidan was on, Thackeray said, “I humbly appeal to all political parties and leaders to avoid large-scale rallies, agitations and protests. Ending Covid is not in our hands, but at least let us not be Covid spreaders.” Thackeray, however, clarified the Shiv Sena fully supports the farmers. “From the MVA, Pawar saheb is leading it and the chief minister is speaking about it. However, even after 60 days, the union government has not yielded to the demands of the farmers. You [the media] should ask these questions,” Thackeray told reporters. Sena leaders Sanjay Raut was unavailable for comment despite several attempts. Sena MP and spokesperson Arvind Sawant said he was out of Mumbai. When the three farm bills were passed in Parliament, the Sena, which has 18 MPs in Lok Sabha, had backed the Bills. But later it walked out of Rajya Sabha when the Bills came up for voting. The Congress and NCP, its allies in Maharashtra, opposed the Bills in both the Houses. “The Sena doesn’t have any cohesive thinking on economy policy, or on agriculture or industries. They only make general statements and this has been since the time of Bal Thackeray,” said Prakash Bal, political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senior-shiv-sena-leaders-ministers-didn-t-attend-farmers-protest-in-mumbai-101611602297135.html

The teacher groups have shown support to farmer and labour unions fighting against the new laws and also raised their voice against the implementation of the New Education Policy (NEP).“The All India Organisation of Teachers and non-teaching employees of education institutes in the country have expressed their solidarity with this struggle. A nation-wide protest of all trade unions was called for, starting January 23, and we too, joined the struggle on Monday,” the joint statement by a host of teacher unions, including Shikshak Bharti, Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO) Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU), among others, under the common umbrella of Joint Platform of Teachers, said.In a joint statement, the teachers have highlighted how NEP violates the constitutional mandates of the reservation policy and Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act. “The new Act will break the present structure of education and could also result in the closure of thousands of schools and colleges. Not only will this lead to high drop-out rates, but it’ll also push more teachers and non-teaching staff in ad-hoc and contractual appointments,” said a Platform of Teachers spokesperson.The main demand of the teachers is that the government repeal the three new farm and labour laws and also withdraw NEP. “The fact that the Governor has refused to give us time to discuss such important matters is being highly criticised by all unions,” said a teacher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/600-teachers-non-teaching-staff-protest-new-education-policy-in-mumbai-101611602057371.html

Earlier, on January 16, a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees was recorded at Santacruz.The Santacruz weather station, representative of Mumbai and suburbs, recorded a minimum temperature of 16.4 degrees Celsius, 0.4 degree below normal. This is the second lowest temperature of the ongoing winter season after December 22 last year when mercury dropped to 16 degrees Celsius. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 18.5 degrees Celsius, which was 0.5 degree below normal. Maximum temperatures also remained low with Santacruz recording it at 30.6 degrees Celsius, 0.1 degree below normal while it was 28.6 degrees Celsius at Colaba which was 1.2 degree below normal. The drop in temperatures was in line with the forecast by India Meteorological Department (IMD). “IMD had forecast that minimum temperatures in and around Mumbai would drop owing to cold winds from the north. This trend is likely to continue for the next two-three days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.“At 16.4 degrees Celsius, Mumbai’s Santacruz recorded the lowest minimum temperature of January this year. It may dip further during the next three days due to cold winds from the north,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, SkymetWeather, on Twitter.

Over the weekend, air quality had plummeted to very poor category with AQI at 320 on Saturday and 310 on Sunday. “Due to continuation of high pressure system in western India, calm winds are prevailing in Mumbai and surrounding regions. Additionally, continental pollution and dusty oceanic air is polluting the air further. This condition is leading to poor AQI in Mumbai. With movement of high pressure system to the west, calm wind conditions will be relaxed slightly which is going improve AQI for Mumbai in the next two days,” said a spokesperson from System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality at 369 (very poor), followed by Malad at 322 and Andheri at 320.AQI was calculated by the SAFAR as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs.

26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy: Punjab to take on Karnataka in quarters||Mandeep Singh-led Punjab team has been on a roll in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy winning all their five league matches. After a successful run in the league stage, Punjab will now be facing defending champions Karnataka in the quarter-final tie to be played at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, Ahmedabad, on Tuesday. Tremendous surge in players’ performances can be attributed to the fact that they prepared well for the tournament. Before Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy was announced by the BCCI, Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) had held camps in a phased manner. Openers Prabhsimran Singh and Abhishek Sharma have given good starts to their team and starred in the victories. Mandeep and vice-captain Gurkeerat Mann have done well in the middle-order. In their league game against Karnataka, Punjab had emerged victorious by nine wickets. Medium-pacer Siddharth Kaul bagged a hat-trick in that game. Other quick bowlers like Arshdeep Singh and Sandeep Sharma have chipped in with useful performances and backed their batsmen. Spinners Mayank Markande and Harpreet Brar have also shown their mettle. Coach Munish Bali would be expecting Punjab to beat Karnataka in the quarter-final tie as well and enter the semi-finals. With such fine run at display, if Punjab team play to their potential, they will be unstoppable.Squad: Mandeep Singh (captain), Gurkeerat Singh Mann (vice-captain), Rohan Marwaha, Abhinav Sharma, Prabhsimran Singh, Anmolpreet Singh, Anmol Malhotra, Sanvir Singh, Sandeep Sharma, Karan Kaila, Mayank Markande, Abhishek Sharma, Ramandeep Singh, Siddharth Kaul, Barinder Singh Sran, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Singh Brar, Baltej Singh Dhanda, Krishan, and Gitansh Khera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/syed-mushtaq-ali-trophy-punjab-to-take-on-karnataka-in-quarters-101611601456568.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Metro-5 corridor to be complete by December 2024: MMRDA||A major line that will ease commute in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Metro-5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), is expected to be completed by December 2024, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said in a statement issued on Sunday. The 24.90-km elevated corridor will provide much-needed connectivity in areas heavily dependent on the suburban railway. It will also provide interconnectivity with Metro-4 (Wadala-Thane-Kasarwadavali) and Metro-12 (Kalyan-Taloja). Of the 24-km line, a 12.7-km stretch between Kapurbawadi and Bhiwandi connects Kapurbawadi, Balkum Naka, Kasheli, Kalher, Purna, Anjur Phata, Dhamankar Naka, and Bhiwandi. The first pier cap of this stretch near Balkum in Thane was erected on January 22 this year, a senior official from MMRDA said. The state authority has also sought clearance from the Central government for the diversion of 1,971.71 square metres (sqm) of forest land in Balkum as well as of 377.86 sqm of area in Kasheli, Bhiwandi for constructing around 24 piers for the project.MMRDA is looking at implementing 337 kms of metro lines in MMR by 2026. The first two lines — Metro 2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) — are expected to be operational by May this year. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will inaugurate the first rolling stock for Metro-2A and Charkop depot, which will be utilised as a common depot for both the lines, on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-metro-5-corridor-to-be-complete-by-december-2024-mmrda-101611601396528.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||NCP chief Sharad Pawar slams Maha governor, Centre at farmers’ rally in Mumbai||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday slammed the Centre as well as the Maharashtra governor over their behaviour towards farmers as thousands of them from across the state protested against the Centre’s contentious new farm laws at Azad Maidan in Mumbai.Pawar took on governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari for not meeting the agitating farmers, saying that the latter had time to meet actor Kangana Ranaut, but not farmers. Later, farmers’ leaders, who led a march towards Raj Bhavan but were stopped by the police, tore off their memorandum after they were told that the governor was out of town and they could submit their demands to Raj Bhavan officials. The new agri laws seek to encourage private trade, contract farming and remove stock limit on foodgrains. The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of minimum support price (MSP) and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.At least a dozen key leaders from the ruling NCP and Congress stood in support and solidarity with the protesting farmers, while Shiv Sena sent its junior youth wing leader as its representative. Eyebrows were raised over the stand by the Sena led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray later said the party fully supported farmers in their agitation.Addressing the farmers at Azad Maidan, Pawar said during his stint as Union agriculture minister in 2003, the UPA government had deliberated on the farm laws by convening three meetings with the agriculture ministers of states, but could not build a consensus over the contents. “The BJP-led NDA passed the laws without any discussion in parliament and in just one day on the basis of the majority. The Modi government has attempted to uproot the farmers through these laws, but the farmers have the power to uproot political leaders who have been acting arrogantly,” Pawar said.He said the laws were passed by crushing the constitution of the country. “The ruling party did not follow parliamentary customs, while passing the laws and undermining the power of the common man. The common man of the country can crush these laws and politicians too.”Pawar, in his speech slammed Koshyari, saying, “He has time to meet Kangana (Ranaut), but not for the farmers. It was the ethical responsibility of the governor to meet the agitating farmers and face their delegation. He should have stayed back at the Raj Bhavan, but he has no etiquette. He is a one-off governor in the history of Maharashtra,” he said.Raj Bhavan, however, said it had clarified to the organisers of the farmers’ protest that the governor would not be available on Monday as he was away in Goa for his address to the first session of Goa legislature. “He holds additional charge as Goa governor. The leaders of Samyukt Shetkari Morcha were informed on Sunday that the honourable governor will not be able to meet the delegation,” the clarification stated. After the rally, the farmers marched towards Raj Bhavan to meet the governor, but they were stopped by the police near Metro theatre. The police offered to allow a delegation of the farmers to meet Raj Bhavan officials to submit their memorandum. However, leaders of the farmers outfits refused to meet Raj Bhavan officials in the absence of the governor and tore off their memorandum that they were going to hand over to Koshyari. The farmers returned to Azad Maidan and will return to their villages on Tuesday after hoisting a flag on the occasion of Republic Day at the same venue. Besides the ruling parties, Samajwadi Party, all left parties, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and many social outfits and labour unions extended their support to the farmers’ protest in Mumbai. Besides Pawar, NCP leaders and state minister Jitendra Avhad, former party legislator Vidya Chavan, Congress’s state unit chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, state minister Sunil Kedar, former minister Arif Naseem Khan, Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap participated in the public rally on Monday at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said the laws were passed by suspending the MPs who were demanding discussions on the bills. “The laws have no provision of minimum support price, will lead to the abolition of agriculture produce market committees, thrashing the system of public distribution and will benefit capitalists, stockists,” he said.Absence of the Sena leaders was conspicuous and led to a debate over the party’s stand on the farm laws. Shiv Sena leader and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said that his party supports the farmers. “Our leader Sharad Pawar attended the rally, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced his support. There are limitations in attending the public gathering in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, but we have extended our full support to the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-slams-maha-governor-centre-at-farmers-rally-in-mumbai-101611601216644.html

26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC says it’s committed to protecting waste lifters’ livelihood||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that it is committed to protecting the livelihood of garbage collectors who are aggrieved of change in waste collection system in the city, but only a handful of them have come forward so far. The MC in a statement before the HC said in a survey, 1,284 collectors were identified and applications invited under the new scheme for which only 402 applications were received. However, out of them, 36 people have started working in the new door-to-door collection system through motorised vehicles as assistants or the vehicle drivers. Rest of them are reluctant to join even as the scheme was finalised after inking an MoU between them and the civic body, it added. The response came to a plea by 28 odd waste collectors who had approached HC last month after MC initiated waste segregation in parts of the city and started lifting it through motorised vehicles. They had sought directions to junk the system that allegedly prevented them from earning their daily livelihood. The MC says it has spent crores and purchased 425 vehicles at a cost of ₹32 crore for lifting the segregated waste. The livelihood of petitioners is well protected as per the decision of MC House reached at after the deliberations with the representatives of waste collectors, the MC says. It added that it is duty-bound to take effective steps for waste collection and disposal as per rules notified by the central government in 2016 and adopted in Chandigarh in March 2019 after due process of law. The rules provide for systematic process that comprises waste segregation, storage at source, proper collection, transportation and disposal. It further said that as per the MoU, those who are skilled are to work as drivers with these newly bought vehicles and others as assistants for waste collection. The charges were also agreed to by them in the December 2019 MoU signed between MC and their representatives, the MC has stated, demanding that the plea be dismissed as new system has been implemented after due deliberations. Meanwhile, the garbage collection mostly went on smoothly on Monday. Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri said after many days, they hadn’t received even a single complaint regarding garbage collection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-says-it-s-committed-to-protecting-waste-lifters-livelihood-101611600857842.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Schools expect good turnout with Class 5 to 8 starting from Wednesday||The Maharashtra education department’s decision to reopen schools for Classes 5 to 8 from January 27 is likely to get a good response from students. School authorities said a large number of parents have agreed to send their children to school. Schools said that as opposed to the initial resistance from parents before schools reopened for Classes 9 to 12 from November 23, parents are now getting comfortable with the idea of schools reopening, and added that they are expecting a good attendance from the first week itself. “We will have 100% students attending the school on the first day. We have several classrooms and have divided each division into two groups of 25 each. We have conducted meetings with parents and have taken them into confidence. They are eager to send their children to school with all protocols in place,” said Arjun Koli, principal of Karad Municipal School. Teachers said that with schools remaining shut for the past 10 months, parents are more worried about the loss of learning of students, especially in rural areas where there are hurdles in online learning. “Parents have been asking us as to when schools would start because they can see that learning online is not as effective as learning offline. Hence, we are hoping for a good turnout as most parents have signed consent forms to send their children,” said Rajan Garud, a teacher from a zilla parishad school in Kardal, Saphale. As per the standard operating procedures laid down by the education department, 50% students in these schools are to attend classes on a rotational basis. Similarly in the first few weeks, schools will conduct classes for three hours from 11am to 2pm. “We will not take a break in between. Students can use the washroom or drink water while classes are on but no break will be given as such to ensure the safety of children and teachers,” said Rajkiran Chavan, teacher at Samarth Vidya Mandir, an aided school in Solapur. There are over 106,000 schools that teach Classes 5 to 8 in the state with nearly 8,000,000 students enrolled as per the data of the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), 2019. Barring Mumbai, schools in most parts of the state are expected to reopen for Classes 5 to 8 on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-schools-expect-good-turnout-with-class-5-to-8-starting-from-wednesday-101611600856649.html

26-01-2021||Mumbai||Farmers march to Mumbai; nationwide protests today||Braving sore feet and cold nights, thousands of farmers and farm labourers from 21 districts across Maharashtra held a sit-in at south Mumbai’s Azad Maidan on Monday, protesting against the three contentious farm laws passed by the central government while also showing solidarity with farmers at Delhi’s borders who have been camping there for the past two months.The farmers, united under the banner of Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Sanghatana (SSKS), reached Mumbai on Sunday evening, a day before India’s 72nd Republic Day, when farmers in different parts of the country will take out rallies — some of them involving tractors — against the laws.At least a dozen key leaders from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Congress and the Shiv Sena, who form Maharashtra’s ruling alliance, stood in support of the farmers demanding repeal of the three laws that aim to open up agricultural trade. Farmers say the laws will eventually help big corporates.At the programme, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar hit out at the Centre. “The BJP-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) passed the laws without any discussion in Parliament and in just one day on the basis of the majority... farmers have the power to uproot political leaders who have been acting arrogantly,” Pawar said.Pawar said during his stint as the Union agriculture minister in 2013, the then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government deliberated farm reforms by convening three meetings with agriculture ministers of states, but could not build a consensus.The Centre, however, says the reforms were much needed, and will lead to new opportunities in agriculture trade. It says farmers are being deceived by people who have “misled them for decades”.In Maharashtra, farmers also tried to march towards the governor’s house, but the police stopped them. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who holds additional charge of Goa, was there to address the customary first session of state legislature on Monday.Farmers refused to submit their memorandum to Raj Bhavan officials.Monday’s protests saw farmers pouring in from Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Aurangabad, Hingoli, Palghar and Thane districts, among others. Some of them walked as far as 200km.Nirmala Pagi, 35, a farmer from Palghar district, left her four children with her mother-in-law and joined the march. “The outcome of the farmers’ protest in Delhi is dependent on how much support they have from all of us. If we unite, maybe the government will listen to us and repeal the three farm laws,” she said.Farmers at Delhi’s borders, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have planned a tractor march on Republic Day. They also plan a march to Parliament on February 1.In the districts of Sonbhadra, Varanasi and Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, farmers’ leaders alleged that the police asked tractor owners not to drive their vehicles on January 26, even as the opposition Samajwadi Party planned to organise a tractor parade.“All police personnel, including circle officers, station officers, sub-inspectors and constables have been instructed to remain in their respective police station areas and carry out vehicle checking, including tractors,” said a police officer in Varanasi, requesting anonymity.In Haryana and Punjab, a section of farmers continued to move towards Delhi in their tractors, leading to traffic snarls at several state and national highways.However, farmers’ bodies in the two states have asked protesters not to disrupt official Republic Day functions anywhere.In Karnataka, several tractors began reaching the outskirts of Bengaluru on Monday to participate in a planned parade. But farmers’ groups alleged that the state government was trying to restrict the movement of the vehicles.“If the government stops people from coming to Bengaluru, we will begin similar protests in every district...,” said Chamarasa Malipatil, honorary president of farmers’ group Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha.Protests were also planned in West Bengal, Rajasthan, Gujarat, parts of Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.(With inputs state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/farmers-from-maharashtra-stand-their-ground-on-new-agri-laws-101611600679996.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body seeks list of HCWs from private hospitals for vaccination||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has sought a list of healthcare workers (HCWs) from major private hospitals who have registered on the CoWIN app, which is managing the vaccination drive. Following a proposal of private hospitals that was submitted last week, BMC may allow beneficiaries in the second and third phase to be vaccinated in their hospital premises under the supervision of civic officials. “We are in the process of getting the list of HCWs from private hospitals, following which the decision will be taken on the proposal submitted by the private hospitals,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. If approved, vaccination of HCWs as well as frontline workers and senior citizens by private hospitals would be allowed in the second and third phases of the drive. “Though we are yet to make a final decision... we are still contemplating as it will help bring vaccine centres closer to beneficiaries. Dispensaries and clinics can also prove beneficial for the public in the following vaccination phases,” said Kakani. According to private hospitals in the city, distance is preventing almost 50% of registered HCWs from getting inoculated. “Currently, there are only 10 vaccination centres in Mumbai, which is slowing down the mass immunisation programme. Each major hospital has over 2,000 HCWs. If the BMC permits us to inoculate them in our hospital premises, it will help save travel time resulting in better turnout,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital. In a meeting held on January 21, the Association of Hospitals, which is a trust comprising private hospitals, said staffers with experience in immunisation could administer vaccines under the supervision of civic officials. “Hospitals will submit the duly signed forms of each recipient of the vaccine to the authority at the end of each day. This way government/BMC authorities can be relieved of considerable burden,” said Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer of LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-seeks-list-of-hcws-from-private-hospitals-for-vaccination-101611600678063.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh transport buses to run at full occupancy||Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) buses will now be allowed to run at full seating capacity. The UT transport department has also decided to scale up CTU operations in a phased manner as per the requirement of public in view of route receipt, said an official.The restrictions on the number of passengers travelling in CTU buses were imposed last year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and to ensure social distancing norms.In a notification issued on Monday, the department said, “It has been noticed that the transport departments of adjoining states of Haryana, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh had running operations with no restrictions on seating capacity on interstate as well as intrastate routes. Due to cap on seating capacity, especially in long-route buses, CTU was incurring heavy financial losses.”Consequently, the department decided that interstate and intrastate buses will be allowed to operate at full seating capacity by following preventive measures such as wearing of masks, maintenance of social distancing, thermal scanning and sanitisation of buses.On the intracity or local routes, the fare to be charged will be as per the notification issued on January 15, 2020, instead of flat rates being charged as on date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-transport-buses-to-run-at-full-occupancy-101611600676932.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmer leaders deploy volunteers to check rumour-mongering during tractor parade||Ahead of farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day, Punjab farmer leaders on Monday said they have deployed volunteers to keep a vigil on rumour-mongers and have also asked protesters not to believe any rumour which could potentially disturb the peaceful march.Farmers from several parts of Punjab and Haryana on Monday continued to head towards Delhi to join the tractor parade against the Centre's three new agriculture laws.With the arrival of more tractors, traffic on the Ambala-Delhi highway slowed down at many stretches."We are all set for the tractor parade on Republic Day," Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said on Monday.Around 35,000 tractor-trolleys belonging to farmers who owe allegiance to the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) are taking part in the tractor parade, said Kokrikalan.He said the instructions have been issued to farmers not to believe any rumour that could disturb the parade.Trained volunteers have been deputed to keep a vigil on rumour-mongers and any unfamiliar person who could disturb the rally, said Kokrikalan, exuding confidence that the parade would be peaceful.Those who are participating in the parade have also been asked to maintain discipline. "Youngsters have been told to stay in the cavalcade," said Kokrikalan.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday appealed to growers to ensure their rally remains peaceful as their stir against the "anti-farmer" laws have been so far.Notably, the Delhi police on Sunday had said that over 300 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to disrupt the tractor parade.Protesting farmers will be depicting farmers' suicide through their tableaux during the tractor parade."We will try to highlight several issues including of farmers' suicide," said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leader Shingara Singh Mann.He said through one of the tableaux, farmers will be encouraged to fight for their rights rather than ending their lives."We will register our protest on this Republic Day," said Mann.As the demand for flags of farm bodies swelled, farmer leaders cautioned some people against selling the flags at a higher rate.Kokrikalan said the flags of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) were being manufactured and sold at ₹100 to 200 per piece by some printing presses. "We have asked such shops and sellers not to defame this agitation and farm unions by making money out of selling their flags at these rates," said Kokrikalan. "If they want to sell the flags, sell them at ₹10-20 a piece," he said.There is a huge demand for flags of different farm unions as many people were sporting these on their vehicles.Hundreds of tractors on Monday left from several places in Punjab and Haryana for taking part in the tractor parade.In Ludhiana, a 30-member team of doctors, nurses, lab technicians, paramedical and support staff on Monday left Delhi for providing medical care to farmers.Dr Arun Mitra, who was leading the team, said they will join the tractor parade with their ambulances and give on the spot medical aid to the needy."We are carrying medicines and equipment for minor surgical procedures," he said.Farmer leaders had said they would take out a tractor parade on Republic Day. On Sunday, the Delhi police had said the farmers' proposed tractor rally would start after the time period of the Republic Day celebration had ended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmer-leaders-deploy-volunteers-to-check-rumour-mongering-during-tractor-parade-101611600175263.html
26-01-2021||Other||CM Uddhav Thackeray inaugurates Patripool RoB, SATIS and smart city integrated command centre in Kalyan||Maharastra state chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the new Patripool rail overbridge (RoB) via video conference and used the event to stress the importance of wearing face masks to stay protected against Covid-19. The CM stopped his speech and pointed out to a few persons in the audience who were not wearing masks. The Patripool RoB on the Kalyan- Shilphata stretch was opened to vehicles on Monday afternoon, two years after the previous 104-year-old Patripool RoB was dismantled by the Central Railway (CR) as it was declared unsafe. “Even though we have gathered to mark the opening of the bridge, people should not forget that the pandemic is not over. Wearing a mask is important anyway,” said Thackeray. During the ceremony, both the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expressed different opinions on naming the bridge. BJP member of Parliament (MP) Kapil Patil, in his speech, said the bridge was named after the late president and scientist APJ Abdul Kalam, while Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde declared the name of the bridge as Aai Tisai Devi bridge, after the local deity. The ceremony was attended by state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, urban development and public works minister Eknath Shinde, officials of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) and local members of legislative Assembly (MLAs). “I have been visiting Kalyan-Dombivli for the last 30 years, and issues like potholes and traffic jams were always there. However, jointly we have managed to do some work now. I don’t mind naming the bridge after APJ Abdul Kalam, however, considering the local sentiments, there should not be any hesitation in naming it after Aai Tisai Devi,” said Thackeray.The Patripool bridge was temporarily lit in the colours of the Indian flag to mark Republic Day on Tuesday. The video of the lighting went viral on social media. The bridge, which has two 76-metre-long and 33-metre-long girders, is the longest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), according to MSRDC officials. Although the work was initiated in December 2018, and the girders were ready within two months, several other hurdles like the Covid-19 lockdown, opposition from locals and re-designing the bridge caused delays. “CR had helped a lot in the timely completion of the project by holding special blocks when required. Also, MSRDC has been continuously following up on the work. With everyone’s support, we have finished the project, and the bridge is now open to the public,” said Rajeshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director, MSRDC. The previous Patripool bridge was shut and dismantled in November 2018. The new two-lane bridge will ease congestion on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch by allowing easy commute between Kalyan-Dombivli, Thane, Bhiwandi, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai.Two crucial projects under smart city mission inaugurated in KalyanThackeray also virtually inaugurated two crucial projects – Kalyan station area traffic improvement scheme (SATIS) project and smart city integrated command control centre – under the smart city mission in Kalyan-Dombivli on Monday. The two projects are meant to decongest Kalyan city. “All developmental works in Kalyan-Dombivli will be taken up on priority and set open to public use,” said Thackeray. Aaditya Thackeray, who was present at the ceremony, said, “When a city is turned into a smart city, it is necessary to think about all sections of society.”Under the smart city mission, the civic body has undertaken works like installing traffic signals, CCTVs, and bus depot redevelopment at a cost of around ₹498 crore. The smart command control room will control the eight traffic signals installed across Kalyan-Dombivli. KDMC will start operating the signals from Tuesday from its headquarters. “If a driver violates traffic rules, the control room will help find the driver and take action,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.During his speech, Aaditya targeted former CM Devendra Fadnavis, saying that the earlier government was distributing “gajar” (fake promises) as opposed to the current government which is really working for people. However, BJP MLA Ravindra Chavan reponded, saying: “All the development works inaugurated today was passed by former state government and Central government, and this government is only implementing them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-uddhav-thackeray-inaugurates-patripool-rob-satis-and-smart-city-integrated-command-centre-in-kalyan-101611600436625.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains to open for all soon, says CM Uddhav Thackeray||The Maharashtra government has begun brainstorming over resuming the local rail services for all in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and announced that it will start operations for the general public soon.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a high-level meeting with key officials from the government, railways, municipal corporations and health department to take stock of the situation. The government is expected to allow the general public to take local trains in limited time slots beginning from non-peak hours. The operations are expected to begin in the next few days.“The trains will soon be open for all. The risk of the Covid-19 spread has not yet ended. The possibilities and aspects to take the idea forward were discussed in today’s meeting,” a statement issued by the chief minister’s office stated.According to officials privy to the development, the state government, which was wary of opening railway operations for the general public so far, has now been convinced that it was time to begin the services. “The positivity rate in MMR has dropped below 5% and infection rate too is too low. All the departments and even the civic bodies in MMR were of the opinion that by taking measures to control the crowd, railway operations could be started in a staggered manner,” said an official who did not want to be named.The government is expected to allow commuters first during non-peak hours, before 7am and after 10pm, to begin with. “Crowding during the hours in which women are allowed has increased. Based on that experience, the operations will be allowed in calibrated manners,” the official said.Government and railway officials have been asked to tap the measures that need to be taken to control crowd. “Staggering office hours has almost been ruled out as it is not an idea that could be implemented in MMR. Colour coding and time slotting and their monitoring is a tedious job, but could be considered,” said another officer.Once the decision is taken, the state government will inform the railways, which in turn will seek permission from the Railway ministry. Railways officials have reportedly told the government that they would not require more than a day to resume 100% operations from the current operation of 85% services. The officials, however, said that the state government should have mechanism in place for crowd control. At present, select categories of people including essential services workers and women are allowed to board suburban trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-to-open-for-all-soon-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101611600376543.html

26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Another FIR filed against car designer Dilip Chhabria||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police registered yet another first information report (FIR) against car designer Dilip Chhabria for allegedly cheating a Chennai-based businessman to the tune of over ₹22 crore.Chhabria has already been arrested by the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) of Mumbai Police’s crime branch in connection with the alleged car finance racket in December 2020.The fresh FIR is based on a complaint lodged by automobile spare parts supplier. “The businessman has alleged that he had supplied spare parts to Chhabria between 2016 and 2018, but Chhabria, with an intention of cheating him, did not make payment of ₹18 crore (towards the spare parts),” said an EOW officer requesting anonymity. Chhabria had allegedly also taken a big sum of money as loan. With interest, the loan amount has now gone up to ₹4.12 crore, which Chhabria owes to the complainant,” the officer added.The police booked Chhabria and his partners in the company for criminal conspiracy and cheating. Chhabria, known for giving futuristic makeovers to cars, was arrested by CIU on December 29 in connection with a car financing and dual registration racket.Later, actor and comedian Kapil Sharma registered a complaint with Versova police alleging that Chhabria had taken ₹5.7 crore from him for designing a vanity van but did not deliver it. Sharma approached CIU on January 7 and said in his statement that he had asked Chhabria to design a vanity van in 2017 and paid him ₹5.3 crore between May 2017 and 2018. In July 2018, Chhabria allegedly demanded ₹40 lakh more as GST, which Sharma paid but Chhabria did not deliver the van.Chhabria is presently in judicial custody in the car finance racket case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-another-fir-filed-against-car-designer-dilip-chhabria-101611600196951.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC seeks ₹1,058 crore from admn for 2021-2022||The municipal corporation has demanded ₹1,058 crore from the UT administration in its proposed budget of ₹1,590 crore for the financial year 2021-2022.Last year, it had received only ₹425 crore against its demand of ₹1,076 crore in grant-in-aid (GIA). Last week, the administration had promised to increase that GIA to ₹500 crore for the coming fiscal.The GIA projection has been made on the basis of the recommendations of the 4th Delhi Finance Commission, which the MC is yet to receive, even though UT administrator VP Singh Badnore had written to the Centre for its implementation.Seeing that the civic body has failed to generate its own funds, it is heavily dependent on the funds from the administration to carry out development and for routine expenditures like staff salaries.MC’s receipts for the financial year 2021-22 are estimated to be ₹469 crore. Traditionally, it has fallen short of budget estimates of receipts. For the current fiscal too, as per the revised estimates of receipts for 2020-21, it will earn only ₹317 crore against the budget estimate of ₹402 crore. MC officials blame the pandemic for the shortfall in its receipts.Budget deficit pegged at ₹62.91 croreThe MC has pegged the budget deficit for the coming fiscal at ₹62.91 crore. For the current financial year, the deficit is expected to be ₹117.69 crore.Recurring expenditure on salaries and other liabilities like power and fuel bills (revenue expenditure) is estimated to be ₹1,178 crore of the total budget outlay of ₹1,590 crore for 2021-2022.For new projects, development and infrastructure works, MC has reserved ₹412.45 crore (capital expenditure).The proposed budget will be tabled in the budget meeting next month. Following an approval with expected minor changes, it will be sent to the UT administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-seeks-1-058-crore-from-admn-for-20212022-101611600137836.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Charge of sedition justified against Kangana Ranaut: Complainant to Bombay HC||The Bombay high court (HC), while hearing the petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut seeking quashing of the first information report (FIR) against her by Bandra police on charges of sedition, was informed by the complainant in the case that the actor’s tweets had not only intended to cause hatred between communities on religious lines but had also tried to create animosity in the minds of her followers against the state government.The affidavit further stressed on section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and said that the actor had continued using the social media platform even after she had given an undertaking to the court on November 24, 2020, that she would desist, and hence her petition should not be entertained.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition of Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel seeking quashing of the FIR, was informed by advocate Rizwan Siddiquee that as per the court’s directions, the actor had filed a reply to the affidavit filed by the complainant in the FIR, and was willing to argue the quashing of the FIR case.However, the court sought to know the content of the affidavit filed by the complainant Munawwarli Sayyed and hence posted the matter for hearing on February 5.Sayyed’s affidavit filed by advocate Rizwan Merchant opposed the petition, stating that the actor had been tweeting intending to “promote enmity and hatred inter se between different groups, caste, community, etc, but also intended to bring in the government of Maharashtra into feelings of hatred, contempt, enmity and disloyalty with a possibility and likelihood of breach of peace and creating an environment prejudicial to maintenance of law and order, public order and public tranquillity.”The affidavit further states: “[The petition by the actor] is premature to claim that no offence is made out against them in the FIR, and their refusal to attend the office of the investigating officer during the interrogation is a deliberate and willful attempt by the applicants to stifle and scuttle the investigation at a nascent stage.”While addressing the bench, Merchant stated that he would be arguing mainly on sedition charges against the actor and her sister, and hence required some time to argue the same.After hearing the submissions, the court said that it would allow both sides to argue on February 15, and complete hearing in the petition the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/charge-of-sedition-justified-against-kangana-ranaut-complainant-to-bombay-hc-101611600136612.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body vaccinates 5,005 HCWs on Day 6 of Covid-19 vaccination||On Monday, which was Day six of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) vaccinated 5,005 healthcare workers (HCWs), which is the highest number of vaccinations carried out in one day in the city so far. The civic body’s target was 6,500. BMC plans to double its vaccination target to around 9,500, but since today is a public holiday, the revised target is yet to be officially set, civic officials said. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said, “We have 65 booths in nine vaccination centres managed by BMC. We anticipated 6,500 beneficiaries to be vaccinated on Monday, but we could vaccinate 5,005. This is not a bad figure as it is the highest till now.” Dr Gomare added, “No major side effects have been reported in any of the beneficiaries and we have been following up with beneficiaries who are reporting any post-vaccination symptom.” So far, over 20 cases of minor adverse effects have been reported to BMC. The symptoms include fever, body ache and weakness. However, these were all treated with basic medication and no one has reported severe adverse effects, BMC officials said. According to BMC’s data, 18,202 HCWs have been vaccinated as of January 25. The vaccination started in Mumbai on January 16. The turnout for the first three days was around 50%, however since last Friday, the turnout has been rising and was up to around 90% on Saturday before falling to 77% on Monday. Despite this, Monday saw the highest numbers of HCWs being vaccinated. The turnout has increased since BMC allowed HCWs to avail walk-in vaccinations even if they do not have prior appointments. The most vaccinations were undertaken at the civic-run KEM Hospital where 3,117 beneficiaries have received the Covishield shot. Sir JJ Hospital, where 145 have taken the Covaxin shot, has recorded the fewest beneficiaries. BMC aims to complete vaccinations of around 130,000 HCWs within the next one month in the first phase of the vaccination drive. The process might take longer as administering second doses to those who received their first shot in phase one will not start before February 15. Currently, BMC has the capacity to vaccinate 15,000 beneficiaries daily, but this will increase to 50,000 in later months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-vaccinates-5-005-hcws-on-day-6-of-covid-19-vaccination-101611600077289.html

For the rest 217 seats, talks between the two parties are still on.“As of now, we have agreed on the principle that the 77 seats that were won by the Congress and the Left parties in 2016 Assembly elections will be in same status quo. At present, it's won't be possible to talk about the exact numbers. The sharing of the remaining 217 seats will be concluded by January 31,” said Pradip Bhattacharya, senior Congress leader.While the Congress had won 44 seats, the Left Front had won 33 seats in the last assembly elections in 2016. Leaders of Congress and the Left Front held a joint press conference after a meeting to decide the seat-sharing.The state assembly elections are just around the corner. The Congress and the Left Front partners, headed by the CPI(M), contested as allies in the 2016 assembly polls but could not stop the TMC from retaining power with 211 out of the state’s 294 seats.

Additionally, almost 519ha have been notified in Pen and Roha talukas of Raigad district, according to the gazette notification reviewed by HT.“These are lands that were already with the mangrove cell. They were already notified as reserved forest under section 4 of the IFA. Due process was followed to check for any claims on the land by the district administration. This is the final notification that there are no claims on these lands and they are reserved forests, soon to be handed over to the forest department,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell) and an ex-officio executive director of the state mangrove foundation.On January 12, the state had notified 1,575.16ha of mangrove land along the state’s coast that is likely to be handed over to the forest department for better conservation (under section 20 of IFA, 1927). This is in line with a Bombay high court (HC) order directing the government to hand over all mangrove areas on government land to the forest department, around 16 years ago.In 2005, in an interim order, HC directed all mangrove areas on government land to be handed over to the forest department. HC reiterated its order on September 18, 2018. However, while district bodies are yet to hand over 1,592.8ha, state agencies such as Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) have failed to transfer approximately 1,147ha under their jurisdiction to the forest department.In December last year, environment group Vanashakti had issued contempt notices to all Konkan district collectors, the Konkan divisional commissioner and JNPT for failing to hand over mangrove land to the forest department. Earlier this month, Vanashakti filed a petition in the HC seeking immediate transfer of all mangrove land to the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-notifies-1-977-ha-mangroves-in-thane-raigad-as-forest-101611599896471.html
26-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai senior citizens-led gang dupes 500 job seekers of ₹10 core in 7 years||A 62-year-old retired civic body employee, a 66-year-old former woman police constable, a junior medical officer and a municipality sweeper, along with five others, formed an unlikely gang that staged elaborate cons, trumping reel-life plots, to dupe more than 500 job seekers of ₹10 crore over seven years. According to the Mumbai crime branch, who recently arrested the nine, the gang’s modus operandi involved luring people with employment offers in government bodies and then, audaciously, arranging for fake competitive tests, police verifications, medical examinations in public hospitals and even paying salaries for seven to eight months to keep its long con rolling and lure more victims. Police officers said that in the guise of a medical check-up, the accused would arrange for a table at some reputable public hospital such as JJ Hospital, KEM Hospital, Sion Hospital and Rajawadi Hospital, where a woman member of the gang would pose as a nurse. The accused forged appointment letters, medical certificates, police verification letters and even deposited salaries between ₹12,000 and ₹15,000 in the bank accounts of 27 victims, all in order to evade any suspicion and gain trust. The gang was headed by Prakash Sadafule, a retired Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) employee from Kandivli. He, police said, began the racket in 2014 with the help of a former woman police constable Priti Padmakar Thakkar (she retired in 1993) and two serving BMC employees — Rajendra Sapre, 57, a junior medical officer, and Nitin Dhotre, 39, a BMC sweeper. The police’s antennae went up after a woman resident of Sion lodged a complaint against Sadafule and his aides at Sion police station last year for taking ₹3.5 lakh under the pretext of getting her son a job in BMC’s water department. The police, through investigation, found that more than 100 people from Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and even Pune had approached the property cell in these places with similar complaints. The police said they arrested Sadafule and Dhotre on December 15, 2020, and then Thakkar on December 16. The other accused were arrested between December 19 and December 21, 2020. Police said investigation is going on and that the racket may have also been an inter-state operation with further arrests likely. The nine accused are still in judicial custody. Thakkar, the police found, had criminal cases of duping people on the pretext of providing them flats in Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) buildings at lower rates. Sadafule was a class IV employee in BMC who retired in 2016. Before his retirement, he was posted in a BMC beat chowki near Sion Hospital. “He was soft-spoken and had an assuring manner. He misused the quality, luring people with the promise of a [government] job and accepted money from them. Sadafule and Thakkar initially took money from around 100 aspirants,” a police officer said. According to the police, they took money in instalments. Thakkar introduced Dhotre, a sweeper in BMC, to Sadafule, to attract more job aspirants. The accused took a first instalment of ₹1 lakh from the new candidates. After one or two months, they called the victims for a medical test in a government hospital and for that, they took another instalment ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh. “Sapre, a junior officer in the health department of BMC, used to take candidates for ‘medical’ tests to some government hospital such as Sion, Rajawadi, KEM or JJ, where another gang member, Satnam Sahani, 38, would pose as a nurse. She would get forms filled by the candidates, recording their ages, height, weight and other personal details. In some cases, candidates were asked to bring urine samples,” said the officer. The accused completed the hospital process in a few minutes so as to avoid suspicion and Sapre would convince the candidates that as the doctors were bribed by them, the medical check-up was just a formality,” the officer said. “The accused would then issue offer letters to the victims and would take another cash instalment at the time. For the fake police verification, the accused would use a hotel in the vicinity of Dadar railway station,” he added. During the process of police verification, the police officer said, another gang member, Kunal Jadhav, a dismissed civic employee, pretended to be an officer. Sapre would meet candidates outside Dadar railway station and bring them to the hotel where Jadhav would ask them a few questions and note down details on a fake form. The job aspirants were given forged appointment letters, medical certificates, police verification confirmations, IDs and several other documents in order to draw more money from them. Police said the forged papers were made by Prashant Kamat, 39, a DTP operator who was introduced to the gang by Jadhav. “The accused used to conduct exams as well, for which they used to hire a hall or school rooms. Kamat used to prepare question papers of 100 questions, in which they mostly asked general knowledge questions. When the aspirants gathered at the exam venue, the accused would ensure they would not interact with any school staff or caretaker or owner of the hall,” said assistant police inspector Laxmikant Salunkhe, property cell, crime branch. “After getting an offer letter and waiting for more than a year, some candidates started asking about their joining dates. The gang then started discussing about ‘salary’ to around 27 aspirants. Sadafule, for that purpose, engaged a money-transfer agent from Dadar and gave cash to deposit in 27 candidates’ accounts. They paid them for seven to eight months,” said police inspector Kedari Pawar of the property cell. During investigation, police seized several documents that had the aspirants’ private details, fake BMC letterheads, stamps, fake offer letters, ID cards and bank statements of salaries deposited in the accounts of the aspirants. One of the victims, Sumit Mohite, 30, who lives at Wadala, said, “My friend, Prashant Rane, who had already paid Sadafule for his job, introduced me to him in 2016. Sadafule offered me a job in Railways as a class III employee and took the first instalment of ₹1.5 lakh”. Sadafule later introduced him to Thakkar. “They gave me an offer letter in 2018 and Thakkar took ₹1.5 lakh from me at Kharghar, where she was staying on rent.. She used to always ask me to wait for a few days whenever I called her enquiring about the joining date. But after three years I realised that there was some foul play and I asked her to return my money. Thakkar then gave a cheque of ₹3 lakh in February 2019, which was dishonoured,” Mohite added. Another victim, who had completed HSC from Ambedkar College, said, on the condition of anonymity, “Around 15 youngsters from Wadala have paid Sadafule. I was also convinced by them and gave ₹1.5 lakh to him in April 2017. Sadafule promised me a job in BMC’s water department and conducted a medical test in May 2018. They asked me to visit Rajawadi hospital with a urine sample. Sapre met outside the hospital and took me inside where a nurse collected the urine sample and also checked my nails.” “After a week, Sapre called me for police verification in Dadar. He met me outside a hotel. One of his aides was sitting inside, pretending to be a policeman, and asked me a few questions like name and where I live ,” said the victim. “Sadafule told me that my offer letter has come, but he did not give it to me. He kept saying that I would join the job in a few months,” added the victim. The police said work of recording detailed statements of victims was going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-senior-citizens-led-gang-dupes-500-job-seekers-of-10-core-in-7-years-101611599596384.html

26-01-2021||Delhi||Doctors at Kasturba hospital threaten strike from Feb 1 over unpaid salaries||Doctors of Kasturba Hospital, run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, are likely to go on an indefinite strike from February 1 over non-payment of salaries for the past three months.A formal announcement about the strike is likely to be made by the doctors’ association after a meeting on January 27. Doctors of Hindu Rao and other hospitals under the north corporation are yet to decide on whether to strike work, but they will write to the civic authorities urging them to make pending payments.Nurses and paramedics of Kasturba Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital and Rajan Babu TB hospital are already on strike since January 7 along with employees of other departments of north corporation over non-payment of salaries.Dr Sunil Kumar, president of the Kasturba Hospital Resident Doctors’ Association, said salaries for the months of November, December and January are the pending and doctors are currently working without payment.“Our salaries are pending for three months and we are giving our services without payment. We also have our families to feed and non-payment of salaries has now become a norm in the north civic body. This has to end. We are waiting till January 26 (Tuesday) for our salaries to be paid. We are likely to go on an indefinite strike from February 1, if our salaries are not released. On January 27 (Wednesday) we will have a meeting to decide our strategy,” Kumar said.Another doctor of the hospital, who wished not to be named, said, “ We have come to know that our salaries are unlikely to be paid till March as the civic body is focusing on the release of salaries of employees of other departments, who are already on an indefinite strike. We have no choice left but to go on a strike. The authorities should find a permanent solution to this problem.”Responding to the doctors’ statements, north corporation mayor Jai Prakash said, “We are arranging funds to pay salaries of employees, which also include doctors. They (doctors) are responsible people, so they should maintain decorum and not go on strike as that is not the solution. We had paid them before we did other employees in October. They should also show us some cooperation.”According to civic officials, the north corporation employs around 1,000 senior doctors, 500 resident doctors, and 1,500 nursing officers across its five hospitals.The 450-bed Kasturba Hospital is a maternity and child specialty hospital located near the Jama Masjid while Hindu Rao Hospital is the municipality’s largest hospital with 980 beds.This is not the first time that doctors have threatened to go on a strike. In June, doctors of Kasturba Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital had threatened to tender mass resignations over non-payment of two months’ salary but they go ahead with the threat as the Supreme Court asked the civic body to pay pending salaries.Again, on October 5, resident doctors at Hindu Rao Hospital went on a strike after their salaries remained unpaid for four months. On October 14, doctors of Kasturba Hospital also went on a strike. These strikes were called off on October 29 after the corporation released two months’ salary and assured doctors that salaries will be paid regularly from then on.“But that promise was not kept by the civic body. Our salaries for three months are now pending. We have not yet decided on the strike but we are going to write to the mayor and commissioner of the north corporation about our ordeal,” Abhimanyu Sardana, president Resident Doctors’ Association Hindu Rao Hospital, said.Sardana said a meeting of the association will be convened towards the end of the month to decide the future course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/salaries-not-paid-doctors-of-delhi-s-kasturba-hospital-may-strike-work-from-feb-1-101611594856111.html
26-01-2021||Other||New DDA plan to give rights to unauthorised colony residents||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) plans to adopt a new strategy to expedite the process of issuing conveyance deeds, which will give ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, under the Centre’s PM-UDAY scheme, said Anurag Jain, vice-chairman of DDA.Since the launch of the process in December 2019, close to 377,636 property owners have registered with the DDA under the scheme of which 54,139 have submitted their applications along with necessary documents till January 22.Of these only 3,634 property owners have got their final documents.Jain said, “We are working on completely changing the strategy for the implementation of PM-UDAY. We plan to send our own team to unauthorised colonies so the initial process, including uploading documents and survey of all the properties, can be done simultaneously. Currently, our team surveys the area after we get applications from property owners.”In October 2019, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry had notified regulations to confer ownership rights to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, which will enable the residents to transfer/sell their properties, avail of home loans and be eligible to demand basic amenities such as water and electricity.Jain said, “We will also deploy additional manpower to speed up the process. For the new process, we will have to update the software. The entire re-engineered process will be in place by March.”The DDA, which is the nodal agency for the implementation of Centre’s PM-Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi AwasAdhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY), plans to carry out the property survey at the time of filing of application by property owners. For this, it plans to do the survey colony-wise and deploy additional staff to speed up the process.Till January 22, DDA has issued 1,716 conveyance deeds and 1,918 authorisations slips, which are the final documents required for registry of property with the Delhi government. Authorisation slip is issued to properties in unauthorised colonies which have come up on government land.In Raja Vihar and Suraj Park in Rohini assembly constituency, many residents complain of lack of clarity and delay in the processing of their applications for property ownership. Residents in these two unauthorised colonies were the first to get conveyance deed or authorisations slips in January last year, just before the Delhi assembly elections.Nirmal Singh, a resident of Suraj Park, said he has been running from pillar to post since August last year to get the application processed. Singh’s family had registered with the DDA under PM-UDAY in February last year.“The GIS survey of our property was done in March. Due to the lockdown, we uploaded the documents in August. But since then, there is no clarity on the status of our application. I have made several visits to the DDA office in the area. There are some technical issues with my applications which they are not able to resolve. When I went to the DDA office in December, they told me that there is some problem with the server. We want the application to be processed at the earliest,” said Singh.Brij Mohan Somani, a resident of Raja Vihar who got the authorisation slip for his property last year, said, “There is a need to streamline the process. A lot of people living in this colony are not well-educated. We want DDA to expedite the process and fix a time duration for clearing each step of the process.”DDA officials say that the process got delayed a bit last year due to the coronavirus pandemic as field surveys couldn’t be done during the lockdown.Jain said that in the past few months, several measures have been taken to expedite the process.“We have increased the number of processing centres from two to 10 to speed up the process. There are 1,375 common service centres through which people can apply. We have also allowed the GIS agencies, which are doing the survey, to file applications,” said Jain.DDA officials said that close to 7,000 applications have been rejected as properties are either falling outside the boundary or are located in the O-zone or falling on master plan road etc. The DDA has issued deficiency notes to 13,000 property owners.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with DDA, said, “If DDA plans take up the process colony-wise, then it should do a pilot project in one of the big unauthorised colonies to see the response and streamline the process. But the most important thing DDA should focus on is to give a legal tag to the entire authorized colonies by regularising it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dda-comes-up-with-new-plan-to-expedite-process-of-issuing-deeds-to-residents-of-unauthorised-colonies-101611594855328.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Doorstep delivery of rations in Delhi by March this year: CM Arvind Kejriwal||The Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration service will be launched by March, and all of the residents of the city will get health cards by the end of this year, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Monday, during an address at a Republic Day event at the Delhi secretariat.Hailing the Capital’s medical infrastructure and staff, Kejriwal also said Delhi’s health care system “did not collapse” even as it bore the brunt of one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the world.“On November 11, there were 8,500 Corona cases in a single day in Delhi, the highest in any city across the world. No city had witnessed these many cases in a day. And yet, Delhi’s health care system did not collapse. Even on that day, Delhi had 7,000 Covid-19 beds vacant in hospitals. In the first week of April in New York City had 6,300 cases and you all must have seen on social media how the entire health system of New York collapsed during the outbreak. The hospitals were fully equipped and patients were in queues outside hospitals,” he said.Kejriwal said the Capital’s health system was able to tackle the surge in cases due to the “reforms and investment” made by the Delhi government in recent years, he said.Due to the pandemic, the government, in a first, did not organise the annual Republic Day event at Chhatrasal Stadium. Even Independence Day celebrations last year were restricted to flag hoisting and a speech by the CM at the Delhi secretariat, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.Lauding the city administration’s move to introduce home isolation for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients, which he said took some load off the hospitals, Kejriwal said Delhi has so far treated 312,425 people under home isolation during the pandemic. In addition, 4,929 people received plasma therapy, first introduced across the country by the Delhi government at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, he said.By March, Kejriwal said, the Delhi government will roll out its flagship doorstep rations delivery programme, which he claimed would “revolutionise” the ration distribution system in the city.By the end of this year, the government will also issue health cards, under which all health records of a Delhi resident will be stored.“The system will start from all Delhi government hospitals and mohalla clinics first, and later be expanded to private facilities. Government and private hospitals will be connected to the Health Information Management System and residents will be able to get an online appointment to consult doctors without waiting in queues at hospitals,” Kejriwal said.The chief minister said despite drying up of tax revenue due to the pandemic, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government managed to pay salaries to its employees and continue its flagship schemes, including free power and electricity supply.In the last billing cycle, 3.8 million households got zero power bills, while 1.4 million domestic consumers received zero bills for water supply.“At a time when people lost their livelihoods, the Delhi government paid their employees and arranged for money from various sources and provided dry ration to 1 crore people every month. At least 10 lakh people were provided cooked food every day, the arrangements were made in schools. We deposited ₹5,000 each in the bank accounts of auto and taxi drivers during the lockdown. Around 1,56,000 auto and taxi drivers received this financial assistance, and no other state government did it. We deposited ₹10,000 each in bank accounts of around 44000 construction workers. We arranged for food and medicines for anyone in need,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doorstep-delivery-of-rations-in-delhi-by-march-this-year-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101611594796523.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police says it will ensure that farmers stick to rally route||Only 5,000 farmers on 5,000 tractors will be allowed into Delhi for the tractor rally scheduled for Tuesday, according to the terms and conditions mentioned in the no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the police on Monday, but the police said practically all tractors joining the rally will be allowed to enter the Capital.Though the police also wanted the rally to end by 5pm on Tuesday — within five hours of its start at 12pm — officers said they are prepared to deal with a situation in which the rally spills over into the next day.After series of meetings between the farm leaders and the police over the past one week, the two sides have agreed upon three routes for the rally.The official limit on the number of tractors and participants, and the hours of operation, was in sharp contrast to the police’s announcement at a press conference on Sunday, when senior police officers had indicated there was no limit on the number of tractors and up to five farmers would be allowed on one tractor.The police had also said the rally would be expected to end by Tuesday itself if there were just about 30,000 tractors. Farmer leaders, however, have maintained the tractor count would be over 200,000 and the rally could go on for 48 hours.Dependra Pathak, special commissioner of Delhi Police’s intelligence unit, said as per the agreement with the farmers, only 5,000 tractors with just one person on each vehicle are permitted, but the “police will facilitate” the farmers. “We’ll ensure their safety, security and movement,” said Pathak.Another senior police officer, who didn’t want to be identified, said the police are still appealing to the farmers to maintain the mandated limit on the number of vehicles. “Our aim is to ensure that the tractors return to the border point by evening. But we won’t stop tractors beyond the 5,000 count,” said the officer.According to the same officer, the count of tractors on the city’s borders as of Monday evening had crossed 27,000. “At most, it will go up to 40,000. If it reaches the upper limit, the rally could spill into Wednesday, but we are prepared for it,” said the officer.Farmer leaders, meanwhile, said all tractors that join the rally would enter Delhi. “There is no limit on the number of tractors or the number of participants. The rally could go on for 48 hours, depending on how long the tractors take to return to the border” said Rajinder Singh, vice president of Kirti Kisan Union.As per the document, the farmers will have to arrange 2,500 volunteers and some traffic marshals to coordinate with the police on the ground.Farmers are required to bring their own drinking water, medical aid and firefighting equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-says-it-will-ensure-that-farmers-stick-to-rally-route-101611594795443.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Gleaming tractors add to buzz at borders||Gleaming tractors that have been serviced, washed and adorned with the tricolour and banners; farmers busy giving finishing touches to tableaux on agricultural themes; volunteers setting up mobile hospitals and another group registering the parade participants -- the farmer protest venues at Delhi’s borders were beehives of activity on Monday, the eve of the historic “tractor parade” to be held by farmers on Republic Day.Tuesday’s event coincides with the two-month anniversary of the farmers’ agitation which began on November 26, when thousands of farmers from neighbouring states reached Delhi’s borders looking to enter the Capital to protest against the three farm laws. When they were denied entry, they camped at the border points, the main camps being at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla.President of Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal said farmers will also take out a “padyatra (pedestrian march)” to the Parliament on February 1, the first day of the budget session. “People who have come here from across the country to participate in the parade will stay back and take part in the padyatra,” he said, adding that the Republic Day “tractor parade” may continue up to 48 hours.Balwinder Singh, 64, a farmer from Bhullar village in Kapurthala district of Punjab, who has been camping at Singhu border, said, “This parade is to express our anguish over the farm laws. Tractors are instrumental in farming and we want to celebrate our Republic Day by displaying our tractors.”Farmers have taken special care to clean their tractors and put up flags and banners. Garvinder Singh, 35, a farmer from Tiwana village in Mohali said everyone in his village had wanted to join the parade. “I serviced my vehicle before coming here to ensure that I can participate in the parade,” he said.Komal Singh, a 20-year-old law student from Chandigarh, and her cousin rode a scooter to Delhi. “Normally, my mother would not have allowed me to ride to Delhi. But when she saw that entire caravans of people were marching towards Delhi, she let me go. There were hundreds of vehicles on the road from Chandigarh to Delhi and I felt like was among family. I have never felt so safe,” said Singh, adding that the journey took her around 10 hours due to the traffic on highways.Tuesday’s Republic Day celebrations by farmers will also feature a number of tableaux depicting several social issues, including privatisation of agriculture, farmer debts, widows and children of farmers who died by suicide, atrocities against Dalits, violence against women, and problems faced by migrants during the Covid-enforced lockdown last year.Harinder Bindu, president of the women’s wing of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), who is camped at Tikri border, said, “These tableaux show the real picture of the country -- where the poor and the marginalised are suffering. We want the people to know that our fight is not just for farmers but for everyone, including those widowed or orphaned because of farm debt suicides,” she said.Members of different student groups were also seen preparing for the parade. Navkiran Natt, of the All India Students’ Union (AISA), said, “We have prepared a tableau depicting how farmers are being exploited by the government and corporates.”To ensure the tractor parade remains peaceful, farmers have formed groups to look after security. Farmer leaders at UP Gate border said their route has been divided into nine zones and each zone will have 200 volunteers present who will be assisting the police during the rally.“For identification purposes, each volunteer will be wearing a yellow jacket and an identification card. Some of them will be riding motorcycles or driving cars along with emergency vehicles. These groups will carry walkie-talkies to coordinate with other volunteers,” said Dharmendra Malik, Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) spokesperson.On Monday, five help desks were set up at the Ghazipur venue for registration of tractors and drivers for the parade. The volunteers were checking driving licences and Aadhaar cards and recording details in a register before issuing them the green registration cards.“We are making a list of all tractors and drivers. We will only allow those tractors and drivers who will display the green registration card,” said Jitendra Singh alias Jitu, who is heading the volunteer groups.The BKU spokesperson said three security teams of 15 volunteers each will be searching all tractor trolleys and tents and also frisking individuals with hand-held metal detectors.“The checking has been going on for the past three days. We will not allow anyone to carry weapons. Since thousands of tractors will be in the rally, we have also arranged mechanics and cranes to repair or remove tractors that break down,” said Malik, adding that women will also be participating in the rally.Farmers said a langar committee will distribute packed food among protesters during the parade. “There will be 3,000 volunteers in uniform at protest sites on Tuesday. While half of them will manage the traffic, others will keep an eye out to prevent any untoward incident,” said Jagmohan Singh, a member of BKU (Punjab).Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of BKU (Rajewal), appealed to farmers to maintain peace and discipline during the parade. “The government will witness the biggest show of strength this Republic Day. We will maintain peace as we have been doing from Day One,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-from-across-the-country-prepare-for-historic-parade-on-rday-101611594735866.html

Both lived in Jafrabad in north-east Delhi.“Around 2.15pm on Saturday, the men were loafing around the staircase of the building and jostling about when they reached a door that opened to the terrace. While the door appeared to be locked, it was actually not even latched. As the men playfully pushed each other, they both landed on the door together and it opened under their weight,” the officer said.They fell sideways to the ground. They were rushed to a hospital where both were declared dead on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-workers-fall-to-death-from-factory-building-in-east-delhi-101611594735326.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Daily vaccination turnout hits high in Capital, 91%+ get shots||Over 91% scheduled beneficiaries of the Covid-19 vaccine were inoculated in one day for the first time in Delhi on Monday, as 41 hospitals in the Capital either completed their daily target or exceeded it.At Delhi’s 81 vaccination centres, 7,408 health care workers of the targeted 8,100 received a jab of either the Covaxin or Covishield vaccines.According to administration data, 41 hospitals, including private and government facilities, either vaccinated 100% of their targeted beneficiaries, or exceeded that number on Monday.Monday was the first time since the launch of the campaign on January 16 when six of Delhi’s 11 districts recorded turnouts over 90%, four recorded over 80%, while one district hit 71% of its target.Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini and Mata Chanan Devi hospital in west Delhi recorded the highest turnouts, with 140 health care workers receiving vaccine shots. Government hospitals like Rajiv Gandhi Super specialty hospital in Tahirpur, Lok Nayak Hospital, GB Pant, ILBS and Dr Hegdewar Arogya Sansthan turnouts of 100% or more.Officials said the 91.45% turnout, a jump of 6.3 percentage points compared to Saturday, was due to minor measures introduced by the administration over the course of the drive.These include out-of-turn vaccine shots for not only those beneficiaries who are allotted slots on future dates, but also those who missed their shots. Further, centres were informally allowed to exceed the cap of 100 shots per day on ensuring full compliance of Covid-19 norms, and allowing beneficiaries take their shots in any centre of their choice, instead of the vaccination point they were registered for.For the second straight day, Shahdara managed to inoculate 100% of its targeted beneficiaries for the day. The district vaccinated 604 (101%) people instead of 600, a trend first seen in northeast district on Saturday.Shahdara was on Monday followed by northeast district, which vaccinated 197 health care workers against the target of 200. North district vaccinated 285 (71%) of 400 beneficiaries – the lowest of all districts on Monday.In Delhi, Covid-19 vaccination happens four days a week - Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.Cumulative vaccination data since January 16 shows that the Capital has so far inoculated 13.8% of the 240,000 health care workers identified and registered with the government for the phase of the programme.“Delhi has had six days of Covid-19 vaccination till now and after the first two to three days of low turnout, things have started looking up since Thursday. We have inoculated 33,170 (65%) healthcare workers so far in the Capital, out of the target of 50,678,” said a senior health official.Overall, southeast district has been closest to its total target so far, vaccinating 75% (3,773) of a total of 5,064 registered health care workers. North Delhi had the fewest vaccinations (1,294) of all districts, against its overall target of 2,465 till Monday.Only 14 AEFI (adverse effects following immunisation) cases were reported on Monday.So far, 156 adverse events have been reported in Delhi, most of which were categorised as “mild”, meaning that the beneficiary reported nausea, headache or mild rash at the injection site, and the person was allowed to leave the centre after a 30-minute observation period.Since the launch of the campaign, the south district has seen the highest number of AEFI cases (28), while northeast reported the lowest with just 4 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-91-of-registered-beneficiaries-get-covid-19-vaccine-shots-in-delhi-on-monday-the-highest-so-far-101611594676633.html

They do not have any lasting solution to the crisis. They said that the civic body can pay only one to two months’ salary, which is not acceptable to us. We will continue our strike,” said AP Khan, convener, Confederation of MCD Employees Union which is on an indefinite strike since January 7.Khan added that the sanitation employees will also continue to strike and will not clear garbage from the streets. “Sanitation services will not be performed until dues are cleared. Only the civic authorities are responsible for this garbage mess,” Khan said.Pawan Tank, acting president of Nagar Nigam Shramik Sangh, which is also part of the Confederation, said that the north corporation authorities announced that salary for two months has been cleared for sanitation employees but it is yet to be paid.“We will not return to work until our demand for regularisation of sanitation workers is met and pending salaries of all employees are cleared. We will not lift garbage from streets and colonies,” Tank said.Residents complained that they are facing a health crisis as streets have not been cleaned for days. Raza Khan, a resident of Daryaganj, said the situation in old quarters of the city is worse than in any other part. “Garbage can be seen lying on streets in the colony. The street near Golcha Cinema now resembles like a dump yard as garbage has not been lifted for last 15 days from here. Foul smell emanating from the garbage is unbearable,” Khan said.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, appealed to sanitation employees to return to work and assured that their other demands will be considered. “In the meeting today, I have assured that at least one-month salary of all employees will be approved by January 28. I appeal them to return to work so that sanitation problem can be solved,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-end-to-sanitation-crisis-as-talks-between-north-mcd-staff-and-mayor-fail-101611594615852.html

In addition, Covid 19 prevention measures such as thermal scanning and temperature check are already being done at all stations.”He added, “We are intimating passengers about average waiting time at stations for their convenience through social media. This is purely a temporary phenomenon because of the enhanced security measures, and we seek the cooperation of the passengers so that both security measures as well as Covid protocols can be properly implemented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/intensive-checks-lead-to-98-mins-waiting-at-chawri-bazar-metro-station-101611594615324.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||Money paid to MCDs being diverted to councillors’ fund, alleges AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations (MCDs) in the national capital are diverting the money disbursed by the Delhi government to augment the councillor local area development (LAD) fund, instead of paying the pending salaries of employees.Addressing a press conference, senior AAP leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak said Delhi is suffering from a “massive garbage issue” as sanitation workers are on strike over salary dues.“The areas under the BJP-ruled north MCD are the worst affected and the situation has remained bad for the past 15-20 days. Sanitation workers of the municipal bodies are on strike for the past several days because the municipalities have not paid them salaries for the past five to six months,” he said.Pathak said on January 14, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and urban development minister Satyender Jain had announced that the Delhi government will release ₹938 crore for payment of salaries of MCD employees.“But the BJP has not paid the salaries of their employees till now. Instead, they have increased the councillor LAD fund. The BJP has decided to provide ₹1 crore to each councillor,” he said.Presenting the SDMC’s budget on December 7, 2020, additional commissioner Ramesh Verma had proposed reducing the LAD fund from ₹1 crore to ₹50 lakh. But on January 19, standing committee chairperson of SDMC, Rajdutt Gahlot rejected the proposal.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “The AAP is misguiding people by making baseless allegations. There is no proposal for increasing councillor’s fund to ₹1.5 crore. The civic body has not yet received any money as promised by the government in the name of salary fund. The only money we got is a fraction of third quarter dues which the government anyway has to give us,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/money-paid-to-mcds-being-diverted-to-councillors-fund-alleges-aap-101611594555381.html
26-01-2021||Chandigarh||J&K hospital, musicologist study if music helps treat mental disorders||Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences ( medical college and hospital, SKIMS-MC) and a musicologist from Jammu and Kashmir’s Institute of Mathematical Science are collaborating to learn whether mental disorders can be diagnosed and treated using sound and Indian classical music. The research will study the effect of acoustics, sound and music on mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. Principal investigator of the project, Shahzad Aasim, a musicologist, said they will be testing the neuro-acoustic mechanism. “Kashmir is a hotspot for mental disorders owing to conflict and other issues. The aim of this research is to accurately diagnose and treat illnesses such as anxiety, depression, autism and other mental disorder using specific and unspecific sound therapies,” he says. “So far, doctors have been diagnosing these disorders using symptoms or case histories. They then make assumptions based on a certain scaling,” said Aasim, who is also the research head at Jammu and Kashmir’s Institute of Mathematical Science (JK-IMS) in the higher education department. SKIMS head of the psychiatry professor Abdul Wahid said the research was yet to begin and they have just signed a memorandum of understanding with JKIMS. “We are yet to formulate a protocol. We are trying to learn the effect of acoustics on treatment of patients and see if we can use it to treat psychiatric disorders,” he said. “I have been working on this for 12 years,” says Aasim, who has written research papers on music, including the quantum mechanism of music in theory and practice and secret of music. The research will be carried on patients of SKIMS-MC and will be done after obtaining informed consent of the patients or their caretakers. The first phase will take six months. “We will be using resonance factor. Human organs like the heart and brain have their vibration frequencies. We will be introducing low frequency sound loops to patients to reach resonance points. Then we will be comparing it with normal people. It is like organ mapping using sound,” Aasim said. Aasim said that they will be using sound notations from Indian classical music based on the frequency spectrum. “We will also be quantifying mood swings,” he said. Dr Nizamuddin, assistant professor at the department of psychiatry, said the project aims to use music and sound therapy to assess symptoms of the patients. “There will be piloting and then research will start. It is a very innovative idea and the outcome is uncertain. Our side will be assessing whether symptom-wise there is improvement in the patient or not,” he said, adding that he was not sure if the therapy can help diagnose patients . Researchers have found that a large population in Kashmir suffers from mental disorders. Nearly 1.8 million or 45% of the total adult population in the Valley show symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a research by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) concluded in 2016. It said, on an average, an adult living in the Valley has witnessed or experienced 7.7 traumatic events during their lifetime. While 93% of people experienced conflict-related trauma, 94% experienced trauma due to natural disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jkhospital-collaborates-with-musicologist-for-diagnosis-treatment-of-mental-disorders-101611576974706.html
26-01-2021||Delhi||WhatsApp treating Indians differently from Europe users: Centre to Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Monday asked the Centre to put on record the explanation offered by WhatsApp to the notice and questionnaires sent by the government seeking clarification on its new privacy policy.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva adjourned the hearing in a plea challenging the updated privacy policy of WhatsApp to March 1, after the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma sought time to place the response of the communication platform on the queries of the government on the new privacy policy.During the hearing, the ASG told the court that the Centre has taken strong note of the new WhatsApp policy which is meting out a “differential” treatment to Indian users. He said that notices and questionnaires have been sent to WhatsApp seeking their response on various aspects concerning the privacy of an individual.Also read | 5 women lawyers challenge physical hearings in Supreme CourtThe ASG also told the court that an opt-out option to not share data with Facebook has been given to European users of WhatsApp, but it has not been given to the Indian users, treating them with an “all or nothing approach”. He also said that a Joint Parliamentary committee is already discussing the Personal Data Collection Bill.“Privacy policy offered by WhatsApp to its European users specifically prohibits the use of any information shared with a Facebook company...this clause has not been offered to Indians and Indian citizens who form a substantial part of WhatsApp’s user base,” Sharma said.“This differential treatment is certainly a cause of concern for the government. The government is also concerned about the Indian users being subjected to these changes rather unilaterally by not providing them the ability to opt out,” he added.He said that the minister has gone on record to express the government’s concerns on the privacy issues as “WhatsApp prima facie seems to be treating the users with an all-or-nothing approach”.The court was hearing a plea by a lawyer Chaitanya Rohilla challenging the new privacy policy of WhatsApp contending that it violates the Right of Privacy of the citizens.Alleging that WhatsApp has put a “Damocles’ sword on its users” to accept its new privacy policy, the plea filed through advocate Manohar Lal has said that the updated policy virtually scrutinises the personal profile of a user.The plea has also said that the new norms also jeopardise national security by sharing, transmitting and storing the users’ data in some another country.Appearing for WhatsApp, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told the court that government has written to them seeking clarification on the new privacy policy. He said that they would give their response to the government by Monday.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, also appearing for WhatsApp, told the court that this is between government and Facebook and so there is no locus of the petitioner. He also said that the court cannot intervene when there is a regulatory authority to look into the matter.Advocate Manohar Lal, for the petitioner, told the court that the policy is not in terms of the laws of the company. He said that the sharing of data is a serious matter of threat to the country’s security and democracy as the information is shared globally.During the hearing, Justice Sachdeva reiterated that WhatsApp is a private application and voluntary where the petitioner can uninstall it in case he has concerns. The court also noted that when the government is already looking into the matter, then no orders are called from the court.The matter will be now heard on March 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whatsapp-treatment-of-indian-users-a-matter-of-concern-centre-to-delhi-hc-101611557773093.html

26-01-2021||World||Antony Blinken succeeds Mike Pompeo as 71st secretary of state||The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Antony Blinken as America’s top diplomat, tasked with carrying out President Joe Biden’s commitment to reverse the Trump administration’s “America First” doctrine that weakened international alliances.Senators voted 78-22 to approve Blinken, a longtime Biden confidant, as the nation’s 71st secretary of state, succeeding Mike Pompeo. The position is the most senior Cabinet position, with the secretary fourth in the line of presidential succession.Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He has pledged to be a leading force in the administration’s bid to reframe the US relationship with the rest of the world after four years in which President Donald Trump questioned longtime alliances. He is expected to start work on Wednesday after being sworn in, according to State Department officials.“American leadership still matters,” Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his Jan. 19 confirmation hearing. “The reality is, the world simply does not organize itself. When we’re not engaged, when we’re not leading, then one of two things is likely to happen. Either some other country tries to take our place, but not in a way that’s likely to advance our interests and values, or maybe just as bad, no one does and then you have chaos.”Blinken vowed that the Biden administration would approach the world with both humility and confidence, saying “we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad.”Despite promising renewed American leadership and an emphasis on shoring up strained ties with allies in Europe and Asia, Blinken told lawmakers that he agreed with many of Trump’s foreign policy initiatives. He backed the so-called Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, and a tough stance on China over human rights and its assertiveness in the South China Sea.He did, however, signal that the Biden administration is interested in bringing Iran back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew in 2018.Trump's secretaries of state nominees met with significant opposition from Democrats. Trump’s first nominee for the job, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, was approved by a 56 to 43 vote and served only 13 months before Trump fired him in tweet. His successor, Pompeo, was confirmed in a 57-42 vote.Opposition to Blinken centered on Iran policy and concerns among conservatives that he will abandon Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.Blinken inherits a deeply demoralized and depleted career workforce at the State Department. Neither Tillerson nor Pompeo offered strong resistance to the Trump administration’s attempts to gut the agency, which were thwarted only by congressional intervention.Although the department escaped proposed cuts of more than 30% of its budget for three consecutive years, it has seen a significant number of departures from its senior and rising mid-level ranks, Many diplomats opted to retire or leave the foreign service given limited prospects for advancement under an administration that they believed didn't value their expertise.A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School and a longtime Democratic foreign policy presence, Blinken has aligned himself with numerous former senior national security officials who have called for a major reinvestment in American diplomacy and renewed emphasis on global engagement.Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was then-Vice President Biden’s national security adviser before he moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Secretary of State John Kerry, who is now serving as special envoy for climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antony-blinken-succeeds-mike-pompeo-as-71st-secretary-of-state-101611683439510.html
26-01-2021||World||First private space crew paying $55M each to fly to station on a SpaceX rocket||The first private space station crew was introduced Tuesday: Three men who are each paying $55 million to fly on a SpaceX rocket.They'll be led by a former NASA astronaut now working for Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the trip for next January.“This is the first private flight to the International Space Station. It’s never been done before," said Axiom's chief executive and president Mike Suffredini, a former space station program manager for NASA.While mission commander Michael Lopez-Alegria is well known in space circles, “the other three guys are just people who want to be able to go to space, and we’re providing that opportunity," Suffredini told The Associated Press.The first crew will spend eight days at the space station, and will take one or two days to get there aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule following liftoff from Cape Canaveral.Russia has been in the off-the-planet tourism business for years, selling rides to the International Space Station since 2001. Other space companies like Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin plan to take paying customers on up-and-down flights lasting just minutes. These trips — much more affordable with seats going for hundreds of thousands versus millions — could kick off this year.Axiom's first customers include Larry Connor, a real estate and tech entrepreneur from Dayton, Ohio, Canadian financier Mark Pathy and Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe, a close friend of Israel's first astronaut Ilan Ramon, who was killed in the space shuttle Columbia accident in 2003.“These guys are all very involved and doing it for kind of for the betterment of their communities and countries, and so we couldn’t be happier with this makeup of the first crew because of their drive and their interest," Suffredini said.Each of these first paying customers intends to perform science research in orbit, he said, along with educational outreach.Lopez-Alegria, a former space station resident and spacewalking leader, called the group a “collection of pioneers."Tom Cruise was mentioned last year as a potential crew member; NASA top officials confirmed he was interested in filming a movie at the space station. There was no word Tuesday on whether Cruise will catch the next Axiom flight. Suffredini declined to comment.Each of the private astronauts had to pass medical tests and will get 15 weeks of training, according to Suffredini. The 70-year-old Connor will become the second-oldest person to fly in space, after John Glenn's shuttle flight in 1998 at age 77. He'll also serve under Lopez-Alegria as the capsule pilot.Axiom plans about two private missions a year to the space station. It also is working to launch its own live-in compartments to the station beginning in 2024. This section would be detached from the station once it's retired by NASA and the international partners, and become its own private outpost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-private-space-crew-paying-55m-each-to-fly-to-station-on-a-spacex-rocket-101611681152965.html
26-01-2021||World||Rate of guns seized at US airport checkpoints jumped in 2020||Security screeners confiscated guns at airport checkpoints at a record pace last year although the total number of guns dropped along with the steep plunge in travelers because of the pandemic.The Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday that screeners found 3,257 firearms on passengers or in their carry-on bags in 2020, or about 10 for every million travelers. About 83% of the guns were loaded.The rate was double that in 2019, when screeners found 5 guns for every million passengers. However, with 500 million more travelers screened in 2019, TSA officers found a record 4,432 guns that year.Screeners found 220 guns at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, followed by 176 at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, 126 at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, 126 at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport, and 104 at Denver International Airport.Federal law prohibits passengers other than certain law enforcement officers from bringing guns or ammunition into the cabin. Federal law allows passengers to put guns in checked bags that go into the cargo hold if they are unloaded and in a locked case.Airlines don't have to permit guns even in checked bags. All leading US carriers temporarily banned guns in checked bags on flights to Washington, D.C.-area airports for a week after the Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. Those bans lapsed last weekend, three days after the inauguration of President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rate-of-guns-seized-at-us-airport-checkpoints-jumped-in-2020-101611680170592.html
26-01-2021||World||Moderna Covid-19 jabs can be up to six weeks apart: WHO||World Health Organization experts on Tuesday cautiously backed delaying second injections of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine in some situations, as they did for the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs.The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) also insisted international travellers should not be prioritised for any Covid-19 jabs for the time being.During a meeting last week, the experts discussed the Moderna vaccine which, like that of Pfizer-BioNTech, uses mRNA technology and is being rolled out across the world.Both vaccines require boosters after three to four weeks, but several countries facing limited vaccine supplies have said they will delay administering the second injection so that more people can benefit from receiving a first dose.The WHO's vaccine advisory group said it was best to respect the tested intervals between doses of 21 days in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 28 days for Moderna.But earlier this month, it said that in "exceptional circumstances" it was possible to wait for up to 42 days to administer the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and on Tuesday, it said the same for the Moderna jabs.Head of the SAGE, Alejandro Cravioto, warned in a virtual press briefing though that "the evidence we have does not go beyond that" six-week cut off.'As quickly as possible' The UN health agency has so far approved only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine but it is expected to issue approval for the Moderna jab soon."We're working with Moderna to go as quickly as possible," WHO's vaccines chief Kate O'Brien told the online briefing.The two vaccines are very similar, the experts said, except for the storage requirements, with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab needed to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), while Moderna doses can be stored at -20 C.With vaccine supplies still limited, the WHO has called for health workers and the most vulnerable to be prioritised and SAGE reinforced the message on Tuesday."In the current period of very limited vaccine supply, preferential vaccination of international travellers would counter the principle of equity," SAGE said."Because of this, and the lack of evidence that vaccination reduces the risk of transmission, SAGE currently does not recommend Covid-19 vaccination of travellers."Allergic reactions 'rare' SAGE also recommended Tuesday that the Moderna vaccine, like the Pfizer-BioNTech one, should only be administered in settings that can deal with potential anaphylactic reaction.But the experts stressed this was the usual recommendation for most vaccination programmes, pointing to findings from US health authorities last week indicating that severe allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine was "rare".SAGE said there was not enough data to make recommendations on the use of the Moderna jab while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.And the experts said in situations where there was a shortage of vaccines, people who had been infected with Covid-19 in the previous six months and therefore likely had immunity could opt to postpone vaccination.But "we are not recommending that programmes exclude individuals on that basis", SAGE executive secretary Joachim Hombach told the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-jabs-can-be-up-to-six-weeks-apart-who-101611680419798.html
26-01-2021||World||Poland's population rapidly shrinking under pandemic||Statistics for 2020 show deaths spiked in Poland to a level unseen since World War II and births sharply declined, trends attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and described by some as a demographic crisis.The data reported Tuesday by the daily newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna came from a state register that includes weekly births and deaths.Poland, a nation with a population of more than 38 million, registered 357,400 births last year, the lowest number since 2005, and some 486,200 deaths from various causes, the highest number registered since the war, in which Poland lost millions of citizens.The overall data showed a population loss of some 129,000 people in 2020, compared with a decline of some 36,400 the year before.Poland's population has slowly decreased in the past two decades mostly due to the emigration of young people seeking better opportunities.The low birth rate surprised observers because some experts predicted the lockdown measures the Polish government has imposed on and off since mid-March would lead to a baby boom, the newspaper said. Communist-era martial law restrictions in Poland during the early 1980s produced such an uptick in births.Demography expert Piotr Szukalski told Dziennik Gazeta Prawna he thinks that deep concerns about the spread of the coronavirus are to blame.Minister of Family and Social Policy Marlena Malag ascribed the high death rate to the pandemic and said it would take a long time for the current government program of family benefits intended to boost the birth rate to reverse the negative trend.Commenting on data the state agency Statistics Poland released in December for 11 months of 2020, economist Rafal Mundry said the number of deaths was the highest since World War II, and the number of births the lowest in 15 years.“We have a huge demographic crisis,” Mundry said on Twitter.In 2019, some 30,000 people died in Poland each month on average. In November, when COVID-19 cases spiked, the country registered almost 60,400 deaths.The high death rate continued in the first three weeks of 2021, with almost 29,000 deaths, compared with some 24,800 deaths in the first three weeks of 2020, before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polands-population-rapidly-shrinking-under-pandemic-101611677612163.html
26-01-2021||World||US pharmaceutical Eli Lilly's, biotech firm Regeneron's Covid-19 antibodies study data shows promising results||US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly's combination of two synthetic antibodies against Covid-19 reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 70 percent in high-risk patients with recent positive tests, the company said Tuesday.The results were called "very encouraging" by Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine."They are the first anti-viral drugs that demonstrably work in the first phase of the disease just after the virus has infected someone but before it has had time to cause a lot of damage," he said.The phase 3 trial involving 1,035 people achieved its main goal, and the study also met its secondary goals of reducing patients' viral load and their time to recover from the disease.Patients were assigned either a placebo or the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, the two antibodies, at 2.8 grams each.There were 11 hospitalizations in the patients who received the therapy, or 2.1 percent of that group.In the placebo arm, there were 36 deaths or hospitalizations, or 7.0 percent of the group.The therapy thus represented a risk reduction of 70 percent, and the result was statistically significant, meaning it was unlikely to have occurred by chance.There were 10 deaths total, all of which occurred in patients taking placebo, and none in the therapy group."Bamlanivimab and etesevimab together have the potential to be an important treatment that significantly reduces hospitalizations and death in high-risk COVID-19 patients," Lilly's chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky said.The company said it would continue to study the drug in another trial to examine whether lower doses would yield the same impact.A peer-reviewed scientific paper is still awaited.- 'Passive vaccination' -In another development, US biotech firm Regeneron announced positive interim results from its phase 3 study of REGEN-COV, a combination of two antibodies, for use as a passive vaccine.An exploratory analysis looked at data from approximately 400 patients, roughly half given the 1.2 grams of the drug by a subcutaneous injection, the other half given a placebo.Out of 223 given the placebo, eight went on to get symptomatic Covid-19, while none of the 186 given REGEN-COV did -- in other words a 100 percent reduction in symptomatic infections.It also reduced the overall rate of infection, whether with symptoms or without, by 50 percent.Finally, the drug markedly decreased the levels of the virus among people who received the drug and became asymptomatically infected versus those in the placebo group."These data using REGEN-COV as a passive vaccine suggest that it may both reduce transmission of the virus as well as reduce viral and disease burden in those who still get infected," said George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's president and chief scientific officer.The final results of the study are expected in the second quarter.- Slow uptake -Monoclonal antibodies are lab-made versions of the body's natural infection-fighting defenses.Our bodies develop these proteins in response to pathogens, and vaccines train the immune systems to be prepared without encountering the live microbe itself.Giving people ready-made antibodies can help those who are at high risk of severe disease because of weak immunity or underlying conditions.Many scientists have welcomed their Covid fighting potential, and both Lilly and Regeneron have received US emergency use authorizations for their therapies.But their uptake has been limited by several factors, from a lack of patient interest to not enough staffing and specific places inside hospitals to administer them.It can also be challenging to identify suitable candidates who are at high risk but haven't yet progressed to severe Covid, because by that stage targeting the virus has less impact than using drugs to reduce the body's overactive immune response.In its press release, Lilly acknowledged some of these difficulties."Lilly has received feedback from front-line nurses and doctors administering these infusions regarding the complexity and time requirements for preparation and administration," the statement said.As a result, the company is working with the Food and Drug Administration to potentially reduce the infusion time from the current 60 minutes to as little as 16 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eli-lilly-regeneron-covid-19-antibodies-study-data-shows-promising-results-101611679252906.html
26-01-2021||World||New warning system in Bangladesh to tackle rising landslide risk||A new system that can warn people of landslides nearly a week in advance is set to be launched in Bangladesh later this year, helping tackle increasing risks from a disaster linked to climate-change-driven extreme rainfall, experts said on Tuesday.Developed by the United Nations and Bangladesh's environment ministry, the warning system uses satellite imagery, rainfall measurements and other meteorological data to predict landslides in vulnerable regions.Right now, landslide alerts are provided more informally, based on rain-gauge readings, which amounts to "now-casting, not forecasting" and doesn't take into account geological data, said a U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization spokesman.Initially, the new alerts are likely to be introduced in May, when the monsoon season begins, in Cox's Bazar in southeast Bangladesh.Besides at-risk Bangladeshis, the area is home to nearly a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who have lived there since they fled their country in 2017.Researchers have gathered data on the area including soil properties and the history of landslides, as well as rainfall thresholds likely to trigger events, FAO officials said.The information will be used to produce warnings at least five days in advance of expected landslides, they said.If succesful, the system - developed by the FAO and the International Organization for Migration - could be expanded to other parts of the country as well, they added.Experts on adapting to climate change said such warnings could save lives, particularly among the country's most vulnerable."Increased heavy downpours which may be due to climate change will definitely cause greater likelihood of more landslides in the hilly areas," said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development."It would be ... very important for the communities vulnerable to landslides to get warnings to enable them to survive," he added. Bangladesh is highly threatened by landslides, particularly during monsoon periods, and the number of disasters has been on the rise due to increasingly severe weather, losses of soil-holding trees and excavation work in hilly areas.Between 2000 and 2018 landslides killed at least 700 people in the Chittagong Hill districts in southeastern Bangladesh, according to the FAO.The low-lying nation is often included on lists of countries most at risk from the impacts of rising global temperatures, from more extreme storms to floods.Scott Hussey, a spokesman for FAO, said it was important to remember "that no early warning system related to any hazard can be 100% accurate".Making the system work effectively will require continual work to refine and upgrade it, as well as efforts to create better awareness of landslide risks among local communities, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via e-mail.Solaiman Haider, a senior official from Bangladesh's Department of Environment, said the system was promising but still in its early stages."We will come to know how well it works and to what extent people accept this during the monsoons," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-warning-system-in-bangladesh-to-tackle-rising-landslide-risk-101611668554875.html
26-01-2021||World||Trump impeachment trial faces challenge from Republican Senator Paul||The Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump on a charge of inciting the deadly Capitol siege could draw its first challenge on Tuesday, with a Republican senator arguing that trying a former president would violate the US Constitution.Trump is the only president to have been impeached by the House of Representatives twice and is the first to face a trial after leaving power, with the possibility of being disqualified from future public office if convicted by chamber's 100 senators serving as jurors. The trial is expected to begin on Feb. 9.Senator Rand Paul, a Trump ally, has pledged to force a vote on whether the Constitution allows the Senate to try the former president who is now a private citizen. Trump left office on Jan. 20.The House approved a single article of impeachment - the equivalent of an indictment in a criminal trial - on Jan. 13, accusing him of inciting an insurrection with an incendiary speech to supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. A police officer and four others died in the melee."I will force a vote on whether the Senate can hold a trial of a private citizen," Paul wrote on Twitter late on Monday, voicing an objection also raised by other Republicans.Paul is expected to speak on the Senate floor around midday.There is a debate among scholars over whether the Senate can hold a trial for Trump now that he has left office. Many experts have said "late impeachment" is constitutional, arguing that presidents who engage in misconduct late in their terms should not be immune from the very process set out in the Constitution for holding them accountable.The Constitution makes clear that impeachment proceedings can result in disqualification from holding office the future, so there is still an active issue for the Senate to resolve, these scholars have said.At least 17 Republican would need to join all 50 Democrats in the evenly divided Senate for Trump to be convicted, a two-thirds threshold that appears unlikely to be reached. Trump remains a powerful force among Republicans and his supporters have vowed to mount election challenges to lawmakers in the party who support conviction.Some Republicans have criticized Trump's false claims of voting fraud and his failed efforts to overturn President Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory. But no Senate Republicans have said definitively that they plan to vote to convict him.A vote on Paul's objection could come on Tuesday afternoon, when the 100 senators are expected to be sworn in for their role as jurors. Paul's office was not immediately available for comment.Paul also has objected to plans to have Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy preside at the trial. U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts presided at Trump's first impeachment trial, which ended in his acquittal in February 2020 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son.Paul cited language in the Constitution that states: "When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside."Although the Constitution calls on the chief justice to preside over presidential impeachment trials, a senator presides when the impeached is not the current president, a Senate source said. First elected to the chamber in 1974, Leahy, 80, holds the title of Senate president pro tempore.The nine House Democrats who will serve as prosecutors set the trial in motion on Monday by delivering the article of impeachment to the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-impeachment-trial-faces-challenge-from-republican-senator-paul-101611674884022.html
26-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron push for return to pre-Trump cooperation||The leaders of Germany and France separately called for governments to work more closely together, signalling their hope that the end of Donald Trump’s four-year term in the US will herald the return of transatlantic collaboration.A week after Joe Biden’s inauguration, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron used virtual addresses to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Davos Agenda to talk up the value of international cooperation and to push for coordinated action on issues ranging from digital taxation to trade and climate change.“This is the hour of multilateralism,” German Chancellor Merkel said. “We see that in such an existential case the attempt to isolate fails long term -- at least in relation to this pandemic it failed.”The German leader, who regularly clashed with Trump’s America First doctrine, said it was an “important sign” that the US is rejoining the World Health Organization and called on President Biden to unblock the World Trade Organization.It was a theme picked up by France’s president, Macron, who said that multilateralism “was blocked by the US administration that didn’t believe in it” under Trump.“I have great hopes this year, with a US partner who I hope will come back,” he said. “We need to build an efficient multilateral system that will allow a new consensus.”Merkel wants the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to quickly reach an agreement on digital taxation and called for a global antitrust regime to tackle cross-border competition issues, while Macron welcomed the US’s new commitment to the Paris climate accord.In a telephone call between Biden and Macron on Sunday, the two men covered issues from NATO to climate change. When the new US president spoke to Merkel on Monday, Biden spoke of his intent to “revitalize the transatlantic alliance, including through NATO and with the European Union,” according to a White House readout. Merkel invited Biden to visit Germany once pandemic-related travel restrictions ease.Multilateralism, and in particularly cooperation between the EU and a post-Trump US, was a theme explored by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during her Davos address earlier in the day.“The challenges to our democracy, the pandemic, climate change -- in his inauguration speech President Joe Biden so aptly spoke of a cascade of crises and, indeed, we face an outstanding set of challenges,” von der Leyen said. “But we can meet them if we work together; that is what we all have to learn again after four long years.”She spoke in particular about the difficulties posed to democracy and freedom of speech by social media and said she wanted Europe and the US to join forces to “create a digital economy rulebook that is valid worldwide.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-and-emmanuel-macron-push-for-return-to-pre-trump-cooperation-101611676411326.html
26-01-2021||World||Iran approves Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine||Iran has approved Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday, in a win for Moscow as it aims to bolster its geopolitical clout.Iran, which is fighting the Middle East's deadliest outbreak, has said it will only rely on vaccines made by Russia, India or China, while also working to produce a homemade jab.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAfter talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Zarif confirmed Sputnik V had been approved on Monday, adding: "In the near future we hope we will be able to purchase it, as well as start joint production."Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei this month banned the use of vaccines made by the United States and Britain, calling the jabs "completely untrustworthy".Iran had earlier said it would wait for the World Health Organization's approval of Russia's jab before buying it.Russia registered the shot -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- in August last year, before the start of large-scale clinical trials, leaving some experts wary.Sputnik V's developers have since said the vaccine is more than 90 percent effective and several countries outside of Russia have begun administering it, including Argentina.Russia last week filed for registration of Sputnik V in the European Union, while EU member Hungary broke ranks and purchased two million doses of the jab before the bloc had approved it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-approves-russia-s-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-101611675397816.html
26-01-2021||World||UK hits grim Covid-19 death toll figure of 100,000||The UK on Tuesday hit another grim Covid-19 milestone as the country's death toll from the deadly virus crossed 100,000 since the peak of the pandemic last year.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) assessment of death certificate data reveals that there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since last year. The UK government's daily death toll figures rely on positive coronavirus tests in the past 28 days and are therefore slightly lower, at 98,531.The ONS figures show that a total of 7,245 registered deaths in England and Wales mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate in the week ending January 15, which is up from 6,057 deaths the week before and is the highest weekly number since April 24, 2020."It is a tragedy that we have now seen more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. This is a dreadful milestone to have reached, and behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,” said Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, a membership organisation for the state-funded National Health Service (NHS)."We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects – but, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities disproportionately,” he said, urging continued “vigilance” among all communities and strictly following the rules of social distancing.“The vaccine offers hope for the future. This is a key phase in the fight to end Covid-19 but we must stay the course until the end is truly in sight,” he added.The latest figures come as the UK government is considering further measures in its fight against a high rate of infections, including the possibility of imposing compulsory 10-day hospital quarantine for travellers entering Britain from regions believed to be at a high risk of spreading new variants of coronavirus.“The NHS is still under intense pressure across all parts of the country with 37,899 people in UK hospitals with Covid-19 – and that includes 4,076 on ventilators,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, as he reiterated the message for people to continue following lockdown restrictions.The minister highlighted that his department-led vaccination programme remains on track to meet the government-set target of covering all those under the top priority groups by mid-February, despite vaccine supply pressures.“The rate limiting factor to this vaccination programme remains supply. As we know, supply is tight. We’ve had a very strong performance in this past week. And I’m confident that the NHS will deliver every shot that’s made available to it,” he said, adding that 78.7 per cent of all over 80s have now been vaccinated as of Monday.The government has also rolled out a new Community Champions scheme through local councils, fielding popular celebrities including British Indian actors Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar, to help combat reluctance among minority communities towards being vaccinated.“It is vital that everyone has access to accurate and up to date information about Covid-19. False information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives,” said Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick.Over 23 million pounds funding has been allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from Covid-19 and boost vaccine take up.“We want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine and I have been working closely with faith and community leaders to ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine,” said Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi.“The expansion of the Community Champions scheme will help everyone get the advice and information they need about Covid-19 vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-hits-grim-covid-19-death-toll-figure-of-100000-101611674968027.html
26-01-2021||World||China hopes Joe Biden will 'learn a lesson' from Donald Trump's wrong policies||Day after the White House said that US President Joe Biden is committed to stopping China's economic abuses, Beijing on Tuesday said that it "hopes" that the new US administration will "learn a lesson" from the previous Donald Trump administration.Speaking at the regular press briefing, Zhao Lijian, Ministry of Foreign Ministry Spokesperson, said, "We hope the new US administration will learn from the Trump administration's lessons where they carried out the wrong policies on China. We hope the new administration will view China and China-US relations in an objective and rational manner, implement China policies that are positive and constructive, meet with China half way, focus on cooperation, manage differences, and bring China-US relations back on the right track of sound and stable development."On Monday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, said that Washington has seen over the last few years that China is growing more authoritarian at home, challenging security and prosperity abroad."We're committed to -- the President is committed to stopping China's economic abuses on many fronts, and the most effective way to do that is through working in concert with our allies and partners to do exactly that," she added.She said that Washington is in "serious competition" with Beijing and added that the Chinese Government is engaged in conduct that it "hurts American workers, blunts our technological edge, and threatens our alliances and our influence in international organizations.""What we've seen over the last few years is that China is growing more authoritarian at home and more assertive abroad. And Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity, and values in significant ways that require a new US approach."The President's view is that the US needs to play a "better defence" that must include holding China accountable for its unfair and illegal practices and making sure that American technologies aren't facilitating China's military build-up, the White House secretary said.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hopes-joe-biden-will-learn-a-lesson-from-donald-trump-s-wrong-policies-101611673034756.html
26-01-2021||World||Thai court acquits 80-year-old writer of defaming monarchy||An 80-year-old writer accused of defaming Thailand's monarchy in 2015 because of comments he made at a public seminar about the constitution was acquitted Tuesday by the Criminal Court.The court ruled that Bundit Aneeya had not violated the lese majeste law because he had not specifically referred to royalty and had not used rude language.The punishment for violating the law is three to 15 years’ imprisonment on each count.The court last week gave a record sentence of 43 1/2 years under the law to a woman arrested six years ago who posted audio clips online deemed critical of the monarchy. The former civil servant had her nominal sentence of 87 years halved because she pleaded guilty.In the past two months, the authorities have pursued lese majeste cases against at least 54 people, according to the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.They acted after growing public criticism of the monarchy, once virtually unknown, by a youth-led pro-democracy movement. The protest movement seeks reform of the monarchy, which it says is unaccountable and has excessive power in what is supposed to be a democratic constitutional monarchy.After King Maha Vajralongkorn took the throne in 2016 following his father’s death, he informed the government that he did not wish to see the lese majeste law used. But as the protests grew last year and criticism of the monarchy got harsher, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha warned a line had been crossed and the law would be used.Bundit was prosecuted for saying at a seminar at Bangkok’s Thammasat University that “Human value and dignity of Thais must be higher than dust under someone’s feet.”By tradition, Thai citizens who see themselves as subjects of the king refer to themselves as “the dust under your feet” when formally addressing the monarch.The seminar was convened by an activist group opposed to the junta that took power in a 2014 military coup, and solicited public comments on a draft constitution to replace the one nullified in the army takeover.Police and military agents monitored the meeting and took Bundit into custody as soon as he made a proposal for five principles that should be enshrined in the charter, including human dignity.He was formally accused only in 2017, when a military prosecutor alleged that his remark was a derogatory reference to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.The lese majeste law is supposed to cover the king, his immediate family and any regent, but has sometimes been applied more broadly.It was the third lese majeste case filed against Bundit, who is in poor health. He was convicted in one previous case, for which he received a suspended sentence, and acquitted in the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-court-acquits-80-year-old-writer-of-defaming-monarchy-101611670545952.html
26-01-2021||World||Iran urges Joe Biden to lift sanctions affecting medicines as it fights Covid-19||Iran urged US President Joe Biden on Tuesday to lift sanctions which it said were hampering Tehran's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Tehran also said it had approved Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine for domestic use, and that it was trying to buy vaccines from AstraZeneca and other companies.Sanctions reimposed by former US President Donald Trump formally exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, but many foreign banks have been deterred from doing business with Iran."Since (Biden's) administration claims not to be anti-science like the previous one ..., one expects it to free the transfer of Iran's own foreign exchange resources to fight the coronavirus and for health and food, and lift banking sanctions quickly," government spokesman Ali Rabiei told state television.He also threatened that Iran would block short-notice inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities by the United Nations atomic agency if Washington did not lift sanctions.In 2018, Trump pulled Washington out of Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with world powers aimed at limiting its nuclear programme, and reimposed US sanctions that had been lifted under it.During a visit to Moscow, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Tuesday that Tehran planned to import and produce the Sputnik V vaccine.Deputy Health Minister Qassem Janbabaei told state television that "AstraZeneca in Sweden" was among companies from which it was considering buying vaccines from overseas, but made no reference to the Anglo-Swedish company's British ties.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top authority, has banned the government from importing US and British-made vaccines, which he said were unreliable and may be used to spread the infection to other nations.President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that vaccinations would begin in the coming weeks.Tehran launched human trials of the first of its three domestic vaccine candidates late last month, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite US sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.Iran is also participating in the COVAX scheme that aims to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poorer countries.Iran has recorded nearly 1.39 million cases of Covid-19 and 57,560 deaths, according to government data, but there has been a decline in new infections and deaths in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-urges-joe-biden-to-lift-sanctions-affecting-medicines-as-it-fights-covid19-101611667419979.html
26-01-2021||World||UK launches new global platform to track new Covid-19 variants||The UK launched a New Variant Assessment Platform on Tuesday, which it says will offer the country's world-leading genomics expertise to identify new variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 to countries who do not have the resources to do so.As part of the UK’s Presidency of the G7 this year, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined the plans in a speech at the think tank Chatham House – the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London as he laid out his vision for a stronger, more collaborative and effective global health system, not just in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, but to ensure the international community is better prepared for future threats.“This pandemic has shown that the foundations of so many of the exciting experiences that make life worth living are contingent not just on our health, or the health of our neighbours, but the health of people we’ve never met. When one of us suffers, we all suffer,” said Hancock.“So we must work to promote health security in every single part of the world. Not only will this Platform help us better understand this virus and how it spreads, but it will also boost global capability in this important field, so we’re all better prepared for whatever lies ahead,” he said.Countries will be offered UK capacity to analyse new strains of the virus through the launch of the platform led by Public Health England (PHE), working with NHS Test and Trace and academic partners as well as the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) SARS-CoV-2 Global Laboratory Working Group. In due course, it will be led by the National Institute for Health Protection (NIHP) and will involve PHE laboratories and staff as well as academic partner capabilities.Dr Isabel Oliver, Director of Public Health England’s National Infection Service, said: “We know that the virus will evolve over time and certain mutations could potentially cause the virus to spread faster, make people sicker, or possibly affect how well vaccines work. Genomic testing is crucial to our efforts to control the virus – it allows us to keep an eye on how the virus is changing and to respond before it’s too late.“This new initiative will bring Public Health England’s cutting edge science to countries that have little or no ability to sequence and analyse Covid-19 virus strains themselves. It will also give us crucial early warning of new variants emerging around the world that might endanger the UK.”The platform will be working directly on samples provided from abroad or will provide expert advice and support remotely where the partner country already has some capabilities in this area but requests further assistance. The offer could include training and resources as well as personnel and equipment.Countries will be able to apply for assistance by contacting the WHO where an existing channel does not already exist with the UK.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) describes the move as vital work to combat the spread of coronavirus by identifying more Covid-19 variants around the world to keep the global community one step ahead of any mutations.The UK has carried out more than half of all SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to the global database, and this capability helped PHE’s scientists identify the variant in Kent, southern England, informing new measures to tackle the spread of the virus.“New variants of coronavirus can be threats to the progress made so far with treatments and vaccines, so it is vital that the global community is able to react to them quickly and decisively,” the DHSC said.The aim of the new platform is for the UK’s genomic expertise to guide the global response to controlling the spread of deadly viruses and saving lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-launches-new-global-platform-to-track-new-covid-19-variants-101611670055368.html
26-01-2021||World||China, New Zealand ink trade deal as Beijing calls for reduced global barriers||China and New Zealand signed a deal on Tuesday upgrading a free trade pact to give exports from the Pacific nation greater access to the world's second-largest economy.The pact comes as Beijing seeks to establish itself as a strong advocate of multilateralism after a bruising trade war with the United States, at a time when the coronavirus has forced the closure of many international borders.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed the signing of the expanded deal."China remains one of our most important trade partners...For this to take place during the global economic crisis bought about by Covid-19 makes it particularly important," she told a news conference.The pact widens an existing trade deal with China to ensure it remains fit for purpose for another decade, Trade Minister Damien O’Connor said in a statement.It provides for tariffs to be either removed or cut on many of New Zealand's mostly commodities-based exports, ranging from dairy to timber and seafood, while compliance costs will also be reduced.For a factbox on key deal points, please click on the square brackets:"The upgrade shows the two sides' firm determination to support multilateralism and free trade," Zhao Lijian, a spokesman of China's foreign ministry, told a news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.The previous day, speaking at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, President Xi Jinping had criticised isolationism and "Cold War" thinking and called for barriers to trade, investment and technological exchange to be removed.In recent months, Beijing has signed an investment pact with the European Union and joined the world's largest free trade bloc in the 15-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes New Zealand.China has also expressed interest in joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) Agreement, the successor to a pact from which Washington withdrew.China's new deal with Wellington also opens up sectors such as aviation, education and finance. In exchange, New Zealand will increase visa quotas for Chinese language teachers and tour guides, the official Xinhua news agency said.New Zealand was the first developed nation to sign a free trade pact with China in 2008, and has long been touted by Beijing as an exemplar of Western engagement.China is now New Zealand’s largest trading partner, with annual two-way trade of more than NZ$32 billion ($21.58 billion).But ties have been tested under Ardern's government as New Zealand criticised China’s influence on small Pacific islands and raised human rights concerns about Muslim Uighurs.Ardern also backed Taiwan’s participation at the World Health Organization (WHO) despite a warning from Beijing.The wider trade pact also comes as Beijing's ties with neighbouring Australia worsened after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first reported in central China.Australia has appealed to the World Trade Organization to review China's decision to impose hefty tariffs on imports of its barley.New Zealand, which will host the regional Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit this year, has said it would be willing to help negotiate a truce between China and Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-new-zealand-ink-trade-deal-as-beijing-calls-for-reduced-global-barriers-101611650515131.html

He said 0.014% had contracted milder forms of COVID-19.Israel began what has become the world's fastest per capita distribution of vaccines against the new coronavirus on Dec. 19, using the shot developed by the American firm Pfizer Inc. and Germany's BioNTech.According to Health Ministry figures, 23% have received the first shot and more than 6% the second, between 21 and 28 days later.The ministry blames highly communicable variants originating abroad for setbacks in Israel's bid to halt the spread of the virus.A week after beginning vaccinations, it imposed its third national lockdown, which officials say may need to be extended into February.But last Thursday it reported a reproduction number - known as "R" - of less than 1, which indicates that epidemic is no longer growing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-serious-covid-19-cases-among-israelis-given-pfizer-shot-says-health-minister-101611663440110.html
26-01-2021||World||Twitter bans major Republican donor Mike Lindell over Capitol riots||Twitter on Monday (local time) banned Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow who is a major Republican donor and supporter of former President Donald Trump, for repeated violations of its new policy enacted after the Capitol riots in the US.According to a report by CNN, the decision to ban Lindell's account was taken based on Twitter's new policy whereby people who repeatedly share election misinformation can be permanently banned."The account you referenced has been permanently suspended due to repeated violations of our Civic Integrity Policy," the Twitter spokesperson said.Though it is not clear which tweets led to the ban on Lindell's account, Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling MyPillow products after Lindell voiced continued support for former President Donald Trump in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and voicing false statements publicly about the validity of the election, CNN reported.According to an earlier report by New York Times, Lindell, a big Republican donor, had called the violence in the Capitol as "very peaceful".He had further stated, "There was probably some undercover antifa that dressed as Trump people and did some damage to windows and got in there."Twitter's Civic Integrity policy states: "You may not use Twitter's services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes".This has resulted in Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene being locked out of her account for 12 hours two weeks ago, CNN said.Earlier this month, Twitter had banned Donald Trump citing the Capitol riots."After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence," Twitter said.On January 6, a group of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest legislators confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid.Trump had made a speech among thousands of supporters reiterating his claim a massive voter fraud had robbed his election victory and encouraged supporters to maintain support to "stop the steal."Five people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and Trump supporter who was shot dead by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-bans-major-republican-donor-mike-lindell-over-capitol-riots-101611663449083.html
26-01-2021||World||Italian PM Conte resigns, leaving country adrift in the midst of the pandemic||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned after losing his Senate majority, plunging the country into political uncertainty just as it’s battling the pandemic and a recession.Weakened by the defection of a junior partner, Conte offered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella on Tuesday, according to a statement from the president’s office. The head of state, who oversees attempts to forge new governments, will hold a round of talks with party leaders before he nominates someone to forge a fresh coalition, the statement said.Conte is angling for a new mandate to form what would be his third government in four years. His plan, according to officials familiar with his thinking, is to forge a broader alliance including pro-European centrists and unaffiliated lawmakers -- and possibly even bringing back some members of ex-Premier Matteo Renzi’s Italy Alive party, who abandoned his second administration earlier this month.But Mattarella could also decide that there’s a better candidate to pull together a majority in the fragmented parliament, or even that elections are necessary to return the country to political stability.After fighting for two weeks to shore up his position, Conte’s hand was forced by the prospect of losing a Senate vote on the judiciary due as soon as Wednesday. A defeat there would have damaged his authority and reduced his chances of being granted a new opportunity by Mattarella, according to an official who spoke before the resignation.The timing of the turmoil has baffled many Italians, with the more than 400 people a day dying while Conte and Renzi tussled and growing evidence of a further hit to the country’s battered public finances. But there was also unease at Conte’s willingness to use emergency powers just as the prospect of the European Union’s recovery package is raising the stakes.Officially, Renzi’s dispute with Conte was driven by disagreements over how the 209 billion euros ($250 billion) of grants and loans should be spent and how the spending should be controlled. But there’s also an awareness that whoever is in power over the next two years stands to reap the political gains from that windfall.Compared to previous bouts of political instability in recent years, Italy’s bond markets have been tranquil, thanks largely to the support provided by the European Central Bank’s stimulus. The nation’s 10-year yield spread over Germany, a key gauge of risk, reached its lowest point in almost five years earlier this month and even now is trading less than 20 basis points higher at around 120 basis points.For the time being, though, the Treasury is starting to factor in a bigger hit to the country’s battered public finances this year as another extended lockdown holds back the recovery, a senior government official said.Treasury models suggest the budget deficit may reach as much as 9.2% of output this year, that official said. The government is also looking at a deteriorating outlook for growth and could see the economy expand as little as 4.5% in a worst-case scenario, according to the official. The government’s official projection from October is for a 6% expansion.For the 56-year-old Conte, a lawyer plucked from Florence academia to head his first government in 2018, it’s the second time he’s seen his coalition fall apart. When Matteo Salvini of the anti-migrant League abandoned Conte in 2019, the premier replaced him with the center-left Democratic Party.This time around, the Democrats and Conte’s main allies, the Five Star Movement, are divided even internally on whether or not to negotiate with Renzi, with many believing he cannot be trusted after sniping at the coalition for months and then pulling out, the officials said. One consideration that delayed Conte’s resignation was the concern that Renzi would seek to maneuver someone else into position to replace him as prime minister.While some of the premier’s allies have raised the prospect of early elections to resolve the impasse, coalition leaders still see this is an unlikely option, officials said. Conte’s supporters fear that the center-right would win a snap vote, and fewer seats will be available after parliament was downsized in a constitutional reform.Polls suggest that Five Star would face a drubbing and Renzi’s party could be wiped out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-resigns-amid-political-turmoil-101611662877262.html

And when the Trump administration increased sanctions, Iran gradually and publicly abandoned the deal's limits on its nuclear development.The remarks Tuesday by Iran's Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei are part of pressure that Tehran is trying to exert on the U.S. as it seeks to increase its leverage and get the Biden administration to quickly return to the deal.President Joe Biden has moved swiftly to dismantle Trump's legacy by signing a series of executive actions that reverse course on a wide range of issues, including climate change and immigration.Though Biden has pledged to return to the nuclear deal, Rabiei said there has yet to be any communication between Iran and Biden on the subject.“The U.S. will not have all the time in the world,” Rabiei said. “We are waiting for the official announcement of their stance as well as the lifting of sanctions.”In the meantime, he added that Iran would take a step further away from the nuclear deal by imposing a “restriction” on inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog in late February.In December, Iran's parliament approved a law under which part of the inspections that the deal had provided for would be suspended in February if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not offer relief from oil and banking sanctions.Tensions between Tehran and Washington have steadily increased. During Trump's final days as president, Tehran seized a South Korean oil tanker and begun enriching uranium closer to weapons-grade levels, while the U.S. has sent B-52 bombers, the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier and a nuclear submarine into the region.Iran has also increased its military drills, including firing cruise missiles as part of a naval drill in the Gulf of Oman this month.Iran has missile capability of up to 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), far enough to reach archenemy Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.Last January, after the U.S. killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad, Tehran retaliated by firing a barrage of ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, resulting in brain concussion injuries to dozens of American soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-won-t-have-infinite-time-to-rejoin-nuclear-deal-says-iran-101611661910017.html

26-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine firms must deliver, says EU chief||Companies producing Covid-19 vaccines "must deliver", EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday as tensions mounted between her European Commission and pharmaceutical firms over delayed deliveries."Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," she said in a live video address to an online-only version of the annual World Economic Forum usually held in Davos, Switzerland."And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations," she said.The Commission is demanding answers of British-Swedish group AstraZeneca and US company Pfizer about delays both have announced to their deliveries to the European Union.In a sign of concern that pharmaceutical groups might be selling the earmarked doses to higher bidders outside the bloc, it is making a move to require the companies to notify authorities of any exports to outside the European Union.Von der Leyen underlined that initiative in her speech, saying "we will set up a vaccine export transparency mechanism" to "ensure" the firms meet their contractual obligations to the EU.The issue is sensitive for von der Leyen, who spearheaded efforts to have the Commission procure more than two billion doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines for the bloc's 27 member states, home to 450 million people.Last week -- after Pfizer's announced delay but before AstraZeneca's -- von der Leyen vowed the aim was to inoculate 70 percent of adults in the EU by the end of August. That goal now looks in jeopardy.The pace of the EU rollout has lagged behind the United States, Britain and Israel, though member states including Malta, Denmark and France have started to accelerate their programmes.In her speech, von der Leyen said the Commission's vaccine procurement was not for the EU alone but also for poorer non-EU countries who are to be supplied through a COVAX vaccination alliance co-led by the World Health Organization.As part of a longer-term strategy to head off this and future health crises, von der Leyen said the EU would propose a public-private entity under a new European Health Emergency Response Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-firms-must-deliver-says-eu-chief-101611660783195.html
26-01-2021||World||WHO issues new clinical advice on treating Covid-19 patients||The World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh clinical advice on Tuesday for treating COVID-19 patients, including those displaying persistent symptoms after recovery, and also said it advised using low-dose anti-coagulants to prevent blood clots."The other things in the guidance that are new are that COVID-19 patients at home should have the use of pulse oximetry, that's measuring the oxygen levels, so you can identify whether somewhat at home is deteriorating and would be better off having hospital care," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a U.N. briefing in Geneva.The WHO advised clinicians to put patients into the awake prone position, on their front, shown to improve the oxygen flow, she said."Also we recommend, we suggest the use, of low-dose anti-coagulents to prevent blood clots forming in blood vessels. We suggest the use of lower doses rather than higher doses because higher doses may lead to other problems," Harris said.She added that a WHO-led team of independent experts, currently in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the first human cases were detected in December 2019, is due to leave quarantine in the next two days to pursue its work with Chinese researchers on the virus origins.She declined to commment on reports of delays in roll-out of vaccines in the European Union. She said she had no specific data and the WHO's priority was for health workers in all countries to be vaccinated in the first 100 days of the year.AstraZeneca, which developed its shot with Oxford University, told the EU on Friday it could not meet agreed supply targets up to the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-issues-new-clinical-advice-on-treating-covid-19-patients-101611660210443.html

Conte won confidence votes in parliament last week, but fell short of an absolute majority, forcing him to take the gamble of resignation.Mattarella, who is the largely ceremonial head of state, can ask Conte to try to form a broader coalition government, appoint a largely technical government to steer the country through the pandemic, or he can dissolve parliament and call elections two years early.The current coalition of the 5-Star Movement, Democratic Party and smaller Leu party are all hoping for a third Conte government. Conte's first government starting in 2018 was a 5-Star alliance with the right-wing League of Matteo Salvini that lasted 15 months. His second, with the Democrats, lasted 16 months.Salvini and center-right opposition parties are clamoring for early elections, hoping to capitalize on polls prior to the government crisis that showed high approval ratings for the League and the right-wing Brothers of Italy party of Giorgia Meloni.Salvini has blasted the “palace games and buying and selling of senators” of recent days as Conte has tried to find new coalition allies, saying Conte is incapable of leading Italy through the crisis.“Let’s use these weeks to give the word back to the people and we’ll have five years of a serious and legitimate parliament and government not chosen in palaces but chosen by Italians,” Salvini said in a video statement Monday.Democratic leader Nicola Zingaretti says early elections are the last thing the country needs. He tweeted Monday: “With Conte for a new clearly European-centric government supported by an ample parliamentary base, that will guarantee credibility and stability to confront the challenges Italy has ahead."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italys-giuseppe-conte-to-resign-seek-nod-to-form-new-coalition-101611655335657.html
26-01-2021||World||China deploys warships in South China Sea after US aircraft carrier sails by||China on Tuesday deployed warships including amphibious ones for a naval drill in the disputed waters of the South China Sea (SCS) in the backdrop of the US sending an aircraft carrier group in the maritime zone for a “freedom of the seas” operation.Three of China’s front-line docking ships, comprising the Wuzhishan, Changbaishan and Kunlunshan of the southern theatre navy, started an exercise focusing on actual combat training and beach landing exercises in the SCS, a state media report said.More warships from the Chinese navy are set to join the drill, which is expected to formally begin on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, a notice issued by China’s Maritime Safety Administration prohibited entry into a portion of waters in the Gulf of Tonkin to the west of the Leizhou peninsula in southwestern China from January 27-30.The American aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the SCS on Saturday to promote “freedom of the seas”, the US military said, barely days after Joe Biden began his term as president. China claims nearly the entire SCS, but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan, which China says is a breakaway region.“The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told reporters on Monday when asked about the presence of US ships in the SCS region.“This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region,” Zhao added.On Tuesday, Zhao reiterated that Beijing hopes Washington will change its policies towards China under the Biden administration.Zhao said in the past few years, the Trump administration had made directional errors, treating China as a strategic competitor or even a threat, and accordingly adopted a series of wrong actions that interfere with China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests.“This has led to an unusually severe situation in Sino-US relations that has never been seen since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. This is not in the fundamental interests of the two peoples,” Zhao said.On December 23, the US Navy said China had falsely claimed that it expelled an American warship from the SCS a day before, adding that Beijing was trying to assert its illegitimate claims in the maritime region.Beijing had said the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) southern theatre command deployed ships and aircraft to warn US destroyer USS John S. McCain as it sailed through disputed waters of the SCS.“The PRC’s statement about this mission is false. USS John S. McCain was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory,” Joe Keiley, US Navy’s 7th Fleet spokesperson, told HT in a statement.The US Navy spokesperson said that its ship conducted its operation and left “on our timeline” and were “not expelled”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deploys-warships-in-south-china-sea-after-us-aircraft-carrier-sails-by-101611655702976.html

There is growing anger in the EU about delivery delays from AstraZeneca Plc, which is expected to deliver fewer jabs to the continent in the first quarter than previously expected.Britain has been using both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines in its inoculation program, with the latter manufactured domestically.“We have great confidence in Pfizer and their delivery program,” Zahawi said, though he acknowledged “tight” supplies. “We work very closely with our EU partners.”The UK aims to offer vaccines to about 15 million people in its top 4 priority groups by Feb. 15. That includes care home residents, the over 70s and frontline health care workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-warns-eu-against-vaccine-nationalism-in-row-over-supplies-101611653404948.html
26-01-2021||World||Dutch Covid-19 riots add to political tension ahead of elections||The Netherlands witnessed a third straight evening of riots after the government imposed a curfew to curb the coronavirus pandemic, adding to uncertainty in the run-up to national elections in March.Police arrested more than 150 people after incidents in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and smaller Dutch cities on Monday, according to local media reports. Caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the disturbances as “criminal violence.”It’s not yet clear what impact the unrest will have on elections scheduled for March 17. Rutte’s government resigned on Jan. 15 over a scathing report on childcare benefits, making him the head of a caretaker cabinet until a new government is formed. That process could take months.The latest opinion polls show that 53-year-old Rutte, who has enjoyed strong public support throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, is likely to stay on as premier as his VVD party consolidates its position as front-runner. In Dutch politics, the largest faction in parliament takes the lead in forming a cabinet.Since the start of the curfew on Saturday, there has been widespread unrest in what a local police union has dubbed the worst riots in four decades. People began throwing fireworks at police officers on Sunday in a protest at a square near Amsterdam’s Van Gogh museum, and images showed others looting a supermarket at Eindhoven’s main train station.The incidents come as the country is in a lockdown, with non-essential shops, restaurants and bars closed until at least Feb. 9. The nationwide curfew was added to the government’s arsenal amid concern over new coronavirus variants that may spread more quickly.At the same time, overall case numbers have come down in recent weeks. The latest weekly data will be released later on Tuesday.While some protesters seemed focused on destroying property, others voiced their opposition to what they believe is an unjust infringement of their freedom by the government.“This has nothing to do with fighting for freedom,” Rutte said on Monday in The Hague, adding that in his view, 99% of the Dutch people are adhering to the rules -- including the curfew.“We are taking these measures not for the fun of it, but because we are fighting the virus and it is that virus that is taking the freedom from us at the moment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-covid-19-riots-add-to-political-tension-ahead-of-elections-101611653966940.html

26-01-2021||World||USIBC recommends big ideas to Biden administration to boost Indo-US ties||The US-India Business Council on Tuesday recommended a slew of big ideas to the new Biden Administration to strengthen the India-US partnership, including reconstituting the existing US-India Trade and Commercial dialogue and creating a new digital partnership under the headship of Vice President Kamala Harris.US India Business Council (USIBC), on the occasion of India’s 72nd Republic Day, also recommended to the Biden Administration to restructure the US-India Strategic Energy Dialogue to include Climate and Sustainable Growth and create a US-India Scholars Endowment to support higher education exchanges.The ideas also include reimagining and reconstitute existing US-India Trade and Commercial Dialogues into a single US-India Strategic Trade Dialogue, creating a new US-India Global Digital Partnership to be headed by Vice President Harris and restructuring the US-India Health Dialogue to expand the mandate and include private sector participation, according to the USIBC.The recommendations reflect USIBC’s long standing view that the natural partnership between the two nations can be leveraged to strengthen both countries’ economic recoveries and create a foundation for economic growth and job creation in the years ahead, it said.USIBC president Nisha Desai Biswal said: “As leaders around the globe reconsider their approach to global trade and investment, both the US and India can and should do more to achieve the shared goal of USD 500 billion in two-way trade”.USIBC said it stands ready to support the Biden administration on work to develop the economic policies that will transform the two economies and create millions of high-quality jobs at home and abroad.The US and India share a common set of values, robust democratic systems, and cultures of entrepreneurship, as well as long standing people-to-people ties that make the two countries natural partners, it said.India-US commercial relationship has seen fast-paced growth over the past decade, with bilateral goods and services trade growing 12.6 per cent in 2019 to reach USD 146.1 billion. Still, the relationship holds significant untapped potential.Business-friendly policies can unlock upwards of USD 150 billion in new trade over the next four years, as resolution of regulatory issues for both US and Indian companies opens the door for more expansive growth, the USIBC said.In its submission, the USIBC recommended that the new USISTD be co-chaired by the US Secretary of Commerce, the US Secretary of State, and the US Trade Representative, who would invite the Government of India to name similar counterparts.The USISTD should focus on reducing trade impediments to strengthen the strategic relationship and support a goal of USD 500 billion in two-way trade by 2024.For the USISTD to succeed, both governments must build a comprehensive “wish list” of core issues of importance to industry, it said.The USIBC has also recommended the two sides set up an expert group consisting of senior officials, industry representatives and academic thought leaders to build a document for discussion under the USISTD.The USIBC, in collaboration with an India-based counterpart, can partner with the US and Indian governments to launch this expert group, it said.Proposing the creation of a US-India Global Digital Partnership (USIGDP) to facilitate discussions between critical stakeholders across government and industry, USIBC said that following the model of the National Space Council, the USIGDP should be headed by Vice President Harris, who would delegate critical elements of the discussion to relevant departments or agencies.Through discussion with the Government of India, appropriate counterpart(s) within the Prime Minister’s Office could be identified, it said.The US and India are leaders in the digital economy, which powers a vast share of global innovation, trade and investment, and STEM job creation.A successful Indian-American diaspora— including many in the tech sector—provides US and Indian industry with access to capital, technology, and a high-quality pool of technical talent.“The Biden administration should invest in partnerships that position the US and India to lead the next generation of technology development,” USIBC said.Observing that the Covid-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped global health discussions and priorities, USIBC recommended restructuring and re-energising the US-India Health Dialogue to create a forum that can tackle important policy issues in a post-pandemic era.To create a sustainable and resilient recovery, the US-India Health Dialogue should promote economic, trade, health, and social collaboration between the two governments and private sector institutions from both countries, it said.Noting that the US-India Strategic Energy Dialogue is a dynamic platform for discussion, but in recent years has moved away from climate goals, USIBC said that with the appointment of US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, it is an opportune time to reintroduce climate into the existing dialogue.This discussion could be co-chaired by Special Presidential Envoy Kerry and the US Secretary of Energy and would leverage expertise from government, industry, US National Laboratories, and research institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usibc-recommends-big-ideas-to-biden-administration-to-boost-indo-us-ties-101611652005647.html
26-01-2021||World||Trump opens office to ‘carry on’ his administration’s agenda||Former President Donald Trump has opened an office to “advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda” of his administration, according to a statement released Monday night.The ex-president’s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, created a new email distribution system via one of his private companies for Trump’s statements because the 2020 campaign’s email infrastructure has been suspended by the vendor it had been using, Campaign Monitor, according to two people familiar with the matter.A slew of technology platforms excised Trump accounts or subgroups, including those on Twitter, Facebook, Shopify, Twitch and Instagram, after the Jan. 6 riot by pro-Trump supporters at the US Capitol.The statement from the Office of Donald J. Trump was issued less than an hour before House Democrats crossed the US Capitol to deliver an article of impeachment against the former president to the Senate. That sets in motion Trump’s second impeachment trial. He is accused of inciting the mob that broke into the Capitol as Congress was about to certify the results of the election he lost to Joe Biden.One of Parscale’s companies, Nucleus, built an email distribution system meant to circumvent outside vendors. Aides want to prevent media companies from silencing or “canceling” Trump in the future, one of the people said.The letterhead on the statement indicated that the office will operate out of Palm Beach, where Trump moved after leaving the White House last week. According to the statement, the “office will be responsible for managing President Trump’s correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism.”Later, in a statement released by the Save America leadership political action committee he formed after the election, Trump endorsed his former press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for governor of Arkansas. She announced that she was running earlier Monday.Also on Monday, a Trump adviser said he had no plans to break from the Republican Party to pursue a third party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-opens-office-to-carry-on-his-administration-s-agenda-101611651145194.html

26-01-2021||World||President Biden more bullish on vaccines, open to 1.5 million daily shot goal||President Joe Biden appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting the nation could soon be injecting 1.5 million shots on an average per day.Biden signaled on Monday his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers.It was among a flurry of moves by Biden during his first full week to show he's taking swift action to heal an ailing economy as talks with Congress over a USD 1.9 trillion stimulus package showed few signs of progress.Biden reiterated that he believes the country is in a precarious spot and and that relief is urgently needed, even as he dismissed the possibility of embracing a scaled-down bill to secure passage faster. Among the features of the stimulus plan are a national vaccination program, aid to reopen schools, direct payments of USD 1,400 to individuals and financial relief for state and local governments.“Time is of the essence,” Biden said. “I am reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here.”Biden's new vaccination target comes after he and his aides faced criticism for the 100 million goal in his first 100 days in office. The US has exceeded a pace of 1 million doses per day over the last week.“I think we may be able to get that to ... 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day,” Biden said, “but we have to meet that goal of a million a day.”Biden added that he expects widespread availability of the vaccines for Americans by spring, with the US. “well on our way to herd immunity” necessary to end the pandemic by summer.Even so, he warned the nation was going to be “in this for a while, and could see between “600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.”As of Sunday, the federal government had distributed 41.4 million vaccine doses to states and other jurisdictions.Of that, 21.8 million doses had been administered, or about 53 per cent.About 3.2 million people had received their full two-dose vaccination, a little less than 1 per cent of the population.That's according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Already, more than 420,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus.Biden's team held a call Sunday to outline the stimulus plan with at least a dozen senators, while the president also privately talked with lawmakers.“There's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes there has to be progress in the next couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.She warned that action needed to be taken before the US reaches an “unemployment cliff” in March, when long-term unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.But Republicans on Capitol Hill were not joining in the push for immediate action.One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said after Sunday's call that “it seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.”Collins described the additional funding for vaccinations as useful while cautioning that any economic aid should be more targeted.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that “any further action should be smart and targeted, not just an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it.”Biden sought to downplay the rhetoric from GOP lawmakers, saying, “I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works.”“This is just the process beginning,” he added. “No one wants to give up on their position until there's no other alternative.”Monday's order will likely take 45 days or longer to make its way through the federal bureaucracy, during which time wrangling with Congress could produce a new aid package.That would be a follow-up to the roughly USD 4 trillion previously approved to tackle the economic and medical fallout from the coronavirus.The order was aimed at increasing factory jobs, which have slumped by 540,000 since the pandemic began last year.“America can't sit on the sidelines in the race for the future,” Biden said before signing the order in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “We're ready, despite all we're facing.”Biden's order would modify the rules for the Buy American program, making it harder for contractors to qualify for a waiver and sell foreign-made goods to federal agencies.It also changes rules so that more of a manufactured good's components must originate from US factories. America-made goods would also be protected by an increase in the government's threshold and price preferences, the difference in price over which the government can buy a foreign product.It's an order that channels Biden's own blue-collar persona and his promise to use the government's market power to support its industrial base, an initiative that former President Donald Trump also attempted with executive actions and import taxes.“Thanks to past presidents granting a trade-pact waiver to Buy American, today billions in U.S. tax dollars leak offshore every year because the goods and companies from 60 other countries are treated like they are American for government procurement purposes,” said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch and a critic of past trade agreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-more-bullish-on-vaccines-open-to-1-5-million-daily-shot-goal-101611650460131.html
26-01-2021||World||Under Joe Biden, China faces renewed trade pressure||The US-Chinese trade war isn’t going away under President Joe Biden.Biden won’t confront Beijing right away, economists say, because he wants to focus on the coronavirus and the economy. But he looks set to renew pressure over trade and technology grievances that prompted President Donald Trump to hike tariffs on Chinese imports in 2017.Negotiators might tone down Trump’s focus on narrowing China’s multibillion-dollar trade surplus with the United States and push harder to open its state-dominated economy, which matters more in the long run, economists say. But no abrupt tariff cuts or other big changes are expected.“I think Biden will focus more on trying to extract structural reforms,” said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics. “It’s going to take some time before we get any shift or explicit announcements.”Biden is evaluating tariffs on Chinese goods and wants to coordinate future steps with allies, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday. She gave no indication of possible changes.“The president is committed to stopping China’s economic abuses,” Psaki said.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, appealed to Washington to learn from Trump's “erroneous policies” and adopt a “constructive attitude" but gave no indication of possible changes by Beijing.“Cooperation is the only correct choice for both sides,” Zhao said Tuesday.Trump acted on complaints that are shared by Europe and other traders, but Washington has little to show for its bruising war. It brought President Xi Jinping’s government to the bargaining table but roiled global trade, raised consumer prices and wiped out jobs.The last major development was a year ago, when Beijing promised in the “Phase One” agreement of January 2020 to buy more soybeans and other US exports and stop pressuring companies to hand over technology.China fell short on those purchases. Amid the coronavirus turmoil, it bought about 55% of what it promised. As for tech policy, some economists say those changes matter but question whether it counts as a win. They say Beijing might have made them anyway to suit its own plans.China faces more opposition than ever in Washington due to its trade record, territorial disputes with neighbors, crackdown on Hong Kong, reports of abuses against ethnic Muslims and accusations of technology theft and spying.“The ground has shifted in a significant way,” said Nathan Sheets, a former Treasury undersecretary for international affairs in the Obama administration.Katherine Tai, Biden’s choice to succeed US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, sounded a hawkish note on China in a speech this month.“We face stiffening competition from a growing and ambitious China,’’ said Tai. “A China whose economy is directed by central planners who are not subject to the pressures of political pluralism, democratic elections or popular opinion.’’That means China has to make changes if wants to make progress, said Raoul Leering, global trade analyst for ING. He said that while many of Trump’s statements were “close to nonsense,” he was right that China has more trade barriers and official intervention in the economy than the United States.“It will depend on China, the speed at which they reform and change policies, to see whether Biden will roll back trade barriers,” he said.After 2 1/2 years and 13 rounds of talks, negotiators have yet to tackle one of the biggest irritants for China’s trading partners — the status of politically favored state companies that dominate industries from banking to oil to telecoms.Europe, Japan and other governments criticized Trump’s tactics but echo complaints that Beijing steals technology and breaks market-opening promises by subsidizing and shielding companies from competition.Those complaints strike at the heart of a state-led development model Communist Party leaders see as the basis of China’s success.They are building up “national champions” including PetroChina Ltd., Asia's biggest oil producer, and China Mobile Ltd., the world's biggest phone carrier by subscribers. The party in 2013 declared state industry the “core of the economy.”Outside the state sector, the party is nurturing competitors in solar power, electric cars, next-generation telecoms and other fields.Beijing could offer to drop its claim to being a developing economy, a status it insists on despite having become one of the biggest manufacturers and a middle-income society, Leering said. Under WTO rules, that allows the Communist Party to protect industries and intervene more in the economy.Giving that up “would be a very important gesture,” Leering said.Trump’s opening shot in 2017 was a tax hike on $360 billion worth of Chinese imports. Beijing retaliated with tariff hikes and suspended soybean imports, hitting farm states that voted for Trump in 2016.The US trade deficit with China narrowed by by 19% in 2019 over a year earlier and by 15% in the first nine months of 2020.That failed to achieve Trump’s goal of moving jobs to the United States. Importers shifted instead to Taiwan, Mexico and other suppliers. The total US trade deficit dipped slightly in 2019, then rose nearly 14% through November last year.Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office estimates tariff hikes cost the average US household nearly $1,300 last year. Businesses postponed investments, undoing some of the benefits of Trump’s 2017 corporate tax cut.A study by the US-China Business Council and Oxford Economics found the US economy lost 245,000 jobs due to the tariffs. It said even a modest reduction would create 145,000 jobs by 2025.Trump stepped up pressure by cutting off access to US technology for telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. and other companies seen by American officials as possible security risks and a threat to US industrial leadership. Americans were ordered to sell shares in Chinese companies Washington says have links to the military.The Communist Party responded by vowing to accelerate its two-decade-old campaign to make China a self-reliant “technology power.”Psaki, the White House spokeswoman, said Biden also was reviewing those issues but gave no indication of possible changes.Biden wants to hold Beijing accountable for “unfair and illegal practices” and make sure American technology doesn't facilitate its military buildup, Psaki said.Zhao, the Chinese spokesman, called on Washington not to “politicize or weaponize” science and technology and to avoid “groundless accusations to smear China.”Biden’s envoys have the option of fine-tuning Trump’s penalties by dropping some in exchange for Chinese policy changes, said Kuijs. But he and other economists say rolling back tariffs and curbs on access to technology and financial markets is unlikely to be a priority.“It is difficult to see a US reversal of the recent hawkish trends in China policy,” Sylvia Sheng of JP Morgan Asset Management said in a report.Tech curbs are unlikely to be eased because Washington "regards China as a competitor,” said Tu Xinquan, director of the Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.Tariff cuts look like the only short-term option, Tu said. He said Biden could defend getting rid of taxes the World Trade Organization says were improperly imposed.“In that case, he wouldn’t lose face,” said Tu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-joe-biden-china-faces-renewed-trade-pressure-101611650924194.html

26-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Chinese media float conspiracies, smear foreign vaccines||China on Monday said the issue of supplying Covid-19 vaccines to countries that need the jabs should not be marred by “malign competition” or “rivalry” but its tightly controlled state media is simultaneously running a smear campaign against both Indian and western vaccines.Not only are Chinese official media outlets questioning the efficacy of western vaccines and safety records, but the Chinese foreign ministry is also – like its diplomats did last year – plugging conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus.A statement from foreign ministry spokesperson to state media recently implied the coronavirus could have emerged from a laboratory at the Fort Detrick Army Medical Command in the US state of Maryland.“If America respects the truth, then please open up Fort Detrick and make public more information about the 200 or more bio-labs outside of the US, and please allow the WHO expert group to go to the US to investigate the origins,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying told The Global Times.Hua’s statement comes in the backdrop of a World Health Organization (WHO) team currently stationed in China to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The article and Hua’s statement were well-timed. The hashtag “American’s Ft. Detrick”, started by the Communist Youth League, had been viewed more than a billion times on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform.The WHO team’s presence in China is particularly sensitive for China as it continues attempts to deflect criticism about the authorities’ slow response to the Covid-19 outbreak at the beginning.A flurry of articles in Chinese state media in the past weeks have also promoted Chinese vaccines while criticising western and Indian ones.India’s efforts to make and supply vaccines to neighbouring countries have not been spared by Chinese media.The Global Times has published stories critical of the vaccines made in India and whether India has the capacity to supply the shots globally.A recent article in the nationalist tabloid not only raised questions about India’s capacity to manufacture vaccines after the fire at the Serum Institute, but also claimed that Indians in China were “embracing” Chinese vaccines.Last week, Reuters news agency calculated that Global Times, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, “had published more than ten reports in the past week critical of vaccines and inoculation schemes in the West”.About half of those reports referred to reported deaths of some frail, elderly patients in Norway after being inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the Reuters report said.The Global Times ran a report quoting Chinese experts as saying Australia should not use western vaccines and opt for Chinese ones.The state-run China Daily newspaper on Monday ran a report extolling China’s vaccines and the country’s efforts to supply doses to developing countries.“While western countries invest enormous capital in developing vaccines to fight the increasing number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, China is fulfilling its promise to make vaccines a global public good,” the article said.There have been questions about the lack of clinical data related to Chinese vaccines.Business and political news website, Caixin, quoted a leading Chinese vaccine expert as saying that China’s needs to share more data on the vaccines -- a rare instance of a Chinese media outlet taking a critical look at the developing story on vaccines. “Ding Sheng, dean of Tsinghua University’s School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and director of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute (GHDDI), called for the original clinical trial data from Chinese experimental vaccines to be made public so that experts can better assess their efficacy and eliminate lingering safety concerns which have emerged in China and abroad,” the website reported.“The clinical data (of our vaccines) need to be further disclosed,” Ding said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-media-float-conspiracies-smear-foreign-vaccines-101611646701770.html
26-01-2021||World||UK jobless rate rises to highest since 2016||Britain's unemployment rate rose to 5.0%, its highest since early 2016, in the three months to November as the coronavirus pandemic continued to take its toll on the economy and the country went back into a lockdown, official figures showed.Separate data, also released by the Office for National Statistics, showed the number of employees on company payrolls in December was down 2.7% on a year earlier and 828,000 lower than at the start of the pandemic in February.British unemployment has been kept down by the government's Job Retention Scheme, which supported 2.4 million jobs as of Oct. 31, down from a peak of 8.9 million in May.The programme is Britain's most expensive Covid economic support measure, costing 46.4 billion pounds ($63 billion) up to mid-December, and is due to end on April 30.Finance minister Rishi Sunak will set out future job support measures at his annual budget on March 3. Rising Covid cases last year repeatedly forced him to scrap plans to end the Job Retention Scheme."This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost as a result is a tragedy," Sunak said after Tuesday's data."Whilst the NHS (National Health Service) is working hard to protect people with the vaccine we’re throwing everything we’ve got at supporting businesses, individuals and families."Friday's data showed that the number of people in employment dropped 88,000 in the three months to the end of November, a smaller fall than the 100,000 drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.The jobless rate was below the 5.1% poll forecast.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said this month that he believed the underlying jobless rate was higher, as the official definition excludes people without work who have temporarily postponed their job search due to the pandemic.Britain went into a new Covid lockdown on Jan. 5 due to a rapidly rising death toll that is now close to 100,000, the highest in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-jobless-rate-rises-to-highest-since-2016-101611646465651.html
26-01-2021||World||Covid-19 pandemic may take four to five years to end, says Singapore minister||It may take four to five years for the Covid-19 pandemic to end and the world to look to a post-Covid normal but that to with much uncertainities, Singapore’s Education Minister Lawrence Wong has warned.Speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2021 conference hosted by Singapore's Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) on Monday, Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce, said there are still many uncertainties to contend with in the next few years, while sharing his hopes about how the future can be "reset" once the pandemic is over, the Channel News Asia reported.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "At some point of time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five years before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-Covid normal. What will this new post-Covid world look like? No one can tell," Wong said.He said there was still a great uncertainty about how the coronavirus will shape society in the coming years.He said adhering to safe management measures like mask-wearing and avoiding crowds will continue for this year and "maybe a good part of next year"."Beyond that, the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations will progressively restart global travel, but getting the world vaccinated won't be quick or easy," he said during the conference.The government has planned for everyone in Singapore to be vaccinated by the third quarter of this year, but Wong conceded that there could still be "bumps along the way".He noted that the current vaccines may not be so effective against new mutant strains of the virus, and will have to be modified to counter them."In the positive scenario, this means the vaccine becomes a bit like an annual flu jab ... or perhaps we develop a vaccine that works for all strains. But in the worst case, we end up always a step behind an evolving virus, and you will not be able to catch up in time," he said."So there are still tremendous uncertainties ahead of us. And the bottom line is that we live in a shared world and no one is safe until everyone is safe," the report quoted the minister as saying.Looking ahead to the post-pandemic future, Wong said the current crisis can set the stage for a "software update" or a "reboot" of Singapore after the damage inflicted the virus."We must reset our social compact to emerge as a fairer and more equal society. The pandemic may be indiscriminate about who it infects but its impact is anything but equal. It has, in fact, widened the gulf between the haves and the have-nots," he said.Wong said that Singapore started to prioritise reducing inequality a decade ago, and that last year, many emergency measures were introduced to help lower-income groups.But this year, the temporary measures will have to "taper down" as the economy improves.However, the minister foresees that Singaporeans will need more assurance and support in a more uncertain and volatile world."The impact of the pandemic has created an added impetus to strengthen our social support system. There will be a permanent shift towards further strengthening of our social safety nets in Singapore to protect the disadvantaged and vulnerable," he said, adding that it will have to be done in a "sustainable manner over the long term".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-may-take-four-to-five-years-to-end-says-singapore-minister-101611640892385.html
26-01-2021||World||Justin Trudeau’s Liberals oust Indian-Canadian MP Ramesh Sangha from party caucus||Canada’s ruling Liberal Party has removed Indian-Canadian MP Rameshwer Singh Sangha, also known as Ramesh Sangha, from its caucus after consultations with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.In a statement, chief government Whip Mark Holland said the Punjab-origin MP who represents the riding of Brampton Centre in the Greater Toronto Area was ejected for making “baseless and dangerous accusations against a number of his caucus colleagues”.Holland added that after he was made aware of the accusations, he consulted with Trudeau and “the necessary steps were taken”.The nature of the accusations was not explained in Holland’s statement, though Sangha has in the past alleged that his party was “pandering” to pro-Khalistan elements. As National Post reported in 2019, he had told Punjabi-language radio channel 5AAB, “There is no doubt, there cannot be two opinions that the Liberal Party is pandering to Khalistan supporters.”More recently, while commenting on the resignation of Sikh cabinet minister Navdeep Bains, Sangha asked during the course of an interview with Y Network, another Punjabi-language group, “Are such people fit to be ministers?”He was speaking in the context of extremism in politics. When Bains quit suddenly this month, he attributed that decision to seeking to spend more time with his family.The release from Holland said, “As we have made clear time and time again, we will not tolerate conspiracy theories, or dangerous and unfounded rhetoric about parliamentarians or other Canadians. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for many Canadians to experience suspicions because of their background; we all know where this can lead. The Liberal caucus continues to stand firm against racism and intolerance.”Sangha was first elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 2015 defeating a minister in the previous Conservative Party government, Bal Gosal. He was re-elected in 2019. Considered a pro-India Sikh MP, he was also former chair of the Canada-India Parliamentary Friendship Group.A retired Indian Air Force officer, Sangha also claimed a close relationship with Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.While Sangha is no longer part of the Liberal caucus, he will continue in parliament as an independent MP.The Hindustan Times tried to reach Sangha for a comment, but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-liberals-oust-indian-canadian-mp-ramesh-sangha-from-party-caucus-101611640760536.html
26-01-2021||World||UN chief urges global alliance to counter rise of neo-Nazis||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged coordinated global action on Monday to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy and the resurgence of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and hate speech sparked partly by the COVID-19 pandemic.The U.N. chief also urged international action “to fight propaganda and disinformation.” And he called for stepped up education on Nazi actions during World War II, stressing that almost two-thirds of young Americans do not know that 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust.Guterres spoke at the annual Park East Synagogue and United Nations International Holocaust Remembrance Service marking Wednesday’s 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, held virtually this year because of COVID-19.He said the pandemic “has exacerbated longstanding injustices and divisions”“Propaganda linking Jews with the pandemic, for example, by accusing them of creating the virus as part of a bid for global domination, would be ridiculous, if it were not so dangerous,” he said. “This is just the latest manifestation of an anti-Semitic trope that dates back to at least the 14th century, when Jews were accused of spreading the bubonic plague.”The secretary-general said it’s sad but not surprising that the pandemic has triggered another eruption of Holocaust denial, distortion and minimizing history.“In Europe, the United States and elsewhere, white supremacists are organizing and recruiting across borders, flaunting the symbols and tropes of the Nazis and their murderous ambitious,” he said. “Tragically, after decades in the shadows, neo-Nazis and their ideas are now gaining currency,”Guterres said U.S. authorities have warned that neo-Nazis are on the rise across the country and around the world. In some unnamed countries, he said, neo-Nazis have infiltrated police and state security services and their ideas can be heard in debates of mainstream political parties.“The continued rise of white supremacy and neo-Nazi ideology must be seen in the context of a global attack on truth that has reduced the role of science and fact-based analysis in public life,” he said.Guterres said fragmentation of the traditional media and the growth of social media are contributing to the absence of shared facts.“We need coordinated global action, on the scale of the threat we face, to build an alliance against the growth and spread of neo-Nazism and white supremacy, and to fight propaganda and disinformation,” he said.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor, warned that “if we do not carry the tragic lessons of history, they are doomed to be repeated.”“This guiding principle -- memory not amnesia -- is a moral imperative to quell the rise of hate, which is greater today than at any time since the end of World War II,” he said.Schneier said Nazi swastikas are again defacing synagogues and cemeteries in France, Germany and most recently Montreal, and among those storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 were people wearing shirts saying “Camp Auschwitz” and “6MWE” -- short for “Six Million Wasn’t Enough.”“Children are not born with hatred; they are taught how to hate,” the 90-year-old rabbi said. “Holocaust education in schools is a must.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-urges-global-alliance-to-counter-rise-of-neonazis-101611633350483.html
26-01-2021||World||Ex-Trump spokeswoman Sarah Sanders running for Arkansas governor||Sarah Sanders, Donald Trump's former chief spokeswoman, announced she's running for Arkansas governor at a time other Republicans are distancing themselves from the former president facing an impeachment charge that he incited the deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol.But the former White House press secretary, who left the job in 2019 to return to her home state, ran the other direction with an announcement Monday that embraced Trump as much as his rhetoric.“With the radical left now in control of Washington, your governor is your last line of defense,” Sanders said in a nearly eight-minute video announcing her 2022 bid that prominently featured pictures of the president as well as some of his favorite targets.Trump, who publicly encouraged Sanders to run, wasted no time putting his seal of approval on her bid. The former president on Monday night backed Sanders' candidacy — his first official, public endorsement since leaving office — and called her a “warrior who will always fight for the people of Arkansas and do what is right, not what is politically correct."The daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders is the most high-profile Trump official to seek major office and is doing so less than a week after the tumultuous end of his presidency. Her candidacy could showcase just how much of a hold Trump still has on the GOP.“Trump is simply not a liability here,” said Janine Parry, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas. “At least for the time being, we’re in a state where he remains an asset.”That’s even as the Senate is preparing for an impeachment trial over the Jan. 6 insurrection by Trump supporters that was aimed at halting the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory over Trump.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked the president last week, saying he “provoked” the siege. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson told reporters days before Biden’s inauguration he wanted Trump’s administration to end, though he also opposed the president’s impeachment.Sanders’ announcement makes a brief reference to the Capitol siege that left five dead, equating it with violence that occurred at some protests last year over racial injustice and the 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice that injured U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise and four others.“This is not who we are as Americans,” Sanders said in the video, but not mentioning Trump’s role in encouraging his supporters who stormed the Capitol.She joins a Republican primary that already includes two statewide elected leaders, Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. The three are running to succeed Hutchinson, who is unable to run next year due to term limits. No Democrats have announced a bid to run for the seat.Griffin and Rutledge had already spent months positioning themselves ahead of Sanders’ entry by lining up endorsements, raising money and trying to stake their claims as the most conservative candidate. Griffin has called for the outright elimination of the state’s income tax, while Rutledge signed on to Texas’ ultimately unsuccessful lawsuit challenging the result of the presidential election.Following the riot, Griffin and Rutledge issued statements condemning the storming of the Capitol but not addressing Trump’s role in stirring up his backers. Combined, the two have raised more than $2.8 million for the race.Griffin on Monday criticized Sanders for promising in her video to cut off funding to so-called sanctuary cities that violate immigration laws. He noted a 2019 measure Hutchinson signed into law already does just that by cutting off funding to cities that don’t cooperate with immigration authorities.“It sounds like she needs to catch up on what’s been going on in Arkansas,” Griffin said in a statement.Rutledge, meanwhile, said in a statement the race was about “who has a proven record and not merely rhetoric.”The race could also get even more crowded. Republican State Sen. Jim Hendren, a nephew of Hutchinson’s, is considering a run for the seat and said he hoped to make a decision within the next three weeks.“Right now we have three announced candidates but they all do represent the far right part of the Republican Party,” said Hendren, who has been much more willing to criticize Trump and hasn’t ruled out an independent bid. “The question I have to decide is, is there room for a more pragmatic, centrist type of approach?”Sanders was already well known in Arkansas politics, going back to when she appeared in ads for her father’s campaign. She managed Sen. John Boozman’s 2010 election and worked as an adviser to Sen. Tom Cotton’s in 2014.During Sanders’ nearly two-year tenure at the White House, daily televised briefings led by the press secretary ended after Sanders repeatedly sparred with reporters who aggressively questioned her. She faced questions about her credibility, but she also earned reporters’ respect working behind the scenes to develop relationships with the media.She remains an unknown on many issues and wasn’t made available for interviews Monday, though she staked out some positions in her introductory video that include reducing the state’s income tax.Her introductory video indicates she’s leaning more on her time with Trump, with it featuring images of or calling out those who frequently drew his ire including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and CNN.Republicans hold a firm grip on Arkansas, with the GOP holding all statewide and federal seats. They also hold a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. Trump in November won the state by nearly 28 percentage points, one of the biggest margins in his ultimate loss to Biden.State Democratic Party Chairman Michael John Gray on Monday called the GOP primary a “race to the bottom.” But national party leaders indicated Sanders’ candidacy may draw more resources and attention to a long-shot race that will coincide with 2022 congressional midterm elections.“As we close the book on a dark chapter in our history, we must make sure Trump’s brand of politics stays in the past," Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison tweeted. “Now, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is running on his record."Hutchinson, who has remained generally popular since taking office in 2015, said he didn't plan on endorsing anyone at this time in the race.“I am a voter, so I will follow the campaign with interest, but I have a job to do for the next two years, and I will devote my energies to bring Arkansas out of the pandemic and to revitalize our economy," he said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extrump-spokeswoman-sarah-sanders-running-for-arkansas-governor-101611633115841.html
26-01-2021||World||Greta Thunberg calls out three decades of 'blah, blah, blah' on climate change||Launching a scathing attack on world leaders and organisations over the issue of climate change, environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Monday said that world leaders speak of an existential climate emergency and yet instead of taking action, they set up "hypothetical distance targets, way into the future."Speaking at the Davos Agenda Summit, the young climate activist said, "My name is Greta Thunberg and I am not here to make deals. You see, I don't belong to any financial interest or political party so I can't bargain or negotiate. I am here to once again remind you of the emergency we are in. The crisis that you and your predecessors have inflicted upon us.""The crisis that you continue to ignore. I am here to remind you of the promises that you have made to your children and grandchildren and to tell you that we are not willing to compromise on the minimum safety levels that still remain," she said.Citing the current scientific knowledge on climate change, she said: "The climate and ecological crisis can no longer be solved within today's systems. According to the current best available science that's no longer an opinion, it's a fact. And we need to keep this in mind as countries, businesses and investors now rush forward to present their ambitious climate targets and commitments.""The longer we avoid this uncomfortable truth and longer we pretend that we can solve the climate and ecological emergency without treating it as an emergency, the more precious time we will lose. And this is time we do not have," she added.Over the emission targets set by the world bodies, Greta said, "Today, we hear leaders all over the world speak of an existential climate emergency and yet instead of taking action you would in an emergency, they set up vague, hypothetical distance targets, way into the future. Target based on loopholes and incomplete numbers. Target like net-zero emissions 2050.

26-01-2021||World||Xi Jinping warns Davos forum against 'new Cold War'||Chinese President Xi Jinping warned global leaders at an all-virtual Davos forum Monday against starting a "new Cold War" while he championed multilateralism.Representing the only major economy to record economic growth last year, Xi presented himself as the defender of multilateralism, as he did at the same forum four years ago when Donald Trump was about to assume the US presidency.Without naming the United States, Xi seemed to have a message for Trump's successor Joe Biden, who entered the White House just a few days ago, but who is not addressing the annual World Economic Forum (WEF)."To build small cliques or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others... will only push the world into division," Xi told the world's political and economic elite as the Biden administration plans to revitalise global alliances to counter China's growing influence.Trump had chosen open confrontation and verbal attacks, without tangible results for the enormous US trade deficit with China.Though Biden may be dismantling one by one the controversial measures of the Trump era, he has nonetheless signalled the United States will closely look out for its own interests.An executive order is to give US companies and products priority in contracting with the federal government as part of an overall plan to save industrial jobs by increasing investments in factories and workers.Meanwhile, European leaders presented agendas of their own at the WEF -- normally held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos but taking place virtually this year because of the pandemic.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier defended a controversial accord signed by the European Union and China in late December to provide increased mutual market access.The deal duplicates "a lot of the arrangements that the US already has with China," Altmaier said.- 'Year of recovery' -Herbert Diess, head of the German auto giant Volkswagen, which has several plants in China, noted that the country represented a great opportunity for European companies.But some members of the European Parliament and activist groups say the accord should be contingent on Beijing's ratifying international conventions banning forced labour.And Kenneth Roth, head of Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation, commented on Twitter that Xi "promotes global collaboration on Covid-19, so long as it doesn't involve investigating his three-week cover-up of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan, which enabled the virus to go global."A year ago, the emergence of a mysterious flu-like disease in China prompted few comments at the forum when it took place at its usual site in Switzerland.A year later, the world is still struggling to contain the coronavirus, which has killed more than two million people and cost 225 million jobs, according to the UN's International Labour Organization.The world's richest people have barely been touched, the non-governmental organisation Oxfam charged.Meanwhile, "it could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recover," Oxfam said in the study titled "The Inequality Virus".Optimism raised late last year by new vaccines has been tempered by production delays and new variants, and many countries are again mulling lockdowns to stem the spread of the virus.But European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde nonetheless forecast that 2021 will be "the year of recovery".She said that while renewed economic activity "seems to be a little bit delayed," it "should not be derailed".Other forum subjects broached on the first day was global taxation of digital giants, a priority for France that until recently has been opposed by the United States.French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed a more conciliatory tone from the new Biden administration on the subject.He hoped that a multilateral accord under the auspices of the the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) could be reached by the middle of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-warns-davos-forum-against-new-cold-war-101611631036488.html
26-01-2021||World||US Senate votes overwhelmingly to confirm Yellen as first female Treasury chief||Janet Yellen won overwhelming Senate confirmation as the first woman to lead the U.S. Treasury on Monday, setting her quickly to work with Congress on coronavirus relief, reviewing U.S. sanctions policy and strengthening financial regulation.The Senate voted 84-15 to confirm Yellen, with all opposition coming from Republicans, several of whom have expressed concerns about President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid plan, tax hikes and other spending initiatives.Shortly after the vote, House of Representatives Democrats delivered to the Senate a charge of impeachment against former President Donald Trump, accusing him of inciting insurrection in a speech to supporters before the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. The planned February trial has stoked some partisan divisions in the chamber, but those were largely absent on Monday."Secretary Yellen's confirmation shatters another glass ceiling," Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement. "In a field dominated by men, it's refreshing to finally see a woman leading the Treasury Department."Yellen, 74, made history in 2014 when she became the first woman to chair the Federal Reserve. A portrait of the economist and daughter of a Brooklyn, New York, family doctor will join those of 76 other secretaries in Treasury's hallways, dating back to the first, Alexander Hamilton.The White House had no immediate comment on when Yellen would be sworn in, or by whom.She won the votes of 34 Republicans in a strong bipartisan vote, with a number of them pledging to work with her."I hope bipartisanship continues & we can work 2gether on commonsense tax/fiscal policy for all Americans," Republican Senator Chuck Grassley wrote on Twitter.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz congratulated Yellen and voiced hope that she could help lead progress on reaching an international agreement on digital taxation. He told Reuters: "Janet Yellen is a very impressive person."Yellen will play a key role in working with Congress on Biden's coronavirus stimulus plans and on his pledges to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.Treasury will oversee Biden's plans to help finance these initiatives by trying to persuade Congress to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increase taxes on Americans making over $400,000 a year.Republicans have expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits during Trump's term with 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending.Yellen told senators at her confirmation hearing last week that they needed to raise the minimum wage and "act big" on stimulus measures or risk a longer, more painful recession brought on by the pandemic.SANCTIONS REVIEWYellen also said during her confirmation hearing that she would conduct an immediate review of U.S. financial sanctions policy administered by Treasury to ensure that they were used "strategically and appropriately" after a major ramp-up of such measures under the Trump administration.Yellen's confirmation less than a week after Biden took office is quick by recent standards. Her Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump's 2017 inauguration on a party-line vote.The Treasury on Monday announced more members of Yellen's team, bringing back some Obama administration veterans who served at the agency.The Treasury named Natalie Wyeth Earnest as counselor to the secretary for strategic communications. Earnest served as assistant secretary for public affairs at Treasury under former Secretary Jack Lew and in various communications roles under former Secretary Tim Geithner.Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former Treasury assistant secretary for tax policy, was named as deputy assistant secretary for tax policy in Treasury's Office of Legislative Affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-votes-overwhelmingly-to-confirm-yellen-as-first-female-treasury-chief-101611628342005.html
26-01-2021||World||Mexican president Obrador works from isolation after positive Covid-19 test||Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador worked from isolation Monday, a day after announcing that he tested positive for COVID-19, and was absent from his daily news conference for the first time in his two years in office.The president, who has rarely been seen wearing a mask, stayed out of sight as his country topped 150,000 deaths, the fourth-highest level in the world. He has been criticized for his handling of Mexico’s pandemic and for not setting an example of prevention in public.He spoke by phone Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and spokesman Jesus Ramirez said afterward on Twitter that Mexico would receive 24 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, though it has not yet been approved for use in the country.Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said Mexico has already received the results of Phase 3 efficacy testing on the Russian vaccine, but he did not release any figures on how well it works. He said those figures would be published soon. He said Mexico could begin receiving shipments of the vaccine in late January or February, though it has not yet been authorized for use.López Obrador appeared “with resolute spirit, working and looking good,” Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard, who is also isolating and awaiting test results, said on Twitter.López-Gatell said the president's symptoms so far were basically a fever.Also Monday, the son of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim announced that his father has COVID-19 and is responding to treatment. Carlos Slim Domit wrote on Twitter that his father started having minor symptoms a week ago and sought care at one of the country’s foremost hospitals.The president announced the diagnosis Sunday on his official Twitter account, saying, “The symptoms are mild but I am already under medical treatment."The 67-year-old López Obrador had a “light” case of COVID-19 and was “isolating at home,” said José Luis Alomía Zegarra, Mexico’s director of epidemiology.On Monday, Interior Secretary Olga Sánchez Cordero said the president had designated her to hold the daily briefings until his return. She said López Obrador was well and strong.“He is carrying out his functions as president of the republic. He will continue keeping an eye on public affairs,” she said. Sánchez Cordero, who spoke without wearing a mask, said she was awaiting test results of her own.Despite his age and high blood pressure, López Obrador has not received a vaccine, though Mexico has received batches of Pfizer-BioNTech doses. He has said that health workers would be the first to get them. Under the government plan, people over 60 will start being vaccinated in February.López Obrador has maintained a busy travel schedule, taking commercial flights. He spent the weekend in San Luis Potosi and Nuevo Leon states, where he was photographed without a mask.He has also resisted locking down the economy, noting the devastating effect it would have on so many Mexicans who live day to day. The country registered 659 newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths Monday, bringing the total to 150,273. However, Mexico tests very few people, and government excess death estimates suggest the real death is closer to 195,000. The country has more than 1.7 million infections, which have pushed the health system of the capital city close to saturation.Early in the pandemic, asked how he was protecting Mexico, López Obrador took two religious amulets from his wallet and proudly showed them off.“The protective shield is the ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’” López Obrador said, reading off the inscription on the amulet, “Stop, enemy, for the Heart of Jesus is with me."In November, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, urged Mexico's leaders to be serious about the coronavirus and set examples for its citizens, saying that “Mexico is in bad shape” with the pandemic. He did not name López Obrador.“We have said it in general. Wearing a mask is important. Hygiene is important, and physical distancing is important, and we expect leaders to be examples,” he added.On Monday, the WHO chief said via Twitter: “I am sorry to hear that you have tested positive for #COVID19, President @lopezobrador— . I wish you swift recovery. Stay strong!”At the start of the pandemic López Obrador was criticized for leaning into crowds and giving hugs. The eternal campaigner, his political style has always been hands-on and personal. As the pandemic grew, he began limiting attendance to his events and maintaining his distance from supporters.But on Friday, López Obrador posted a photo of himself, Ebrard, a translator and former chief of staff Alfonso Romo gathered around a table for a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden. None was wearing a mask.As in other countries, the mask question has polarized the Mexican public and appeared to divide reaction to López Obrador's infection as well, said Ivonne Acuña Murillo, political science professor at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City. She noted a range of responses, from people wishing him a speedy recovery to those who appeared gleeful at his illness.López Obrador is known to be stubborn and more often doubles down on a position rather than retreat in the face of criticism.“He really is an individual of convictions and fixed ideas,” Acuña said. “He doesn’t easily change his positions and decisions.” Still, she thought it was more likely that he would begin wearing a mask than making a dramatic change in his optimistic discourse about the pandemic.Along a Mexico City boulevard Monday, Gabriel Osorio, who was wearing a mask and protective glasses with his suit and tie, said it was a risky situation.“We hope that he recovers and returns soon," Osorio said. "Also, I didn’t think that he took the correct measures to take care of himself.”Mexico City street vendor Eduardo Sanchez wished the president luck. “We’re all exposed to that,” he said through his mask. “Everyone, old or young, has to take care of themselves.”Other Latin American leaders who have tested positive for the coronavirus include Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, Guatemala’s Alejandro Giammattei, Honduras’ Juan Orlando Hernández and Bolivia’s then-interim President Jeanine Ánéz. All have recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-obrador-works-from-isolation-after-positive-covid-19-test-101611628069432.html
26-01-2021||World||Twitter users fact check misinformation in new trial program||Twitter Inc said on Monday it launched a pilot program that has users flag tweets that they believe are misleading and write notes to provide context.The project, called Birdwatch, is initially offered in the United States, the social media firm said in a blog post.Twitter and other social media companies have been under pressure to combat misinformation on their platforms. Twitter last year started adding labels and warnings about misinformation on the site, including about the Covid-19 pandemic and the US election.Birdwatch is on a separate section of Twitter https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch, and only pilot participants, who apply to the program, will write posts identifying and rebutting misinformation. Their notes will initially not be visible on Twitter for users outside of the pilot group but will be visible on the Birdwatch site.Twitter said it ultimately expects to have between 1,000 and 100,000 Birdwatchers who are being admitted on a rolling basis and who will not be paid."Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors," said Twitter Vice President of Product Keith Coleman in the blog post.Pilot participants can rate the helpfulness of notes from other contributors."We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn't dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors," said Coleman in the blog post."We believe this is a model worth trying," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-users-fact-check-misinformation-in-new-trial-program-101611626507444.html

Trump was issued less than an hour before an article of impeachment against the former president was to be delivered from the House to the Senate at the US Capitol. That will set in motion Trump’s second impeachment trial. Trump is accused of inciting the mob that broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6 as Congress was about to certify the election that he lost to Joe Biden.The letterhead on the statement indicated that the office will operate out of Palm Beach, where Trump moved after leaving the White House last week. The statement said the “office will be responsible for managing President Trump’s correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-opens-office-to-carry-on-agenda-of-his-administration-101611623669721.html
26-01-2021||World||US detects first case of Brazil coronavirus variant||The first case of a coronavirus variant that recently emerged in Brazil has been confirmed in the United States, health authorities in the state of Minnesota said Monday.The Minnesota Department of Health said in a statement that the "Public Health Laboratory has found the variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus known as the Brazil P.1 variant in a specimen from a Minnesota resident with recent travel history to Brazil."The patient, who is a resident of the Twin Cities metro area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, tested positive for Covid-19 in early January and was advised to isolate, the statement said. Further lab information revealed the case to be the Brazil variant.This case, as well as the discovery of three cases of the British coronavirus variant in Minnesota in the past few weeks, underscores "why it is so important to limit travel during a pandemic as much as possible," state epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said in the statement.President Joe Biden on Monday re-imposed a travel ban on most non-US citizens who have been in Britain, Brazil, Ireland and much of Europe.Biden also extended the ban to travelers who have recently been to South Africa amid warnings that new, more transmissible coronavirus variants are already establishing themselves in the United States.The new president last week tightened mask wearing rules and ordered quarantine for people flying into the United States, as he seeks to tackle the country's worsening coronavirus crisis.More than 25 million Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the US since the pandemic began, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally.The milestone was reached only five days after the US, the world's wealthiest and hardest-hit nation, recorded 400,000 deaths from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-detects-first-case-of-brazil-coronavirus-variant-101611623450296.html
26-01-2021||World||US Covid-19 numbers drop, but race against new strains heats up||Coronavirus deaths and cases per day in the US dropped markedly over the past couple of weeks but are still running at alarmingly high levels, and the effort to snuff out Covid-19 is becoming an ever more urgent race between the vaccine and the mutating virus.The government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the improvement in numbers around the country appears to reflect a “natural peaking and then plateauing” after a holiday surge, rather than the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December.The US is recording just under 3,100 deaths a day on average, down from more than 3,350 less than two weeks ago. New cases are averaging about 170,000 a day after peaking at almost 250,000 on Jan. 11. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has fallen to about 110,000 from a high of 132,000 on Jan. 7.States that have been hot spots in recent weeks such as California and Arizona have shown similar improvements during the same period.On Monday, California lifted regional stay-at-home orders in favor of county-by-county restrictions and ended a 10 p.m. curfew. The shift will allow restaurants and churches to resume outdoor operations and hair and nail salons to reopen in many places, though local officials could maintain stricter rules.Elsewhere, Minnesota school districts have begun bringing elementary students back for in-person learning. Chicago’s school system, the nation’s third-largest district, had hoped to bring teachers back Monday to prepare for students to return next month, but the teachers union has refused. Illinois announced that more counties will be able to offer limited indoor dining.“I don’t think the dynamics of what we’re seeing now with the plateauing is significantly influenced yet — it will be soon — but yet by the vaccine. I just think it’s the natural course of plateauing,” Fauci told NBC’s “Today.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, said that a predicted holiday surge was reduced by people traveling less than expected, and an increase in mask-wearing in response to spikes in infections has since helped bring the numbers down.Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said too few people have been vaccinated so far for that to have had a significant impact on virus trends. She said she can’t predict how long it will take for the vaccines' effects to be reflected in the numbers.Rivers said she is concerned that the more contagious variants of the virus could lead to a deadly resurgence later this year.“I think we were on track to have a good — or a better, at least — spring and summer, and I’m worried that the variants might be throwing us a curveball,” she said.Nationwide, about 19.3 million people, or less than 6% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of the vaccine, including about 3 million who have gotten the second shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 55% of the 41 million doses distributed to the states by the federal government have been injected into arms, by the CDC's count.The virus has killed over 419,000 Americans and infected more than 25 million, with a widely cited University of Washington model projecting the death toll will reach about 569,000 by May 1.And health experts have warned that the more contagious and possibly more deadly variant sweeping through Britain will probably become the dominant source of infection in the US by March. It has been reported in over 20 states so far. Other mutant versions are circulating in South Africa and Brazil. The variant from Brazil was detected for the first time in the US in a Minnesota resident who recently traveled to the South American country, state health officials said Monday.The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to mutate. The fear is that it will ultimately render the vaccines ineffective.To guard against the new variants, President Joe Biden on Monday added South Africa to the list of more than two dozen countries whose residents are subject to coronavirus-related limits on entering the US.Most non-U.S. citizens who have been to Brazil, Ireland, Britain and other European nations will be barred from entering the US under the rules re-imposed by Biden after President Donald Trump had moved to relax them.Fauci said scientists are already preparing to adjust Covid-19 vaccines to fight the mutated versions.He said there is “a very slight, modest diminution” of the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines against those variants, but “there’s enough cushion with the vaccines that we have that we still consider them to be effective" against both.Moderna, the maker of one of the two vaccines being used in the US, announced on Monday that it is beginning to test a possible booster dose against the South African variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the move was out of “an abundance of caution” after preliminary lab tests suggested its shot produced a weaker immune response to that variant.The vaccine rollout in the US has been marked by disarray and confusion, with states complaining in recent days about shortages and inadequate deliveries that have forced them to cancel mass vaccination events and tens of thousands of appointments.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said shortages are preventing the city from opening more large-scale vaccination sites.“Here you have New York City ready to vaccinate at the rate of a half-million New Yorkers a week, but we don’t have the vaccine to go with it,” de Blasio said. “A lot of other places in the country are ready to do so much more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-numbers-drop-but-race-against-new-strains-heats-up-101611623175614.html

This week, we expect to reach 100 million reported cases," Tedros said.He further said people should continue to adhere to precautionary measures to impede the spread of the coronavirus until the majority of the global population was vaccinated."There is so much all we can do to navigate our way out of this pandemic while we all wait our turn to be vaccinated: physical distancing, avoiding crowds, masks, hands hygiene, ventilation and more. You might be sick of hearing it. You might be sick of doing it, but this virus is not sick of us," the WHO chief added.The global number of Covid-19 cases reached 98,794,942, with the cumulative death toll rising to 2,124,193, according to the WHO data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-struggling-with-covid-19-vaccine-supply-distribution-says-who-expert-101611621827356.html

And thanks to the combined efforts of Britain, India and many other nations, we are on the road to success against Covid. So, I look forward to visiting India later this year, strengthening our friendship, and striving for the quantum leap in our relationship that Prime Minister Modi and I have both pledged to achieve,” he said.Addressing the Indian diaspora in the UK, he added,“All over the world, this virus is compelling people to stay apart, including family and friends in Britain and India, who form what Prime Minister Modi has called the “living bridge” between us. “But for now, let me wish everyone in India as well as those celebrating here in Britain, a very happy Republic Day,” the British prime minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-greets-india-on-r-day-says-working-together-to-eliminate-covid-101611620758554.html
26-01-2021||World||Election lawsuit citing ‘Lord of the Rings’ is tweaked after ‘a Bit of Rest’||Citing JRR Tolkien’s absent King Aragorn in a lawsuit seeking to nullify November’s US election might have been a bit much, supporters of Donald Trump acknowledged in a new filing after being ridiculed online.“This lawsuit does NOT seek to ‘install Donald Trump as president,’” because the whole election was illegal, they told the court on Monday to clarify their aims. Instead, the supporters said, they just want to “curb the power of a disputed Congress and President” while their case is heard.The suit, filed Jan. 18 in federal court in Waco, Texas, names House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, among others. It “merely seeks a return to the system of government contemplated by the founders of this nation -- a republic where representatives are elected by its citizens -- through a new election,” the group said.In a request for a temporary restraining order against the new government, the group cited Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” trilogy to argue that President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and Congress have no legitimate claim to governance.‘Rightful King of Gondor’“During the course of the epic trilogy, the rightful King of Gondor had abandoned the throne,” and so “a steward was appointed to manage Gondor until the return of the King, known as ‘Aragorn,’” it said. It asked the court to “appoint a group of special masters (the ‘Stewards’)” to check the power of “the illegitimate President until this Constitutional crisis can be resolved through a peaceful legal process.”Monday’s filing is marked by a tone of concern, or perhaps exasperation, at being misunderstood.“Salon.com and other media outlets, apparently due solely to counsel making a literary analogy (something not remotely uncommon to legal writing), have characterized this lawsuit as a mere fantasy,” the group said. “And perhaps they are right in a sense. Admittedly, Counsel has struggled greatly with the question of what is an appropriate remedy when an entire federal election has been conducted illegally.”The solution appears to have come after a brief recharge.“After getting a bit of rest and pondering it over the weekend,” the plaintiffs said, they had submitted an alternative proposed temporary restraining order -- one that “does not seek to appoint any ‘Stewards.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/election-lawsuit-citing-lord-of-the-rings-is-tweaked-after-a-bit-of-rest-101611621171080.html
26-01-2021||World||Donald Trump impeachment goes to Senate, testing his sway over GOP||Democrats marched the impeachment case against Donald Trump to the Senate Monday night for the start of his historic trial, but Republican senators were easing off their criticism of the former president and shunning calls to convict him over the deadly siege at the US Capitol.It's an early sign of Trump's enduring sway over the party.The House prosecutors delivered the sole impeachment charge of “incitement of insurrection," making the ceremonial walk across the Capitol to the Senate. But Republican denunciations of Trump have cooled since the Jan. 6 riot. Instead Republicans are presenting a tangle of legal arguments against the legitimacy of the trial and questions whether Trump's repeated demands to overturn Joe Biden's election really amounted to incitement.What seemed for some Democrats like an open-shut case that played out for the world on live television, as Trump encouraged a rally mob to “fight like hell" for his presidency, is running into a Republican Party that feels very differently. Not only are there legal concerns, but senators are wary of crossing the former president and his legions of followers who are their voters. Security remains tight at the Capitol.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said if Congress starts holding impeachment trials of former officials, what's next: “Could we go back and try President Obama?”Besides, he suggested, Trump has already been held to account. “One way in our system you get punished is losing an election.”Arguments in the Senate trial will begin the week of Feb. 8, and the case against Trump, the first former president to face impeachment trial, will test a political party still sorting itself out for the post-Trump era. Republican senators are balancing the demands of deep-pocketed donors who are distancing themselves from Trump and voters who demand loyalty to him. One Republican, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, announced Monday he would not seek reelection in 2022 citing the polarized political atmosphere.For Democrats the tone, tenor and length of the upcoming trial, so early in Biden's presidency, poses its own challenge, forcing them to strike a balance between their vow to hold Trump accountable and their eagerness to deliver on the new administration's priorities following their sweep of control of the House, Senate and White House.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans appear more eager to argue over trial process than the substance of the impeachment case against Trump, perhaps to avoid casting judgment on the former president's “role in fomenting the despicable attack” on the Capitol.He said there's only one question "senators of both parties will have to answer before God and their own conscience: Is former President Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection against the United States?”Failing to conduct the trial would amount to a “get-out-jail-free card” for other officials accused of wrongdoing on their way out the door, Schumer said.On Monday, it was learned that Chief Justice John Roberts is not expected to preside at the trial, as he did during Trump’s first impeachment, potentially affecting the gravitas of the proceedings. The shift is said to be in keeping with protocol because Trump is no longer in office.Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D- Vt., who serves in the largely ceremonial role of Senate president pro-tempore, is set to preside.Leaders in both parties agreed to a short delay in the proceedings that serves their political and practical interests, even as National Guard troops remain at the Capitol amid security threats on lawmakers ahead of the trial.The start date gives Trump’s new legal team time to prepare its case, while also providing more than a month's distance from the passions of the bloody riot. For the Democratic-led Senate, the intervening weeks provide prime time to confirm some of Biden’s key Cabinet nominees.Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., questioned how his colleagues who were in the Capitol that day could see the insurrection as anything other than a “stunning violation” of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power.“It is a critical moment in American history,” Coons said Sunday in an interview.An early vote to dismiss the trial probably would not succeed, given that Democrats now control the Senate. Still, the mounting Republican opposition to the proceedings indicates that many GOP senators would eventually vote to acquit Trump. Democrats would need the support of 17 Republicans — a high bar — to convict him.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said he doesn't believe the Senate has the constitutional authority to convict Trump after he has left office.“I think a lot of Americans are going to think it’s strange that the Senate is spending its time trying to convict and remove from office a man who left office a week ago,” Cotton said.Democrats reject that argument, pointing to an 1876 impeachment of a secretary of war who had already resigned and to opinions by many legal scholars. Democrats also say that a reckoning of the first invasion of the Capitol since the War of 1812, perpetrated by rioters egged on by a president as Electoral College votes were being tallied, is necessary to ensure such a siege never happens again.A few GOP senators have agreed with Democrats, though not close to the number that will be needed to convict Trump.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said he believes "what is being alleged and what we saw, which is incitement to insurrection, is an impeachable offense.” Romney said, “If not, what is?”But Romney, the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump when the Senate acquitted the then-president in last year’s trial, appears to be an outlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-impeachment-goes-to-senate-testing-his-sway-over-gop-101611620799468.html

Latin America's largest nation has over 217,000 Covid-19 deaths, second in the world after the United States.With few vaccines to inoculate Brazil's 210 million people and a rampant second wave, the country now finds itself almost entirely reliant on the Sinovac vaccine that Bolsonaro, a China hawk, had previously ridiculed.Butantan has a contract with Sinovac for 46 million doses. The first 6 million were ready for use and have been distributed around Brazil. The rest have to be completed by Butantan.Brazil's federally-funded Fiocruz Institute, which has a deal with AstraZeneca to produce up to 100 million doses of its vaccine, said on Monday it expects China to send the active ingredient needed to make the shots locally around Feb. 8.It had previously said it could deliver finished doses in March, but now says it will await the Chinese shipment before giving a more specific time frame."It is not possible to disclose a detailed production schedule at this time," Fiocruz said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-thanks-china-for-fast-tracking-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-101611619929346.html
26-01-2021||World||China tests Joe Biden’s will on strategic flash point of Taiwan||China’s decision to fly more than a dozen military aircraft, including strategic bombers, into the Taiwan Strait this weekend sends an early warning to President Joe Biden on one of the most volatile issues between Beijing and Washington.The sortie by eight Xian H-6K bombers and five other planes Saturday was the third-largest such incursion by People Liberation Army aircraft in the past year, according to Taiwanese Defense Ministry data. Moreover, H-6K bombers are believed to be capable of carrying land-attack cruise missiles that give Chinese forces the ability to strike overseas bases from a safe distance.The US State Department issued a statement affirming Washington’s “rock-solid” commitment to Taipei and urging Beijing “to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure.” China should “instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.The incursion sent “a clear signal to the Biden administration that China stands ready to defend its sovereignty over Taiwan and that it is a red line that the U.S. should not dare to cross,” said Yongwook Ryu, assistant professor of East Asian international relations at at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “We will see quite a bit of jostling between China and the U.S. over Taiwan in the early phase of the Biden administration, as the two giants seek to figure out where they can cooperate and test each other’s resolve.”The 70-year-old dispute over Taiwan has re-emerged since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party president, as its president in 2016. China’s Xi Jinping, who has vowed to work toward unifying the two sides, has cut off communication with Taipei and launched a pressure campaign over Tsai’s refusal to accept that both sides belong to “One China.”Former US President Donald Trump -- propelled by his own battles with China -- dramatically expanded ties with Taipei, approving the first fighter jet sale in 30 years and the most senior visit by a U.S. cabinet official since Washington switched ties from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. China has pushed back by carrying out frequent military exercises near the island and, in August, firing “carrier killer” ballistic missiles into the South China Sea.Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Monday that the U.S. planned to review Trump’s policies while consulting with allies and lawmakers in Washington to build consensus on a China strategy. “Beijing is now challenging our security, prosperity and values in significant ways that require a new U.S. approach,” Psaki said.Psaki’s remarks came in response to Xi’s speech at a virtual World Economic Forum in which he urged world powers to shun an “outdated Cold-War mentality” and defended China’s right to follow its own path. Earlier, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing that the U.S. should “refrain from sending wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces, to avoid harm to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”The State Department statement placed the onus on China to re-engage with Taiwan, while indicating a desire to preserve the longstanding ambiguity about Taiwan’s status. The U.S. pledged to stand by existing agreements with China and spoke of the interests of the “people on Taiwan,” rather than the people “of Taiwan.”“The U.S. wants to prevent China from miscalculating, so it is likely to continue to make clear U.S. interests in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and its resolve to oppose China’s intimidation of Taiwan,” said Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser on Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has advised both the State and Defense departments.Chinese state media paid little attention to the State Department remarks, an article in the Global Times newspaper cited its reference to upholding existing agreements as evidence the U.S. was returning to a more “mainstream” Taiwan policy. The Communist Party newspaper described the PLA drills as part of existing training plans and not intended as a signal to the US.Meanwhile, a US aircraft carrier group entered the disputed South China Sea to “conduct routine operations,” the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Saturday. It was unclear whether the USS Theodore Roosevelt’s trip was intended a specific signal, since such voyages are usually planned long in advance.China has repeatedly come up in calls between top Biden aides and their allies in recent days. Newly confirmed US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin agreed in a call Sunday with Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi to oppose any attempts to change the status quo in the East or South China seas, according to a Japanese Defense Ministry statement.Alexander Huang, a professor of international strategic relations at Tamkang University, speculated that Xi was trying to test Biden’s limits.“Xi is looking to see how the new Biden administration will respond to Chinese behavior,” Huang said. “Whether they believe that the Biden administration will take a strong stance on Taiwan or a soft and indecisive one, they will take lessons from that as they begin a wide range of dialogues on issues from trade to climate change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-joe-biden-s-will-on-strategic-flash-point-of-taiwan-101611620451499.html
26-01-2021||World||Britain to help other countries track down coronavirus variants||Britain will share its genomic sequencing capabilities with other countries to help quicker identify new variants of the coronavirus in places with less ability to do so, its health ministry said on Tuesday.New variants of the coronavirus have alarmed scientists, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned the prospect of a "vaccine-busting" variant could mean that lockdown measures are needed for longer and new travel restrictions are introduced.Britain said it had carried out more than half the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to a global database, and would launch a New Variant Assessment Platform which could be used for coronavirus variants and also future pandemics."Our New Variant Assessment Platform will help us better understand this virus and how it spreads, and will also boost global capacity to understand coronavirus, so we're all better prepared for whatever lies ahead," Health Minister Matt Hancock will say in a speech at Chatham House, according to advance extracts released by the health ministry.The three major variants of concern identified so far were discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. All three variants are thought to be more transmissible.The variant discovered in Britain could also be associated with higher mortality, although the evidence around that is uncertain.Scientist have also highlighted particular concern that vaccines might not work as well against the variants found in South Africa and Brazil.Moderna said on Monday it believe its COVID-19 vaccine protects against the British and South African variants, although it will test a new booster shot aimed at the South Africa variant after concluding the antibody response could be diminished.Britain's health minister and health officials have said they believe the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines being rolled out in the country work against the UK variant.

And in light of the contagious variant B1351, South Africa has been added to the restricted list."She said beginning Tuesday international travellers coming into the US must provide proof of a negative test within three days of travel to airlines prior to departure.Noting the danger posed by the pandemic, the proclamation said, "The Federal Government must act swiftly and aggressively to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The national emergency caused by the Covid-19 outbreak in the United States continues to pose a grave threat to our health and security."Last week, Biden had announced that travellers flying to the US from foreign countries will be required to mandatorily quarantine upon their arrival and pass a Covid-19 test before departure.Prior to this, he had mandated wearing face masks and observing social distancing on government property, urging "every American to mask up for the next 100 days."The new administration has also predicted that the US death toll will top 500,000 next month from its current count of nearly 419,000, adding that wearing masks is the "the single best thing we can do."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-sign-order-keeping-travel-restrictions-on-europe-says-white-house-101611618752355.html
26-01-2021||World||US virus numbers drop, but race against new strains heats up||Coronavirus deaths and cases per day in the U.S. dropped markedly over the past couple of weeks but are still running at alarmingly high levels, and the effort to snuff out Covid-19 is becoming an ever more urgent race between the vaccine and the mutating virus.The government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the improvement in numbers around the country appears to reflect a “natural peaking and then plateauing” after a holiday surge, rather than the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December.The US is recording just under 3,100 deaths a day on average, down from more than 3,350 less than two weeks ago. New cases are averaging about 170,000 a day after peaking at almost 250,000 on Jan. 11. The number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients has fallen to about 110,000 from a high of 132,000 on Jan. 7.States that have been hot spots in recent weeks such as California and Arizona have shown similar improvements during the same period.On Monday, California lifted regional stay-at-home orders in favor of county-by-county restrictions and ended a 10 p.m. curfew. The shift will allow restaurants and churches to resume outdoor operations and hair and nail salons to reopen in many places, though local officials could maintain stricter rules.Elsewhere, Minnesota school districts have begun bringing elementary students back for in-person learning. Chicago’s school system, the nation’s third-largest district, had hoped to bring teachers back Monday to prepare for students to return next month, but the teachers union has refused. Illinois announced that that more counties will be able to offer limited indoor dining.“I don’t think the dynamics of what we’re seeing now with the plateauing is significantly influenced yet — it will be soon — but yet by the vaccine. I just think it’s the natural course of plateauing,” Fauci told NBC’s “Today.”Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, said that a predicted holiday surge was reduced by people traveling less than expected, and an increase in mask-wearing in response to spikes in infections has since helped bring the numbers down.Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said too few people have been vaccinated so far for that to have had a significant impact on virus trends. She said she can’t predict how long it will take for the vaccines' effects to be reflected in the numbers.Rivers said she is concerned that the more contagious variants of the virus could lead to a deadly resurgence later this year.“I think we were on track to have a good — or a better, at least — spring and summer, and I’m worried that the variants might be throwing us a curveball,” she said.Nationwide, about 18.5 million people, or less than 6% of the U.S. population, have received at least one dose of vaccine, including about 3 million who have gotten the second shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only slightly more than half of the 41 million doses distributed to the states by the federal government have been injected into arms, by the CDC's count.The virus has killed over 419,000 Americans and infected more than 25 million, with a widely cited University of Washington model projecting the death toll will reach about 569,000 by May 1.And health experts have warned that the more contagious and possibly more deadly variant sweeping through Britain will probably become the dominant source of infection in the U.S. by March. It has been reported in over 20 states so far. Other mutant versions are circulating in South Africa and Brazil. The variant from Brazil was detected for the first time in the U.S. in a Minnesota resident who recently traveled to the South American country, state health officials said Monday.The more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to mutate. The fear is that it will ultimately render the vaccines ineffective.To guard against the new variants, President Joe Biden on Monday added South Africa to the list of more than two dozen countries whose residents are subject to coronavirus-related limits on entering the U.S.Most non-U.S. citizens who have been to Brazil, Ireland, Britain and other European nations will be barred from entering the U.S. under the rules re-imposed by Biden after President Donald Trump had moved to relax them.Fauci said scientists are already preparing to adjust COVID-19 vaccines to fight the mutated versions.He said there is “a very slight, modest diminution” of the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against those variants, but “there’s enough cushion with the vaccines that we have that we still consider them to be effective" against both.Moderna, the maker of one of the two vaccines being used in the U.S., announced on Monday that it is beginning to test a possible booster dose against the South African variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said the move was out of “an abundance of caution” after preliminary lab tests suggested its shot produced a weaker immune response to that variant.The vaccine rollout in the U.S. has been marked by disarray and confusion, with states complaining in recent days about shortages and inadequate deliveries that have forced them to cancel mass vaccination events and tens of thousands of appointments.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said shortages are preventing the city from opening more large-scale vaccination sites.“Here you have New York City ready to vaccinate at the rate of a half-million New Yorkers a week, but we don’t have the vaccine to go with it,” de Blasio said. “A lot of other places in the country are ready to do so much more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-virus-numbers-drop-but-race-against-new-strains-heats-up-101611618919493.html
26-01-2021||World||AstraZeneca denies report vaccine less effective in elderly||AstraZeneca denied on Monday its Covid-19 vaccine is not very effective for people over 65, after German media reports said officials fear the vaccine may not be approved in the European Union for use in the elderly.German daily papers Handelsblatt and Bild said in separate reports the vaccine - co-developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University - had an efficacy of 8% or less than 10%, respectively, in those over 65.German officials were concerned that the vaccine may not receive approval from the EU's medicines authority EMA for use in those over 65, Bild said in its online edition.The reports mark another potential issue for AstraZeneca, which told the EU on Friday it could not meet agreed supply targets up to the end of March after running into vaccine production problems.Frustration was already growing among European countries because Pfizer and partner BioNTech announced a temporary slowdown in vaccine supplies earlier in January.In a written response, AstraZeneca described the German media reports saying its Covid-19 vaccine was shown to have a very low efficacy in the elderly as "completely incorrect".It said Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation supported the vaccine's use in the elderly. It also said that a strong immune responses to the vaccine had been shown in blood analysis of elderly trial participants.Britain on Dec. 30 became the first country to approve the two-shot vaccine and did not impose an upper age limit. It has so far focused on the elderly and healthcare workers for its immunisation campaign.AstraZeneca's main trial in Britain started testing on adults no older than 55 because it initially focused on healthcare personnel and frontline workers in active duty.Elderly trial participants were recruited later so that infections, which are needed to arrive at reliable efficacy data, were also coming in later.Researchers at Oxford University said in a paper published in medical journal The Lancet on Dec. 8, when details of key vaccine trials held in Britain and Brazil were released, that efficacy data based on infections in the elderly were still limited."Efficacy data in these cohorts are currently limited by the small number of (infection) cases, but additional data will be available in future analyses," they said in the paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-denies-report-vaccine-less-effective-in-elderly-101611618932361.html
26-01-2021||World||Jill Biden signals she'll be more active as first lady||Five days into her new role, Jill Biden signaled Monday that she'll be a more active first lady, with a trio of virtual appearances before governors' spouses, young Latinos and library officials.She also used the meetings to promote President Joe Biden's call for national unity and his $1.9 trillion pandemic relief proposal, which is facing resistance from some Republicans lawmakers.Jill Biden's early moves seemed designed to signal that she intends to be more active than her predecessor, Melania Trump. Mrs. Trump often allowed weeks to pass between her public appearances.Mrs. Trump also was largely absent from Washington in the opening months of Donald Trump's administration. She returned to New York shortly after the inauguration in January 2017 to live with their son, Barron, as he finished out the school year uninterrupted.On Monday, Jill Biden took on the role of top surrogate for the president, encouraging unity and promising the administration would listen to all voices.“We can’t do this alone," she told the governors' spouses meeting over Zoom. "Congress will need to pass the legislation and, ultimately, it will take state and local leadership.”Biden pushed the same message to a Zoom meeting, or “charla,” with young Latinos.“We need you in this effort,” she told them. “No one can speak to your communities like you can, and you know how much this matters.” Blacks and Latinos are among those suffering the most severe economic and life-and-death consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.In a videotaped message to the American Library Association's midwinter virtual conference, the first lady pledged that “empathy, resilience, diversity, learning and trust” will be the “foundation of the administration that we will build.”“We're going to invest in all communities. We going to listen to all Americans,” she said. “We're going to work to heal the pain that has come from this time of crisis.”Two days after last Wednesday's inauguration, Biden visited the Whitman-Walker Health clinic to highlight services for cancer patients. Afterward, she made an unannounced stop at the U.S. Capitol to deliver chocolate chip cookies to National Guard members as a thank you for providing security for the swearing-in.Jennifer Pickens, an author who studies the White House, said Biden, 69, had “hit the ground running, as she should.”“She has had the benefit of being married to a statesman of nearly 50 years and has come to the role of first lady after spending eight years as the second lady, something we have not had since first lady Barbara Bush,” Pickens said.Barbara Bush was married to George H.W. Bush, who spent eight years as vice president to Ronald Reagan before he was elected president in 1988. Bush lost his reelection bid in 1992.Joe Biden was a U.S. senator for 36 years, followed by eight years as vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-signals-she-ll-be-more-active-as-first-lady-101611618286421.html
26-01-2021||World||US justice department probes if staff tried to alter election outcome||The Justice Department’s inspector general has opened an investigation into whether department staff members sought to use the agency to alter the outcome of the 2020 election and overturn President Joe Biden’s victory.The department didn’t say what prompted Inspector General Michael Horowitz to open the inquiry, but it came after the New York Times reported that Jeffrey Clark, the acting head of its civil division, had discussed a plan with former President Donald Trump to pressure politicians in Georgia to overturn the state’s results.Clark’s name wasn’t mentioned in the department’s two-paragraph release on Monday. He resigned from the Justice Department on Jan. 14, less than a week before the end of Trump’s presidency, and didn’t have a new job lined up at the time. The Times reported on Friday that Clark’s efforts included an attempt to remove then acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who had deflected Trump’s attempts to use the Justice Department in a baseless attack on the election results.The inspector general’s office “is making this statement, consistent with DOJ policy, to reassure the public that an appropriate agency is investigating the allegations,” spokeswoman Stephanie Logan said in a statement Monday.Clark acknowledged meeting with Trump but said he didn’t devise a plan to oust Rosen, or “formulate recommendations for action based on factual inaccuracies.”“There was a candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president,” he told Bloomberg Law on Friday, adding that legal privileges prevented him from “divulging specifics regarding the conversation.”The Justice Department’s role in Trump’s months-long effort to reverse the results of the election adds to a growing list of examples of the former president’s bold attempts to pressure government officials to ignore the law in order to throw out the will of voters.Clark’s alleged role in this effort has been cited by Democrats in Congress who are seeking to convict Trump in a Senate impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol. They have vowed to open their own investigation.Before stepping down last month, Attorney General William Barr, known as a Trump loyalist, told the Associated Press that he had “not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”Horowitz, who was nominated for the watchdog post by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2012, has overseen numerous politically charged investigations into the conduct of Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, including fallout from the probe into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Investigations by the inspector general, who can make referrals to criminal authorities, can take years to conclude and for the results to be made public.The investigation into potential meddling in the 2020 presidential election is limited to current and former Justice Department employees, according to the statement Monday.(Adds background on election-meddling allegations in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-department-probes-if-staff-tried-to-alter-election-outcome-101611615888767.html
26-01-2021||World||Italian PM Giuseppe Conte to resign on Tuesday to chart comeback||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will resign on Tuesday morning to avoid a damaging defeat in the Senate and maneuver to return at the head of a new government.Conte will preside over a cabinet meeting at 9 a.m. in Rome and then head to President Sergio Mattarella’s office to formally step down, according to a government statement.The idea is that by preemptively offering his resignation to Mattarella, who oversees the formation of ruling coalitions, Conte will then be asked to take another shot at putting together a government, according to officials who asked not to be named discussing confidential deliberations.The Five Star Movement, the biggest force in the current parliament, and lawmakers of the center-left Democratic Party had both been urging the premier to resign after a junior ally ditched the alliance, officials said.The trigger was a vote in the Senate later this week in which Conte probably wouldn’t have had a majority. Five Star has plunged in the polls and stands to lose the most in early elections if the government collapses and Mattarella decides they are unavoidable.Meanwhile, the Italian Treasury is starting to factor in a bigger hit to the country’s battered public finances this year as another extended lockdown holds back the recovery, a senior government official said.Treasury models suggest the budget deficit may reach as much as 9.2% of output this year, the official said. The government is also looking at a deteriorating outlook for growth and could see the economy expand as little as 4.5% in a worst-case scenario, according to the official.The prospect of spiraling borrowing and political instability in a country that’s already the European Union’s problem child is likely to prompt concern in Brussels and Frankfurt, where officials spent much of 2020 unlocking fiscal and monetary aid to help Italy and countries similarly crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.Any government in power will also have to decide how to spend the EU’s recovery package and speed up the pace of vaccinations.Conte’s NemesisAfter resisting pressure to quit following the defection earlier this month of the Italy Alive party led by former Premier Matteo Renzi, Conte appears to have concluded that resigning now and coming back to head a “unity government” is his best option, officials said.There is also the fact that Renzi and Conte have a long-standing dislike of each other and have been ill at ease in a coalition of mutual convenience.Conte could seek to forge a new coalition. That might include centrists, unaffiliated lawmakers, Renzi’s Italy Alive party or members of it, as well as lawmakers from Silvio Berlusconi’s center-right Forza Italia, the officials said.While some of the premier’s allies have raised the prospect of early elections to resolve the impasse, coalition leaders still see this is an unlikely option, with some fearing that a vote would usher in the center-right opposition led by Matteo Salvini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-giuseppe-conte-to-resign-on-tuesday-to-chart-comeback-101611615697806.html
26-01-2021||World||Biden bullish on Covid vaccines, says open to 1.5 million shots daily||President Joe Biden on Monday appeared to boost his goal for coronavirus vaccinations in his first 100 days in office, suggesting that the nation could soon be vaccinating 1.5 million Americans on average per day.Biden signaled his increasing bullishness on the pace of vaccinations after signing an executive order to boost government purchases from US manufacturers. It was among a flurry of moves by Biden during his first full week to show he's taking swift action to heal an ailing economy as talks with Congress over a $1.9 trillion stimulus package showed few signs of progress.Biden reiterated that he believes the country is in a precarious spot and and that relief is urgently needed, even as he dismissed the possibility of embracing a scaled-down bill to secure passage faster. Among the features of the stimulus plan are a national vaccination program, aid to reopen schools, direct payments of $1,400 to individuals and financial relief for state and local governments.“Time is of the essence," Biden said. “I am reluctant to cherry-pick and take out one or two items here."Biden's new vaccination target comes after he and his aides faced criticism for the 100 million goal in his first 100 days in office. The US has exceeded a pace of 1 million doses per day over the last week.“I think we may be able to get that to ... 1.5 million a day, rather than 1 million a day," Biden said, “but we have to meet that goal of a million a day.”Biden added that he expects widespread availability of the vaccines for Americans by spring, with the US “well on our way to herd immunity” necessary to end the pandemic by summer. Even so, he warned the nation was going to be “in this for a while, and could see between "600,000 and 660,000 deaths before we begin to turn the corner in a major way.”As of Sunday, the federal government had distributed 41.4 million vaccine doses to states and other jurisdictions. Of that, 21.8 million doses had been administered, or about 53%. About 3.2 million people had received their full two-dose vaccination, a little less than 1% of the population. That’s according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Already, more than 420,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus.Biden's team held a call Sunday to outline the stimulus plan with at least a dozen senators, while the president also privately talked with lawmakers.“There's an urgency to moving it forward, and he certainly believes there has to be progress in the next couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. She warned that action needed to be taken before the U.S. reaches an “unemployment cliff” in March, when long-term unemployment benefits expire for millions of Americans.But Republicans on Capitol Hill were not joining in the push for immediate action.One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said after Sunday's call that “it seems premature to be considering a package of this size and scope.” Collins described the additional funding for vaccinations as useful while cautioning that any economic aid should be more targeted.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Monday that “any further action should be smart and targeted, not just an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don’t need it.”Biden sought to downplay the rhetoric from GOP lawmakers, saying, “I have been doing legislative negotiations for a large part of my life. I know how the system works."“This is just the process beginning," he added. "No one wants to give up on their position until there’s no other alternative.”Monday’s order will likely take 45 days or longer to make its way through the federal bureaucracy, during which time wrangling with Congress could produce a new aid package. That would be a follow-up to the roughly $4 trillion previously approved to tackle the economic and medical fallout from the coronavirus.The order was aimed at increasing factory jobs, which have slumped by 540,000 since the pandemic began last year.“America can’t sit on the sidelines in the race for the future," Biden said before signing the order in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. “We’re ready, despite all we’re facing."Biden’s order would modify the rules for the Buy American program, making it harder for contractors to qualify for a waiver and sell foreign-made goods to federal agencies. It also changes rules so that more of a manufactured good’s components must originate from US factories. America-made goods would also be protected by an increase in the government’s threshold and price preferences, the difference in price over which the government can buy a foreign product.It's an order that channels Biden's own blue-collar persona and his promise to use the government's market power to support its industrial base, an initiative that former President Donald Trump also attempted with executive actions and import taxes.“Thanks to past presidents granting a trade-pact waiver to Buy American, today billions in US tax dollars leak offshore every year because the goods and companies from 60 other countries are treated like they are American for government procurement purposes," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch and a critic of past trade agreements.While Trump also issued a series of executive actions and tariffs with the goal of boosting manufacturing, he didn't attempt to rewrite the guidance for what constitutes a US-made component or tighten the process for granting exemptions to buy foreign goods, a key difference from Biden’s agenda, Biden's administration said.The order also has elements that apply to the separate Buy America program that applies to highways and bridges. It aims to open up government procurement contracts to new companies by scouting potential contractors. The order would create a public website for companies that received waivers to sell foreign goods to the government, so that US manufacturers can have more information and be in a more competitive position.Past presidents have promised to revitalize manufacturing as a source of job growth and achieved mixed results. The government helped save the automotive sector after the 2008 financial crisis, but the number of factory jobs has been steadily shrinking over the course of four decades.The number of US manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979 at 19.5 million and now totals 12.3 million, according to the Labor Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bullish-on-covid-vaccines-says-open-to-1-5-million-shots-daily-101611615446587.html

26-01-2021||India||'Farmer organisations not in control of agitation now': Haryana CM||Haryana chief minister, Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday urged the agitating farmer organisations to give a deep thought to where the agitation is headed.In a late evening statement, the chief minister said Tuesday’s events have shown that the farmers organisations were not in control of the agitation any longer. “The leadership has passed on to hands who do not subscribe to the same set of beliefs that they do. Let the farmers give a deep thought to where the agitation is headed,’’ Khattar said referring to the “sad events” at the Red Fort.The CM said the Council of Ministers, in a specially convened meeting, has appealed to all farmers, particularly those from Haryana, to return to their homes. He said that unsavoury events on Tuesday deserved to be condemned in the strongest words. “Democracy offers space for dissent and differences. But no Indian, whatever the difference of opinion or difference of approach, can ever justify the action of hosting a flag other than the National Flag on the ramparts of the Red Fort. Our martyrs gave their life and blood to preserve and protect the nation for all of us, not to make a spectacle of it,’’ the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-organisations-not-in-control-of-agitation-now-haryana-cm-101611684962579.html

We acknowledge the key role of a unified GCC in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region," he added.Reiterating India's stance for a "just and comprehensive solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", he said that India supports "President Mahmoud Abbas' call to hold an international peace conference with the participation of all relevant parties to achieve the vision of a sovereign and independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel."Speaking on the commencement of talks between Israel and Lebanon, Tirumurti said that India looks forward to the formation of the government in Lebanon as it will "offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon".During the Open Debate, India also emphasised on its proposal to supply vaccines to the Middle East region to help the countries combat the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unsc-india-welcomes-elections-in-palestine-calls-for-free-fair-polls-101611681952668.html
26-01-2021||India||Nagaland Governor puts NSCN in line of fire in Republic Day speech||Nagaland Governor RN Ravi on Tuesday put the Isak-Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) in his line of fire saying the Centre’s initiative to resolve the Naga political issue was yet to bear fruit due to “unrealistic intransigence of some people” who are unwilling to forsake the politics by gun.In his Republic Day address at the Civil Secretariat Plaza in Kohima, Ravi who is also the central government’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks said people of the state have been unable to reap optimum benefit because some extra constitutional entities in the guise of espousing the Naga national cause have queered the pitch for the people and the government, keeping peace and progress at bay.Without naming the NSCN-IM, Ravi said, “The latest initiative since the last 24 years could not fructify as yet due to unrealistic intransigence of some people who are unwilling to forsake the politics by gun.”The governor’s remark comes against the backdrop of an impasse in the negotiations on the Naga political issue between the Centre and the NSCN-IM over the latter’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution. The NSCN-IM has been holding peace talks with the government of India since 1997.The politics by gun has fragmented the Naga society, pitting neighbours against each other and tribes against tribes, it did not even spare the Church for their honest initiatives to usher peace in this land, Ravi said.“The unrealistic, self-destructive and divisive politics has exhausted the people of Nagaland. The primary stakeholders have made their positions abundantly clear that the era of gun must end without further delay and enduring peace must be restored. They have made it clear that unresolved issues, if any, be pursued through dialogue post-settlement,” he asserted.Towards this, he appreciated the initiative of the state government in holding a comprehensive meeting with broad spectrum tribal and civil society on October 15, 2020 that reiterated the popular sentiment that the armed groups must come together to facilitate “One-Solution” for the sake of the people.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi loves the Naga people and holds them in high esteem. He is committed to restoring an enduring peace in the region with utmost regard to the wishes of the people. He is anxious to ensure that while India is taking giant leaps to the Moon and Mars, our people of Nagaland are not left behind,” the governor said.He went on to say that there must be no doubt in any quarter that Nagaland is and shall remain an integral part of India“On this auspicious occasion, I earnestly urge those friends who are still standing between the people and the peace to see the writings on the wall. The people of Nagaland and peace can no longer be kept a hostage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-governor-puts-nscn-in-line-of-fire-in-republic-day-speech-101611680938160.html
26-01-2021||India||BJP leaders meet to discuss violence in Delhi, farmers' agitation||Senior leaders of the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) went into a huddle on Tuesday to discuss the implications of the violence that broke out in the national capital. Farmers protesting against the farm laws broke police barricades to reach Red Fort where they hoisted a flag sacred to the Sikhs. The party also underlined that there are similarities in how the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the farm laws have unfolded.Party chief JP Nadda, general secretary BL Santhosh and few other senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP and party general secretary Arun Singh, were present for the meeting at the BJP headquarters, said a person aware of the developments.The RSS also condemned the violence. In a statement, RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said, “The violence and disturbances unleashed in Delhi today on the sacred Republic Day is extremely painful and deplorable. Especially the unfortunate act at the historic Red Fort, it is an insult to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for freedom and national integrity. The RSS appeals to all countrymen to rise above political and ideological differences and strive for peace as a priority.”Also read: Explained - As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers wantNo details were shared about the meeting, although a functionary aware of the details said the party leaders see similarities in Tuesday’s protests that broke out within hours of the Republic Day parade, with the protests that engulfed the city at the same time last year when protestors gathered to demand the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act.Last year, when then US president Donald Trump was in India, protests broke out between pro and anti-CAA groups in the national capital leading to over dozen of deaths and heavy casualties.A senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the protests have “corroborated” what the party has been alleging— that the protests have been infiltrated by “anti-national elements”.The functionary quoted above said there is a sense in the party that the protests are being fuelled by those with “vested interests” and the government’s outreach efforts are being “stonewalled”.“The timing of the protests, the way the so-called farmers have reacted to the government’s outreach is indicative of it being the handiwork of those with vested interests. Why do they refuse to interact with the committee appointed by the Supreme Court?” said the functionary.While the opposition parties, including the Congress, have alleged that the farm laws were passed without adequate discussion in Parliament and the government did not heed the demand to send the bills to a select committee, the BJP claims that the opposition is creating deliberate misinformation about the laws just as it did with the CAA, which only seeks to fast-track citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbourhood.“When the CAA was passed we asked the protestors to show even one person whose citizenship rights had been taken away. Similarly, now we are ready to argue on the merits of the farm laws to prove it does not take away anyone’s land. But a concerted misinformation campaign has been started about the farm laws just as it was about the CAA,” said BJP’s national spokesperson RP Singh.He said the blame for prolonging the farmer’s protest and the violence that erupted on Tuesday rests with the “lumpen left and the ultra-left intellectuals”.The protests come at a time when the party has begun preparations for electoral battles in four states—Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala- and the Union territory of Pudducherry. The BJP has been facing flak for the farm laws that the protesting farmers have dubbed as pro-corporate and for being unable to break the logjam. It was also accused of dubbing the protesting farmers as secessionists.BJP leaders condemned the violence that broke out. Former national general secretary P Murlidhar Rao said the violence is “shameful and not acceptable”.“In Indian democracy u can have a mobilisation challenging govt on policies..sometimes it may appear as humiliating for d leaders who’re at helms but u can't have a situation where its challenging d sovereignty of country n questioning d spirit of Indian Republic,” he tweeted.Ram Madhav, also a former national general secretary, attacked the Congress for fostering the protests. “After peddling all sorts of falsehoods about farm law reforms n provoking farmers into aggressive action, the Indian versions of Trump like Rahul n ilk are now demonstrating pseudo-indignation at violence. They r equally responsible for whatever happened in Delhi today,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-meet-to-discuss-violence-in-delhi-farmers-agitation-101611680457433.html

The message is clear that the country's people are anguished with the government. In such a situation, the Modi government will also have to shun arrogance and head the pleas of farmers," the AICC general secretary said in a statement."Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have to shed his arrogance and tread the path of 'Rajdharma'. This is the true message of the 72nd Republic Day. Without any further delay, all three anti-farming black laws will have to be withdrawn. This is also the call of 62 crore 'annadatas' of the country," he said.The Congress leader also hailed the farm unions for dissociating from the day's violent incidents and hoped that they would follow the path of peace and non-violence to achieve their goal."Today, the Congress party and the entire country is pained by the violence and unruly incidents in Delhi. There is no place for such incidents in a democracy," he added."The agitators must keep their goal in mind. Non-violence and peace have remained the biggest strength of this farmer agitation. We sincerely hope that this farmer-labourer alliance will pledge to remain committed to a peaceful and non-violent struggle for the repeal of the three three anti-agriculture black laws," Surjewala said.He also criticised the government for holding 10 rounds of talks and yet not resolving the deadlock."Is it right for the prime minister to not give a healing touch despite the death of 175 farmers? Is the Modi government's policy of tiring out the farmers good for the country," Surjewala asked.A tractor parade by the farmer unions meant to highlight their demands dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital during the day as hordes of rampaging protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult -- hoisting a religious flag from the rampart of Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's tricolour.Tens of thousands of protesters clashed with police in multiple places, leading to chaos in well-known landmarks of Delhi and suburbs, amid waves of violence that ebbed and flowed through the day, leaving the farmers' two-month peaceful movement in tatters. One person was killed and several were injured in the clashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-place-for-such-incidents-in-democracy-cong-on-violence-during-tractor-rally-101611677629246.html

26-01-2021||India||Violence by certain elements in Delhi unacceptable, says Captain Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said that the violence perpetrated by certain elements during the farmers’ tractor rally in the national capital was unacceptable and urged all genuine farmers to immediately vacate Delhi and return to the city’s borders where they had been protesting peacefully for the past two months.The chief minister also ordered a high alert in Punjab amid the tension and violence in Delhi and directed Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta to ensure that law and order in the state is not disturbed at any cost.Expressing grave concern over the situation, Capt. Amarinder said the violence was apparently triggered by some people who violated the rules laid down for the tractor rally through mutual agreement between the Delhi Police and the Kisan Unions. It was unfortunate that these elements disturbed the peaceful agitation of the farmers, he said.He also condemned the incidents that took place at the historic Red Fort and some other key points of the national capital.Pointing out that the major farmer leaders had already and categorically dissociated themselves from the violence, Captain Amarinder said the agitating farmers should immediately vacate the national capital and get back to their camps at the borders, and continue to engage with the Centre to resolve the crisis over the farm laws.“Shocking scenes in Delhi. The violence by some elements is unacceptable. It'll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. Kisan leaders have disassociated themselves & suspended #TractorRally. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi & return to borders,” he tweeted.The chief minister called upon the farmers to continue to exercise the remarkable restraint with which they had conducted their peaceful protests for the past two months at Delhi’s borders, and in Punjab prior to that. Pointing out that peace had been the hallmark of their agitation, and the reason for the support they had received from across India and the world, he stressed the need for law and order to be maintained at all costs during the democratic protests by the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-by-certain-elements-in-delhi-unacceptable-says-captain-amarinder-101611673821763.html

The violence started after the farmer organisations deviated from the path decided by the authorities for tractor rally. They pushed towards central Delhi, breaking barricades and facing water cannons.Some groups of farmers also stormed the Red Fort and hoisted their own flag. In the clashes at the 17th century monument, the policemen were attacked with sticks, leaving some of them injured. By evening, however, these protesters had started returning to their sit-in sites at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders.At least 19 people were taken to two Delhi hospitals following violence during the tractor rally. Most of them suffered minor injuries and were in need of first aid, according to doctors from the two hospitals.The Delhi Police registered four FIRs on Tuesday in connection with the violence. "Three FIRs were registered in east district and one in Shahdara district," news agency PTI quoted a police official as saying.According to Delhi Police, 86 of its personnel were injured in the violence, news agency PTI reported.

We have always held that peace is our biggest strength and that any violation would hurt the movement," the SKM had said in a statement, adding that it dissociates itself from those who have resorted to violence.The farmers, who have been protesting against three farm laws of the Centre, held the tractor rally to demand the repeal of new acts. Instead of following the marked route, they forcibly entered central Delhi by removing police barricades.The three laws against which these farmers have been protesting since November 26 are: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-body-samyukt-kisan-morcha-calls-off-tractor-rally-with-immediate-effect-101611671213478.html

The land was allotted to UPSCWB in compliance with the Supreme Court directives in the Ayodhya title dispute case in which the apex court, on November 9, 2019, paved the way for construction of Ram temple at the disputed site.“I believe there is no better way than to start the project by planting saplings on the five-acre land. The plantation was carried out in the area of the project meant to be developed as a green area. The area will have plants and trees from all different geographical regions of India and from different parts of the world in order to create awareness about the imminent threat of climate change,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson for Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which has been set up by UPSCWB to look after the construction of the Dhannipur project.Senior members of the board along with the members of the IICF hoisted the flag at 8.30 am on the 5 acre land in Dhannipuur village. The flag hoisting was followed by plantation drive where members and trustees of IICF planted saplings.On December 19, the trust had released the blueprint of the mosque and other structures designed by Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow-based architect and town planner, whom the trust has hired to design the mosque that would come up in Dhannipur in place of the Babri Masjid that was demolished in 1992.Akhtar is the founder dean of the Faculty of Architecture at Jamia Milia University, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhyas-dhannipur-mosque-project-launched-with-unfurling-of-tricolour-on-rday-101611667926019.html
26-01-2021||India||Explained: As tractor rally turns violent in Delhi, what farmers want||The farmers protesting against the three laws passed by Parliament unleashed a fury on Delhi's roads on Tuesday.Also Read: Amit Shah reviews situation in DelhiThe farmers have been protesting at various border points near Delhi for more than two months. The anger finally spilled on the streets, as the police tried to stop their march towards central Delhi.So what exactly do these farmers want?As far as negotiations with the government are concerned, the agenda of the farmers is to focus the discussions only on ways in which the new laws can be scrapped. The government has, however, refused to roll back the pro-reform laws farmers say will hurt their livelihoods.ALSO WATCH | How farmers stormed Red Fort on tractors, hoisted flag from its ramparts﻿It has instead offered to hold the implementation of the three contentious laws for 18 months. The government has asked the farmers to reconsider the offer which Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said is the "best offer".The Supreme Court had on January 12 ordered to keep the three laws in abeyance and ordered the formation of a committee, but its intervention backfired as farmer unions alleged that the panel is “pro-government”.Out of the three central laws, the primary area of concern for farmers is the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, or FPTC Act in short. The law allows buying and selling of farm produce outside the APMC mandis without any tax. These regulated market places are being used by the farmers for years to sell their produce. But if the system is scrapped, they will find it difficult to negotiate with large buyers - hence putting them at the mercy of large corporate houses.The government, on its part, says that this act will give more freedom to farmers to choose who to sell their produce to. It has termed the three laws historic saying they will change the way agriculture trade is done.Also Read: At least 19 in hospital after violence at tractor rally in DelhiA related issue is that of the Minimum Support Price or MSP - the price at which the government purchases farm produce directly from the farmers. The farmers say that once they stop selling in APMCs, the big corporate houses may not honour the MSP. So, they want the government to make MSP a legal right.A recent study by the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India (UPIASI) said that farmers in fully regulated agriculture markets in Punjab got 30 per cent more price for their produce in 2018-19 than those in totally unregulated markets in Bihar and partially regulated ones in Odisha, terming MSP as only risk-management instrument available for farmers. (Click here to read the full study)However, there is a need to consider the economic aspect before taking a decision on the MSP. The government sets MSPs for 23 crops, but effectively, it is applicable only in cases of wheat and rice as these are bought in sufficiently large quantities. MSPs are an assurance that the government will intervene if market rates fall below that threshold. And it was a good step in cases where India faced acute food shortages. But the laws to will have to be different while dealing with surpluses.Moreover, higher MSPs could upend the Reserve Bank of India’s inflation targets, hurting economic growth. Mandatory MSPs will also render India’s agri-exports non-competitive because the government’s assured prices are way higher than both domestic and international market prices.The government, meanwhile, says that it is not right to include in the agenda the demand related to MSP as it is out of the purview of the new farm laws. It highlighted the plight of the small and marginal farmers and said they will benefit from the new reforms in the agriculture sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-as-tractor-rally-turns-violent-in-delhi-what-farmers-want-101611667569088.html
26-01-2021||India||105-year-old organic farmer from Coimbatore is celebrating her Padma Shri award||Eleven people from various fields in Tamil Nadu have been conferred the Padma awards. Among them and possibly the oldest living recipients from the list is 105-year-old Papammal from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu who has been awarded the prestigious Padma Shri.Papammal runs her own organic farm spread across 2.5 acres of land where she has been cultivating a variety of millets, pulses, vegetables and corn for over nine decades. “I’m very happy,” Papammal said over the phone as she was commuting to the Coimbatore airport to meet DMK leader MK Stalin. She joined the party several years ago.From an early age, Papammal alias Rangammal was interested in agricultural practices. She was born in 1914, lost her parents at an early age and was brought up by her paternal grandmother in Thekkampatti where she continues to live. She would not have studied beyond class 2, say her family members.Papammal lost her husband a decade ago and has three daughters, three grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and lives with five members of her family.“Paati is a boon for us,” said her grandson R Balasubramanian who is also a farmer. “Of course, I learnt everything from her. I’ve seen her work on the farm since I was a child and from class 10 until now I’m farming,” said Balasubramanian, 50.Also read: Amit Shah orders deployment of additional paramilitary forces in DelhiPapaammal saved money by selling snacks and beverages from a provisional shop she inherited from her grandmother. With the money, she bought 10 acres of land to cultivate pulses and corn. “There has never been a day when she hasn’t worked,” says her second niece R Kamalam who was accompanying her to the airport.With age, she sold a major portion of her land and retained 2.5 acres. The centenarian’s day starts at 5.30 in the morning and by 6 am she is on the field working until the afternoon. She had been associated with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in its education and other activities. She also had a stint as a councillor of the Thekkampatti panchayat in 1959. She also attends several village functions where they seek her blessings.The past year, however, slowed her down a bit as she developed wheezing and has remained indoors due to the Covid-19 pandemic while her family members help with her farm.According to her family, Papaammal’s active lifestyle and food habits keep her healthy. “Her favourite is mutton biryani and she takes her food with lots of greens and vegetables. She eats all her meals hot on a leaf and doesn’t use plates,” says Balasubramanian. “She sticks to hot water and avoids tea and coffee.”Though she received the information from Delhi on Monday afternoon, it was formally announced at night. Their home witnessed a beeline of visitors, including the media and politicians, since the announcement. “Her celebration is being with so many people,” says Kamalam.The family is planning a date to organise a formal celebration for her. Balasubramanian says that he brings up his two children with her as the role model to be active and work hard. “Our inspiration is at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/105yearold-organic-farmer-from-coimbatore-is-celebrating-her-padma-shri-award-101611667462021.html

The violence by some elements is unacceptable. It'll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. Kisan leaders have disassociated themselves & suspended #TractorRally. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi & return to borders.Earlier in the day Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept the farmers' demands, saying that the new farm laws were "completely wrong"."The farm laws are completely wrong as they are against federalism since agriculture is a state subject under Schedule 7 of the Constitution," said Singh.Asserting that his heart was with the protesting farmers, Punjab CM had appealed to the farmers to ensure that their 'tractor rally' event remains peaceful."Be peaceful and the country is with you," Singh said.But as the day progressed, farmers deviated from the approved routes and started moving towards central Delhi which led to clashes with the policemen. Thousands of protesting farmers clashed with police in several areas of Delhi. The farmers also stormed the historic Red Fort after breaking through barricades. Hundreds of protesters could be seen chasing security personnel with sticks and ramming their tractors into the buses parked by police, prompting security personnel to resort to lathi-charge and using tear gas. Internet services have been suspended in several parts of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) after the violence erupted.Farm union leaders called for restraint asking the protesting farmers to return to the border points where they have been camping for the past two months now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-by-some-elements-unacceptable-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-101611661899008.html

They said that the projects of the board were not “unanimously” passed and that the minutes have not reflected the objections they had raised. In a letter addressed to the Central Empowered Committee which is currently examining a petition against the clearances granted to the projects, the members who include Rajendra Kerkar, Arnold Noronha, Parag Ragnekar, Amrut Singh among others, wrote, “We were not given any opportunity to contribute to the decision making in a reasoned way and most of the concerns raised by us about the projects during the meeting were also ignored. In fact, few of us had written to the Member Secretary of the Board requesting him to record our objections in the minutes of the Board’s meeting held on 2nd December 2019. However no such inclusions corrections were made by him while escalating the minutes of the Board along with the wildlife clearance recommendation before the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SC-NBWL). Ultimately even the SC-NBWL recommended all three projects on 4th April 2020.”Also Read: Goa nearing complete normalcy after Covid-19 outbreak: Governor KoshyariDuring that meeting the Board granted approval to the three projects viz. the doubling of railway track in Castle Rock- Kulem-Kalay-Margao section of South Western Railway involving diversion of 120.875ha, four laning of existing NH-4A in Goa involving diversion of 31.015ha (Wildlife Sanctuary 6.75ha & National Park 24.265ha) and laying of LILO Narendra 400KV transmission line involving 11.546ha within the protected areas of Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park. The cumulative forest land that is to be diverted for the three projects inside the protected area is 163.43ha while the cumulative forest land required for such projects outside the protected area is believed to be another 200ha of forest land. The members also claimed that the agenda of the meeting was only handed over at the beginning of the meeting, thus giving them no time or opportunity to either understand the veracity of projects on wildlife or to form any reasoned opinion on their merits/demerits.“During the meeting there was no scope for meaningful debate or discussion, inadequate deliberation on the mitigation measures, no opportunity provided to each member to be heard and the haste adopted to simply get over the Agenda items and put rubber stamp recommendation on the wildlife clearance proposals concerning the three linear infrastructure projects. Even our signature on the attendance sheet of the meeting were considered and portrayed as deemed approval for the projects,” the members stated. “The Member Secretary who is also the Chief Wildlife of the State of Goa was overly enthusiastic about getting the projects approved as the Central government has already approved them. Surprisingly, he took it upon himself to present the project proposals to the members instead of the project proponents,” the letter stated. The exhaustive letter has also questioned the Board’s refusal to examine the projects comprehensively and cumulatively. “The three proposed linear projects will further fragment the already fragmented area, most of which is pristine and virgin in nature, However. Wildlife clearance was sought for every individual project to dilute the figurative requirement of diversion forest within the same protected area network. Thus, the impact of these projects, especially the cumulative impact on biodiversity, does not find mention,” the members said, adding that the State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire state. “There lacks a strategy with regard to these projects as random mono-culture afforestation will not be able to compensate the loss of forestry species of the Western Ghats,” the members said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-infra-projects-members-of-wildlife-board-allege-incorrect-minutes-101611661463866.html

The opposition should introspect and uphold the democratic values, and also work in the interest of the people,” Sawant said.Kamat took to Twitter to hit back saying, “[The] government must listen to Emotions, Sentiments & Aspirations of the People & the Duty of the Opposition is to be the Voice of the People. Some Actions come as a Reaction. Let the Government show the courage to face the Opposition at Length in Assembly without adopting shortcuts.”The opposition which now consists of less than one fourth of the total strength of the Goa Legislative Assembly owing to large scale defections over the last five years, has been raising its voice claiming that the Goa government is stifling dissenting voices.“If the government is afraid of even the little of the opposition that is left then they are really afraid,” Vijai Sardesai of the Goa Forward Party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-cm-leader-of-opposition-spar-over-unparliamentary-protest-in-assembly-101611660432730.html

Gradually we developed a huge clientele,” he said, adding that each saree would cost around ₹15-35.Some of his clients are chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Sourav Ganguly, noted classical musician Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Asha Bhosle, Lata Mangeshkar, among several others. Satyajit Ray and Hemanta Mukhopadhyay were also his clients. “I am very happy and I would like to thank the government for this award. This is an acknowledgement of the hard work that I and my artisans have been doing over the past 48 years,” said Basak.Earlier he was conferred the National Award in 2013 for his skill and exquisite craftsmanship. Among other feats, he was conferred honorary doctorate by UK-based World Record University for depicting the Ramayana on handloom woven saree and entered the Guinness Book for weaving the longest saree.“At present I am working with around 5,000 artisans, out of which around 2,000 are women. They have found a way to earn their living and have become self-reliant. The actual recipients of this award are these artisans and I would thank them too,” he said.“Ours is a weaver family for the last 89 years. Now that I have received the award I would like to work more and engage more artisans and make them self-reliant,” he added.His family was forced to migrate to India from Tangail in Bangladesh in the late 1960s.

He stood tall among the greats who had graced the same spot before him in blue. “Back then there was no proper government sponsorship and we had to fight hard to get anyone to hear our requirements.”The challenges notwithstanding, Venkatesh won his first gold for the country in the shot put in 1999 in Australia.The para-athlete from Bengaluru on Monday was conferred with the Padma Shri for his contribution to sport and its development.

The Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole helped 73-year-old farmer Yamunabai in unfurling the national flag.Soon after, the farmers sloganeered against the laws and started to leave Mumbai. Farmers' leaders described it as a successful agitation and said they were able to send a message that state farmers are united against the farm laws.“The Mumbai agitation sent a message to the agitating farmers at Delhi borders that we are firmly behind them and will not relent till these regressive farm laws are withdrawn,” said Ajit Navale, convenor, Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) which organised this protest. “We will soon announce the next phase of agitation which will continue till these laws are not withdrawn,” he added.He said farmers were disappointed that Maharashtra Governor Bhagat SinghKoshyari did not meet them and their march was stopped midway to Raj Bhavan, the residence of the Governor. “We tore our memorandum signalling our protest,” said Navale.NCP chief and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat addressed the meeting on Monday condemning the central government for introducing the farm laws which they accused only enslaved the farmers.Prashant Sonavane, 56, who travelled for 12 hours from Buldhana, owns a 2 acre land in which he cultivates cotton crop. “Our agitation was successful as farmers across the state came together against these laws which will only snatch away our land and offer them to multinational companies on a platter,” said Sonavane.Similarly Yeshwant Malke, 50, regretted that Koshyari did not meet them. “It seems that the Governor was not ready to help us in this genuine demand. However our agitation in Mumbai helped to spread awareness about our struggle and we are going back satisfied,” said Malke.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since late November last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-speaker-present-as-protesting-farmers-hoist-tricolour-in-mumbai-101611658651901.html

She has now been conferred with Padma Shri, the country’s fourth-highest award, in recognition of her work.“Congratulations to all for it would not have been possible for me alone to save and rescue 125 people mostly women from getting killed on charges of witchcraft and partially rehabilitate them to live normal lives. I never even dreamt of getting such an honour in my life as only celebrities and film stars used to get such an award. I thank Narendra Modi for finding people like me from the remotest corners of the country for such national honour,” said Mahato.Also read | Assam banker known for empowering women gets Padma ShriShe added the award has strengthened her resolve to fight against the practice. “...17 women and men came to me after escaping murderous assaults on January 1 from Odisha on charges of practicing witchcraft. The police station in-charge there pleaded his inability to act in such socially volatile matter...” she said.Mahato was married off at 13 in 1978 when she was in Class 3. Her life changed completely in March 1995 when some of her neighbours attempted to rape her accusing her of practising black magic after a girl fell sick in their neighbourhood. “Panchayat fined me ₹500. Six months later, the villagers beat me and tried to kill me. I fled,” she said. Mahato rushed to the local lawmaker’s house for help and shelter but in vain. She then approached the police, who demanded ₹10, 000 for lodging a case.Bureaucrat Nidhi Khare helped her by sending her to an NGO working to root out witch-hunting practice in Jharkhand. “The then West Singhbhum deputy commissioner Amir Khare helped me set up anti-witch-hunting consultation centre, which has so far saved 125 so-called witches,” said Mahato.A documentary was made on her struggles in 1996 and how she was fighting the menace and helping others.

Her relatives raised her despite hardships and made her realise the importance of financial security, especially for women. The difficult circumstances made Baruah stronger and on Monday, she was named as one of the recipients of this year’s Padma Shri awards in recognition of her efforts to financially empower the Assamese women. Baruah is the founder of Konoklata Mahila Urban Cooperative Bank that has provided credit to thousands of women and made a positive change to their lives in Jorhat, Sivasagar. and Golaghat districts.Also read | Tamil Nadu’s Padma awardees include Balasubrahmanyam“I am very encouraged and inspired by the honour. It is a recognition of the difficult and arduous task that we have taken up and been pursuing for years. I want to express my gratitude to all who have been part of this journey and hope we reach more women.”Baruah understood first-hand how women from very poor backgrounds faced problems because of lack of money or a place to safely keep their earnings during her involvement with various women groups and her work in a cooperative bank.“Most women were unaware of how banks functioned. My work in a cooperative bank made me realise that these women needed a bank that they could access easily, save their earnings and take easy loans when in need. That is how the idea to set up the bank came.”Despite no specialised knowledge of banking, Baruah applied to the Reserve Bank of India in 1990 to set up a cooperative bank for women. The approval came in 1998 and the bank was set up two years later in Jorhat with an initial investment of ₹8.45 lakh and 1,500 women members. The bank employs only women and now has four branches, 21 regular employees, and 45,000 account holders, mostly women.“Women can open accounts with us with zero balance or as low as ₹20. Till now, we have given loans to over 8,000 women and around 1,200 women self-help-groups. Our turnover for the last year was nearly ₹16 crore and a profit of ₹30 lakh,” said Baruah. “We operate with the deposits of very poor women. We hope after this recognition, the government schemes or works related to MP or MLA local area development funds are also done through our bank so that we are able to expand and help more women.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-banker-known-for-empowering-women-gets-padma-shri-101611658223113.html

Authorities blocked roads with large trucks and buses in an attempt to stop the farmers from reaching the centre of the national capital. The farmers were seen ramming their tractors into those buses.Some Delhi Police officials even sat on the road in Nangloi to stop the farmers.

He also said, "We dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts."News agency ANI reported that internet services have been snapped in some parts of Delhi-NCR in view of the prevailing law and order situation.For nearly two months, farmers have camped at the edge of the capital, blockading highways and other important roads. They are demanding the withdrawal of three new laws - passed in September last year - which they say will commercialise agriculture and devastate farmers' earnings.The government has rubbished these allegations terming the three laws "historic". it has also offered to amend the laws and suspend their implementation for 18 months. But farmers insist they will settle for nothing less than a complete repeal. They plan to march on foot to Parliament on February 1, when the country’s new budget will be presented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clashes-vandalism-tractors-on-roads-how-farmers-march-turned-violent-101611655975423.html

Some vested interests have been trying to whip up passions by instigating and resorting to unsavory incidents, which are crude, meaningless and are laced with ulterior motives,” he regretted.He said desecration, vandalism, arson and all such acts of insanity have no place in our society and those responsible for the aberrations will be dealt with firmly by all means to restore peace and harmony in the state.“We have to respect all faiths and that is what our tradition has been. The government is very firm in safeguarding the social fabric, which is spun by the colorful yarn of various faiths that reflects unity in diversity,” he said.The Governor appreciated the efforts of the state government in handling the Covid-19 pandemic in the state which had passed through testing times in the last one year. With vaccination rolling out 10 days back, the run has been smooth and the government has put in place the necessary infrastructure, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-governor-s-balanced-development-pitch-points-to-3-capitals-plan-101611653777062.html

At the break of dawn, children gather around the modest home of the 102-year-old man to learn Odia alphabets and a bit of mathematics. Elders who could not attend school during their childhood come to his home at 6 pm to learn how to sign their names.As a young boy, being sent to his maternal uncle’s place in Jajpur district helped him to study till class 7. Soon after his uncle arranged a job for him at Cuttack. But his father was reluctant and made him stay with him to help him out in farming. India was still not a free country then.Prusty took it upon himself the job of spreading literacy. “I would find children loafing around. They were all illiterate. Since I did not have much work, I started teaching them under a tree. There was no school then. Initially, I had to run after them, but soon they started coming,” he said.What endeared him to others was his refusal to charge money from his students. Even more than 70 years after he started teaching, he does not take money. “I liked children and teaching. I wanted the kids to grow up and become good human beings. Money was never my concern" said Prusty, who claims to have taught at least three generations from the same family.Kantira now has schools and colleges nearby, but villagers still send their kids to Prusty for learning the alphabets and arithmetic. “I will continue teaching the children as long as my health permits,” said Prusty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teacher-for-7-decades-102-year-old-class-7-pass-out-is-padma-shri-winner-101611653287893.html

Working on tips from co-workers, acquaintances, and friends, agents have tracked down driver's license photos to match their faces with those captured on camera in the building.In some cases, authorities got records from Facebook or Twitter to connect their social media accounts to their email addresses or phone numbers. In others, agents used records from license plate readers to confirm their travels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-me-rioters-flaunt-involvement-in-capitol-siege-on-social-media-101611652105942.html

The state police had a different approach in different districts and varying degrees of what was allowed for the rally. While the rallies ended peacefully by afternoon in a few districts, there was a tussle between police and farmers in the delta districts. In Thanjavur and Nagapattinam districts, there was heavy police deployment, and a scuffle broke out between the police and the farmers who started the rally with bullock carts, tractors, jeeps and two-wheelers. In Thanjavur, the farmers removed barricades and ropes to continue their rally and ended it by afternoon. Also Read: Tractor rally: Why protesting farmers digressed from the original routesHundreds of tractors participated in Nagapattinam district and were stopped. “A confrontation is still going on between police and farmers there,” said state coordinator of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee K Balakrishnan.

Policemen and farmers were also seen pushing one another after the tractors were not allowed to proceed. Some farmers continued their rally on foot. In Karur district too, they were allowed to continue the rally on foot. In Cuddalore, no tractor was allowed to enter the city, while in Virudhunagar, one tractor was allowed and hundreds of farmers joined on their two-wheelers. Police said that the rallies went on peacefully in these two places. “Since we had warned them earlier, farmers took put a rally only on two-wheleers,” said a station officer from Cuddalore. The district police had issued a note warning against gatherings due to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly since a new variant of the virus emerged earlier this month. “Those who organise protests and gather in large numbers will be severely punished as per law as it may cause a surge in cases,” the Cuddalore police’s statement read. “Tractors without permission used in this rally will be penalised according to Motors (Vehicles) Act (1988) under sections 177, 179 and 207 and the tractors will be seized.”The opposition DMK and its allies have protested and launched hunger strikes in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi in the recent months. However, the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government has been in favour of the three new farm bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-tractor-rally-largely-peaceful-farmers-cops-scuffle-in-delta-areas-101611652882519.html
26-01-2021||India||Assam’s Padma awardee worked to eradicate witch-hunting practice||Till a decade back, nearly 12-15 people would be branded as witches and murdered annually in Assam. The cases have come down drastically in recent years, thanks mainly to activist Birubala Rabha’s efforts. In recognition of her work against the practice in the face of personal problems and dangers, the 72-year-old was named as one of the recipients of this year’s Padma Shri awards.“I am very happy with the honour. I have faced many struggles and even threats to my life for the work I have been doing... The recognition is the blessing of those who have supported us,” said Rabha, who dropped out of school after Class 5 to be married off early. Rabha was called a witch and blamed by fellow villagers for deaths of neighbours.Also read | Telangana’s Padma Shri awardee can barely eke out a living as a cookHaving been a victim of the practice, Rabha took it upon herself to raise her voice against it and has since saved dozens of lives. She has spread awareness for ending witch-hunting. “My life and work are dedicated to others. The journey has been arduous, but I am not going to rest on my laurels and stop the mission which we have taken up,” said Rabha. Rabha’s work prompted the passage of the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act in 2015.Witch-hunting is a form of superstition wherein women usually are blamed for deaths, illnesses, financial troubles, or even crop damage and targeted by relatives, neighbours, or fellow villagers. Such women are often ex-communicated, forced to leave villages, tortured by kangaroo courts, and in many cases killed. The real motives of such killings are often property disputes and ego clashes.According to the Assam government figures, between 2011 and 2019, 107 people were killed across Assam in witch-hunting incidents. The latest such incident was reported in October when a 50-year-old widow and a 28-year-old man were killed in Karbi Anglong district.“Though Rabha had been working for years on this, our work took concrete shape in 2012 with the setting up of Birubala Mission. We now have around 600 members across Assam and have saved lives of at least 200...” said Natyabir Das, an associate of Rabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assams-padma-awardee-worked-to-eradicate-witch-hunting-practice-101611652822445.html
26-01-2021||India||India criticises delay in UN reforms, calls for transparent negotiations||India has criticised the inordinate delay in inter-governmental negotiations for reforms of the UN and called for a more open and transparent approach to ensure the world body and the Security Council become more inclusive and capable of tackling contemporary challenges. Participating in a meeting on the negotiations to ensure equitable representation and an increase in the membership of the Security Council on Monday, India’s envoy to the UN, TS Tirumurti, criticised “naysayers” who had stalled the reforms. He didn’t name the parties that were opposing the changes. India has for long campaigned for a permanent seat in a reformed and expanded Security Council. Its candidature has been backed by P-5 members such as the US, the UK and France and members of the G-20 such as Germany and Japan. China is often perceived as stalling efforts to reform the UN. “We all know that reform at the UN is supposed to be a process, not an event. However, sadly, there is no process here in the UN that has traversed the torturous pathways more than what this process of Security Council reform has,” Tirumurti said, pointing out that the inter-governmental negotiations had started 13 years ago while the subject of reforms was first included in the General Assembly’s agenda 43 years ago. “While the world is not what it was when we began the process, the objections to moving forward remain frozen in time. While global challenges of the 21st century have multiplied, we have been stopped by the naysayers to even adopt the process in order to move forward,” he said. The inaction on UN reforms has not been “without cost”, and the Security Council is called on to address complex issues of international peace and security but “finds itself unable to act effectively, for it is lacking inclusivity of those who need to be there, and therefore lacking legitimacy and credibility”, Tirumurti said. The inter-governmental negotiations, he said, are “anything but negotiations” and there is no written documentation that can form the basis for “transparent give-and-take negotiations”. Tirumurti said India wants the application of the UN General Assembly’s rules to the inter-governmental negotiations to ensure openness and transparency, and an “outcome text” or draft outcome document that should be updated after each meeting to reflect the views and positions of all countries. The UN cannot allow the inter-governmental negotiations to “continue to serve as a convenient smokescreen for a handful of reform naysayers”, and failure to make changes could force states to look outside negotiations, for genuine reforms. The permanent membership of the Security Council should reflect contemporary realities and include adequate representation from all regions, he said, reiterating India’s call to have six more permanent seats – two each for Africa and Asia, one for Latin America and the Caribbean, and one for the West European and others group. “The goal of a reformed multilateralism to preserve peace and promote security is a long overdue idea. For our part, India stands ready to play a constructive role in promoting the common objective of a comprehensive and structured reform process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-criticises-delay-in-un-reforms-calls-for-transparent-negotiations-101611652402677.html

The apex court had asked the Delhi Police to take a final call on this. After rounds of consultations, permission for the tractor march was given and a route was also decided. But on Tuesday nothing happened as planned with protesters claiming that they had to break barricades because Delhi Police were not allowing them to enter the Capital and the Police claiming that it had to use force because the protesters turned violent.On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi became the first politician to the violence unfolding at the heart of the Capital.

Raju, who works as a cook on daily wages at a tribal welfare hostel in Marlavai village, has been awarded the fourth-highest civilian award for saving the dying tribal Gussadi dance.“I do not know what this award is, but I am extremely happy that my name was considered in Delhi. But I will be happier if they can arrange me some shelter and food through the rest of my life,” said Raju, who belongs to the Gond tribal community. “I will be grateful if this award can help me lead a happy life.”Raju has won accolades for his efforts to popularise Gussadi, an ethnic dance form of Raj Gonds inhabiting areas along the Telangana-Maharashtra border.Also read | Writer, folklorist, former journalist Vinayak Khedekar wins Padma ShriThe dance is performed during the harvesting season when the Gonds wear Gussadi Topi, a large headgear made of around 1,500 peacock feathers locally known as Mal boora, and animal skin around their waists. Raju worked with Madari Tukaram, the first Gond Indian Administrative Service officer in the early 1980s to give a style and system to Gussadi dance. “Long ago, I performed in front of [late former Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi and presented her with the traditional headgear of Gussadi,” Raju said.Raju also took part in the Republic Day parade as part of the state tableau in 1981. He also performed in presence of APJ Abdul Kalam when he was the President.Jayadheer Tirumala Rao, a researcher on Telangana tribal art and dance forms, said when tribal dance forms were being corrupted with modern forms and cinema culture, Raju took it as a challenge and restored the traditional dance form of Gussadi by hundreds of performances across the state and the country. “...[he has] trained thousands of tribal youths in this dance form over the last four decades,” said Rao. “If any art form has to survive, the artiste has to survive first. It will happen only if more such artistes who are striving hard to sustain the dying art forms like Gussadi are honoured with such awards.”Raju was felicitated at the Republic Day celebrations at Asifabad with a shawl and bouquet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telanganas-padma-shri-awardee-can-barely-eke-out-a-living-as-a-cook-101611650182113.html

Confusion prevailed over who are these attackers as the unions of the farmers continued to distance themselves from the ruckus that took over the Capital in the name of a 'peaceful protest' which was supposed to have gone back to the borders by the time when the Capital became a mini war-zone. A video showing a tractor being driven frantically in the middle of a crowded ITO has also emerged. With a National Flag on the top of it, the tractor has only one driver and as it chases police personnel, they jump away from its way, the video shows.

26-01-2021||India||Republic Day: India showcases military prowess amid border row with China||From T-90 tanks and BMP-II infantry combat vehicles rumbling down Rajpath to fighter jets performing some breathtaking manoeuvres in the skies to flaunting indigenous rockets and missiles, India on Tuesday showcased its military might to the world during the 72nd Republic Day parade held at a time when India and China are locked in a border standoff in the Ladakh sector. Military equipment displayed at the parade included the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, Pinaka multi-launcher rocket system, bridge layer tank T-72, Samvijay electronic warfare system and Schilka weapon system. The Indian Air Force’s Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and MiG-29s—fighters that are part of the IAF’s muscular posture in the Ladakh theatre—were among the 42 aircraft that took part in the Republic Day flypast, which is the highlight of the parade. The Rafale jets took part in the parade for the first time. Also Read: R-Day: UP tableau displays Ayodhya’s Ram Temple, Deepotsava celebrationBefore the parade began, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to India’s fallen heroes by placing a wreath at the National War Memorial at India Gate.

President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu and several cabinet ministers were among the dignitaries who witnessed the parade.The parade was led by Lieutenant General Vijay Kumar Mishra, general officer commanding, HQs Delhi Area. The march past included Param Vir Chakra and Ashok Chakra awardees (India’s highest wartime and peacetime gallantry awards, respectively), a marching contingent and band of the Bangladesh armed forces, an army mounted column of 61 Cavalry and marching contingents of the Jat Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Mahar Regiment, the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles and Bengal Sappers. The Bangladesh marching and band contingent was invited to take part in the parade as part of celebrations linked to 50 years of the liberation of that country. The flypast featured a vintage Dakota aircraft that flew in formation with two Mi-17 V5 helicopters, marking the golden jubilee celebrations.

The parade was shorter and involved fewer participants because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, only a fourth of the usual number of spectators were allowed at Rajpath. The shortened route of the parade saw it end at National Stadium instead of Red Fort. Not more than 25,000 spectators were allowed, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 were also not permitted at the parade. There was no chief guest at the parade this year.

This was the first time in at least five decades that the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in India’s diplomatic calendar, did not have a chief guest. The last time the parade did not have a chief guest was in 1966.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-india-showcases-military-prowess-amid-border-row-with-china-101611648321861.html

The UT, which was carved out of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, was represented in a tableau, which highlighted the vision for Ladakh - to be “carbon neutral and exemplary for the world.”The tableau featured the future prospects and development of Green Ladakh through natural resources and the generation of horticultural produce, as well as through the development of tourism. It also displayed the composite culture and communal harmony of the region. Art and architecture, languages and dialects, customs and costumes, fairs and festivals, literature, crafts and music of Ladakh were also highlighted prominently on the tableau. Also featuring on the tableau was the Indian Astronomical Observatory located in Hanle near the capital city of Leh.The Union territory of Ladakh came into existence in October 2019, two months after Union home minister Amit Shah announced the abrogation of Article 370, thus revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. As part of the announcement, the separation of Ladakh from Jammu and Kashmir was also announced, with both regions becoming UTs independent of each other.The various other ‘firsts’ of the day’s Republic Day parade included the participation of a woman fighter pilot of the Indian Air Force (IAF), Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth. Also appearing in the parade for the first time was the Rafale fighter jet, which flew in a “Vertical Charlie” formation in the flypast during the parade.

We urge everyone to remain peaceful and protest non-violently.”On Sunday when Delhi Police gave permission to farmers to hold their rally, police had reached a consensus with the farmers on holding the rally at specified locations near the three borders.

Some of them claimed they had received confusing text messages about the vaccination and hence could not make it.Anjani Bajpayee, a staff nurse, said, “After Covid duty, I was in quarantine and had a fever. I got the message a day before the vaccination, but I avoided the shot due to fever. Since the message came just a day before, I could not do much about it.”Jitendra, a ward-boy at Shyama Prasad Mukherjee (SPM) Civil Hospital here, said, “I called, and the seniors told me persons with fever should not take the Covaxin shot.”Some said they had to rush out of Lucknow due to death in the family. A few others said they had switched to a different number and so could not get the messages about the vaccination.Being engaged in routine duty, too, became a reason for some of the absentees.A senior doctor, who was one of the recipients of Covaxin vaccine, said, “The OPD (outpatient department) had a lot of patients waiting. Many of the OPD (staff) was listed for vaccination, so I managed the OPD workload.”Asked if he could have gone after OPD, which closes at 2 pm, the doctor, who did not wish to be named, said, “I would get the shot whenever called next.”Anjani, the staff nurse at Lok Bandhu Hospital, said, “I have told my hospital director that my name be included in the list in the next round.”As for the confusing messages, a staffer at Civil Hospital, who was to be vaccinated on January 22, said, “I got the message for the vaccination a day before and, shortly after, a message came for cancellation of the vaccination. A third came confirming (the vaccination) again and it confused me.”Health officials said medical conditions such as allergy or fever could be ignored but the SMSes were very clear.“Medical conditions such as fever or allergy have to be considered before the vaccination,” said Dr MK Singh, the officer in charge of vaccination in Lucknow.“Three hospitals had to use Covaxin, but the message went for Covishield. Hence, the cancellation was sent and (there was) a third message confirming their vaccination. There was no confusion,” said Dr Singh.He said an analysis of the reasons was being done and the final picture would be clear in the next two days.As vaccination is voluntary, officials are now working on motivational methods. Those who have been vaccinated are being asked to motivate others and video messages of vaccination ambassadors are being circulated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-workers-blame-confusing-messages-on-missing-covid-vaccine-shot-in-up-101611642938780.html

The leaders of the agitation plan to follow up with a march on foot to Parliament on February 1, when the government presents the Union budget.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that while the Republic Day rally is planned as a one-day event, the scale of the protest could mean that the rally could spill over to the next day by the time they return to their starting spots located at three different rally routes in and around the capital.

The farmers last week rejected a proposal by the Centre to put the laws on hold for 18 months.

She had said after her induction in the IAF, while recalling her first experience of the spin solo on fighter aircraft Kiran, that as she entered the aircraft into a spin and recovered it all by herself at 20,000 feet, doubt started creeping into her mind as to what if the aircraft didn’t recover.“I told myself that if I don’t do it now, I will always be afraid of it. I spun the aircraft and to my surprise, the spin was more vicious or so it seemed. But the fighter pilot in me took over and I told myself come what may I will recover. And the aircraft recovered from spin and so did my confidence,” she had said.The Air Force contingent, comprising 96 airmen and four officers, was led by flight lieutenant Tanik Sharma.

Here is what we know about the incident that has turned the spotlight on the eastern sector even as rival soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball in Ladakh: • The latest incident took place at Naku La area at a height of over 5,000 metres on January 20 when Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into the Indian territory but were pushed back. • The Army has clarified it was a minor face-off that was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols. • The Naku La area has traditionally not been prone to face-offs. • Experts pointed to attempts by Beijing to open a new front amid the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tensions first erupted in May 2020. The two sides are holding diplomatic and military dialogues to defuse tensions there. Also Read: Indian, Chinese troops clashed in north Sikkim last week: Officials• The Chinese side neither confirmed nor denied the incident. • Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said Chinese border troops are committed to upholding peace and tranquility along the border with India and urged the “Indian side to work in the same direction” and “refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border”. • The news of the Naku La clash came hours before a joint statement by the two nuclear-armed neighbours, which agreed to a push for “early disengagement” of their frontline troops during the ninth round of military talks on Sunday. The talks went on for 16 hours. • The ongoing border tensions escalated in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. It was the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the contested Line of Actual Control in 45 years and resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers. • The Naku La episode is the second such incident in the eastern sector in less than a year. Four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops suffered injuries during a May 9, 2020, confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers. • Rival soldiers have so far clashed at least five times since the India-China border row erupted last year in the Ladakh sector. The situation there remains tense and the ongoing military and diplomatic dialogues have yet to make any positive impact. • On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the military and diplomatic talks with China were prolonged. • While the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been at the centre of the current border tensions, Indian forces are in a heightened state of alert all along the border with China, stretching from Himachal Pradesh to Uttarakhand to Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-troops-clash-at-sikkim-s-naku-la-all-you-need-to-know-101611639860685.html

The chief minister, who was sharing the dais with the Prime Minister, refused to speak at the event, taking offense to religious slogans being raised at a government function. This led to a war of words between the BJP and the Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC).Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been in power in West Bengal since 2011 and the leader is looking for a third straight term as the chief minister. The BJP, buoyed by its performance in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, is aiming at forming its maiden government in the eastern state.

26-01-2021||India||Budget session: Parliament canteen expands menu, hikes prices||A buffet lunch for ₹700 and an aloo bonda for ₹10—the Parliament canteen will dish out an elaborate menu this Budget session. The Parliament canteen, now run by ITDC, will offer as many as 58 food items—both vegetarian and non-vegetarian—from January 27, an internal circular said. The price tags, however, don’t smell of subsidy. For many years, the Parliament canteen had tried to strike a balance between the quality of food and its price but for the first time, food will be served with a no-profit-no-loss approach. While vegetarian biryani is priced at ₹50, a plate of chicken biryani will cost ₹100. A vegetarian meal (thali) will now be available for ₹100, mutton biryani at ₹150 and for a plate of fish and chips, a customer will have to shell out ₹110. Also Read: Stage set for mega tractor rally; Parliament march on Feb 1The new price list indicates a new menu and a higher rate. While the chicken biryani will cost ₹30 more than the current rate and its mutton counterpart will be ₹50 costlier, the new items include fish and chips, medu vada, mutton cutlet, omelette, masala poori and uttapam. A small plate of green salad, earlier available for ₹10, will now cost ₹25. Last year, the contract with the Northern Railways, which has been running the canteen since 1968, was scrapped. Top officials indicated that cost control and a better, tastier menu were the prime reasons for such a move. “The Northern Railways’ people in the Parliament canteen were paid nearly ₹1 lakh each by the Parliament to run the canteen. We felt that the cost should be reduced,” said an official. During a normal session, an average 4,500 people eat at the Parliament every day. According to the data available with officials, during the 2019-20 fiscal, of the ₹17 crore annual subsidy, only ₹24 lakh was spent on account of MPs. The rest was accounted for by visitors, security personnel and officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-session-parliament-canteen-expands-menu-increases-prices-101611635360277.html

At the same time, I knew there were so many things, so much diversity and such a wide canvas I could illustrate," he said."While Republic Day only dates back to 1949, many elements of the subcontinent’s culture have been evolving for centuries. With origins that stretch back hundreds of years, musical instruments such as the dholak (a two-headed hand drum) and the sitar (a long-necked stringed instrument), both featured in the Doodle artwork, are just a few examples of India’s rich heritage," Google wrote."From its distinctive architectural styles to the Bollywood film industry, India’s cultural impact is felt across the world, and today, there is much to celebrate," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-day-google-doodle-2021-selfie-sitar-cricket-google-celebrates-republic-day-with-mumbai-artist-s-doodle-101611626347774.html

26-01-2021||India||With many firsts, India’s military might, cultural diversity on display on R-Day||India will celebrate its 72nd Republic Day on Tuesday and the main ceremony will be organised at Rajpath in the national capital of Delhi where President Ram Nath Kovind will take the salute of the parade. The Republic Day Parade ceremony will commence with Prime Minister Narendra Modi visiting the National War Memorial. He will lead the nation in paying tributes to the fallen heroes by laying a wreath.India’s military might, cultural diversity, social and economic progress will be on display during the 72nd Republic Day celebrations. This year's Republic Day ceremony will be different from the past due to Covid-19 pandemic. The parade will be held following all necessary Covid-19 preventive protocols and its route has been shortened.The parade will start at 9.50am from Vijay Chowk and proceed to National Stadium and the tableaux will start from Vijay Chowk and proceed to Red Fort ground. The parade will begin from Vijay Chowk, as usual, but will end at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort. Only around 25,000 spectators will be allowed to witness the parade as compared to the average of 1.15 lakh people every year. Children below 15 years and elderly with comorbidities will not be permitted. This year, there will be no chief guest from foreign countries due to the pandemic.Thirty-two tableaux, 17 from states and Union territories, nine from various ministries or departments and paramilitary forces and six from the ministry of defence, depicting the nation’s rich cultural heritage, economic progress and defence prowess will roll down the Rajpath.The 122-member proud contingent of the Bangladesh Armed Forces comprising soldiers of the Bangladesh army, sailors of the Bangladesh navy and air warriors of the Bangladesh air force will lead the contingent march on the Rajpath.

26-01-2021||India||Troops come to blows in India-China face-off||Indian and Chinese soldiers were involved in a brawl in north Sikkim last week, with soldiers from both armies suffering injuries in a clash that has turned the spotlight on the eastern sector even as rival soldiers are deployed eyeball to eyeball in Ladakh, officials familiar with the development said on Monday.The latest incident took place at Naku La area, which is at a height of over 5,000 metres, on January 20, when Chinese soldiers attempted to intrude into the Indian territory, the officials cited above said, requesting anonymity. They added that the soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) were pushed back.“It is clarified that there was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on January 20 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,” the army said in a brief statement.The Naku La area has traditionally not been prone to face-offs, and the developments reflected China’s aggressive behaviour in the eastern sector, the officials said.Experts pointed to attempts by Beijing to open a new front amid the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tensions first erupted in May 2020. The two sides are holding diplomatic and military dialogues to defuse tensions there.“I thought the use of the word ‘minor’ was best avoided. A clash is a clash. Just as we were awaiting the outcome of the ninth round of talks between military com mmanders, reports of an intrusion into Naku La represents an attitude that is anything but minor,” former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said.The Chinese side neither confirmed nor denied the incident. “On the specific [incident] you mentioned, I don’t have any information to offer. I would like to stress though the Chinese border troops are committed to upholding peace and tranquility along the border with India,” Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told the press in Beijing at a regular briefing.He urged the “Indian side to work in the same direction” and “refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border”.The news of the Naku La clash came hours before a joint statement by the two nuclear-armed neighbours, who agreed to a push for “early disengagement” of their frontline troops during the ninth round of military talks on Sunday. The talks went on for 16 hours.“They [the two sides] also agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, maintain the good momentum of dialogue and negotiation, and hold the 10th round of the corps commander-level meeting at an early date to jointly advance de-escalation,” the joint statement said.The ongoing border tensions reached new heights in the aftermath of a clash in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 — the first deadly conflict between soldiers of the two sides along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 45 years. The clash resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers.The Naku La episode is the second such incident in the eastern sector in less than a year. Four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops suffered injuries during a May 9, 2020, confrontation that involved around 150 soldiers.Rival soldiers have so far clashed at least five times since the India-China border row erupted last year in the Ladakh sector. The situation there remains tense and the ongoing military and diplomatic dialogues have yet to make any positive impact.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the Indian Army was prepared to hold its ground in eastern Ladakh “as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the military and diplomatic talks with China were prolonged.While the LAC in eastern Ladakh has been at the centre of the current border tensions, Indian forces are in a heightened state of alert all along the border with China, stretching from Himachal Pradesh to Uttarakhand to Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh.In his address to the nation on the eve of India’s 72nd Republic Day, President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday said while the country was committed to peace, its forces were “adequately mobilised” to thwart any attempt to undermine national security. “Our national interest will be protected at all costs,” he said.A senior journalist of the Chinese official media said there was no record of last week’s clash in the PLA’s patrol log, an unusual remark given the secrecy surrounding the Chinese army.“This is fake news. Based on what I learned, there is no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side. Small frictions often occur on China-India border area, but clash that caused multiple injuries will definitely be recorded and reported,” Hu Xijin, the high-profile editor of nationalistic Global Times tabloid, tweeted.But experts said the Naku La incident appears to be part of a larger effort to both test India’s defences and open a new front in the face of the stalemate in the Ladakh sector, where tens of thousands of troops have dug in for the harsh winter.“There is nothing the Chinese can now do in Ladakh which they can portray to their advantage,” Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said. “Unlike previous standoffs, where the Chinese stepped back after intruding, there has been a fundamental change in the attitude of the Chinese. They aren’t stepping back this time after they were repelled and faced resistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-come-to-blows-in-india-china-faceoff-101611618264075.html
26-01-2021||India||Conversion ordinance: Don’t take HC ‘lightly’, top court tells UP govt||The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a plea by the Uttar Pradesh government seeking to stop the Allahabad high court from examining the state’s contentious anti-conversion law, and said that no constitutional court should be taken “lightly”.A Supreme Court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, made it clear that it will not transfer the petitions against the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, to itself, but would like the high court to rule on the validity of the law.“If the Allahabad high court is going to hear it and decide it quickly, why should we interfere? Why should we transfer the case here? We would like the advantage of the decision by the high court,” observed the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, clearing the decks for the high court to proceed suitably when the matter next comes up for hearing before it on February 6.The state government, got adjournments from the high court in the last two hearings citing the pendency of the similar petitions before the Supreme Court.Senior advocate PS Narasimha, representing the UP government, had requested the bench to transfer the two petitions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conversion-ordinance-don-t-take-hc-lightly-top-court-tells-up-govt-101611617889197.html
26-01-2021||India||India to impose permanent ban on 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok: Report||India's ministry of electronics and information technology has issued fresh notices to make permanent a ban imposed on video app TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps in June, Indian media reported late on Monday.When it first imposed the ban, the Indian government gave the 59 apps a chance to explain their position on compliance with privacy and security requirements, the Times of India reported on Monday.The companies, which include ByteDance's popular video-sharing app TikTok, Tencent Holdings' WeChat and Alibaba's UC Browser, were also asked to respond to a list of questions, the newspaper said."The government is not satisfied with the response/explanation given by these companies. Hence, the ban for these 59 apps is permanent now," business newspaper Livemint quoted a source familiar with the notices as saying. It said the notices were issued last week.The ministry's June order stated that the apps were "prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order".The order, which India referred to as a "digital strike", followed a skirmish with Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border site when 20 Indian soldiers were killed.In September, India banned another 118 mobile apps, including Tencent's popular videogame PUBG, as it stepped up the pressure on Chinese technology companies following the standoff at the border.A TikTok representative told the Economic Times newspaper that the company was evaluating the notice and will respond to it as appropriate.The ministry of electronics and information technology could not be reached for comment outside regular working hours. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-impose-permanent-ban-on-59-chinese-apps-including-tiktok-report-101611617067803.html

This included 29 women, 10 people of Indian origin, non resident Indians and foreigners, 16 posthumous awardees and one transgender person.Abe, Japan’s longest-serving PM, stepped down last August and was the first Japanese PM to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in 2014.Indian-American physicist Narendra Singh Kapany, who is known for his work on fibre optics, was awarded posthumously along with Balasubrahmanyam, who recording 40,000 songs in 16 languages and died last September after being infected with Covid-19.Dr Belle Monappa Hegde, cardiologist and former vice chancellor of Manipal University, was given the Padma Vibhushan, as was Islamic scholar and peace activist Wahiduddin Khan and Odia sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo.BB Lal, former director general of the Archaeological Survey of India whose books first suggested the presence of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya town, was also awarded.Former bureaucrat Nripendra Misra, who now heads the committee for the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, was among 10 Padma Bhushan awardees.

26-01-2021||India||SC rejects Andhra govt plea to defer local polls||The Supreme Court on Monday reproached the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh for its endeavour to have village panchayat elections postponed, and said that the court cannot allow “lawlessness” in a state because of an ego battle.Clearing the decks for the local body elections in February in accordance with the poll panel’s itinerary, the top court expressed its strong displeasure at the state government’s accusations against state election commissioner N Ramesh Kumar, terming the whole episode a “sorry state of affairs.”“Sometimes, you come up with one excuse; sometimes, you challenge appointment of an officer (Kumar). It is a political process and you are not letting a political process be completed for the last six months on one pretext or another. It is not that in this country, no election has taken place during these times. It was conducted in Bihar,” a bench headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, told AP government’s lawyer Mukul Rohatgi.Even as Rohatgi said that the state government was acting in the interest of its employees and that the court could prescribe an election schedule, the bench, which also included justice Hrishikesh Roy, said that it could not ask the state election commissioner to stop functioning.“What is this happening in the state? Your chief secretary and principal secretary don’t go. Your DGP is absent. Your employees’ associations are issuing resolutions against the election commission. We cannot allow this lawlessness. We cannot let this lawlessness continue because of your ego battles and your fights. We are not going to be a party to your ego battles,” Justice Kaul told Rohatgi.During the hearing, senior advocates Parag Tripathi and BH Marlapally, appeared on behalf of the associations of state government officers and other employees. Senior lawyer Sajan Povayya too appeared for medical officers in the state.The bench proceeded to dismiss the appeal by Jagan government against the high court’s order of January 21 in favour of the state election commission.On January 8, Kumar released the schedule for elections to be held in four phases – on February 5, 9, 13 and 17. The notification was issued on January 23 and the nomination process for phase-1 was to commence on Monday. This could not take place, as the district collectors and district panchayat officers refused to start the process as there were no instructions from the Jagan government||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-andhra-govt-plea-to-defer-local-polls-101611610431663.html
26-01-2021||India||Stage set for mega tractor rally; Parliament march on Feb 1||Hundreds of thousands of protesters on Monday prepared to enter the national capital on Republic Day on tractors to take out a mega farmers’ parade — one, they contend, will rival the spectacle of the official celebrations on the Rajpath boulevard in pomp and pageantry — even as the leaders of the agitation said they will follow up with a march on foot to Parliament on February 1, when the government presents the Union budget.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that while the Republic Day rally is planned as a one-day event, the scale of the protest could mean that the rally could spill over to the next day by the time they return to their starting spots located at three different rally routes in and around the Capital.The police say about 30,000 tractors are likely to participate in the rally, but farm leaders said the number of vehicles will be closer to 200,000. The farm unions, however, have promised not to veer from the three routes — centered around the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders — agreed to with the Delhi Police.“We will march towards Parliament on foot from different locations on the Budget day on February 1. As far as tomorrow’s (Tuesday’s) tractor rally is concerned, it will give the government an idea of our strength and they will know the agitation is not just limited to Haryana or Punjab but it is an agitation of the whole country,” said Darshan Pal, a farm union leader.He said the agitation will continue till the demand of repealing three contentious farm laws is met. The government and farm unions have not been able to find a solution to the stand-off over 11 rounds of talks, and the farmers last week rejected a far-reaching proposal by the Centre to put the laws on hold for 18 months. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday reiterated that farmers should accept the government’s proposal to suspend the laws. “The government has given the best offer to farmers’ unions. I am hopeful that they will convey their decision to us after discussing it among themselves,” he told reporters.Delhi Police have allowed Tuesday’s parade to cover a length of 194km on stretches crossing the three principal border points that have become protest sites over the last two months. The “farmers’ Republic Day parade” is the outcome of a months-long protest by farm unions against the three farm laws pushed by the Centre, and farmers say their event will be unique.The police said thousands of security personnel have been deployed at several border points to maintain law and order during Tuesday’s parade. The Delhi Traffic Police asked commuters to avoid routes where protesting farmers will conduct the rally.The farmers will also hold tractor marches from four places on the Haryana-Rajasthan border but these won’t enter Delhi.At the Tikri and Singhu border camps, the two largest farmers’ congregation points, farmers were busy preparing for their own Republic Day cultural spectacle. In the coppery light of a fading wintry sun, wheat-grower Manjit Singh Brar flashed a ‘V’ sign as he mounted a flagstaff on his glimmering brass-and-chrome-lined tractor.Wearing a turban in the colours of the national flag, he then roared on a video call: “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” (hail soldiers, hail farmers), a popular slogan coined by the country’s second prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri.Yogendra Yadav, one of the organisers of the farmers’ protests, said: “We have always seen Jai Jawan (victory to soldiers) on Republic Day. This time we will see Jai Kisan (victory to farmers) too. This will be a historic occasion.” His comment referred to the official celebrations which ceremoniously figure in a two-hour parade that showcases the country’s military might and cultural diversity.Farmer leaders have appealed to those participating in the tractor parade to carry enough ration for 24 hours and ensure that the rally remains peaceful. “No one should carry any weapon or consume alcohol. Banners carrying provocative messages are not allowed,” a leader said.The farm unions have pressed on with a protest against the Centre, opposing the agricultural laws that ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales, and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. The farmers say the laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.At Singhu and Tikri, which have become virtual tent cities, resembling a fair, with all possible amenities, such as 24-hour tea stalls, music sessions, prayer halls, canteens, gyms, libraries and now tractor fitment-and-polishing centres, the farmers could be seen preparing for the rally.Gulab Singh, who has modified his tractor for ₹600,000, said: “Urban children who have never been to villages will see a glimpse of what farming is like and what rural life is all about.” The vehicle has been flamboyantly decorated and dazzles in chrome, has a 10-speaker stereo system, coordinated LED lights and GPS, which will guide him through his parade route.Each procession of tractors will be led by a car that will act as a pilot vehicle, seating leaders of the movement such as Darshan Pal, Balbir Singh Rajewal and Kavitha Kuruganti.In one trolley, a team of six contortionists will make an acrobatic presentation, each contortion representing a food-crop plant.Farmer-artistes from Bengal have set up a mobile installation to pay a poignant tribute to over 100 farmers who have died in the protests, including Sant Ram Singh, a Sikh cleric who fatally shot himself on December 16. “It will be a major attraction and will pay a tribute to all our farmer brothers who have lost their lives in this agitation,” said Bolin Bhattacharya, who refused to reveal details of the artwork, preferring to keep it a surprise.Tableaux of folk dances of Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan will be led by women, said Revati, a farmer who goes by one name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stage-set-for-mega-tractor-rally-parliament-march-on-feb-1-101611602868064.html

26-01-2021||India||India seventh most affected by climate change in 2019 globally: Report||India was the seventh most-affected by the devastating impact of climate change globally in 2019 according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021 released on Monday.India was preceded by Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Bahamas, Japan, Malawi and Afghanistan in the list of countries most affected by the impacts of extreme weather events in 2019, the report by Germanwatch, a Bonn-based environmental organisation said.Between 2000 and 2019, over 475,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of more than 11,000 extreme weather events globally and losses amounted to around US $2.56 trillion (in purchasing power parities).The report was released just ahead of the Global Adaptation Summit hosted by Netherlands wherein UN secretary general Antonio Guterres is likely to call upon developed countries and donor agencies to increase funding to adaptation measures of developing countries.Also Read: Joe Biden talks transatlantic ties, Covid-19, climate change with Boris JohnsonIn 2019, monsoon continued for a month longer than normal in India. From June to the end of September 2019, 110% of the long-period average was recorded. Flooding caused by heavy rain was responsible for 1,800 deaths across 14 states and led to the displacement of 1.8 million people. Overall, 11.8 million people were affected by the intense monsoon with the economic damage estimated to be US $10 billion. There were eight tropical cyclones in India. Six of the eight cyclones intensified to become “very severe.” Extremely severe cyclone Fani affected 28 million people, killing nearly 90 people in India and Bangladesh, and causing economic losses of US $8.1 billion, the report said.The Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) analyses quantified impacts of extreme weather events both in terms of the fatalities and economic losses. It doesn’t however consider slow-onset events like rising sea levels, glacier melting or ocean warming and acidification. The index is based on data from the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE. The most recent data available for 2019 and from 2000 to 2019 was taken into account.Six of the 10 countries most affected from 2000 to 2019 belong to the low to lower-middle income category. Climate impacts affect people in developing countries disproportionately, threatening lives and livelihoods, the report highlighted, adding that international climate financing has remained inadequate. In 2018, a total of US $78.9 billion was provided and mobilised. But the goal to mobilise US $100 billion annually from 2020 onwards, which, in 2009, developed countries agreed to provide for developing countries to finance mitigation and adaptation efforts remains unfulfilled.“The global Covid-19 pandemic has reiterated the fact that vulnerable countries are exposed to various types of risk—climatic, geophysical, economic and health-related—and that vulnerability is systemic and interconnected,” said Laura Schaefer of Germanwatch. “It is therefore important to address these interconnections. Strengthening the climate resilience of countries is a crucial part of this challenge. The Climate Adaptation Summit offers the opportunity to take an important step in this direction,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seventh-most-affected-by-climate-change-in-2019-globally-report-101611552192319.html

26-01-2021||Today's||The Allahabad High Court stands up for personal liberty||Indian laws — and the Indian State — have a long history of unwarranted interference in the private lives of individuals. One of the most egregious examples of this is the Special Marriage Act (SMA). It requires couples to notify marriage officers one month in advance of their marriage, and for marriage officers to publicise such a notification. SMA also allows for any person to “object” to the marriage on the basis that it (allegedly) violates provisions of the Act. It has been seen — repeatedly — that these provisions have allowed hostile families, as well as other groups, to interfere with the decision of individuals to marry, and pressure, browbeat, and coerce them to change their minds. This has been especially true of inter-faith marriages.The basic issue is straightforward. If two individuals have taken the deeply personal — and intimate — decision to marry each other, it is not for anyone else — and especially not for vigilante groups — to interfere with that choice. But it is precisely this kind of extra-legal interference that is facilitated, and indeed, encouraged, by laws with reporting requirements of this kind.However, in this context, a recent judgment of the Allahabad High Court, in Safiya Sultana v State of UP, assumes great significance. It was specifically contended in the case that because of ongoing issues surrounding the implementation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversions Ordinance (popularly known as the “love jihad law”), the provisions of SMA required authoritative interpretation.Justice Vivek Chaudhary observed that as SMA had been passed in 1954, it was important for the court to examine whether the social and legal landscape had changed in the intervening years. Relying on a Law Commission Report that had observed that SMA’s notice requirement led to “high handed or unwarranted interference”, which often took the form of social boycotts and harassment, and on numerous Supreme Court judgments that had emphasised the importance of individual autonomy and privacy in questions of marriage, he held that it was clear that the Constitution mandated “personal liberty and privacy to be fundamental rights including within their sphere right to choose partner without interference from State, family or society”.In this context, given the social interference that was facilitated and sanctioned by the notice requirements of SMA, Justice Chaudhary held that those requirements would have to be read as voluntary, not mandatory. In other words, if a couple marrying under SMA did not want their details to be made public, they could not be compelled to do so.As a significant number of marriages under SMA are inter-faith, the impact of this judgment cannot be understated.The judgment of the Allahabad High Court represents an important judicial pushback against the dominant ideology of State interference in questions of marriage, including by empowering social and vigilante groups.SMA’s notice requirements, of course, are not new. As the court observed, they were present at the very beginning, when the original SMA was introduced in 1872. However, arguably, it is these notice requirements that have formed the baseline of further intrusions (the infamous “love jihad” ordinance also has a similar notice requirement, and indeed, goes further by empowering the police to investigate into the “genuineness” of a religious conversion).What is most important is what they signify — notice and reporting requirements convey a message to the world that decisions of the most intimate character are not for the individual to make, but must be ratified by society (which, in practical terms, means the dominant members of society). In practice, they leave individuals and couples with a stark choice — face the possibility of social persecution and violence, or give up your freedoms. These are not choices that a constitutional democracy should be asking its citizens to make.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-allahabad-high-court-stands-up-for-personal-liberty-101611584175250.html
26-01-2021||Today's||A roadmap to reform democracy||The new American President, Joe Biden, has announced his intention to host a summit of democracies in the first year of office. The growing democracy deficit in the world is bothering the world’s oldest democracy — the United States (US).Joseph Story, a renowned American jurist, warned long ago that the “Constitution has been reared for immortality, if the work of man may justly aspire to such a title. It may, nevertheless, perish in an hour by the folly, or corruption, or negligence of its only keepers, the people”. Happenings in America in the last couple of years indicate that there are no “American people” anymore. It is a deeply divided society today.The Democrats want to pass on the blame to Donald Trump’s presidency. It cannot be denied that Trump’s tenure saw schisms exacerbate in American society. They culminated in the violent incursions at the Capitol Hill by Trump’s supporters on January 6, when the Congress was in session to ratify votes for the presidential election. Trump cannot completely shrug off responsibility for the happenings on that day as his tweet a few days before — “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” — turned out to be a major catalyst for mass mobilisation and violence on the fateful day.Critics argue that Democrats too carry some blame for the violent incidents across several cities during the Black Lives Matter movement last year. Antifa, which played a role in the movement, is seen to have turned a just cause into a polarising prejudice through violence. Biden did condemn Antifa and violence. Yet, the Democrats cannot escape part of the responsibility for the deep divisions in the American society today. In fact, the unusually high support that Trump got in the election — over 70 million votes — was partly due to people’s anger against the double standards of the Democrats too. Biden may first have to fix his own democracy before embarking on addressing the global democratic deficit.That does not mean the concerns flagged by Biden are misplaced. A new wave of populist movements is challenging the very foundations of democracies, from the oldest democracy in America to the largest democracy in India. The agitation by the farmers against the three agri-reform laws of the Narendra Modi government is a case in question. Dissent is an integral part of democracy. But as Ambedkar warned in his last address to the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949, the methods of dissent must be constitutional. “If you wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, .... the first thing in my judgement we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. It means that we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. It means that we must abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha. These methods are nothing but the grammar of anarchy”, Ambedkar had warned.The revolts witnessed in America and India by small groups have the potential to lead to two consequences. One, democratic systems will weaken further.Two, out of that anarchy will rise authoritarians and despots. Either way, the loser will be the democratic world. The time has come for us to revisit the functioning of democratic institutions and effect important reforms to defeat these forces.By their very nature, democracies are majoritarian. The Greek states, where the concept of democracy was born, had practised a brutish version of majoritarianism. The great philosopher, Socrates, was awarded death sentence in an open court through popular assent, forcing Plato to denounce Greek democracies as kleptocracies.From there, we have travelled quite a distance. Democracies developed checks and balances in the form of the elected parliaments on the one side and unelected institutions on the other. While elected bodies are meant to be the voice of the majorities, non-elected bodies such as the judiciary, media and other public institutions are expected to be the refuge for the non-majorities.Not that the majorities are always wrong — the three farm bills of the Modi government are an absolute necessity today. But parliamentary majorities are facing a non-majority backlash. It is here that non-elected institutions such as the judiciary and media have to play a balancing role. The danger is when they also come to be perceived as the voices of the majority and against non-majorities. People will then resort to methods that Ambedkar rejected as unconstitutional.The reform that democracies need today is two-fold. First, elected institutions need to become less majoritarian and more consensual. Second, there is a need to build a stronger non-elected institutional framework for greater balancing.Gandhi feared that for a country such as India, democracies could end up as mobocracies. That was why he used to insist upon the concept of Ram Rajya. Gandhi’s Ram Rajya was a non-majoritarian democracy, where the minutest minority too has its voice heard. Ambedkar used to insist that without social democracy, political democracy is bound to fail. By social democracy, what he meant was not just participation but a sense of stakeholdership of different sections of society in the decision-making process. Ram Rajya and social democracy are concepts worth revisiting at this juncture to avert the challenges and enhance the efficacy of our democratic institutions.Ram Madhav is a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and director, India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-roadmap-to-reform-democracy-101611583336608.html
26-01-2021||Editorials||Ensure justice for child sexual abuse survivors | HT Editorial||The Bombay High Court ruling that a man who molested a 12-year-old child could not be held guilty under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, on the grounds that there was no disrobing involved, sets a dangerous precedent in cases of child sexual abuse. Justice P Ganediwala held that since there was no skin-to-skin contact, this did not fall within the ambit of Pocso. The accused has been convicted only under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code for outraging the modesty of the girl, which carries a minimum sentence of one year as opposed to a minimum of three years under the Pocso Act.The ruling is disturbing. It is a literal interpretation of the law and overlooks the fact that Pocso does not mention clothing as a factor in the crime of molesting a child. This is a matter of violating the bodily integrity of the victim. The interpretation also does not recognise the long-term psychological damage that child sexual abuse victims suffer.This reading of the law will dilute cases of child abuse and make it difficult to ensure justice. The National Commission of Women has pointed out that the order will have a cascading impact on women safety and trivialised the legal architecture in place, and has decided, rightly so, to challenge the order. The National Commission of Protection of Child Rights has asked the Maharashtra government to appeal against the judgment too. This must be done promptly. The issue should also force a relook at the wording of the Act and other laws, which deal with child abuse. There can be no room for ambiguity in child abuse cases and any loophole which allows for this must be plugged at once.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/ensure-justice-for-child-sexual-abuse-survivors-hteditorial-101611583636633.html
26-01-2021||Editorials||Celebrating the Republic | HT Editorial||As India marks its 72nd Republic Day, it is instructive to go back to the scale of achievement of the founding moment of modern Indian constitutionalism. In 1950, after a deliberative process in the Constituent Assembly — its proceedings make for fascinating reading and continue to startle scholars and observers with the breadth and ambition of the vision at hand — India formally adopted its Constitution. This document took the best of constitutional schemes elsewhere, but it was also devised with India’s specific requirements in mind and represented a rupture.Bruised and battered by colonialism, India was to be sovereign. A modern democratic State was institutionalised. Universal adult franchise, in a society of stark social and economic inequality, enabled political equality. Parliament, popularly elected, would express the sovereign will of the people. India would be a Union of states — in recognition of its diversity and recognition that the Centre alone could not govern a country of India’s size and diversity. The word secular was added to the Preamble only later (in controversial circumstances during the Emergency). But there is little doubt that the spirit of secularism permeated through the Constitution — the State would not have a religion; it would not discriminate on the basis of religion; and Indian citizens, irrespective of their religious beliefs, would exercise equal rights. In recognition of the entrenched structural inequalities, the Constitution had provisions for affirmative action for marginalised groups. With fundamental rights, including the right to free speech, individual liberty was made a key pillar of India’s political design. And institutions, including an independent judiciary, were to keep a check on executive excesses.This liberal democratic design has served India well. But the Republic can only work well if all pillars of the Constitution function in letter and spirit. This has been a particularly difficult period — with Indian sovereignty challenged in eastern Ladakh; an increasing perception that the nature of the Indian State is transforming from a secular one to a majoritarian set-up; questions about the role of institutions and the erosion of civil liberties; and the federal structure coming under stress. It is time for India to return to the spirit — not just the letter — of the Constitution and reaffirm its commitment to safeguarding constitutional values on this Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/celebrating-the-republic-hteditorial-101611583155152.html
