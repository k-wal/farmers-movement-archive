21-01-2021||Noida||Awareness drive begins to reduce mishaps on Yamuna Expressway||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority (Yeida), along with the traffic police, on Thursday started an awareness drive for commuters to reduce accidents on the Yamuna Expressway.The awareness drive is part of the ongoing road safety month that started on January 19 and will end on February 17. Arun Vir Singh, Yeida CEO, has directed the staff to remove all hoardings and take effective measures so that the road accidents can be reduced on the expressway. According to the officials, the expressway has witnessed at least 750 deaths since it opened in August 2012.Yeida organized an event for road safety at Jewar toll plaza. “We have decided to intensify the awareness campaign about safety of the motorists. The violation of traffic rules on road often leads to accidents affecting the lives of many. And if we follow the traffic rules, then we can help in reducing the road accidents,” said Singh.Yeida has roped in some private agencies, which will send 18 lakh messages to make people aware about the precautions for road safety.“These messages will be sent in a month’s time and the firms will send these messages under their social obligation. Pamphlets will be distributed to commuters at toll plazas to make people aware about road safety. Apart from this, we have directed the e-way operator to take all measures to avoid the accidents,” said Singh, who also directed the enforcement wing to conduct inspection along the expressway.The data provided by Yeida shows that 45% of accidents are a result of drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Also, speeding and violation of traffic rules account for 19% and 11% accidents, respectively, on the expressway, the data shows. The stationary vehicles on the expressway have also been found as a major cause of accidents. Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh also participated in the month-long drive. “Drinking and driving is also one of the major causes of accident on Yamuna Expressway. We should take pledge to avoid breaking the rules on roads,” said the MLA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/awareness-drive-begins-to-reduce-mishaps-on-yamuna-expressway-101611253651007.html
21-01-2021||Noida||Installation of crash barriers on Yamuna E-way: Agency to be hired on Jan 27||GREATER NOIDA: The Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), operator of the Yamuna Expressway, is likely to finalise an agency on January 27 for the installation work of crash barriers on the two sides of divider on the 165km expressway. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida), the monitoring agency, on Thursday said it will make sure that the work on the ₹75 crore project starts at the earliest as the crash barrier will help in providing safety to commuters on the expressway. In December last year, JIL had issued a tender inviting bids for the project.“We have directed JIL to start installation of the crash barrier in February after selection of an agency on January 27. We do not want this to be delayed because providing the safety to motorists is of utmost priority,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.Yeida had, in August 2018, hired Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi for conducting the safety audit of the expressway that passes through six districts of Uttar Pradesh that include Gautam Budh Nagar, Aligarh, Mahtura, Hathras, Agra and Bulandshahr. In March 2019, IIT-Delhi had submitted its initial report suggesting several measures.“We have already implemented the 80% recommendations made by the IIT-Delhi. Under the remaining 20% safety measures, we need to install crash barriers, increase the number of high definition cameras and some other steps. These steps will be taken up at the earliest,” said Santosh Panwar, a JIL spokesperson.The expressway operator will spend ₹75 crore on crash barrier installation and ₹2 crore on installation of cameras at 20 more locations, the officials said. So far, JIL has installed CCTV cameras at 10 locations. In case of an accident, the crash barrier stops a vehicle from going to other side, preventing multiple accidents, said the Yeida officials. Following criticism from the Supreme Court on a petition seeking motorists’ safety on the expressway in early 2018, the Uttar Pradesh government had directed officials concerned to beef up enforcement to contain speeding and other traffic violations to check the incidents of accidents.“We are taking adequate steps to provide safety and working to implement suggestions of the safety audit,” said Panwar.The seven points suggested (by IIT Delhi) in the draft report are additional signage (distance bar markings) before the exit ramps, remove lane system, installation of rumble strips at the entry and exit ramps, installation of crash attenuators at the exit ramps, audible shoulder marking throughout the corridor, remove all sign posts from the shoulder, shoulder guard rail to be reinstalled as per the standard specifications and replacement of raised median (divider) with flush median and central guard rail as per the standard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/installation-of-crash-barriers-on-yamuna-e-way-agency-to-be-hired-on-jan-27-101611253470983.html

Officials said on Thursday that they have increased vaccination centres to 31 (from 26 decided earlier) to cover more people.The officials also said that the present stock of Covishield vaccine will be able to cater to two doses each for the 11,846 beneficiaries. The district on January 14 had received 2,741 vials, each having 10 doses, from the vaccine reserve at Meerut. Ghaziabad had achieved 94.75% target during the inaugural session held on January 16 when 379 of 400 beneficiaries took the shots. “The 11,846 beneficiaries will be equally vaccinated on each of three days during the next round of vaccination. The vaccination sessions will be held at 31 centres on all three days. Those who have missed the inaugural session on January 16 will be able to get the vaccine in the second round. We aim to achieve more than 94.75% coverage which we achieved during the inaugural session,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The district has also prepared a “micro plan” in which it is listed that 40 sessions each will be held on January 22 and 28, while 39 sessions will be held across all centres on January 29, the officials said, adding that 100 beneficiaries will be vaccinated in each session. With this, the district aims to vaccinate 4,000 health-care workers on January 22 and 28, while 3,900 will be inoculated on January 29. Officials of the district health department said that there were nine cases reported after the inaugural session under the adverse event following immunization (AEFI) but none of them faced any severe conditions. “The nine incidents reported under AEFI were those who complained of mild fever, headache, myalgia, etc., and the symptoms subsided. These were minor AEFI incidents. For better coverage in coming rounds, we have held meetings with health-care workers and associations, and intend to vaccinate maximum of the listed beneficiaries,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The district during the inaugural session exhausted 40 vials of Covishield vaccine while the rest of the stock was despatched to the vaccination centres on Thursday. State officials said that they had received about 911,000 doses under the second round while they had received about 1,075,000 doses before the start of inaugural session. “So, we have received about 2 million doses so far. It is estimated that we have about 855,000 to 900,000 health-care workers and two doses to each of them will be about 1.8 million doses. So, we have sufficient stock available. Those who have missed the inaugural session will be able to participate in the second round,” said Alok Kumar, UP’s principal secretary (health). During the inaugural session on January 16, a total of 22,643 out of 31,700 listed health-care workers were vaccinated across 317 centres with a coverage of about 71%, and 98 events of AEFI were also reported from across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-vaccinate-4-000-health-care-workers-across-31-centres-today-101611253470480.html

Officials said these consumers have not deposited any amount against their electricity bills in the last two years, officials said.In the first week of December last year, the discom has called off its disconnection drive against another 65,000 consumers for not clearing their outstanding power dues of ₹3.25 crore, upon instructions by state energy minister Shrikant Sharma.PVVNL chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that these 12,000 defaulter consumers have been identified by the discom’s portal. “We had sent mandatory notices to them before launching the crackdown against them. But all our requests for clearing outstanding dues fell on deaf ears. As a result, we started pulling plugs from Wednesday and within three weeks, we’ll disconnect power lines of all those 12,000 major defaulters,” he said.He further said that after the disconnection drive, recovery penalties will be issued against these defaulters to ensure recovery through the legal route. “The PVVNL had been offering many schemes like easy instalments and one-time settlement to them so that defaulters can clear their outstanding bills easily. We had also decided to waive off the interest on their outstanding bills but even then, they didn’t pay any attention. Finally, we had no option other than to pull the plug permanently and initiate legal action against them,” he said. The PVVNL has 3.25 lakh consumers in Gautam Budh Nagar district and the total outstanding dues of these consumers stand at over ₹25 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidadiscom-to-pull-the-plug-on-12-000-consumers-over-outstanding-electricity-bills-101611253411712.html

Delhi government officials said the government is focusing on reducing dropouts. During an international education conference that concluded last week, education directorate officials said 40% of the students who failed to clear class 9 were dropping out of school.Addressing these concerns, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said, “Struggling children who leave the system to pick up jobs outside is where we need to figure out how skill training can come into play, and how we can provide support to them.”Around 52.54% of students in the age group 6-17 years are enrolled in schools run by Delhi government followed by 26.31% which study in private schools.The report also found that only 55.4% of children below six years of age are attending anganwadi centres which provide supplementary nutrition as well as early childhood education to those from working-class families.Delhi’s literacy rate meanwhile is higher than the national average as per the report which stated that effective literacy rate in the capital stood at 88.54%.

Police said it appears gas had been leaking since the night before but the family could not spot it. They said the incident took place when one of the victims went to the kitchen to make tea and lit a matchbox, and the room went up in flames.Munish Chauhan, station house officer, Bisrakh police station, said the incident took place around 6am. Twenty-five-old Rubi was home with her two sons Jigar, 8, and Love, 4, while her husband, Laxman, was at work. Their three relatives – Chandni, 20, along with her son Guddu, 4, and Muskan, 18 – were also sleeping in the same room.The SHO said that Rubi allegedly went to the stove to prepare tea. “Since the gas had already spread in the room, it swiftly caught fire. All six persons in the room received burn injuries,” he said. Locals and the police later doused the fire and sent the victims to the community health centre in Bisrakh. Doctors later referred the six to the district hospital in Noida for better treatment. Police said the cylinder did not burst during the incident. The SHO said five of the victims were discharged after treatment as they were not critically injured. “Rubi has received serious burn injuries and is admitted to the district hospital. The family has not filed any complaint in this regard,” said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/six-of-family-injured-as-lpg-cylinder-catches-fire-in-bisrakh-village-one-critical-101611253351437.html
21-01-2021||Noida||Noida: Residents suffer as Sector 63 park turns into dump yard||Noida: Residents of Bahlolpur colony in Sector 63 have alleged that the area’s only park has become a garbage dumping site due to apathy of the Noida authority. The residents said that garbage is also dumped at different spots along roadside. They also stated that the garbage is often set afire, and that despite several complaints, the issue persists. “The entire park, along with several road stretches such as near Bahlolpur underpass, Chijarsi road, Pushta road to count a few, are hardly ever cleaned and over the time have been converted into a dump yard. There are no dustbins and some miscreants often set the garbage at the roadside on fire. We are suffering the mismanagement by the authority that seldom collects the garbage,” said Sonu Yadav, vice-president of Bahlolpur RWA, Sector 63. He added that while the children’s play area in the park is full of solid waste, the rising stink from the park dissuades parents from sending their wards to the park. “The wind often carries foul smell from the garbage in the park or on roadside to our houses. The condition is very unhygienic. There used to be some big dustbins in the park, but most of them were removed. The authority’s sanitation workers do come daily to collect waste from houses, but nobody comes to remove the garbage from the roadsides,” said Paramveer Singh, president of Bahlolpur RWA. Another resident stated that despite several complaints no action had been taken. “There are a number of makeshift colonies in the region, mostly occupied by scrap dealers. They throw the waste on their wish and often set it afire,” said Ranbir Singh, a resident of sector 63. According to Noida authority officials, the garbage collection is happening from each area, but a number of residents especially the villagers in several colonies do improper disposal. “We will get the area cleaned in the next three days and ensure that solid waste is removed from all such spots, including the park. But there are also issues such as lack of awareness. A number of residents, especially the tenants in the colonies, often throw garbage as per their convenience, and many do this to save ₹50 that is charged every month for door-to-door collection,” said IP Singh, officer on special duty (health), Noida authority. Noida generates around 700 tonnes of domestic waste daily. The door-to-door garbage collection covers 220 high-rises with 1,40,000 apartments, about 98 RWAs having 40,000 houses and about 70 small and big villages within the city, the officials said. After collection, the garbage goes to 21 different ‘transfer stations’ of the Noida authority where the unsegregated is separated manually with help of ragpickers and later sent to the main storage facility at Sector 145.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-suffer-as-sector-63-park-turns-into-dump-yard-101611253350387.html
21-01-2021||Noida||Farmers at UP Gate, Chilla border reject govt proposal of temporary suspension of farm laws; protest to continue||Noida/Ghaziabad: Protesting farmers stationed at border areas of Ghaziabad and Noida refused to end their agitation, saying they have not accepted the government’s offer of temporary suspension of the three farm laws. They said they will not budge till the government completely withdraws these laws which “aim to benefit corporates and not farmers”.During the tenth round of talks on Wednesday, the government had proposed to stay the implementation of the three laws for one-and-a-half years and the farmer union leaders are to reply to the proposal during the next meeting scheduled on January 22. In the wake of this offer, a detailed meeting was held at the Singhu Border to discuss the proposal. On Thursday as well, farmer union leaders held day-long discussions over the government’s proposal. “We still demand repeal of the three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price (MSP). All protest sites are together and core-committee members are busy discussing the proposal at the Singhu border. They will decide about the reply to be given to the government on January 22. The government has given a proposal and we have not accepted it,” said Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is stationed at UP Gate. He said that the proposed tractor parade on Republic Day will be held. The farmers had proposed that the route will be the outer Ring Road of Delhi. Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Bhanu faction on Thursday rehearsed for the rally.Farmers have been stationed at the Chilla border and the Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida, and the UP Gate in Ghaziabad since last year demanding a complete rollback of the three new farm laws.The Supreme Court on January 12 had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and also directed for the formation of a committee.Protest sites were abuzz Thursday morning with farmers holding discussions in their tents, on their tractors and trolleys and on roads.“The committee during its meeting decided that the proposal put forward by the government is not acceptable. The farmers’ union leaders will meet government representatives on Friday and will convey the decision taken today by our committee. Majority of farmers protesting at different sites were demanding repeal of laws and new law on MSP,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand who attended the core-committee meeting at Singhu border on Thursday. “It was also decided that the tractor parade will be held and some committees have also been formed to take up preparations,” he added.Rakesh Kumar, pradhan of Parsauli village in Mathura, who had come with a group of villagers, said, “We are of the view that the government wants us to end the protest and return. If the protest is called off, farmers will disintegrate and after one-and-a-half years, it will become difficult to bring them again at a common platform, in case the government wishes to implement the laws again”. He said he donated ₹3.51 lakh to the protesting farmers at UP Gate.“Farmers should not go back. With the proposal it seems that the government is feeling the heat of such massive protests. People are supporting farmers like anything. On Wednesday we went across to our village and people donated ₹10, ₹20, ₹50 and even more as per their capacity. So, the farmers also have the support of people in villages and must continue the protest,” said Leela Dhar, a 75-year-old member of Rakesh Kumar’s group from Mathura. At the Chilla border, Thakur Bhanu Pratap, president BKU-Bhanu, said he wonders why the government suspended these laws for only one-a-half-year years instead of withdrawing them permanently. “The Supreme Court staying the implementation of the contentious farm laws is a clear message for the government that these laws are not good for farmers. If our petition had no merit, the apex court would have rejected it. The government should admit that these laws were wrongly framed and that they should be withdrawn,” he said.He said he had sent a team to Singhu border for Thursday’s meeting. “We have received information that the Sankyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farm unions, has rejected the government’s proposal. I am yet to meet my team members who had gone to a meeting held in Delhi. But it is now clear that the protest will continue till the farm laws are repealed,” he said. Master Shyoraj Singh, BKU-Lokshakti president, said the government had proposed to form a committee in the initial meetings as well. “The government should repeal the laws and promise MSPs on crops. If the government does not agree, we are resolved to fight longer,” he said. He said that the farmers are readying for the tractor rally on Republic Day.He said that as of now, the protest will continue. “We want the government to completely cancel these laws,” he said.Gaurav Tikait, another BKU leader at UP Gate and president of the youth wing, said that farmers are now fighting for their honour. “There were many terms used against farmers and now it is a fight for our honour. The government’s proposal seems vague and intended to derail the agitation. Every common farmer understands this. Even if not for the farm laws, farmers were inclined to hold protests demanding a new law on MSP and implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report. So, we are inclined to continue,” he added. The UP Gate has many camps run by NGOs, social organisations and other entities. A group of veterans from the Indian Army and other paramilitary forces is also camping at the site since December 16.“It seems that the government is under pressure and these are positive signs. What we feel is that the farmers should continue their protest and the government will finally budge and take back three laws. So, there should be no going back home till the three laws are rolled back,” said Manidev Chaturvedi, a retired inspector from the Border Security Force.Retired Hawaldar Desa Singh, who is from Pilibhit and served during the 1965 and 1971 wars, came to UP Gate to support the farmers, saying that farmers have already braved adverse weather and stiff opposition from the government so far. “Now, there is no going back. If farmers return, the protest will disintegrate. There should be a resolution and there is no going back,” he added. Subedar Major (retired) JP Mishra, the founder and national president of the Veterans’ Association, said that the conditions farmers were facing were dangerous.“If the new laws get implemented, the corporates will get a better hold on them. We came here as most of us are from farming backgrounds. Our group has people who have joined from different cities in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Haryana,” he added at UP Gate.A farmer, Kali Charan Chaturvedi from Firozabad, had come to the Chilla border protest site with a ‘gada’ (blunt mace) at the Chilla border. “Gada was Hanuman’s weapon which used for victory over Lanka. I have planned to use the gada for farmers’ victory against farm laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/farmers-at-up-gate-chilla-border-reject-govt-proposal-of-temporary-suspension-of-farm-laws-protest-to-continue-101611253290939.html

The tunnel will be constructed approximately at a depth of 14 to 16 metres.”He added, “The alignment of the tunnel runs along the Outer Ring Road and is below the multi-storied built up structures. All necessary safety precautions are being taken while constructing the tunnel below built up structures by monitoring the ground movements with highly sensitive instruments fixed on nearby structures.”DMRC officials said that about 27km of underground section will be constructed in the corridors approved so far under Phase-IV. The Janakpuri West-RK Ashram Marg corridor will have underground sections of 7.74 kilometres in total.In Phase 3, when about 50 kilometres of underground sections were built, about 30 TBMs were pressed into service in the national capital, Dayal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dmrc-starts-first-tunnelling-work-at-vikaspuri-under-phase-iv-expansion-101611252990963.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Elderly man held for role in fraudulently obtaining ₹2 crore bank loan||Delhi Police’s economic offences wing (EOW) has arrested an elderly man for his alleged connivance in fraudulently obtaining a loan of ₹2 crore from a nationalised bank in Delhi by submitting forged and fabricated property documents. The forgery had come to light in 2015 and main accused and the mastermind behind the forgery, Satish Sharma, has already been arrested by the police.Police have identified the man arrested on Wednesday as 64-year-old Suresh Kumar Pruthi, a resident of Sonepat, Haryana. Joint commissioner of police (EOW) OP Mishra said the forgery had come to light in 2015 when an assistant general manager of the nationalised bank, from its branch on Parliament Street, alleged that Sharma had taken a loan of ₹2 crore from the bank to purchase a school, Bramshakti Model School, in Sonepat. The loan was secured by mortgaging a property in Narender Nagar area of Sonepat as collateral, Mishra said.“Later, it was found that Sharma has already availed of another loan of ₹4 crore from another public-sector bank in Mayapuri, Delhi, by mortgaging the same property. The fact regarding the mortgaging of the same property to the other bank was not disclosed by Sharma. On this, the bank gave a police complaint against Sharma,” Mishra said.The officer said during investigation, it was revealed that the documents of the Narender Nagar property submitted by Sharma to the bank as security did not match with the record at the sub-registrar’s office in Sonepat. “Following years of probe, Sharma was arrested last August. Further investigation revealed that one Suresh Pruthi who originally sold that property to Sharma in 1998 has also signed forged papers of sale deed of the same property on which Sharma availed of the loan of ₹2 crore,” the joint commissioner said.Further searches were conducted and Pruthi was also arrested on Wednesday, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elderly-man-held-for-role-in-fraudulently-obtaining-2-crore-bank-loan-101611252990249.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt hands over cheques amounting to ₹7.48 crore to 307 sportspersons||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday distributed cheques worth ₹7.48 crore among 307 sportspersons as financial assistance, and urged them to make the capital city proud by their achievements in the field of sports.Sisodia said the Delhi government is ensuring world-class training as well as nutritional requirement of young sportspersons. “Sports play a crucial role in education. On the one hand, Delhi has been at the top in school games for the past three years. On the other hand, it is receiving accolades for its improved education system. NITI Aayog, a central government agency, ranked Delhi government schools the best in the country. This is a proud achievement for Delhi,” he said.Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, said under the Delhi government’s “Play and Progress” scheme, financial assistance of ₹2 lakh is provided to sportspersons under 14 categories and ₹3 lakh is provided to sportspersons under another 17 categories. “The Delhi government provides assistance of up to ₹16 lakh to talented sportspersons from Delhi. It is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s dream that every student plays at least one sport, and every talented sportsperson gets all kinds of assistance from the government to excel. That is why the Delhi government is running different schemes to promote sports and prepare sportspersons to win medals,” he said.Outlining the achievements of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the field of education, a statement released by the deputy CM’s office said, “The Delhi government has done a lot of work to improve sports infrastructure in the city. There are 17 operational swimming pools under the sports branch and eight are under construction. There are many synthetic athletic tracks, synthetic hockey turfs, archery fields, and other sports facilities that are already operational. Two sports hostels with training facilities have also been sanctioned at the cost of approximately ₹100 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-hands-over-cheques-amounting-to-7-48-crore-to-307-sportspersons-101611252933334.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Curtailed by pandemic, the Republic Day parade is different this year||Many events that were a regular feature of the Republic Day Celebrations in the national capital will be missing this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures put in place to contain its spread, said government officials.One prominent event that drew crowds and cheers – stunts on motorcycles by the army and the personnel of the paramilitary forces – have been cancelled this year. The veterans’ parade by ex-servicemen and women, too, has been knocked off the programme chart, and so is the parade by recipients of the national bravery awards. In the 2020 Republic Day parade, veterans as old as 99 and 100 years had participated in the parade and the motorcycle stunts were performed by women officers of the Central Reserve Police Force.Government officials, who did not wish to be named, said these events were cancelled because the elderly and children are more susceptible to contract Covid-19. “There will be no enclosure for schoolchildren this year either. The total number of the enclosures has also been reduced -- from 36 to 22. The number of attendees will be 25,000 as against 150,000 until last year. Only 4,000 entries will be through tickets, the others would be invitation-based. The motorcycle stunt event was cancelled as it involved the participants sitting closely together and supporting each other while staying in close proximity on moving motorcycles,” said a senior official involved in the Republic Day arrangements.The official further said no children below the age of 15 years would be allowed at the venue on the India Gate lawns on January 26. Unlike the 12X12 format of the marching contingent with 124 participants, the format this year is 8X12, with only 96 participants.“Not just the spectators but the number of media persons has also been reduced from 300 to 100. The workers on the lawns are currently being tested at the Covid booth set up at the venue. Police personnel who will be at the gates and in charge of frisking will be wearing personal protective equipment suits and will carry thermal scanners. Officers from the security unit, who will guard the VIPs, will undergo Covid-19 testing and are already in quarantine for seven days before the Republic Day function,” a second official, privy to the arrangement details, said.Also, this year, instead of a gallery (benches arranged in rows and raised on platforms) for spectators, the ministry of defence has arranged for chairs -- so that they can be kept apart on the lawns to ensure a distance of six feet between spectators. “Another change is that only the tableaux will go to the Red Fort. The parade will culminate at the National Stadium at the C-Hexagon of India Gate,” the second official said.But there is an addition as well this year. At least 122 soldiers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces will be taking part in the parade. According to a press statement issued by the High Commission of India in Dhaka, this is only the third time since Independence that a foreign military contingent has been invited to participate in the national parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/curtailed-by-pandemic-the-republic-day-parade-is-different-this-year-101611252930829.html

While Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta claimed unaccounted funds of ₹26,000 crore in the water utility, the AAP hit back saying the allegation was completely “bogus and frivolous”. The BJP demanded a two-day-long special session of the Delhi assembly to discuss the issue. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Gupta said, “ ₹26,000 crore was transferred from Delhi government’s account to DJB’s accounts in the last five years, but the government is not ready to give any account for this amount.”In a statement, the AAP said, “It’s not even clear what scam are they referring to? The truth is that BJP is completely rattled by the ₹2500 crore scam uncovered by the AAP in the MCD, and is indulging in trash talk to only distract the public attention from this issue.”While Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that the party will start a door-to-door campaign to tell people in this regard, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the allegations are “very serious”The AAP said the opposition party knows the writing on the wall, referring to the MCD polls scheduled next year. “The allegation by BJP is completely bogus and frivolous. If there was any scam in DJB, BJP would have already unleased the Delhi Police, CBI and Anti Corruption Bureau but they instead chose to talk to media. BJP knows the writing is on the wall and that the people of Delhi are going to vote for the AAP in the upcoming MCD elections, giving a historic mandate,” the party said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-bjp-spar-over-allegations-of-financial-irregularities-101611252930316.html
21-01-2021||Other||SDMC may allow only five food carts per ward, provide permanent licence||New Delhi: The BJP-ruled South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Wednesday proposed to provide permanent licences to at least five smart food eateries, including food trucks, vans, e-carts in each municipal ward, officials said on Wednesday. The opposition AAP criticised the move, saying the scheme will lead to chaos on roads. The SDMC House passed the proposal on Wednesday with the officials saying that a policy will be drafted to fix licence fee and lay down other modalities. “Keeping in view the revenue of the corporation as well as employment avenues in 104 wards in the jurisdiction of SDMC, it is proposed that a licence process for selling and serving food items through e-food cart, food truck and bus as well as having new restaurants ideas of these types (such as aeroplane, train, double-decked bus) be issued… lands of corporations and other institutions lying vacant can be put to good use,” the proposal passed by SDMC read. It was moved by BJP councillor from Malviya Nagar, Nandini Sharma.Sharma said the scheme is at a “nascent stage” and its modalities are yet to be worked out. “It will be a good source of income to the corporation,” she said.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior SDMC official said applicants will have to produce a no-objection-certificate (NOC) from the traffic department at the time of application to ensure that the cart or food truck will not hinder traffic movement in the area. “We will take all necessary steps to keep the application process hassle-free. While issuing licences we will also make sure that such eateries do not become a traffic nuisance. The civic body’s licensing department will be the only authority to issue the permit,” the official said.Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said the scheme is aimed at promoting self-employment among people and that the corporation will “organise” such eateries that are running illegally. “Such food vans or e-food carts are already operating illegally in many areas of the city. They do not have any kind of permit and hence create chaos on roads. Under this scheme, we aim to resolve this problem and legalise and organise such food joints. We will cap the number of such carts to five per ward, so it does not create chaos in the area. Plus, SDMC will also get additional revenue with this move,” Chawla said. Reacting to the proposal, senior AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj said the initiative will only lead to chaos on streets. He also alleged that the civic body has given “power of issuing licence to councillors” which would lead to corruption.“Before leaving the MCD, the BJP wants to monetise every inch of land in the city. The BJP-ruled MCD is trying to set up permanent restaurants on all the land available under its jurisdiction. A condition of the scheme is that permission for these restaurants can be taken from the local councillor. This is ample indication that the BJP-ruled MCD is trying to give absolute powers to the local councillor so that he or she can earn crores of money,” Bharadwaj alleged.He further said that earlier the central government had formulated the Street Vendors’ Protection Act. As per this law, the authorities were to identify all street vendors and issue licences for shops in their respective zones but that did not happen, Bharadwaj said.Reacting to AAP allegations, Chawla stressed that there will be no chaos on roads as applicants will have to get a no objection certificate from the traffic department. “The AAP is levelling baseless allegations. It has now become their habit that they start a negative propaganda as soon as we try to start something good. The allegations of councillors issuing licences is not true. Licensing process will be completely online and transparent. Councillors can only give recommendations for setting up carts or food vans in their areas,” Chawla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sdmc-may-allow-only-five-food-carts-per-ward-provide-permanent-licence-101611252811279.html

21-01-2021||Delhi||Sharp jump in vaccine turnout in Capital as Delhi hospitals opt for out-of-turn jabs for health staff||The city recorded its highest turnout for the Covid-19 vaccination drive so far, with 5,942 health care workers out of the targeted 8,100 receiving the shot on Thursday. Officials said the 73.36% turnout, a nearly 25 percentage point increase from Wednesday was due largely to the government’s Co-WIN platform being tweaked to allow out-of-turn jabs for registered beneficiaries. With 100 vaccinations on Thursday, the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital became the first major government facility to record a 100% turnout. The highest-ever turnout at a public hospital so far was 95 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Saturday, when the vaccination drive was rolled out nationally.To be sure, private hospitals such as Max-Saket and Sir Ganga Ram hospital have seen 100% turnouts before. “We were able to vaccinate 100% people on Thursday. Of course, the ‘add beneficiary’ function, which allows registered health care workers to get the shot even if their name is not slotted for the day, has helped. Along with that, we are also working on motivating our staff members and we are addressing all their concerns. Those who have already received the vaccines are also motivating others,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. The hospital had administered doses of the coronavirus vaccine to 31 people on Saturday, a number that dropped to 12 on the second day of the drive, and later increased to 35 persons on the third day. Although the turnout at Lady Hardinge Medical College was slightly lower on Thursday, the ‘walk-in’ option has helped it drive up numbers. At the hospital, 69 people were given jabs on Thursday, in comparison to 76 on Tuesday. The hospital, along with Ram Manohar Lohia, was one of the first to allow these out-of-turn shots.“Earlier we had to turn away people who were not on the list of beneficiaries for the day. Now the portal allows us to add beneficiaries as they come to the centre. Now the portal also allows us to register people from our hospital on the spot and administer the shot. There were some contractual employees whose registrations were not completed earlier,” said Dr NN Mathur, director, Lady Hardinge Medical College. Of the 11 revenue districts in Delhi, the highest turnout on Thursday (91.5%) was in north-east Delhi, where 183 out of 200 targeted beneficiaries were vaccinated, followed by south-east district (90.88%) where 727 of 800 beneficiaries were given jabs. The Shahdara district vaccinated 264 (44%) out of a targeted 600 persons — the lowest among the 11 districts, showed government data. The low turnout for the first three days was attributed to hesitance among beneficiaries and several instances of technical glitches which, officials said, were largely fixed by Thursday. So far, 18,795 healthcare workers in Delhi have taken the shots out of a targeted 34,497, reflecting an average turnout of 54.48%, government records showed. While the turnout was 53.3% on the first day of vaccination, it dropped down to 44.2% on Monday. However, with continuing reports of vaccine hesitancy among employees, hospitals have asked senior doctors to take the shot and motivate those working under them to get the jab. “The government is focusing on information campaign to combat the vaccine hesitancy in a big way; the situation should improve within the week. We are asking all the senior doctors to talk to those working under them to address any concern they might have. We will also put up banners with what beneficiaries who have already received the vaccine are saying,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. The hospital, which is one of the six centres administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, has been faced vaccine hesitancy, especially among the resident doctor who wrote to the medical superintendent asking that they be given Covishield. The centres with Covaxin have been seeing a lower turnout than those administering Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. On Thursday, the turnout at centres giving Covaxin shots was 45.67% in comparison to 75.57% at centres giving Covishield shots, government record showed. Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College, said: “The government’s policy to allow centres to administer the vaccines to beneficiaries registered for slots in future dates have helped immensely in increasing the turnout on Thursday. High turnout numbers at this stage will contribute to confidence building among the masses and ensure that the turnout remains decently high in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sharp-jump-in-vaccine-turnout-in-capital-as-delhi-hospitals-opt-for-out-of-turn-jabs-for-health-staff-101611252810336.html

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and Adjoining Areas had in December last year directed all industrial units in Delhi to switch to PNG by January 31, and had directed the DPCC to inspect and identify industries using polluting fuels and act against those found violating the directive. In the latest report, the DPCC said out of the total 1,644 polluting industries identified in the national capital, 1,624 have converted to PNG, as on Thursday. Officials said the remaining units will be inspected in the coming weeks and a status report will be filed before the CAQM on January 31. “At least 1,624 industrial units in Delhi have converted to PNG, a safer and non-polluting fuel out of 1644 units using polluting fuels. This is a major step in controlling the city’s industrial emissions. We are hoping that by January 31, when the deadline set by the CAQM will be completed, we can make a complete switch to clean fuel,” a DPCC official said. The official said a status report has also been submitted to the CAQM and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). In an air review meeting conducted on December 22, the commission reviewed the progress of switching over of industries operating in Delhi to PNG. Representatives of the Delhi government, DPCC, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), and Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) had attended the meeting to chalk out a plan to switch these industrial units to cleaner fuels as a long term initiative to reduce the pollution levels in Delhi. “About 1,644 of the industrial units spread across 50 industrial areas in Delhi had been identified for the switch over to PNG. The Commission stressed the need to switch over by all identified industries in Delhi considering the sector is one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi and the NCR or the National Capital Region,” the minutes of the meeting read. IGL and GAIL have also been directed to complete the pipeline network, metering, and associated infrastructure by January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/all-polluting-industries-in-capital-will-likely-switch-to-png-by-month-end-delhi-pollution-control-body-101611252751510.html

On Thursday, Delhi had witnessed its highest number of vaccinations ever since the drive started on January 16 with 73.36% or 5,942 health care workers getting inoculated.At least 22 of the 24 adverse reactions reported were minor, whereas two people needed hospitalisation. Both the people to be hospitalised had received Covaxin shots, as per data seen by HT. However, senior district officials claimed that both the hospitalisations had happened on Wednesday – when Delhi did not have an immunisation drive – following vaccinations that were done on Tuesday. “There were two people who were admitted for observation on Wednesday and were discharged soon after. Both the people had minor symptoms, such as fever for which they had been admitted. No serious adverse event has been reported in the district,” said a senior official from south-west district that showed the two hospitalisations. So far, there has been only one severe adverse event following vaccination using Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. A 22-year-old security guard at the All India Institute of Medial Sciences had developed serious allergic reaction and had to be admitted after getting the shot on January 16. There have been cases of abnormal heart rate, severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, and faintings reported after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield being administered as well. The vaccine is received by people at 75 centres across the city in comparison to six centre that give Covaxin, under the trial mode. Sixteen cases of AEFI (adverse event following immunisation) were recorded on Tuesday, 26 on Monday and 52 on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/twentyfour-adverse-reactions-reported-on-day-4-two-require-hospitalisation-101611252750353.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Chill to replace warm, windy days in Delhi from Sunday, air remains ‘poor’||After experiencing warm but windy days, Delhi’s temperature is expected to plummet again from January 24, a day after a fresh western disturbance passes over the western Himalayas, India Meteorological Department said. On Thursday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 7.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was 22.8 degrees Celsius, which was a notch above what is considered to be the season’s normal. At the Palam weather station, the minimum temperature was 7.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 20.2 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that till Saturday, the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 6-7 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperatures will be around 20 degrees Celsius. “From January 24 (Sunday), the minimum temperature will start falling and from January 25, the maximum temperature will also see a fall. This will primarily be because of the cold winds blowing from Jammu Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh after spells of rain and snow on January 23,” said Srivastava. Meanwhile, the air quality in Delhi is likely to deteriorate briefly on January 23, but winds are expected to pick up again and improve the air from January 24. On Thursday, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 296, in the ‘poor’ zone. On Wednesday, the average AQI was 283, also in the ‘poor’ category. According to IMD scientists, this improvement has been because of strong winds blowing over the national capital. The wind speeds have been high on Wednesday and Thursday primarily because of a difference in the maximum and minimum temperatures, scientists explained. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said that the surface winds on Thursday were south-westerly and moderate, but will slow down on Friday leading to deterioration in pollution levels. “The AQI is forecasted to be in the ‘poor’ category on January 22. Under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, winds are forecasted to increase on January 23 and marginal improvement in AQI is forecasted for January 23 and January 24. However, despite the improvement, the AQI will remain within the ‘very poor’ category,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chill-to-replace-warm-windy-days-in-delhi-from-sunday-air-remains-poor-101611252750897.html

The SSA is a flagship programme of the government of India to support states and Union territories in developing and strengthening formal primary and upper primary education. In his letter, Sisoida said, “I would like to draw your attention towards 2,766 teachers serving as contractual teachers under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan in Delhi. Among them, 1,673 serve in schools run by the directorate of education, and 1,093 serve in schools run by east and south Delhi municipal corporations. Against the annual work plan and budget for the year 2020-21, proposed by the Delhi government in its meeting with the officials of the ministry of education, government of India, on May 27, 2020, the salary of contract teachers was approved only for six months and was conveyed to us on August 20, 2020, by the ministry.”“All of these contractual teachers are central teachers eligibility test (CTET) qualified and till now, they are actively engaged in supporting the semi-online teaching-learning of students in their respective schools. Their six months’ service period was completed on January 19, 2021,” he said. Sisodia, who is also the deputy chief minister of Delhi, said front-line workers, including teachers, have played a major role in the past year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said it will be unfair if any of them would be asked to leave their services at this point in time. “I urge you to kindly extend the financial support to these teachers till at least March 31, 2021, on the existing cost-sharing basis between the Union and the Delhi government,” Sisodia wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-requests-union-education-minister-to-extend-contracts-of-ssa-teachers-101611252690851.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Covid vaccine: Govt will lean on its socio-economic survey to find people with comorbidities||Findings of Delhi government’s socio-economic survey – which suggests that 2.60% of the population of the Capital have chronic illnesses – is being considered for ascertaining the number of people with comorbidities, who will be in line for getting the Covid-19 vaccination in the third phase along with people aged over 50 years.The survey took place between took place between November 2018 and November 2019.The first phase of the vaccination drive – meant for health workers—is currently underway in the city. Delhi has around 300,000 health care workers of whom 240,000 have registered for the vaccine shots. The overall actual turnout so far since January 16 (the first day of the vaccination drive) has remained around 54.5%, because of what experts attribute as vaccine hesitance. (updated)The second group set to be inoculated are front line workers – which includes the police, sanitation workers, fire officials, teachers, and staff in departments which were engaged in Covid-19 management. Their number is estimated at 600,000 and the registration process for this category is currently underway.The third phase is supposed to cover people aged over 50 years and people with comorbidities, irrespective of their age. While the government estimates the number of people aged over 50 years to be around 4.2 million through electoral rolls, they are yet to ascertain the number of people with comorbidities. Registration for this category (which includes both people aged over 50 years and people with comorbidities) is yet to begin.“For people with comorbidities, so far, the government was relying on hospital data, records obtained from departments such as health and social welfare, and findings of door-to-door health surveys which were launched across all 11 revenue districts during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings of the socio-economic survey will now help in ascertaining the numbers under this category,” said a senior government official.According to the survey – which covered a sample size of around 10.2 million people, roughly half of Delhi’s population – around 2.60% of Delhi suffers from chronic illnesses that qualify as comorbid conditions. Of those who have comorbid conditions, 36.33% have diabetes, 21.75% have diseases that concern cardiac issues, hypertension and blood circulation, 9.17% have respiratory diseases, 2.33% have thalassemia, 2.02% have tuberculosis, 1.40% have leprosy, 1.33% have some form of cancer, 1.12% have haemophilia, 0.26% have HIV and the remaining 24.29% have been clubbed under “other diseases’’.The report on the survey, which HT has seen, further said, “The highest proportion of diabetes patients in Delhi has been reported as 43.34% from (the) central district and the highest proportion of cardiac patients is 26.20% in north-west district. Further, the highest proportion of patients with respiratory disease is 11.56% in (the) north district.”The findings of the survey have been uploaded on Delhi government’s website. While the Delhi government publishes an economic survey every year, this is the first such socio-economic survey with a much larger ambit beyond economic and welfare indicators, which includes schooling, nutrition, access to resources ranging from drinking water to mobile phones and television, transportation, housing and health indicators, among several others.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “The findings of the survey have the potential to contribute in several fronts of governance. Assessment of the report is underway. We are examining all aspects of it.”The survey was ordered by Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in 2018 after three girls – aged between two and eight years – of a family were found to have died of severe malnutrition in east Delhi’s Mandawli. The project, however, faced delays because of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and Delhi Assembly polls in February 2020, said the senior government official.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet commission for Covid-19 India vaccination task force, said: “The findings of the government report will be very useful in ascertaining an estimated number of people in the category for people with comorbidities. So far, to identify people in this category, governments across states are digging into hospital records and departmental records. The government is also planning to take data from the Aarogya Setu application in this regard.”To ensure that no person aged over 50 years or those with comorbidities gets excluded from the vaccination drive, the government will also be opening up windows for people to get registered on their own – both online and offline. “But that window will open up after vaccines are administered to front line workers across the country. The approval will be given by the Central government. Provisions, such as giving the general public limited access to the Co-Win system through applications and setting up help desks in government offices, have been discussed in several review meetings,” said a senior official in the Delhi government’s health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-vaccine-govt-will-lean-on-its-socio-economic-survey-to-find-people-with-comorbidities-101611252690231.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal reviews progress of flat construction for slum dwellers||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday directed officials of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) to expedite the process of construction and allocation of flats under the government’s “Jahaan Jhuggi Wahin Makaan” (in-situ slum rehabilitation) policy.The directions were issued by Kejriwal during a review meeting, which he had chaired. “The chief minister has instructed officials to expeditiously allot flats that have been constructed for the EWS (economically weaker sections) and slum dwellers. He said all obstacles in the allotment of land required for the construction of upcoming flats should be removed. A total of 9,315 houses are in a ready-to-move condition for 14 identified slum clusters,” the government said in a statement.Apart from these, a total of 28,910 flats are being constructed for 73 identified slum clusters, it said.“We have to ensure that the construction of EWS flats for the in-situ rehabilitation of people is completed within the stipulated timeline. This has to be ensured so that we can provide shelter for every poor person in Delhi,” Kejriwal said during the meeting. Officials of DUSIB said 9,315 houses are in a ready-to-move condition for 14 identified slum clusters. Of these, 9,315 houses, 7,400 are in Bhalswa Jahangirpuri area, where people from seven slum clusters will be relocated. , Another 1,060 houses are in Sultanpuri area for four slum clusters, and 855 houses have been proposed in Bawana area for three slum clusters.In the previous meetings, it was decided that the construction project will be taken up in three phases, and the EWS flats will be constructed on the vacant land available with DUSIB.“The 89,400 houses will be constructed in three phases. In the first phase, 41,400 houses will be constructed by the year 2022. In the second phase, 18,000 houses will be constructed. In the third phase, 30,000 EWS houses will be constructed across Delhi,” the government said. The houses will be multi-storeyed, and five separate tenders will be floated in the first phase, each for a lot of 8,000 houses ( the remaining 1,400 flats are already completed). The time frame for the construction of houses in the first phase is 24 months, with a construction cost of ₹3,312 crore for 41,400 flats, which comes to ₹8 lakh per flat.The project is being executed under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-reviews-progress-of-flat-construction-for-slum-dwellers-101611252630948.html
21-01-2021||Other||The burglar who made away with jewellery worth ₹20 crore, but got caught within 24 hours||New Delhi: An electrician-cum-technician working for a jewellery showroom in South Delhi’s Kalkaji used his professional skills and supplemented them by watching YouTube videos to break into the same shop to steal 25 kilos of gold and diamond jewellery worth ₹20 crore, the Delhi Police said on Thursday after arresting the suspect and recovering the entire stolen items.RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said prima facie it appears that the suspect, 25-year-old Sheikh Nur Rahman, operated all alone in a heist that lasted a little over six hours, including over four hours inside the showroom and over 90 minutes that Rahman spent just waiting on the roof of a nearby building.Though the entire stolen jewellery weighed 25kilos, the DCP said that a lot of it was studded with diamonds because of which the market price of the booty was ₹20 crore. “This is one of the biggest seizures of stolen jewellery in India in the recent years,” the officer said. PLANNINGRahman, for the last one year, had been employed at the Kalkaji store of Anjali Jewellers, a Kolkata-based firm which primarily caters to jewellery of Bengali tradition, said the showroom manager Arijit Chakravarty. “He would come across as any other employee, there was nothing in his appearance or mannerism to suggest he plan and execute such a heist,” said Chakravarty. But Rahman allegedly had other plans. “In one year of work, he got to know the showroom inside out. And he used his knowledge and skills to plan the heist for three months. He thought he had a foolproof plan,” said Suvashis Choudhary, joint commissioner of police (southern range).In the last three months, Rahman allegedly studied the layout of the entry and exit points, the position of the guards, the screws that needed to be opened, the CCTV cameras that needed to be disconnected and all other fine details, Choudhary said. “He then invested about ₹50,000 on buying equipment such as hydraulic iron cutters, gas cutters, suitcase, backpack, rope, etc,” said the officer. Then, Rahman created an alibi for himself by taking a 15-day leave -- beginning January 10 -- in which he would visit his home in Hooghly in West Bengal.The DCP said Rahman did book a train ticket and he even went home, but he quietly returned to Delhi within a week. But he stayed away from his residential quarter in Govindpuri that was provided by his employer.THE HEISTAround 9.30pm on Tuesday, he donned a PPE kit to ensure no one would approach him or suspect him on the streets, wore a large face mask, carried a suitcase and the burglary tools in the backpack and reached near the showroom by an auto-rickshaw.“Since he had done his survey, he reached the terrace of a mostly vacant structure located two buildings away from the four-storey jewellery showroom. He then waited on the terrace until 11pm so that the residents of the next two buildings were in their homes,” the DCP said. Once all was quiet, he easily scaled the terrace of the next two buildings and reached the roof of the showroom. He used hydraulic iron cutters to remove the fibre and tin sheets of a small opening in the roof that allowed him access to the generator room on the top floor. He lowered the heavy tools and bags using a rope. Police said Rahman took his time to operate without any noise.Once he was inside, he used the same cutter to break open an iron grill and an iron shutter to gain entry into the actual showroom which was spread over the ground, first and second floors. He didn’t even need the gas cutter he had brought along. Rahman did not touch the jewellery on the first and second floors and went directly to the ground floor because he was targeting jewellery of “low volume and high value”, said JCP Choudhary. “He cut the wires of only one CCTV camera that could have probably given away his identity. He left the other cameras, lest the management check the footage and find it suspicious that so many cameras went off at the same time,” said the officer. He then stuffed as much jewellery he could carry in his bags and left the same way he had come -- using a rope to haul up the heavy bags from the generator room to the terrace. The police said he hired an auto-rickshaw and reached his friend’s home in Karol Bagh even as he planned to leave for Kolkata on Thursday by train. The crime was detected around 11am on Wednesday when the showroom was opened. IN POLICE NETThe police formed 10 teams of about 100 police personnel and began with probing the 35-odd employees of the showroom, other people who visited occasionally for work and local criminals. The CCTV cameras threw up a lot of footage that suggested the role of an insider. For example, the thief had no trouble in finding a particular CCTV camera in the generator room to change its direction. He also knew exactly where to find drinking water on the third floor. “Most importantly, the thief knew which size screwdriver was needed for opening the screws. All this pointed to someone with particular technical skills,” JCP Choudhary said. And Rahman was the only employee who the police believed had the skills and knowledge to execute such a heist.Though Rahman had allegedly prepared an alibi, his absence came across as suspicious to the police. “Our local enquiry revealed that Rahman was seen in Delhi at a time when he was supposed to be in his hometown. He then became the primary suspect,” DCP Meena said. Thereafter, the police used his call detail records and other technical analysis to catch him from his friend’s home in Karol Bagh and recover all the stolen booty from him -- within 24 hours of him leaving the showroom. Rahman has been booked for theft in a dwelling house and trespassing. If convicted, he could land in jail for up to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/the-burglar-who-made-away-with-jewellery-worth-rs-20-crore-but-got-caught-within-24-hours-101611252630337.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Temperature to rise till next week under influence of western disturbance||The city woke up to cold and foggy conditions on Thursday morning, when the minimum temperature settled at 7.2 degrees Celsius — down from 9 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. Warmer conditions soon took over, giving way to clear, sunny skies, which pushed the maximum daytime temperature to 20.2 degrees Celsius as against 16.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. While dense to moderate fog will continue to prevail during early morning hours over the next week, official forecasts by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predict that the minimum temperature will rise to about 10 degrees Celsius till January 25 under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.“From Friday a fresh weather system will start forming over the Himalayas. There will be a dense cloud cover over entire North India which will trap heat and push up the minimum temperature, which is expected to remain above normal until January 25,” said Kuldip Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature in Gurugram is expected to remain between 20 to 22 degrees Celsius, as per official forecasts.However, following the passage of this weather system — which is expected to bring fresh snowfall to India’s hilly states — cold, northwesterly winds will once again begin to blow over Delhi-NCR, causing the mercury to dip. As per the IMD’s forecasts, the minimum temperature in Gururgam is expected to dip to as little as six degrees between January 25 and 27, while the maximum temperature is expected to hover around 17 degrees Celsius.Gurugram’s air quality, meanwhile, settled in the “poor” category on Thursday, with 234 on the CPCB’s daily air quality index bulletin. This was up slightly from 207 the previous day. With wind speeds expected to range between 15 to 20 kmph over the next two days, there will not be any significant deterioration in air quality until early next week. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “air quality is likely to remain in Poor to lower end of very Poor category on 22.01.2021.

21-01-2021||Gurugram||Illegal shops on green belts along Golf Course Ext Road demolished||In a drive to demolish encroachments and illegal establishments on green belts, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) on Thursday demolished 35 shops on green belts along the Golf Course Extension Road.The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) and GMDA have decided to rid encroachments in all green belts in their areas of jurisdiction. Officials said that they have identified encroachments along major roads, wherein which shops, vends and other such establishments have come up on green belts. The shops demolished on Thursday included nurseries, furniture showrooms and auto spare parts stores, among several others. RS Bhath, district town planner, GMDA, said that they have identified roads and stretches in GMDA areas and private licensed colonies, where green belts and government land have been illegally encroached upon. “We have received complaints from residents and our officials have surveyed these roads. An inspection of this stretch (Golf Course Extension Road) was carried out a day earlier and similar action would be taken in other areas,” he said. Bhath has appealed to owners of shops and vends that have come up illegally in green belts to start vacating the same. “The drive against illegal encroachments would soon be started in areas under the newly formed municipal corporation in Manesar too,” he said. The GMDA team, which carried out the demolition drive, was supported by a large contingent of police as well as estate officer Rajeev Lamba and duty magistrate Ajay Malik. Sandeep Lot, junior engineer, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran, who was part of the team said that the shop owners and those living in tenements were allowed to remove the goods from their establishments before the structures were demolished. “We asked the owners to remove their goods and carried out demolition thereafter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-shops-on-green-belts-along-golf-course-ext-road-demolished-101611251070034.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Haryana govt revises scheduled rates for construction items||Almost three decades after the last revision of Haryana Schedule of Rates (HSR) — the prices paid by the government to contractors for purchasing raw material —the state government on Wednesday announced that a revised list of rates shall be effective from March1.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced that, apart from revision of HSR, the government will also introduce reforms in the contract system that include online registration of contractors, payment of bills within 30 days, online evaluation and allotment of contracts to make the system more transparent and accountable. The new HSR will become effective from March, and these would now form the base for inviting new tenders and evaluating work performance. The new HSR would also be revised every five years, said Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) officials. HSR determines the prices that the government pays to contractors for purchasing raw material, such as steel, cement, bricks, etc, used in construction and other works.Khattar, who made the announcement in Chandigarh, said that a new IT regime for tenders will also be introduced in the state from April 1, under which the contractors would have to get registered. Thereafter, they won’t be required to deposit a bid security. He also announced that the tendering process is being made digital, and the evaluation and allotment of work would also be made online. Under the new regime, the state government has also made it mandatory that bills submitted by contractors will be passed in 21 days and payment be made within 30 days from the day the bill is passed. Apart from such changes, the government will also set up an online complaint portal to address the grievances of contractors. The announcements made by the government have been welcomed by contractors in Gurugram and across the state as these would bridge the gap between the market and government rates, which were last revised in 1987.Contractors also said that online registration will end the requirement of paying earnest money but maintained that these decisions would be effective only if these are implemented in letter and spirit. Commenting on the changes introduced by the state government, Shailesh Khatana, chairman, HSVP Contractors Association, said that revision of rates was a long overdue as the rates fixed in 1987 along with premium used to fix the rates of tenders. “The rates of cement, steel, bricks under the previous HSR were quite less despite the addition of premium. Although the premium was increased every three years, it was still difficult to manage the cost. Many items, required now, were absent in the 1987 list. As such, it was difficult for contractors to execute the work” said Khatana. The contractors further said the online registration and stopping the condition of paying earnest money would greatly help them. “Earlier, the contractors were required to pay earnest money fees even before bidding for the tender. There has also been reduction in security deposit from five to two percent. All these steps will greatly help in boosting business and confidence in government contracts,” said Satender Thakran, who is a contractor with MCG, Gurugram. Hari Dutt Sharma, superintending engineer, HSVP said that the revision in HSR was sorely needed and that the new list will include many items that are not present in the existing list. “The revision will ensure that there is not a significant gap in the market rates and schedule rates. The changes announced in the tendering system would also bring in more transparency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-govt-revises-scheduled-rates-for-construction-items-101611251012791.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Six members of Tota Gang arrested from Dwarka Expressway||The police arrested six men of a gang wanted for a slew of crimes, ranging from illegal water business in newer sectors to extortion, robbery, look, kidnapping and murder, from the Dwarka Expressway on Wednesday night.The police said that they are members of the Tota Gang, which has more than 30 members, based in Dhanwapur in Sector 104. There are more than 60 cases registered against them in Delhi, Gurugram, Jhajjar and Sonepat for supplying drugs, illegal liquor, kidnapping, robbery, loot and murder. The police had previously announced a reward of ₹5,000, each, for information leading to their arrest.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the gang controls the water supply to commercial buildings as well as residential societies in the area. “There are more than two gangs that are running illegal water supply and are intolerant of newcomers to the business. They have often resorted to violence against them. They not only threaten newcomers but have assaulted over 15 people, who tried to supply water in these areas, in the last two weeks,” he said.Illegal water extraction is rampant in Ullawas village, Sector 61, Palam Vihar, Pataudi, Badshahpur, Kadipur, developing sectors located along the Dwarka Expressway, including sectors 104, 109 and 111, the police said.“The mafia has a lot of muscle power. The developers and people constructing houses are dependent on them for water tankers. They do not share their office address and visiting their spots is not easy for anyone who is not a part of the trade,” said Sangwan.In an incident of violence on January 13, allegedly perpetrated by the gang, a resident of Garhi Hasaru village in Sector 10, who used to supply water tankers, was severely injured and admitted to a private hospital in Manesar.Sangwan said that the victim could not record his statement as he was brutally beaten by the gang members after he refused to stop water supply. “Pankaj Kumar’s father, in a statement to police, said that his son worked with a water tanker company and supplied water to areas along Dwarka Expressway and Sector 10. A few men from the area had approached him to quit the job but he refused, following which, on January 12, they assaulted him with weapons and iron rods, and robbed him of his money. When the father reached the spot, they fled in their cars,” he said.The police said that Kumar has suffered several fractures and is still unable to walk. Similar incidents have been reported from areas along the Dwarka Expressway, following which the police started tracking the gang members. The gang also used to threaten residents if they refused water supply by them, and were also forced to pay extra.Cases under sections 148 (unlawful assembly), 149 (common objective) 323 (causing hurt), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 395 (dacoity) and 397 (robbery or dacoity with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code were registered against them at the Sector 10 police station.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the Palam Vihar crime unit arrested them from Dwarka Expressway when they were allegedly trying to rob a commuter on Wednesday night. “This gang remains active at night to rob commuters and during the day, controls the water supply. There have been at least 20 incidents, wherein residents from various new and developing sectors have complained that the water mafia allegedly sabotaged civic water supply to stay in business. They are forced to purchase water from this informal sector at a rate 40 times that of the GMDA’s,” he said.Rao said that there are at least 20 illegal borewells in the area, from which they get their supply.The suspects were identified as Hitesh alias Sonu, Rahul alias Lambu, Rohit Kumar, Neeraj Singh, Lalit alias Kalu and Neeraj Katiya. The police recovered two revolvers, one countrymade pistol, 28 live cartridges, iron rods and pipes, and a Scorpio from their possession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/six-members-of-tota-gang-arrested-from-dwarka-expressway-101611251011689.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Lab results for suspected bird flu samples may take another week||Laboratory reports of two wild bird carcasses — a crow and an egret — which were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal to be tested for bird flu, are likely to take another week to arrive, said officials in the district animal husbandry department on Thursday. This is despite the preliminary tests conducted by the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar, following which the samples were suspected to be positive for avian influenza. Suspicions regarding a possible outbreak of avian influenza arose earlier in January and had prompted Haryana government to notify an outbreak of influenza strain H5N8, with Panchkula’s Ganauli and Kheri villages as the epicentre. On January 8, the district wildlife department retrieved four wild bird carcasses, of which two were sent to the lab in Jalandhar for testing. A senior official in the district animal husbandry department, seeking anonymity, said, “We have not yet received any confirmatory statement on whether the samples are indeed positive for bird flu. There seems to be a large backlog of samples sent to the lab from other states that is slowing down the process. It may also be that the samples in fact turned out negative for avian influenza, and therefore the lab is expediting positive reports so that containment operations can be started, wherever needed. We have been told to expect the reports in a week.” Dr Punita Gahlot, the animal husbandry department’s deputy director in Gurugram, confirmed that there have not been any unusual, or excess, deaths among poultry birds in the district. She also confirmed that the department is going to step up clinical surveillance of poultry farms this week, bringing smaller backyard units into the rotation (as opposed to only those farms with a high density of birds). This is being done after a suspected outbreak from Kohand village in Karnal district was reported on Tuesday. Punjab, too, has begun culling poultry this week after confirmation of bird flu at two farms in Dera Bassi. Wildlife inspector Rajesh Chahal, who is the forest department’s nodal officer for all bird flu-related matters, also said that no unusual mortality of wild birds (whether domestic or migratory) has so far been reported from Najafgarh, Basai and Sultanpur wetlands in Gurugram. “We are also in touch with wildlife department staff in neighbouring districts. For now, our orders are to keep doing daily patrols, but there doesn’t seem to be any cause for alarm, “ said Chahal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lab-results-for-suspected-bird-flu-samples-may-take-another-week-101611251012272.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram receives 39K additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine||Over 39,000 additional doses of Covishield — one of the two Covid-19 vaccines approved for emergency use — have been allocated for Gurugram to be given to the front-line healthcare workers as the second dose 28 days after their first vaccine shot, said district health department officials on Thursday. Despite the reluctance among the healthcare workers regarding the vaccine that has led to vaccine wastage of almost 10% in the state, the district health department has been focusing on utilising the available doses by increasing the daily turnout. The state on Tuesday received a stock of 214,000 doses of Covishield vaccine. “As many as 38,980 doses will arrive in Gurugram on Friday. The stock includes almost 1,500 doses for healthcare workers commissioned by the Central government and 37,480 doses for the state healthcare workers,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said. Three vaccination drives have been held so far in Gurugram since the launch on January 16 and over 7,500 health care workers have been covered. In the previous drives, the turnout has been almost 60% in district, which increased to 80% on Thursday. Senior state officials said that due to hesitancy among healthcare workers, several vaccine vials have been wasted. According to them, a vial once opened has to be used in five hours. A single vial of Covishield has 10 doses, while Covaxin has 20.“The open-vial concept is not applicable for Covid-19 vaccine, in which the remaining doses can be used later,” said Dr Virender Ahlawat, state immunisation officer. “The vaccine wastage is almost 10% presently. Wastage is mostly reported in the last hours of the vaccination. If a vial is opened and not many people turn up, then the doses get wasted. Therefore, in districts with lower turnout, limited vials are being used. Only two to three cases of vials breakage before or during the inoculation have been reported so far.”A few officials privy to the matter, however, said that the vaccine wastage is higher than 10%. “The vaccine wastage could have been avoided if front-line workers like police and urban civic body workers were included along with the health staff. Currently, due to lower footfall of health workers, many police personnel are also getting skeptical,” said a senior official of the Gurugram Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-receives-39k-additional-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-101611251010556.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Grey-winged blackbird spotted for first time in Gurugram||Birders this week confirmed the first sighting of a male grey-winged blackbird in Gurugram, in the Aravalli forests near Bhondsi Nature Park, on Bharat Yatra Kendra Road.Prior to this, the species was last spotted in the region in 2016, in New Delhi. Experts said the sighting, though rare, isn’t surprising, as there has been an increase in the number of Himalayan birds spotted during winter months in Delhi and Gurugram, in recent years.The grey-winged blackbird is a large, passerine bird belonging to the thrush family, and may be recognised from its silvery wings and bright orange bill. It is a resident of the northern Indian subcontinent, with a habitat that extends all the way to parts of South-East Asia (including Myanmar and Thailand). While commonly seen in India’s Himalayan states, the bird has been previously photographed in Delhi-NCR on just one occasion — at the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary on January 4, 2016.Amit Sharma, the Gurugram-based birder who first spotted the male blackbird on Tuesday, said, “There is also another sighting of the same species, recorded by veteran birder Suresh Sharma, over three decades ago, from Sultanpur during the winter season. More recently, another fellow birdwatcher, Pritpal Panjeta, has seen the bird near Damdama lake. But this week’s sighting at Bhondsi is the first photographic record of the species in Gurugram. We also saw the bird again at the same place on Thursday.”Sharma also happened to photograph three other rare species in Bhondsi this week, including a black-throated thrush, Tickell’s thrush, and an orange-headed thrush. “This forest in Bhondsi has yielded some very interesting finds recently. I have especially noticed that there is a very healthy population of thrushes there in the winter season. There are only a few remaining patches of Aravalli wilderness left like this and protection for them needs to be increased,” Sharma said.Experts said that the blackbird’s sighting bolsters the theory that Himalayan birds are seeking habitats with little anthropogenic stress, after similar sightings of the Himalayan bluetail in Faridabad and the Himalayan desert finch in Sirsa, this winter. Last year, a flock of fire-capped tit (another Himalayan species) was also seen in Bhondsi, while birders in Delhi had sighted two black-hooded orioles (also native to the Himalayas) at Buddha Jayanti Park. More recently, in 2021, a sub-adult of the same species was spotted at the Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary as well.Dr Surya Prakash, a former head of the School of Life Sciences at Jawahar Lal Nehru University, said, “It isn’t that there are more birds migrating to Delhi from the Himalayas during winter. My sense is that this might have been happening all along, and we are only observing it now because of an increased number of birders. We have recently also seen the Tickell’s blue flycatcher in Delhi, another rare sighting. It seems that these birds are seeking out places in the Aravalli hills, like Bhondsi and Mangar, with very little anthropogenic stress that resemble their native habitats in the lower Himalayan foothills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/greywinged-blackbird-spotted-for-first-time-in-gurugram-101611251010989.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||79% coverage recorded on third day of vaccination drive||At least 4,001 front-line healthcare workers in the district took the Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, according to the district health department. Nearly 79% turned up for a shot after walk-in vaccination of the registered beneficiaries was permitted by the government earlier this week. In the last vaccination drive on Monday, only 60% of the targeted workforce received inoculation. The health department expects to retain Thursday’s accelerated pace by covering healthcare workers from nursing homes and small clinics from Friday onwards. Only healthcare workers in government facilities and private hospitals have been covered so far in the three vaccination drives held in the city. On Thursday, against the target of inoculating 4,661 people with Covishield, almost 3,786 (81%) took the jab at 49 vaccination sites. The takers for Covaxin, on the other hand, remained low, with 215 people getting inoculated out of 400 (54%) as hesitancy to fill the consent form continued to persist among health workers. The vaccination took place in at least 53 sites, which included 14 government sites and 17 big private hospitals, where multiple booths were set up. Till now, a total of 7,490 health staff have received the Covid-19 vaccine in Gurugram— the highest in the state. In Haryana, at least 45, 893 people have received the first dose and are awaiting the second one to be administered 28 days later. “We are still not satisfied with the vaccination numbers. More motivation is required to get rid of apprehensions regarding the vaccine. As Friday is the day for the routine immunisation, it is likely the vaccination numbers may fall. Inoculation will take place only in private hospitals,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Among various private hospitals, Columbia Asia Hospital vaccinated at least 120 health staff members, completing their Thursday’s target. Dr Nikhil Mishra, chief medical superintendent, Columbia Asia Hospital, said, “On Wednesday, the health department provided the hospital with the entire list of the staff registered on Co-WIN platform. We posted the information on the hospital’s social media group, apprising the staff about the walk-in. This expedited the process in comparison to Monday’s drive.”Max Hospital also managed to achieve 95% of its target to vaccinate 330 health care staff. Arpita Mukherjee, vice president, operations, Max Hospital, said, “The new approach of walk-in has been helpful in conducting the vaccination drive. Three counters were set up for the vaccination, where doctors and staff directly came and got vaccinated within five minutes. Their phone numbers and ID proof were identified on Co-WIN platform.”Mukherjee added that jab taken by many senior doctors of the hospital instilled confidence among the other health staff. “Considering the response received, we expect to cover our 2,400 health care workers by January 25,” said Mukherjee. According to Mishra, vaccination being a voluntary exercise cannot be imposed on employees having apprehensions about taking the shot. The total staff of the Columbia Asia Hospital is 454, out of over 175 have been inoculated. “The drive will continue every day for the next few days in the hospitals. We not only have to cover our own staff but also an additional lot of 400 health workers from nursing homes and diagnostic centres within the vicinity,” said Mishra.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “From Friday onwards, the health staff from small nursing homes and clinics will be inoculated. They have been alloted vaccination sites in at least 12 private hospitals. Messages have been delivered to them through Indian Medical Association and to the medical officers.” Meanwhile, in the government facilities, the process of inoculating staff from ESIC hospital and government dispensaries has already started. In community centre in Sector 10, pharmacists, ambulance drivers, doctors and their assisting staff from Islampur, Civil Lines received inoculation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/79-coverage-recorded-on-third-day-of-vaccination-drive-101611251010054.html

They are unsure about whether to continue medication from conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and others. We are trying to address this by appointing ambassadors inside the hospital who will help clarify their doubts. We are also organising meetings with associations to spread awareness among various groups,” he said.He also added that the doubts of high-risk groups among healthcare workers are addressed by the doctors to ensure that they have more clarity.Dr Ashish Bharti, chief, health department, PMC, said that the department is making all efforts to ensure that the vaccines are not wasted.“We have cleared the glitch in the Co-WIN application and the messages for inoculation were sent on Thursday so that the beneficiaries can visit the centres on Friday. We are hopeful that the turnout will be good on Friday. And once the number is achieved there will be no wastage of vaccine,” he said.He added that the centres have slots which ensure that at least a few beneficiaries are there before a few vials are opened to reduce wastage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-turnout-in-pune-district-leads-to-vaccine-wastage-101611249089773.html

Now I am being told by others here that he has died in the tragedy,” said Sudhanshu Kumar, brother of Sushil Kumar Pandey, a resident of Bihar, who died in the fire incident.It was the construction contractor who told the rescue officials that some of his men were missing, according to Chetan Tupe, a legislator from Manjari.“After the dousing process was over, the officials went back inside and found the men on the top floor of the building. The fire started on the top two floors and they got stuck there with no way of escaping,” said Tupe.“The bodies were found in the second sweep conducted after the fire dousing and cooling was done,” said Murlidhar Mohol, mayor of Pune.Hours after the fire was doused, sparks were flying during the cooling process at the building which had caught fire in the afternoon. “We have vehicles on standby to deal with these remnant fires,” said Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune fire brigade.While a team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and a private team of Amanora group were also involved in the rescue process along with the Pune police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/expert-panel-will-probe-fire-incident-at-sii-ajit-pawar-101611249029803.html

The protestors’ demand include opposition to privatisation of Railways, implementing old pension scheme, insurance cover up to ₹50 lakh for those employees who worked during the Covid lockdown. The one-day protest is part of the national stir organised by All India Station Masters’ Association (AISMA). It is the sixth phase of the protest. On October 7, through email, the association had sent their demands and opposed the railway board’s decisions. The association staged a “night protest” by lighting lamps at workplace on October 15. From October 20 to 26, station masters tied black ribbon on shoulder in protest. “We sat on one-day hunger strike on October 31 and later agitated outside the DRM offices across the country. Today, again, we did a hunger strike protest for our demands and it is seen that despite repeated protests, the railway administration is not considering our demands. Now we plan to go on an indefinite strike soon. Then it will be the responsibility of railways if the railways’ work is disrupted,” said association national president Dhananjay Chandratre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/station-masters-hold-protest-outside-pune-drm-office-101611245549398.html

For the last 20 days, her mother noticed that she was not following anything shown to her. The child’s MRI revealed a calcified brain tumour at the base of the skull, suggestive of craniopharyngioma of size 3cm, large for a child of one year, close to critical neural structures, such as optic nerves and hypothalamus,” PGIMER stated in a release.“These tumours are usually operated on through open surgery and the remaining part is treated with radiation therapy. Over the last few years, such tumours are being removed through the nose endoscopically by neurosurgeons teaming with ENT surgeons among patients older than six years. However, endoscopic removal through the nose is highly challenging in small children because of small nostrils, immature bones at the skull base and proximity to crucial blood vessels,” the release added.The operation was conducted by a team of endoscopic skull base surgeons, including Dr Dhandapani SS and Dr Sushant from the department of neurosurgery, and Dr Rijuneeta from the department of ENT. “The youngest child reported to date having undergone endoscopic surgery through the nose for such tumours was 2 years old, operated at Stanford, USA, in 2019,” PGIMER said.On how the operation was conducted, doctors said extensive drilling of the immature bones was carried out using a diamond drill and computer navigation, and a tumour-removal corridor was created. The tumour was dissected from critical structures using angled endoscopes and removed through the nose despite very little working space.After a six-hour-long surgery, the child was moved to the ICU and recovered well. After 10 days of surgery, she has improved vision and no complications, with a CT scan showing almost complete removal, doctors said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pgimer-chandigarh-doctors-endoscopically-remove-brain-tumour-from-16-month-old-girl-101611244529437.html

The dismal figure is recorded even as 68.4 per cent schools, for Class 9 to Class 12, have reopened in the district. The poor student attendance on school campuses reflects the fear and anxiety of Covid spread in the minds of parents. As per the education department, Maharashtra has reopened 95.9 per cent schools in the state for Class 9 to Class 12 and the turnout by students is just 38.4 per cent. Sunanda Wakhare, education officer, Pune zilla parishad, said that the turnout of students in rural areas of Pune district has been good. “We saw that initially when the schools reopened for Class 9 to Class 12, the student turnout was relatively less due to the virus fear in the minds of parents. The consent letters were also less. With time the turnout of students has improved significantly. We hope city schools also follow the example set by their counterparts in rural areas,” said Wakhare. She noted that the Pune rural has better turnout of students as compared to Pune city. “The schools for Class 9 to Class 12 within Pune municipal limits reopened from January 4. The turnout and consent of parents is increasing gradually. It is likely to get better,” said Wakhare. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) additional commissioner Suresh Jagtap said that schools within civic limits have seen around 40 per cent consent letters from parents. “Some schools have touched as much as 60 per cent. An increase in student attendance has also been reported at some schools,” said Jagtap.

And as India is abode to a variety of resident birds and migratory ones in winters, this is the ideal season for birdwatching. Even the recent bird flu outbreak hasn’t significantly dented the enthusiasm of bird watchers, who are also taking precautionary measures.“There hasn’t been much of an impact (of bird flu scare) in terms of birders going out because we are aware of the situation. There hasn’t been human transmission of the flu till now, but we need to take safety measures. Sanctuaries were shut, but we went to other places such as Najafgarh Jheel, Yamuna bank, etc.,” says Pankaj Gupta, from Delhi Bird Foundation, who adds that there hasn’t been a dip in queries for walks from professionals, but newbies are a little hesitant.Abhishek Gulshan, nature educator and founder Ninox - Owl about Nature, which conducts nature walks and workshops says, “We’re still conducting walks. One doesn’t have to be so worried. There are certain precautions you need to take. We’re wearing masks already, so that helps. Concerns do come and we address them. The motive is to not increase business but as an educator, it is my responsibility to provide adequate information.” He shares that one photo walk was cancelled last week amid the outbreak, but he “wanted to collect information, educate the participants, give a clear picture as we can’t jeopardise lives”. Gupta and Gulshan advise maintaining distance from birds and roosting spots, avoid touching dead/dying birds and request attendees to inform authorities about the same. Participants, too, are being cautious. Ishita Sachdeva, an avid birder who recently returned from Bandhavgarh National Park, says, “As long as we don’t come in contact (with birds), it’s fine. We don’t go too close anyway...”Wildlife researcher Roshan Puranik cautions, “It’s a great time to spot migratory birds, but if you see a rare one, don’t run carelessly. Maintain social distancing, wear a mask. Make sure everyone in the group has their own binoculars, water, eatables, etc.” To beginners, he suggests a good pair of binoculars and getting familiar with calls of common birds at least.Interact with author/sanchita_kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bird-flu-won-t-scare-away-avid-birders-101611232300051.html

We need long-term sustainable roads of high quality as part of the solid infrastructure development plan for Chakan industrial hub,” he said.Morhard expressed the need for a robust infrastructural development plan for Pune, while addressing mediapersons on the sidelines of the inauguration of h2e’s official website and the plant’s production facility at the company premises near Sangam Bridge on Thursday. h2e Power Systems is India’s first fuel cell company.He further said, “There is a need for a joint effort to understand that Pune is the number one industrial hub in Maharashtra and thus it needs very best roads which are not dilapidated every year after the monsoon. This is not happening at other places. We need a solid infrastructure for Pune. We have to look into smart traffic management systems to manage traffic at vital junctions in Chakan.” “We need to have solid infrastructure, including 24- hour power supply, uninterrupted internet.

The Sushant Singh Rajput Memorial Fund of $35,000 has been set up in UC Berkeley. #SushantDay,” she said.Rajput’s former girlfriend Ankita Lokhande said she would like to remember him as a happy, intelligent, romantic, mad and adorable person.Sharing a throwback video of Rajput playing with his dog in their house, she said, “I don’t know how to start and what to say but yes today I’m gonna share few of your old videos Sushant to celebrate you. These are the only memories I have with you and I will always remember you Like this happy, intelligent, romantic, mad and adorable #HappyBirthdaySSR.”Rajput’s friend and co-star Kriti Sanon said she would like to remember him as a smiling child.“This is how I’ll remember you.. Smiling like a child! Happy Birthday Sush. I hope you are smiling and at peace wherever you are..” Sanon tweeted alongside a smiling photo of Rajput.Actor Manoj Bajpayee shared a poster of “Sonchiriya”, a film in which he worked with Rajput.“Always remember you celebrate you, your work and cherish all the time that we all spent with you Sushant Singh Rajput!! Jahan bhi ho tum khush raho,” he wrote.TV-film producer Ekta Kapoor shared a short video clip of Rajput as Manav from her popular show “Pavitra Rishta”, which made the actor a household name. “Sushi forever!

21-01-2021||Chandigarh||10 months after Covid outbreak, colleges reopen to poor response in Punjab||Ten months after they were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, higher education institutions reopened to a poor response in Punjab on Thursday. Less than 10% of the students reported for classes at private and government institutes in Bathinda and its adjoining districts on the first day. Heads of the institutions said that the students and faculty members were yet to warm up to offline classes. Government Rajindra College principal Surjit Singh said of the 4,300 students, less than 10% attended college on Thursday. “The college has been restarted in a phased manner since November but the attendance has remained thin. Students need time to build confidence. The first year exams start from January 25. We hope to see improvement in attendance from February,” he said. Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Technical University registrar Gurinder Pal Singh said classes would begin from February as exams are underway. The university has announced it will allot hostel rooms to students from places located more than 40 km from the campus. “There is hardly anyone who has opted for the offline mode of examination and we are proceeding accordingly. We are gearing up to conduct classroom teaching after the exams,” he said. Gurmeet Singh Dhaliwal, the chairperson of the Baba Farid Group of Institutions, one of the largest colleges in the area with nearly 10,000 students in different streams, said it is difficult to implement the state government’s decision to resume higher institutes fully. Dhaliwal said with the given infrastructure and transport facilities, maintaining social distancing is not easy. ONLINE AND OFFLINE MODES ADD TO PRESSURE The state government’s directive is with a rider that students will be allowed to take classes according to their choice and no institute should compel them to attend the classes physically. “It is not possible to run both offline and online mode for classes or exams with the given strength of teachers and facilities. Teachers have expressed concern over holding offline classes when the pandemic is still not over. We need uniformity,” he said. Earlier, the state government allowed the phased reopening of universities and colleges from November 16. In the first phase, only departments with hands-on training such as sciences and medicines were allowed to open and only final year students were called for physical classes with 50% attendance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-months-after-covid-outbreak-colleges-reopen-to-poor-response-in-punjab-101611226948291.html

The citizens booked are living under the fear that they will face legal action. However, since the citizens have helped the government in combating Covid-19 crisis, we demand that the notices be cancelled on humanitarian grounds. The minister has sent our request to the secretary and we are sure about positive action in this regard,” he said.Earlier, Right to Information (RTI) activist Vivek Velankar had criticized the city police for initiating the process to prosecute the citizens and said that the policemen were visiting the address provided by citizens when they were booked under IPC 188 where their address proof and photo identity was being taken.The visiting policemen have been asking the citizens to remain present in the court for hearing of their respective cases.Earlier, NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade had written to the home minister requesting him to ask the Pune police chief not to go ahead with the action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-govt-to-withdraw-offences-under-section-188-against-lockdown-violators-101611226048478.html

We do design the session two days prior to the vaccination so that the messages reach the beneficiaries well in advance so that they reach the site on time. For Friday we will plan the session Wednesday night itself so that the portal sends the message and the beneficiaries can reach the site on time and plan the day accordingly since they are all healthcare workers.”Dr Ashish Bharti, PMC health chief, said, “The reason for the low turnout is due to the software glitches because of which the messages are reaching the beneficiaries late. The software sends the messages based on random selection and on Wednesday the messages were sent too late.”“The five vaccination centres started functioning after 10am which resulted in only 184 beneficiaries being vaccinated. Once the messages reach the beneficiaries after 10 am it is difficult for the beneficiary to report to the site. This app cannot be controlled by us in any way,” he said.“It would be difficult to say if there is any hesitancy because this is a voluntary vaccination process and when we say whether we need counselling or not then these are our own healthcare workers. We can do the counselling for the general public, but the reason for low turnout is purely technical,” he said.The PMC which had eight vaccination centres on Saturday, January 16, and had targeted to vaccinate 800 beneficiaries, on Monday and Tuesday reduced three private hospitals and brought down the centres to five with six sites by adding an additional site at its own Kamala Nehru hospital.Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner, had said that the Covid vaccination at private hospitals was shut because there were some problems in private hospital site creation.On Tuesday a total of 2,900 beneficiaries were to be vaccinated out of which only 47% or 1,355 were vaccinated of which 958 (64%) were from Pune rural, 184 (31%) from Pune city and 213 (27%) from PCMC. The district office reported only one minor adverse effect through the day at New Bhosari Hospital in the PCMC area.No vaccination drive todayDr Ashish Bharti, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) health chief, said, that there would be no Covid-19 vaccination on Thursday and on Friday and Saturday the drive will continue.“There is no further instruction on which days the vaccination would take place for the next week. The uncertainty on the vaccination days is also leading to a lower turnout,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccination-drive-better-turnout-in-rural-areas-of-pune-district-than-city-101611226047975.html

21-01-2021||Patna||Bihar seeks Nafed’s help for procurement of pulses, maize at MSP||The Bihar government is planning to rope in national agriculture cooperative marketing federation (Nafed) to facilitate procurement of pulses and maize on the minimum support price (MSP) from the farmers in Bihar.Nafed had discontinued procurement of maize, pulses and oilseeds from farmers after the state government froze its account operations, following the tax dispute in procurement of paddy on behalf of the food corporation of India (FCI) in 2012.Secretary, food and consumer protection department, Vinay Kumar has led several rounds of talks with Nafed officials in this regard. The department is likely to send a proposal to the Central government soon to finalise the procurement modalities. “The department aims to launch procurement of pulses from this season, if everything goes as per the plan,” said the secretary.Nafed branch manager, Patna, Yatendra Singh said that the federation was capable of procuring farm produce from the farmers, if the state government demonstrated its willingness. “As per the talks with the state government officials, Nafed is readying its network to purchase maize and pulses in the upcoming season,” said Singh.Nafed has supplied about 1.36 lakh metric tonne of chana dal (split chickpea lentils) to Bihar government under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyann Ann Yojna (PMGKAY) for its distribution to the poor during the pandemic phase last year.Officials said that the farmers of Bihar were estimated to produce more than five lakh MT of pulses, despite decreasing acreage of farming area. With procurement of pulses discontinued for nearly a decade, farmers have shifted focus on cultivation of MSP assured crops like paddy and wheat. Currently, pulses are being grown on 4.39 lakh hectare as compared to 10.83 lakh hectare in 1991-92.Also Read: Bihar: Hanged in 1857, Waris Ali of Tirhut finally added to Dictionary of MartyrsMaize growing farmers of the state are also likely to benefit from the Nafed’s expected re-launch of its procurement. Last year, farmers of the Seemanchal region were compelled to sell maize at throw away prices against the MSP of ₹1850 per quintal. Sporadic protests were made across the region by the farmers against the state government’s apathy towards their demand for maize procurement.An agricultural activist Mahendra Yadav, who had filed a petition in the Patna high court to restart procurement of maize, attributed the state government’s readiness to engage with Nafed for procurement of farm produce, other than paddy and wheat, to the ongoing farmers’ protest in the national capital.“Farmers had explored all options, from democratic protests to legal recourse, to sell their maize on the MSP, but the food and consumer protection department officials refused to take any notice,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-seeks-nafed-s-help-for-procurement-of-pulses-maize-at-msp-101611221329226.html
21-01-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government weighing quota formulas for panchayat polls||The Uttar Pradesh government was unsure over which mathematical formula to use for allocating different castes and class categories to village panchayats, causing the delay in finalisation of the reservation policy for the three-tier panchayat polls, people aware of the issue said.This situation had arisen even as potential candidates were anxiously waiting for the categorisation, they added. The state government had earlier indicated it wanted to hold panchayat polls in the state in March-April and preparations were being made accordingly. The real election activities including campaigning in rural areas will begin only after the category status of the village panchayats is known.Currently, two formulas are being discussed to finalise the reservation policy, according to those in the know of things. One is to adopt the rotation formula under which panchayats can be reserved for the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the Scheduled Castes (STs) and the Backward Classes (BCs) on the basis of the strength of their population under a block in the descending order but in a way, as far as possible, that a village panchayat is not reserved for the same category for which it was reserved in the previous election.The second formula being discussed suggested afresh allocations without taking the status of Panchayats in the previous elections into account and treating them as if they were never reserved or categorised earlier.State panchayati raj minister Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said the reservation options were being discussed before a policy was framed to allot posts/seats to the reserved categories in village panchayats and wards.“We have to decide between rotation and the Zero Formula,” he said, adding, “The policy will be finalised soon.”Officials in the panchayati raj department disclosed that the government wanted to drive the Zero Formula to reserve village panchayats afresh as if they were being reserved for the first time.“If this is done, then village panchayats under the block will be reserved for STs, SCs and BCs on the basis of the strength of their population in the descending order as per entitlement which is, for example, 21.5% for SCs,” the officials explained.“The panchayats/posts that are left after the quota allotment is over are allotted to the general or the unreserved category where a candidate belonging to any caste or class is entitled to contest,” they added.Also Read: Savarkar’s portrait in Uttar Pradesh House triggers rowA government order issued in 2015, however, is coming in the way of applying the Zero Formula and the government, officials said, may have to amend the old rules to have its way.As per the rules laid down under The Uttar Pradesh Panchayat Raj (Reservation and Allotment of Seats and Offices) (Tenth Amendment) Rules, 2015, the number of offices of pradhans for the STs, SCs, and the BCs “shall” be allotted to different gram panchayats under the development block on the basis of the ratio of their population in the panchayat area in the descending order, that is, from amongst the gram panchayat in the block.The gram panchayat, in the territorial area of which the ratio of population of the STs is the highest “shall” be allotted to them and gram panchayats, in the territorial area of which the ratio of population the SCs is the highest “shall” be allocated to them and the same for the BCs.And in the subsequent election, the allotment “shall” be made in the same manner but in a way, as far as possible that a gram panchayat is not allotted to the category to which that panchayat was reserved in the previous election, the rules clarify.The rules provide for fresh reservation or adoption of a Zero Formula in a situation when the general delimitation of the state makes massive changes in the boundaries of village panchayats.As many as 7,315 new village panchayats and around 10,000 new territorial constituencies (wards) were carved out following a general delimitation ordered by the then Akhilesh Yadav government in 2015 in the wake of Census in 2011.“Widespread changes made it necessary for the then government to go for reserving village panchayats afresh without factoring in their categorisation in previous elections,” those privy to the matter said.Prior to 2015, the general delimitation was done in 1995.“Logically, the government should proceed further from 2015 and adopt the rotation formula to reserve village panchayats and wards. The same formula should continue till there is general delimitation after 15 years or so,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-government-weighing-quota-formulas-for-panchayat-polls-101611220184868.html
21-01-2021||Pune||Citizens demand relaxing mask compulsion in private vehicles||A week after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) expunged the fine for not wearing masks inside private vehicles, similar demand is gathering steam in Pune. The Anti-Helmet Compulsion Action Committee (AHCAC) which has members from various political parties and social activists, on Wednesday, issued a joint statement addressing the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Vikram Kumar, urging him to stop collecting fines from people for not wearing masks in private vehicles. Last week, the BMC announced that passengers and driver riding a private vehicle will not have the compulsion of wearing masks inside. The AHCAC statement highlighted the decision taken by BMC in Mumbai. “In PMC region, a fine of ₹500 is still being collected from those not wearing masks in four-wheelers. The Pune Municipal Commissioner should take a decision to stop this,” stated the AHCAC in its statement. NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade, BJP leader Sandeep Khardekar, and RTI activist Vivek Velankar are among members of the AHCAC. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta stated he doesn’t have an objection in not fining travellers in private vehicles for not wearing mask. According to Gupta, it’s up to the PMC commissioner to take a call. “I have had consultation with the municipal commissioner this afternoon. I have clarified that I do not have any objection regarding this decision. It’s up to the PMC to decide now,” said Gupta.Citizens have in the recent past complained about the fines being collected from them for not wearing masks in private vehicles. Some have also said that a fine has been imposed if the mask was slipped below the nose. PMC chief Kumar said that the decision is under consideration. While BMC proceeded with the decision, PMC officials said the relaxation is still under consideration. “We have not taken such a decision yet. We are thinking about it. We will surely let you know if we decide something,” said Kumar. Many demanded that the enforcement of this fine has become a draconian exercise. “I had to pay ₹500 fine near agricultural college signal when I was traveling in my car with my driver. I was wearing a mask but it had dropped down below my nose. I had not realized it. Police stopped us and demanded to pay the fine which I paid. This does not make any sense. Wearing a mask is necessary but why such unnecessary harassment while traveling by a private vehicle?” asked Pandurang Kulkarni, a resident of Kothrud. There are also incidents of corruption in this process. “A passenger in my car was fined but then he gave ₹200 and was let off,” said Chetan Karote, a driver in a private transportation service in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/citizens-demand-relaxing-mask-compulsion-in-private-vehicles-101611220286805.html

Earlier this month, four blackbucks died after they were attacked by stray dogs in Katraj zoo. The Blackbuck is a protected animal under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, which prohibits their hunting and poaching.Referring to the Katraj zoo incident, MNS elected members on Wednesday raised safety concerns of all gardens across the city. MNS leader Vasant More said, “The administration is responsible for the deaths of blackbuck. It’s the negligence of the administration. The Municipal commissioner must take action against the concerned persons.” The zoo currently has 448 animals and about 100 staffers who keep the zoo guarded and take care of animals. The Raj-Thackeray led party also raised the issue of public safety in other gardens across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mns-agitates-over-blackbuck-deaths-in-katraj-zoo-raises-safety-concerns-101611220226912.html
21-01-2021||Pune||MSEDCL begins serving notices to defaulters; Fadnavis and Shetti oppose move||Despite the opposition parties and farmers’ outfits threatening a backlash, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) has released figures of dues of ₹2359.13 crore in the western Maharashtra region while sending notices to consumers to pay bills or face disconnections. According to MSEDCL, there are a total of 30,92,370 defaulters in western Maharashtra. Of the total consumer base, there are 8.33 lakh defaulters in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation area alone. The MSEDCL has appealed consumers to pay bills as early as possible failing which there will be disconnections of power supply as per electricity act 2003. At present, the MSEDCL has served notices as per the act to industrial and commercial defaulters. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) along with Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) strongly objected to the notices saying the government is changing its stand. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had earlier promised to waive off inflated power bills sent during lockdown though it later changed its stand and decided not to offer any incentive. “The government had earlier promised to waive off the bill but instead of doing that it has served notices to people. We will not let this happen,” said SSS leader Raju Shetti, who is part of MVA. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis also accused the MVA government of double standards. “Now, that the gram panchayat polls are over, the government has instructed to disconnect the power supply. During the lockdown period, MSEDCL gave hefty bills to consumers and now they have decided to disconnect electrical connections. The MSEDCL has given a concession to builders and developers in bills and now they are pressuring the common man to pay bills,” said Fadnavis in Mumbai. According to MSEDCL officials, the arrears amount has been increased from the last three months in western Maharashtra region that includes Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts. In the last three months from October to December-2020, there was an addition of around 15 lakh defaulters taking the outstanding amount to ₹693 crore. Now, it has reached 2,059 crore in the western Maharashtra region. In Pune district, there are a total of 13, 86,000 defaulters. MSEDCL has calculated an amount of ₹682 crore as arrears. The defaulters comprise of those in residential, industrial, commercial and public services, some have-not paid electricity bills in pre-Covid and post-Covid period (till date). Anukush Nale, regional director of MSEDCL of Western Maharashtra region said, the MSEDCL is facing a financial crunch. “We are appealing defaulters to pay electricity bills. At present, we are appealing to residential consumers. However, we have started sending notices to industrial and commercial consumers. We are not taking any action on residential consumers right now. However, if they fail to pay bills despite the repeated appeal, we have to take action as per the electricity act and it includes disconnection.” Box-1 Pune District – Total consumers- around 36 lakh Types of consumers No of consumers Amount ( ₹in cr) Residential– 11, 56.750- ₹635 Commercial - 1, 94,287- ₹295.55 Industrial 27,970 ₹150.35 Public services 6995 ₹15.60 Total 13, 86,000 1,096.90 Box-2 In PMC and PCMC area – Total consumers- appox 25 lakh Types of consumers No of consumers Amount ( ₹in cr) Residential– 6, 80,330 400.25 Commercial - 1, 35,000 206.00 Industrial 16,220 70.55 Public services 14, 2200 5.18 Total 8, 33,000 682.00||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/msedcl-begins-serving-notices-to-defaulters-fadnavis-and-shetti-oppose-move-101611220167584.html
21-01-2021||Pune||PMC proposes bicycle track on 10 routes, plans to expand network||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to revamp the existing bicycle track network in the city and introduce 22 new cycle tracks on various city roads. The civic body this week floated tenders inviting bids to build bicycle tracks on 10 routes including Swargate to Khadakwasla, which will be around 30 kilometres. The 10 streets identified by PMC for laying either new bicycle track or revamping existing ones are part of 22 routes where the civic body plans to build a 100-kilometre-long network of bicycle tracks. According to city mayor Murlidhar Mohol, due to the lack of political and administrative will, the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) could not be implemented, the bicycle scheme was part of the CMP. “We had planned to restore around 55 kilometres of the cycle track. However, the PMC had earlier dug roads to lay water pipelines for a 24x7 water supply project as a result of which work on the cycle track was affected. Now the civic body has completed 450 kilometres of water pipeline work, we have decided to restart cycle track work on those roads where PMC has laid pipelines. We have decided to revamp the bicycle scheme and for that, we have decided to propose funds,” said Mohol. The move comes a year after the public bicycle sharing programme launched in the city hit a deadlock despite initial success due to inadequate infrastructure. VG Kulkarni, chief superintendent of the PMC road department said, at present, Pune has a network of 100-kilometre bicycle tracks. “However, most of the tracks need to be redeveloped. In the upcoming budget, we have decided to develop new 25 kilometres of tracks on different roads. We will propose more than ₹20 crore in the budget,” said Kulkarni. In 2017, PMC prepared a comprehensive bicycle plan and launched a bicycle share scheme in various parts of the city. Pune Smart City Development Company Limited (PSCDCL) took credit and started a share scheme in Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) on December 5, 2018. After that, PMC continued the scheme in different parts of the city. After two years, all three private bicycle provider companies had withdrawn from the scheme due to a lack of response of public infrastructure and vandalisation of bicycles. Swargate to Khadakwasla track along canal road At present, the civic body has floated a tender to develop a cycle track from Swargate to Khadakwasla (up to Madhuban restaurant near Nanded city where the corporation limit ends). Besides that, the PMC has also proposed a cycle track along the canal from PL Deshpande garden (Sinhagad road) to Fun time multiplex at Wadgaon near Sinhagad road. It is a 4.5-kilometre stretch. Amar Shinde, executive engineer of road department said, “We have floated the tender of Swargate to Khadakwasla cycle route. Actually, we have given the name Swargate to Khadakwasla. But it is up to PMC limit which finishes before Nanded city. From Swaragate to Rajaram bridge, there is space to develop a cycle track as the civic body had made provision for a track on the footpath. It is around a two-kilometre stretch. We have to revamp and make a dedicated track. From Rajaram bridge to Fun time cinema, there are some road widening problems as well as a proposed flyover, so we are not able to develop the track. We have estimated ₹1.74 crore for a track from Abhiruchi where the flyover starts to Lokmat office.” Harshad Abhyankar, who was a member of the advisory committee in the Comprehensive Bicycle Plan (CBP), and present member of the non-motorized transport committee said, “There should be a political determination to make Pune a cycle city. We had completed detailed work in the CBP. As per City Mobility plan (CMP), there should be 90 per cent transport focus on non-motorized transport like walking, bicycle and public transport. We should have to develop footpaths, road crossing and cycle tracks on priority. At present, the cycle is not on priority as compared to fly over and other motorized transport systems. As per CBP, PMC should have to develop an 800 kilometre (both side of roads) cycle track with a total length of 400 kilometres. In the last three years, the corporation has developed around 25 kilometres of the cycle track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-proposes-bicycle-track-on-10-routes-plans-to-expand-network-101611220166837.html

Work of the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) has also been affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic and deadlines for the two metro lines (PCMC to Swargate and Vanaz to Ramwadi) has been extended.Prime Minister Modi did the ground breaking ceremony on December 18, 2018, for line three of Pune Metro which is in between Hinjewadi and Shivajinagar. It was expected that this line would get completed in the period of three years, but there has been no ground work as of now.PMRDA metropolitan commissioner Suhas Diwase, said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, some works got delayed but work is in progress. Last week, we made progress in the viability gap funding. Even most of the lands have been handed over to the contract company. The work of the casting yard is in progress. Very soon citizens would be able to see actual pillar works on ground but can’t specify the date for starting civil works. The other necessary works like soil testing, among other things are in progress.”Maha-Metro’s managing director Brijesh Dixit, said, “Due to the pandemic, some deadlines have changed. Labourers have returned to their hometowns. Though the project deadline was 2021 to complete the whole project, some parts would definitely become operational, but authorities would take decisions about commercial rights. The trials of the metro is going on in preferential corridors.”Recently, PMRDA demolished the flyover at University junction and is erecting a new flyover at this busy chowk along with the metro corridor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/hinjewadishivajingar-metro-yet-to-see-work-on-ground-101611220106777.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Sonu Sood’s appeal to stay demolition notice for Juhu building||The Bombay high court on Thursday rejected an appeal filed by actor Sonu Sood who had sought a stay on the demolition notice issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on October 27, 2020 against the alleged structural changes he had made to the Shakti Sagar building in Juhu.The actor had approached the high court after the city civil court at Dindoshi rejected his application in December last year. The single-judge bench of justice Prithviraj Chavan had heard the actor’s application on January 13 wherein he had sought a restraint against the BMC from taking any action based on its October 27 notice and also sought a stay on the operation of the city civil court order. Also Read: Bombay HC grants three weeks transit pre-arrest bail to Tandav makersOn October 27 last year, BMC had issued a notice under Section 53 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act to Sood and his wife Sonali, directing them to restore the property as per the approved plan or get approval for the changes they had made to the structure within a month.The actor had approached the city civil court seeking a stay on the BMC notice; however,on December 19 the civil court refused to grant him any relief and hence he moved the high court.In their application before the high court, Sood and his wife informed the court through advocate DP Singh that they did not carry out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building. The actor had submitted that the city civil court had failed to consider that the notice was issued by BMC as its illegal demands were not satisfied.Advocate Amogh Singh, appearing for the actor, told the court that the BMC notice was vague as it did not mention the nature of the alleged alterations and the BMC official concerned had not responded to the actor’s reply to the notice and hence the BMC notice had malafide intent and was in contravention of the provisions of the MRTP Act.However BMC refuted the allegations made by the actor and submitted that the actor and his wife were “habitual offenders”. An affidavit filed by the designated officer of the K-West ward through advocate Joel Carlos submitted, “It is stated that the appellants are habitual offenders and want to enjoy the commercial proceeds of their unauthorized work and therefore once again started reconstructing the demolished portion in order to make it operational as the hotel albeit illegally and without permission from the License Department.”The affidavit added that as the hotel was being run without even the mandatory license under Section 394 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, the prosecution was initiated by the Public Health Department, BMC.Senior counsel Anil Sakhare, appearing for the BMC, argued that Sood had constructed hotel rooms under the pretext of “beautification” and approached the court with “unclean hands”. Sakhare submitted that Sood could be permitted to continue with the commercial activity of running a residential hotel and hence sought dismissal of his application.After hearing the arguments, the bench refused to accept the request of Sood’s lawyer for 10 weeks’ time to comply with the BMC’s process as the relevant clearance from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While dismissing the application the court observed, “You (Sonu Sood) are too late. You’ve ample opportunity and law helps those who are diligent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-sonu-sood-s-appeal-to-stay-demolition-notice-for-juhu-building-101611218187331.html

21-01-2021||Other||Nearly 46% seats in Punjab Technical University vacant this academic session||Nearly 46% seats in colleges affiliated to the Inder Kumar Gujral Punjab Technical University (IKG-PTU) in the current academic session (2020-21) are vacant. The university managed to fill only 28,155 of the total 52,753 seats (which comes around 54%) even after extended round of counselling and direct admissions concluded on December 31 last year. The university authorities, however, say there was a jump of 4% in student intake as compared to the corresponding year when 35,166 of the total 68,801 seats (nearly 50%) were filled. This year, PTU offered nearly 16,048 less seats as compared to 2019-20, data shared by the PTU shows. Data shows that nearly 38% and 54% seats in the AICTE and non-AICTE courses this session remain vacant (See chart). More than 270 colleges, technical and non-technical institiutes in the state are affiliated to the PTU. Of the 15,626 BTech seats (10,773 of BTech and 4,853 BTech lateral entry in second year), 46% seats (7,118) remain vacant. The varsity authorities said it got very good response in BTech (lateral entry) as they could fill 48% seats while last year, 65% seats remained vacant. PTU main campus in Kapurthala district has nearly 34% more students as compared to 2019-20 as more than 1,500 students are currently studying there. PTU vice-chancellor Ajay Kumar Sharma said, “We developed PTU campus here in Kapurthala and the varsity’s ranking and perception among students improved with better infrastructure. We roped in top-end multinational companies during placement drives.” Experts say more students from Punjab are opting for overseas varsities for higher education and dearth of employment opportunities are two main reasons behind the trend. Pandemic also played a role in lesser student intake, especially those from outside the state. Other reason is pending dues of the post-matric scholarship scheme as students didn’t want to get harassed as degrees of students from the said category were being held back over non-payment of fee. As per the joint action committee of private colleges, nearly 1.25 lakh SC students dropped out of the colleges from 2016-17 to 2019-20 sessions because of scholarship issue as nearly 1,650 private colleges are yet to receive ₹1,800 crore from the Punjab government. A senior PTU functionary said there was need to improve the education standard in the affiliated colleges and create more employment opportunities. Narender Singh, former director of Guru Gobind Singh engineering college, Talwandi Sabo, said, “Our regulatory bodies, including the AICTE, are increasing seats without market research for job options. The private players for survival are recruiting under-qualified teachers at paltry salary and government couldn’t fix pay grade for them, leading to fall in the education standard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-46-seats-in-punjab-technical-university-vacant-this-academic-session-101611217648760.html

Saffron is considered to be the world’s most expensive spice and is known as the king of spices. It fetches between ₹1.5 lakh and ₹2.5 lakh a kilogram. Saffron production peaked in Kashmir in the 1990s with an annual average of around 15.5 tonnes. It has since declined as saffron fields mostly in Pampore near Srinagar depended on rain for irrigation particularly in September and October. Either too much or little rain has been among the reasons for the decline in production. Kashmir is the only place in India, where saffron is cultivated. It is the region’s second-largest industry after horticulture and estimated to support around 20,000 families. Iran and Spain are among the only other places where the spice is grown in the world.Chief agriculture officer Mohammad Qasim Ghani said the credit for the increase in the production goes to the National Mission on Saffron launched in 2010 under which root rejuvenation of the crop and sprinkle irrigation has been undertaken. He added there has more than 4.5 to 5 kilograms per hectare increase in the yield in the area where the scheme was implemented. “Kashmir has the potential to produce 6 to 7 kilograms of saffron per hectare. Earlier in the 1980s, our production was over 6 kilograms.”Ghani blamed dry weather spells and a decline in the area under saffron cultivation among the reasons for the earlier dip in the yield.In a tweet, Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha’s office lauded the achievement. “Great Achievement: Annual yield of the world’s costliest spice, #Saffron, cultivated in Kashmir has crossed 13 metric tonnes for the first time in the last 10 years.”Zahoor Ahmad, a grower, said timely rain and snow has led to good production this year. “We hope that from now onwards the production will keep rising.”Officials said saffron is grown on 3,700 hectares of land in Kashmir compared to 5,500 hectares. The ₹410 crore National Mission on Saffron Mission has been implemented on 3,500 hectares of the land. Of this, 3,200 hectares of the land is located in Pampore, and the rest in Srinagar and Budgam.Officials said the mission has helped bring more land under the saffron cultivation as many growers had earlier started converting saffron fields into apple orchards and using them for commercial purposes due to their prime locations mostly along the Srinagar-Jammu highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kashmirs-annual-saffron-yield-crosses-13-metric-tonnes-for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-101611217647465.html

He had also requested the court to direct the BMC against initiating any demolition.The court instructed Singh to ask his client to approach the civic body regarding demolition action. Justice Prithviraj Chavan, while dismissing Sood’s appeal and application said, “Law helps only those who are diligent. The ball is now in the office of the BMC...you may approach them.”“You are too late. You had ample opportunity,” Justice Chavan was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Sood approached the high court earlier this month challenging an order of a city court that had dismissed his suit against the BMC's notice.The BMC had alleged that the actor made structural changes to his six-storey residential building and converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions. The civic body also filed a complaint against the actor at the Juhu police station in January. They sought an FIR against the actor for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without taking permission from the civic body. Police still have not registered an FIR against the actor.The actor claims that he has not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the building. BMC has denied Sood’s claims and on Wednesday called the actor a ‘habitual offender’.“Sonu Sood is a habitual offender and wants to enjoy commercial proceeds of their unauthorised constructions and therefore has once again started reconstructing the demolished portion in order to make it operational as the hotel albeit illegally and without permission from the licensing department,” BMC said in its plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/illegal-construction-sonu-sood-s-appeal-against-bmc-notice-dismissed-by-hc-101611214008424.html
21-01-2021||Patna||Bihar: Hanged in 1857, Waris Ali of Tirhut finally added to Dictionary of Martyrs||A fresh chapter has been added in the history of Tirhut in the state. Waris Ali, the 1857 war hero from Tirhut has officially been declared a martyr. His name has been included in the Dictionary of Martyrs, India’s Freedom Struggle (1857-1947), published by the ministry of culture in collaboration with the Indian Council for Historical Research (ICHR). Waris Ali was a jamaadar at Baruraj police station (Muzaffarpur) and was arrested in June 1857 on charges of writing seditious letters to support the rebels who had attempted to break into Muzaffarpur’s Central Jail in 1857. He was tried and hanged on July 7, 1857.But for decades his name remained obscured, confined only to the government records while the sacrifices he had made for the country remained unrecognised. In 2017 efforts were made to get Waris Ali and 27 other freedom fighters from Tirhut the status of martyrs. With the publication of this new list of martyrs, Waris Ali has become the first martyr from Tirhut. Till date Khudiram Bose, the revolutionary who was hanged in 1908, was considered the first martyr from Tirhut. Khudiram was hanged for attempting to assassinate a British judge, Magistrate Douglas Kingsford, by throwing bomb on the carriage he was supposed to be travelling in Muzaffarpur. Two British women had died in that incident “Finally after 162 years, the contributions and sacrifices made by Tirhut in the country’s freedom struggle have been recognised. The publication of the Dictionary of Martyrs has virtually changed the history of Tirhut,” Dr Ashok Anshuman, state coordinator of the Dictionary of Martyrs and a history teacher at the LS College, Muzaffarpur, said. Besides, the 27 freedom fighters of Tirthut who were deported to Port Blair during freedom struggle, too have been given a status of war heroes, the state coordinator of the dictionary, said. “The ICHR has approved their names,” he said. Ranjit Kumar, a local, said initiatives in this direction was taken by former Union minister, late Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Qaiser Imam from New India Foundation. “They wanted Waris Ali and 27 other freedom fighters from Tirhutto be recognised as martyrs and wrote to the Muzaffarpur administration to bring the matter to the notice of the general administration department, Bihar government,” he said. In 2017, the state government recommended the matter to Ministry of Home Affairs, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-hanged-in-1857-waris-ali-of-tirhut-finally-added-to-dictionary-of-martyrs-101611215067166.html

21-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Restaurants must display jhatka and halal distinction, says SDMC||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has now made it mandatory for restaurants and meat shops to display whether the meat they are selling is halal or jhatka. The south civic body passed a proposal regarding this on Wednesday in its House meeting. Narendra Chawla, leader of the House in SDMC, said that it was the right of the consumer to know what type of food he or she is consuming so this proposal is regarding “ensuring the very right” of the consumer. “Many people do not eat jhatka meat while others don’t eat halal but in restaurants, you cannot tell the meat type being served. You may find halal or jhatka meat written on the meat shops but such a practice is rare in restaurants. So it is a healthy exercise to mention whether halal or jhatka meat is being served at restaurants,” Chawla said.Also read | HC directs SDMC, ASI to look into illegal construction near Qutub MinarThe proposal, which was passed in the House, stated, “Thousands of restaurants are in operation in 104 wards of four zone falling under South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Out of these, meat is being served in about 90% of restaurants but it is not displayed by them whether the meat being served by the restaurants is halal or jhatka... Eating halal meat is forbidden and against religion for Hindus and Sikhs. Therefore, this meeting resolves that this direction be given to restaurants and meat shops that they write mandatorily about the meat being sold by them.”However, SDMC Leader of Opposition and Aam Aadmi Party councillor Prem Chauhan said, “It is an unnecessary order. These are tactics to divert attention from real issues related to corruption and non-payment of salaries in the civic body.”A similar proposal is already in place in shops and restaurants under East Delhi Municipal Corporation areas.

The three days of vaccination which started on January 16 has witnessed participation of 32,379 healthcare workers against the target of 49,131.The program has witnessed a steady decline in participation against the set targets for all three days with 73.79% of the intended beneficiaries taking the jab on day 1, followed by a dip on Day 2 to 68.72% and 54.89% on Tuesday. The health official held the technical glitch in the Co-Win app as the chief cause for the declining number of participants.However, the CM held the verbal exchange between the two vaccine manufacturers as the reason behind the decline in participation.“Health workers have come in fewer numbers for vaccination. This is also due to the exchange of words done for commercial reasons between the two vaccine manufacturers. Yesterday, Bharat Biotech released guidelines regarding its vaccine. If these guidelines were issued earlier, people's trust would have increased in the vaccine,” tweeted Gehlot.In another tweet, he said, “I appeal to the health workers to come forward to get the vaccine.”Gehlot's statement came a day after the state government urged the Central government to allow on spot registration of beneficiaries as the vaccination program was hindered due to technical glitches in the CoWin app.A senior doctor said the CoWin application does not work effectively and has problems. The beneficiaries didn’t receive the messages for vaccination on time and were later called telephonically.“We have asked the GoI to allow vaccination through on-spot registrations as there is some technical snag with the software,” stated Dr Sudheer Bhandari, Principal SMS Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-appeals-to-healthcare-staff-to-come-forward-for-covid-vaccination-101611203938269.html

Students also cried that unlike other education boards, BSEB has not reduced syllabus which has added to their woes.Amit Kumar, a Class 12 student of Govt Boys’ Senior Secondary School, said, “No online class was held in my school in 10 months. Most of us rely on coaching centres for better preparation but they were also closed. I doubt that I will pass the examination.”“BSEB is doing unfair with us as neither syllabus was reduced nor extra time is being given for preparation. This way our performance will deteriorate in comparison to other board students. Ultimately, we will suffer as low percentage will not fetch us good colleges for higher studies”, rued 17-year-old.Another Class 12 student Supriya Rani said, “Syllabus is much vast and complex than preceding class. Despite self-study, I am not able to understand topics of Physics and Mathematics. With barely 10 days left for the examination, I am not confident to clear my doubts and write papers.”Another lot of students raised question on safety protocols being followed in schools after several students and teachers tested Covid-19 positive in Patna, Gaya and Munger early this month.To raise their demand, students also took to twitter using #postpone_biharboardexam2021.When contacted, a teacher of Shastri Nagar Girls’ School, said, “After reopening of school, attendance is very low.

21-01-2021||Mumbai||BMC election: Mumbai group begins survey to check awareness of electorate||Ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal (BMC) elections in 2022, a group of alert citizens has initiated a survey to know educate people about their municipal wards and corporators.The survey, conducted by Jaago Mumbaikar group, will look at two aspects -- if people are aware about their ward, their corporator and BMC’s responsibilities and what are the areas concerning them. Activists say that though BMC elections directly impact one’s quality of life, the awareness among voters is generally low, especially compared to assembly and Lok Sabha elections.In 2017, the voter turnout for BMC elections at 55% was a record high for Mumbai since 1992. It was just 44% in the 2012 civic election as opposed to 54% in the 2014 assembly elections and around 55% in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The city has 24 municipal wards and 227 electoral wards. The elections are expected to be held in the first half of 2022.A member from Jaago Mumbaikar, who did not wish to be named, said, “Once we have the survey results, we are planning to run a campaign to bring awareness among Mumbaikars. We will also meet all political parties insisting on giving tickets to candidates with a clean record.”Milind Mhaske, project coordinator, Praja Foundation which has been releasing councillor reports and also training councillors in the city, said, “Around 30-40% of people in the city might still not know about their electoral wards or corporator, though they might know who their MP or MLA is. This (survey) exercise is important as it will create awareness among sections, which may otherwise not be interested in participating in municipal elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmcelectionmumbai-group-begins-survey-to-check-awareness-of-electorate-101611203786136.html
21-01-2021||Kolkata||Full EC bench in Bengal to take stock of poll preparedness, law and order||The full bench of the Election Commission of India (EC) would be camping in West Bengal over the next two days to take stock of the preparedness, and law and order situation in the poll-bound eastern state. The poll panel, headed by chief election commissioner Sunil Arora and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar landed in Kolkata on Wednesday afternoon. “On Thursday, the EC bench is scheduled to hold meetings with representatives of political parties, central and state regulatory agencies and senior IAS and IPS officers. On Friday, the bench will hold a meeting with the state’s chief secretary, home secretary and director general of police,” said a top official of the state government. This is the first time that the full bench of the poll panel has come to the state ahead of the crucial assembly elections. Earlier, deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain had visited the state twice to take stock of the situation. Also read | EC gears up to launch digital voter ID cardsWith the assembly election approaching, the political temperature is rising in West Bengal. While verbal duels are continuing between leaders of the two political parties every day, incidents of political clashes are also being reported from across the state. “The poll panel has already asked for regular reports of law and order situation in the state, including status of non-bailable arrest warrants and seizure of illegal arms and ammunitions, from the administration. A stern warning has also been sent out to officials that the EC won’t tolerate any dereliction of duty,” said a senior official of the poll panel. While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has already raised demands of enforcing the Model Code of Conduct and deployment of Central Armed Police Forces in the state at the earliest, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) has said that law and order is a state subject and Central forces can only be deployed after elections are announced. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has also repeatedly expressed his concern over violence in the state and has, on many occasions, alleged that the law and order situation in the state has deteriorated. The TMC, however, has refuted the charges every time. Before coming to West Bengal, the ECI bench had gone to Assam, another state where elections are scheduled around the same time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/full-ec-bench-in-bengal-to-take-stock-of-poll-preparedness-law-and-order-101611201925878.html

21-01-2021||Lucknow||Row over Hindutva icon Veer Savarkar’s portrait in UP Legislative Council||Installation of Hinduva icon Veer Savarkar’s portrait in the picture gallery of Uttar Pradesh legislative council has sparked a political controversy with the Opposition demanding its removal and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) standing its ground and even asking the Opposition to take inspiration from Savarkar’s life instead of ‘politicking’ over his portrait.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath dedicated the renovated and beautified legislative council to the public on Tuesday. He also inaugurated its picture gallery that houses portraits of the freedom fighters and chairpersons of the council.The chief minister looked at the newly-installed portrait of Veer Savarkar and said he was a great freedom fighter and philosopher, who was a source of inspiration for every Indian.However, a Congress MLC was swift to object and termed the inclusion of Savarkar’s portrait in the gallery an “insult” to other freedom fighters, who he said, did not bow to the atrocities of the British and even laid down their lives for the country. He demanded that the portrait be removed and placed in the BJP office.Legislative Council chairman and Samajwadi Party leader Ramesh Yadav said he had directed the principal secretary of the council to submit a report over the induction of the portrait within seven days following the objection raised by the Congress MLC.The controversy continues to simmer with the SP chief and former chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, calling for a debate over Savarkar;s contribution to the freedom struggle. “All those who contributed to the freedom struggle should be honoured but there are different kinds of allegations, documents and stories that raise question marks over his (Savarkar’s) role in the freedom struggle,” Yadav said.BJP state unit spokesperson Chandramohan shot back at the Opposition terming Savrakar’s life as an inspiration for people across the country and claimed that both Congress and the Samajwadi Party worked as dynasties and were serving their “vested” political interests by questioning Savarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/row-over-hindutva-icon-veer-savarkar-s-portrait-in-up-legislative-council-101611199964692.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Farmers’ agitation: Delhi borders continue to be closed at multiple points||The farmers’ agitation at Delhi borders entered its 58th day on Thursday with the national Capital’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh continuing to remain closed at multiple points. The borders with Uttar Pradesh at Chilla and Ghazipur remained closed for those coming from Noida and Ghaziabad. Commuters coming into Delhi from Uttar Pradesh have been advised by Delhi Traffic Police to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders which have remained mostly unaffected. The traffic at these borders is also slow as police continue to check these points for groups of protesting farmers who may try to enter the Capital. For borders shared between Delhi and Haryana, the routes passing through Singhu, Tikri, Auchandi, Piau Manyari and Saboli and Mangesh have continued to remain closed. The traffic police said they have been diverting traffic from Mukarba and GTK Road. Motorists can choose other border routes such as the Delhi-Gurgaon and Delhi-Faridabad stretches opening between the two states. Today, farmer leaders, under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, will discuss government’s proposal of suspending the farm laws for a year. On Wednesday, the government had presented a proposal before the farmers that farm laws will be suspended for 18 months. An affidavit will be given in the Supreme Court committing to the same, the government had proposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-agitation-delhi-borders-continue-to-be-closed-at-multiple-points-101611198205291.html

According to the agency, Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami approached Dasgupta to manipulate TRPs of some news channels to benefit his own and Republic Bharat channels, owned by ARG Outlier Media Pvt. Ltd.Opposing Dasgupta’s bail application in the sessions court, special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray submitted that although the charge-sheet in the case had been filed, there were many aspects that need to be investigated. He argued that Dasgupta’s release could lead to tampering with the prosecution witnesses who work under him.The prosecution has cited purported WhatsApp chats as evidence of the allegations against Dasgupta.“We have shown to the court the WhatsApp chat regarding the TRPs in which Dasgupta promised to take down some other channels and put Arnab’s channel on the higher position,” he said.Dasgupta’s lawyer told the court that there was no evidence to back the allegations against him.

21-01-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka HC says anti-cow slaughter ordinance 'constitutionally valid'||In a major boost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the State, the Karnataka High Court on Wednesday observed that the provision in the ordinance relating to ban on cow slaughter is constitutionally valid.A batch of petitions was filed by Mohammed Arif Jameel and others, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance. Advocate General Prabhuling Navadgi appeared for the State before the High Court.The state government contended before the court that the ordinance was in consonance with the Directive Principles of State Policy in the Constitution. The State further contended by filing a preliminary statement of objections that the cattle population over the past eight years has substantially reduced from 95,16,484 in the 2012 census (19th livestock census) to 84,69,004 in 2019 (20th livestock census), and that as per the 2019 census 2,38,296 cattle are being slaughtered every year and on an average, it works out to 652 per day.Under the Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (INAPH) Scheme of the Central government, ear tagging of cattle is undertaken using Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) conforming to Bureau of India Standards, and out of total cattle population of 1,15,53,564, about 96,00,000 cattle are ear-tagged and the work is in progress, the government pointed out.In its statement, the state government further submitted that there are 4,212 veterinary institutions throughout the State headed by veterinary officers and inspectors who are available on call and there are 176 mobile clinics.After hearing the Advocate General, the Court observed that the issue relating to the ban on cow slaughter has been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Mirzapur's case as being constitutionally valid.The court, however, observed that the government must ensure that no coercive action is taken against farmers who transport animals for animal husbandry, agriculture, and other bona fide purposes until Rules are framed under the provisions of the ordinance. The development in the High Court today clears hurdles for the Government to effectively implement the cow slaughter ordinance.The anti-cow slaughter law came into effect in Karnataka from January 18, the state government said in a notification."All provisions of The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, 2020 comes into force from January 18," the Karnataka government said.According to the order, three and seven years jail and (or) a fine up to ₹5 lakh will be imposed under this law and subsequent offences can invite fines up to ₹10 lakh and a jail term of up to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-hc-says-anti-cow-slaughter-ordinance-constitutionally-valid-101611191605855.html

They laid down their lives fighting for the freedom of the country.” The Congress legislator said that the portrait should be removed and placed in the party office of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Hitting out at the opposition, BJP state unit spokesperson Chandramohan said: “The life and struggle of Savarkar is an inspiration to the people across the country.

21-01-2021||Kolkata||‘Goli Maaro’ chants at BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s rally in Bengal||Supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday allegedly raised the controversial “goli maaro” slogan at a roadshow in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, a day after a similar slogan was raised by supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress.The slogan, “desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro” (shoot the traitors of the nation), was raised by people carrying the BJP flag who were seen trailing a truck carrying former Trinamool Congress leader Suvendu Adhikari who is now with the BJP, the BJP’s Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh and BJP’s Hooghly MP Locket Chatterjee in the district’s Chandannagar area.Condemning the incident, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said the party “does not endorse it”. “Our party does not endorse it at all. People carrying the BJP flag cannot talk like that,” he told mediapersons in Kolkata.The BJP spokesperson also hit out at the TMC, saying that the slogan raised at the Chandannagar rally was aimed at terrorists while workers of the ruling party had used it against “traitors of Bengal”.“However, one must understand that when we talk of traitors of India we mean mercenaries and terrorists who kill innocent citizens and pose a threat to the nation. The intention of TMC workers was quite different because they talked of traitors of Bengal,” he said.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh targeted the BJP and said that the party believes in the “culture of violence”. “The TMC workers should not have uttered it but the BJP has proved once again that it believes in the culture of violence in letter and spirit,” he said.On Tuesday, the BJP had alleged that a section of people who took part in a massive TMC road show in Kolkata shouted slogans about “shooting traitors in Bengal”.Asked about the purported “goli maaro” slogan, TMC leader Madan Mitra said: “Bullets are not part of Bengal’s political culture, but the people could certainly slap BJP leaders.”In January last year, Union minister Anurag Thakur egged the audience at a Delhi election rally to raise the slogan by repeatedly chanting the first half of it, and waiting for the crowd to complete it.West Bengal is scheduled to go polls before May this year.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/goli-maaro-chants-at-bjp-leader-suvendu-adhikari-s-rally-in-bengal-101611188561231.html
21-01-2021||Bangalore||After cabinet expansion, dissent brews in Karnataka BJP||Troubles are mounting for Karnataka chief minister B.S.Yediyurappa after his attempt to quell dissent within the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by expanding the cabinet only widened the fissures within the two-year-old government.Basanagouda Ramanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the legislator from Bijapur City, on Wednesday targeted Yediyurappa by calling for an end to family-based politics in the BJP.“Our Prime Minister’s dreams are development, end of dynasty politics, corruption-free government. I will request our national president that only one person from a household should be given power. It cannot be that there is an MP, MLC, MLA, board heads and even people in-charge of party affairs from only one family,” Yatnal said in Bengaluru.The renewed opposition to Yediyurappa comes at a time when there is a growing clamour by dissidents for the removal of the 77-year old who has been accused of trying to placate his family and staunch loyalists; The troubles are only likely to increase as the CM turns a year older in February; there is a tacit rule in the BJP that those above 75 years of age should not hold any administrative posts.A cabinet expansion last week triggered open criticism of the CM by those who missed out on ministerial berths.Yediyurappa has also been fighting charges of neglecting Kannada for Hindi. He faces the task of finding ways to make up for shortfall in revenue from the Centre ahead of the state budget in March.So deep is the divide within the state BJP that Yediyurappa now faces opposition not just from his earlier detractors but those who were once seen to be close to the Lingayat leader.M.P.Renukacharya, the legislator from Honnali, on Wednesday met with senior BJP leaders including Prakash Javedekar and Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi to express his concern on being overlooked for a cabinet post.“All the meetings went well,” Renukacharya said, refusing to disclose more details of the talks he had with the central leaders.“Core BJP MLAs are unhappy and are now planning to approach the top leadership of the organisation and the Centre to express their concerns,” said a three-time legislator of the BJP, requesting not to be named.Incidentally, his first challenge after entering office for a record fourth term in July 2019 was also related to his cabinet as he struggled to get his choice of names approved by the BJP’s central leadership, forcing him to work alone for nearly three weeks.The pressure has forced Yediyurappa to hold out assurances and promises to disgruntled elements within his party of a cabinet expansion to accommodate those left out of his ministerial council. Heavy lobbying continues for portfolios like heavy industry, energy, rural development, panchayat raj and the all important Bengaluru in-charge ministries, people aware of the developments say.Yediyurappa scrambled between meetings on Wednesday to discuss portfolio allocations. So busy is he with the administration and cabinet reshuffle that the chief minister could not even savour the fact that Karnataka had been named the most innovative state in the country by NITI Aayog.Political analysts say that as the government enters the third year, how the BJP shapes its strategy in the state will become more clear.“The government is entering the third year of existence that will leave just two years before the next elections. Of this one year will be entirely dedicated towards elections and the BJP will have to decide if they want to keep Yediyurappa or replace him right now,”said A.Narayana, a political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/after-cabinet-expansion-dissent-brews-in-karnataka-bjp-101611188278289.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Front line workers, elderly may have to wait two extra weeks to get Covid jabs||The low turnout of health care workers in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive in Delhi is likely to push the vaccine roll out schedule for front line workers and the elderly by at least two weeks, senior officials in the state government said on Wednesday.Since India launched one of the biggest immunisation campaigns to control the coronavirus disease on Saturday, Delhi has been able to vaccinate 12,853 health care workers so far. But this is just 48.72% against the Delhi government’s target to inoculate 26,378 health care workers in three days. Experts have said that if people remain hesitant in coming forward to taking more shots, the government should consider opening up to allow other priority groups – and maybe even the general public – to take doses.Senior government officials said if current trends continue, then front line workers will not get their turn until March. As a result, immunisation of the general public, starting with people above the age of 50 years, can get pushed back to as late as mid-April.“The issue is being closely monitored by the state health department and the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). As of now, on an average 4,284 people are getting vaccinated for Covid-19 each day in the city. If the turnout does not improve soon and more centres are not added, then it will take the entire month of February and the first week of March to complete just the first dose of vaccination for the 120,000 health care workers,” said a senior government official involved in the immunisation programme.As per the initial plan of the Delhi government, the first batch of 120,000 registered health care workers were to be vaccinated by February 13. There are 81 centres in the city, each of which has a target of vaccinating at least 100 people a day. The vaccination happens four days a week — Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.As of now, the Capital has received a total of 274,500 doses, which according to the government is sufficient to inoculate 120,000 health care workers. There are a total of 240,000 health care workers registered in the city for taking the vaccine. Health officials said another batch of vaccines would be required to immunise the reamainig 120,000 health care workers. A Covid-19 vaccination is considered complete if a beneficiary has taken two doses within a gap of 28 days.A government spokesperson said the decision to increase the number of session sites or vaccination centres requires the approval from the Union health ministry. “The session sites are directly regulated by the ministry. So, increasing the number of centres will depend on directions issued by the Centre. The Delhi government is working on extensive IEC campaigns to spread awareness among health care workers regarding the safety of the vaccines. Several districts have started workshops from today (Wednesday) on this,” the spokesperson said.Dr Yogesh Kushwaha, nodal officer for vaccination at Lal Bahadur Shastri (LBS) hospital in east Delhi said at present all the 81 centres, all of which are hospitals, are vaccinating health care workers that belong to their institutions only.“At least 700 health care workers from LBS are to be vaccinated, but in the past three days, less than 150 workers have been immunised. Because of the low turnout, it will now take as much as three weeks to give the first doses of Covid-19 vaccine to all our 700 health workers,” he said.A senior health official said the turnout is likely to improve in the coming days with the government now allowing vaccination on a “walk-in” basis to the registered beneficiaries.“We are hoping to see a turnaround in the next two weeks as now even those registered beneficiaries who are not in the scheduled list for the day can get the jabs if they just walk-in at the session site. Any vaccination campaign always sees a tepid response in the beginning. It will take time. Districts are also carrying out different awareness campaigns and word of mouth plays an important role. As more health care workers take the vaccine shots in the coming days, people will be less scared or apprehensive about the safety of the vaccines,” a health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/front-line-workers-elderly-may-have-to-wait-two-extra-weeks-to-get-covid-jabs-101611185026087.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet Turkman’s Bhoora||Histories and havelis, kebabs and tikkis, bazaars and lanes. People flock to Old Delhi from all over for these attractions. But nobody comes here to hang out with one of its most beautiful elements: Bhoora, the dog.He is the living landmark of Turkman Gate, one of the only four surviving of the original 14 gateways of the Mughal-era Walled City. Bhoora is among the many strays in the area, but stands out for his shaggy bhoora (brown) coat and his quiet nature. He is very well-behaved, never barks, never chases the cats, and brings out the best from every creature here, including the humans.This evening he is sitting on the pavement, just outside the building housing the Haj Manzil, across the lane from the stone gateway. Actually, to call Bhoora a stray would be true only up to a point. For years he lived in Turkman Gate through thick and thin with beggar Mumtaz. They were always seen together on the same part of the sidewalk, be it day or night.Abandoned years before by his family, following a road accident in West Bengal that made him lose his leg, the bearded Mumtaz found a new home in Turkman Gate, where he also made a friend in Bhoora. They would eat together, with Mumtaz sharing with Bhoora whatever he would be offered by the passersby.Mumtaz died a few months ago and for a time it seemed that Bhoora would be alone in the world. But he swiftly adopted Muhammed Abrar, a banana seller, who parks his cart daily outside the aforementioned Haj Manzil.Making a little fire for Bhoora from wood pieces, Mr Abrar talks of how Bhoora started sitting by his stall, not long after his companion’s passing, until they became friends. “Now I make a bed for him every night under my cart.” Mr Abrar lives in Narela with his (human) family but sometimes he stays over “and then I sleep on the top of the cart and Bhoora sleeps underneath.”Turkman Gate teems with street hawkers and it is a fact that everybody here is kind to the dogs and cats milling about, but everyone has a particularly soft corner for Bhoora. “Maybe because he is so seedha-saadha (simple), and everyone feels he is still missing Mumtaz.”Now Mr Abrar calls Bhoora by his name. The dog turns to him with wide unquestioning eyes, and trustfully sits by the banana seller’s legs, close to the fire, looking at peace.Bhoora is always seen about the gateway, and in case you can’t spot him, just ask anyone in the area for his whereabouts. He is known to all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-turkman-s-bhoora-101611180901477.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||We will not shift the venue of the Republic Day tractor rally, farmers to police||New Delhi: Farmers protesting at Delhi borders on Wednesday reiterated that they will take out a “peaceful” tractor rally on the Outer Ring Road on Republic Day and urged the police not to force them to shift it anywhere else. The Delhi police had urged the farmers to either cancel the rally or shift it to the Kundali-Manesar-Palwal expressway on the periphery of the Capital.With this the second round of talks between the police and the farmers remained inconclusive on Wednesday.The leaders of several farmer unions have announced to conduct a tractor rally on the Outer Ring Road as a part of their ongoing protest against the three new farm laws. Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said, “The police again asked the farmer unions to shift the proposed tractor march to Western Peripheral Expressway or Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway. But farmers have made it clear that the march will be conducted only on the Outer Ring Road.”“We have assured the police that the march will remain peaceful. We are not going to disrupt peace in the city. We are not marching to the India Gate or the Red Fort. Police should allow us to conduct our peaceful march,” he added.A senior police officer, who was part of the discussion, said, “The talks with farmers are still on. We are yet to reach any consensus.”Earlier on Tuesday, the farmers also shared the route map of their proposed tractor rally and said that the parade will touch all the borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be participating in the tractor rally, they said.Another farmer leader and president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Darshan Pal, said another round of talks with the police will be held on Thursday. “The police have apprehensions that the rally can be infiltrated by some anti-social elements. But we have assured that the protest will remain peaceful. We have been protesting for around two months and no incident of violence has been reported from Delhi borders. We have told police that the crowd might get provoked, if they are not allowed to carry out the march,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court said it would be “highly irregular and improper” for it to either stop or allow the protesting farmer unions to hold a Republic Day tractor rally in the Capital, forcing the Central government to withdraw its plea to injunct the farmers.The protesters said when the apex court had not stopped them, the police should also not interfere. “Why is the police worried about the safety and security of the farmers only during the tractor march? They are not even bothered to see hundreds of farmers dying every day during the protest. Hundreds of farmers are travelling to Delhi to participate in this rally. Things might get out of control if police interferes,” said Amandeep Sindhu, a farmer protesting at the Singhu border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/we-will-not-shift-the-venue-of-the-republic-day-tractor-rally-farmers-to-police-101611180536120.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Five more persons held for Pitampura jewellery heist||Five more persons, one of them a 30-year-old woman, have been arrested in connection with last week’s dacoity at a jewellery showroom in north-west Delhi’s Pitampura. Nearly seven kilograms of gold jewellery worth over ₹3.5 crore were looted at gunpoint by a group of eight robbers, with the police terming the heist one of the biggest in Delhi in the recent past.More than one kilogram of stolen jewellery was recovered from the bank locker of the arrested woman -- she is the sister of one of the arrested men -- while another 1.5 kilos of gold was recovered from four persons who were arrested between Monday and Wednesday from West Bengal, Bihar and Delhi.Earlier, the police had recovered 3.5 kilos of gold jewellery from the suspects.The total number of arrests in the case is now 12 -- eight men who were involved in the dacoity and four receivers of the stolen jewellery. Nearly six kilos of the stolen jewellery has been recovered so far, the police said.“One or two suspects are still on the run and their arrests may lead to the recovery of the remaining jewellery. It was one of the biggest dacoity in the recent years in Delhi,” said joint commissioner of police (northern range) Surender Singh Yadav.According to Yadav, two of the arrested men, identified as Pitu Sheikh and Suraj, had committed a burglary at the same jewellery showroom in 2019. They were arrested and the stolen jewellery recovered from them at that time.In the latest dacoity, which happened around 4am on January 15, a group of eight robbers arrived outside the jewellery showroom in Pitampura, held the security guard, Chandan Vinay Shukla, hostage at gunpoint and broke into the showroom. They ransacked the shop and fled with nearly seven kilos of gold jewellery.“The entire heist took just three minutes. The guard informed the police about the dacoity only after the dacoits fled,” said special commissioner of police (law and order, west zone) Sanjay Singh, adding that a case was registered and four teams, including the special staff of north-west and Rohini districts, having around two dozen investigators, were tasked to crack the case and nab the suspects.As the guard had told the police that the dacoits had come in a Honda City car, investigators scanned through the footage of 30 CCTV cameras along a 5km route that the suspects had taken to reach Rithala Metro station, where the vehicle was found abandoned at a vacant plot.“We got the car’s registration number from one of the cameras installed near the showroom. We followed the route and recovered the vehicle -- it has been stolen from Rohini Sector 5 on the night of January 11,” said an investigator, requesting anonymity.During the probe, the officer said investigators learnt about the 2019 burglary at the showroom. They learnt that the three men arrested for that burglary lived in the same neighbourhood from where the Honda City was recovered.Further probe led to the identification of the suspects living in the neighbourhood. Police collected information about their whereabouts and nabbed them from Haryana, Delhi, West Bengal and Bihar.Brothers Pitu Sheikh and Mintu Sheikh were caught from Hazaribagh railway station; they were on a Howrah-bound train and were fleeing to their home town in West Bengal with the stolen jewellery. Another robber Reet Mohammad was caught from West Bengal. His interrogation led to the arrest of his brother Sameer Sheikh from Rithala. One Hakim was caught from Patna on Wednesday, the officer said.The other arrested persons were identified as Shankar, Suraj, Saleem alias Monu, Rahul, Sanu Rehman, Sheikh Ripal.“Suraj’s interrogation led to the arrest of his sister to whom he had given his share of the stolen jewellery. We interrogated her and she led us to her bank locker in which around 1,100 grams of gold jewellery was kept,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-five-more-persons-held-for-pitampura-jewellery-heist-101611180104383.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Farmer dies by suicide at Tikri, leaves note behind||A 42-year-old farmer from Rohtak died by suicide at Delhi’s Tikri border on Wednesday.Police said the farmer allegedly consumed poison and was rushed to a hospital in Mangolpuri during the wee hours of Wednesday, but couldn’t be saved. He died at around 3:30 am.The farmer was identified as Jai Baghwan Rana who had been protesting at the Tikri border. “The police were informed that a farmer had consumed poison at the Tikri border at around 2:30am. He was immediately rushed to a hospital in an ambulance that had been deployed at the protest site. He was declared dead at around 3:30 am. The police have initiated a probe,” said a senior police official.According to protesters at the Tikri border, Rana had left behind a note urging the government and the farmers’ union leaders to resolve the ongoing stand-off. The purported suicide note stated, “My name is Jai Bhagwan Rana and I am a small farmer. The government says it is a matter of only two to three states, but farmers from all over the country are protesting against the laws. Sadly, it is not a movement now, but a fight of issues. The talks between the farmers and the Centre also remain deadlocked”“The government should call the farmers from all states and take their opinion in front of the media and decide for itself,” he added.Several farmers have allegedly died by suicide in the last few months at the borders of the national capital, where the ongoing agitation entered day 56 on Wednesday. Last month, a lawyer from Patiala had died by suicide near the Tikri border. A Sikh preacher had also ended his life at the Singhu border over the ongoing agitation in December.The farmer union leaders have been taking several measures to sensitize farmers and keep them motivated. Several posters and banners have also been put up at protest sites requesting agitating farmers to choose life.Earlier on Wednesday, another farmer Dhana Singh (60) also died due to a heart attack at the Tikri border. Singh was a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Ugrahan) and belonged to Patiala.Manjeet Singh, district president of Patiala, BKU (Ugrahan), said that the deceased was participating in the protest since November last year. “We have lost so many brothers while protesting on the highways in this bone-chilling weather, but it’s not bothering the government. The government should understand that these sacrifices will further strengthen our movement since now we have to also fight for those who are dying during the protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmer-dies-by-suicide-at-tikri-leaves-note-behind-101611179913074.html

21-01-2021||Delhi||Whose road it is, asks Delhi HC after demolition drive leaves people displaced||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has directed the city government’s Public Works Department (PWD) and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) to name the land owning agency of the East Laxmi Nagar Market area where a demolition drive was conducted in July last year to remove encroachment on the service road alongside the nullah road, also known as the Master Plan Road.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, on January 19, 2021, asked the civic body and the PWD to indicate the owner of the land as per records after both them said that the land does not belong to them.The court was hearing a plea by 121 families who had contended that authorities carried out the demolition from July 6 to July 8, 2020 with absolute disregard to the plight of even around 400 residents who were home quarantined on account of Covid-19. They had alleged that they were treated in an inhumane manner and all their means of existence were destroyed.The east civic body had demolished 56 houses constructed on a service road of the Master Plan Road following a court order on clearing encroachments. On July 17, 2020 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had visited the spot and ordered that the people affected by the drive be immediately shifted to temporary shelters. He had also directed officials to begin an in-depth study of the high court order and whether a court order for demolition can be issued in the times of a pandemic.The residents were rehabilitated temporarily in a Delhi government school. However, according to their counsel, a notice was given in September, 2020 asking them to leave the shelter home in the school as it was in the process of being renovated to resume physical classes, whenever it would be scheduled. While most of them left in September itself, others have vacated the place recently.On Tuesday, senior advocate Salman Khurshid, for the petitioners, told the court that were till now being housed in schools but since the schools now are being reopened, they have been removed.He contended that the authority which claims to be the owner of the land should consider rehabilitating the petitioners and other displaced persons according to their policies.Advocate J Priyadarshini, also counsel for the petitioners, said that her clients are staying in difficult conditions at these alternative accommodations after they were asked to vacate the school.While the counsel for the EDMC said that the land was owned by the PWD, the latter’s counsel denied the claim.The court asked the authorities to file affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing on February 18.Earlier, on July 24, 2020, the high court had said that onus of providing accommodation to displaced families was on the Delhi government, as over the years, officials of the public works department (PWD) or the road owing agency had either not been vigilant or had ignored the extensive encroachments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whose-road-it-is-asks-delhi-hc-after-demolition-drive-leaves-people-displaced-101611178329299.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants three weeks transit pre-arrest bail to Tandav makers||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday granted a three-week transit pre-arrest bail to Tandav director Ali Abbas Zafar and producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra and writer Gaurav Solanki. Similar relief was also granted to Aparna Purohit, head of content, Amazon Prime. The four have been booked in a first information report (FIR) filed by the Lucknow Police based on a complaint by senior sub-inspector Amar Nath Yadav who alleged that the web series portrays Hindu gods in a bad light. A single-judge bench of justice Prakash D Naik was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda and advocate Aniket Nikam that the FIR does not make any direct/indirect allegations against the applicants in their individual capacity. “The FIR also does not portray any role/intent whatsoever to the applicant for having committed any offence, under which the FIR is registered,” submitted the counsels. The makers of Tandav have been booked under sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 505 (1) (B) (public mischief with intent to cause fear or alarm) and 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Information Technology Act. The application by the makers of the web series state, “The applicants have come to learn that the said FIR was registered on January 17, 2021 at 11.46pm and that the police authorities of the concerned police station are currently travelling to Mumbai to arrest the applicants in pursuance of the same.” The bench was informed that the content in question has been removed and the makers do not want to give rise to any further controversy. Purohit’s plea, which is filed separately, states, “The web series and the characters thereof in no manner depict/portray or represent any gods and/or goddesses of any religion whatsoever.” Additional public prosecutor Yogesh Nakhwa opposed the applications stating that the accused should approach Hazratganj court in Lucknow and seek similar relief instead of approaching the Bombay HC. After hearing the submissions, the bench granted transitory anticipatory bail of three weeks to the four to enable them to approach the court in Lucknow for regular pre-arrest bail and disposed of the applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-three-weeks-transit-pre-arrest-bail-to-tandav-makers-101611175580645.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Strong winds clear the air, western disturbance all set to bring back the chill||Just a day after Delhi reported “severe” air quality, for the sixth time since New Year, strong winds came to the rescue and dispersed the accumulated pollutants, thereby allowing the air quality index to touch the considerably better ”poor“category.India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted that winds will continue to blow at high speeds on Thursday as well, allowing for a further improvement in air quality. Also, a fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region from January 22, causing widespread rain and snow in those parts between January 22 and 24,and a resultant chill in Delhi and other cities in the plains, the IMD has said.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that on Wednesday, the overall air quality index of Delhi was 283, in the ”poor” zone. This was a major improvement from Tuesday, when the AQI was 404, in the ”severe” zone.The IMD scientists said winds in Delhi have been strong since Tuesday afternoon and will get more intense on Thursday. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said the difference in maximum and minimum temperatures often lead to an increase in wind speeds over a region.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 18.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum was 7.8 degrees Celsius.“The wind speeds are expected to be higher on Thursday and the air quality will improve further, but remain in the “poor” zone. On Friday, there air quality may deteriorate again, but it will be a temporary dip as there is a forecast of wind speeds going up again from January 23,” Soni said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed on Wednesday ranged between 15 and 16kmph and was blowing from the north-west. He said because of the strong winds, the “feels like” temperature, which is the temperature that a human body perceives, was also lower than the actual recording.“In the morning hours, we had shallow to moderate fog. In the coming days, the temperature will be around 7-8 degrees Celsius, but there will be a fall from January 24. The minimum temperature is likely to fall to around 4 degree Celsius and the maximum temperature is also expected to fall by two to three degrees,” Srivastava said.He said the fall will be the result of a western disturbance over the western Himalayas, which will lead to rainfall and snowfall in parts of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh on January 22 and January 23.“After this western disturbance passes, the wind direction will change and the temperatures in Delhi and neighbouring areas will fall,” Srivastava said.Minimum temperatures are likely to fall by 2-4 degrees over most parts of north-west India, over the next three days, leading to cold wave conditions.“Cold day” or ”severe cold day” conditions are likely over west Rajasthan during next 24 hours and over Bihar during next three days, IMD said in its Tuesday bulletin.According to IMD, a cold day or a severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and a maximum temperature of 4.5 degree Celsius or 6.4 degrees Celsius below normal, respectively.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/strong-winds-clear-the-air-western-disturbance-all-set-to-bring-back-the-chill-101611174032362.html

The minister has also demanded regulatory mechanism by the Central government for over-the-top (OTT) platform contents to avoid any communal tension in the country.“These types of content create communal tension and lead to division between communities. The Central government should take appropriate steps to avoid such tensions,” he said.Deshmukh said that a first information report (FIR) would be filed in the case and a formal investigation would be initiated. He further said that the Uttar Pradesh Police had sought permission from them to conduct investigation in Mumbai in three cases lodged against Tandav. “They had sought our permission for the investigation and it is a routine process to visit other states in relation to investigation. Even teams of the Maharashtra Police keep visiting other states for investigation,” he said.Several FIRs have been filed against the web series for allegedly inappropriate depiction of Hindu deities. Many organisations have demanded ban on the series.BoxState home minister Anil Deshmukh has announced to consider withdrawal of cases lodged under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code against people for venturing out during lockdown.

21-01-2021||Mumbai||After NMIMS row, colleges in Mumbai bring changes to online exam process||After four proctors who allegedly harassed female students were fired by the online exam-conducting firm of a city-based management institute, several colleges have decided to include in-house teachers for online exams along with other proctors. In some cases, proctoring will only be done by college teachers along with software proctoring, said college principals. Last week, students of Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS) took to Twitter to share screenshots of messages sent by four proctors to some female students. The proctors were working with Mercer Mettl, a company that conducts online examinations, which had been hired by NMIMS. The four were fired by Mercer Mettl after it received the reports of harassment. NMIMS has formed a fact-finding committee to investigate the students’ allegations and updates on the investigation are awaited. “Our college exams have been conducted very smoothly with the help of our technology partner without any complaints from students or teachers. But after the recent incident at the management institute, our teachers came together to brainstorm on how to avoid recurrence of such an instance in the future, and decided to include teachers for proctoring all exams along with external proctors,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra. She said that this change will apply for all online exams henceforth. The principal of a college in south Mumbai on condition of anonymity said that it was exploring the option of not hiring external exam vendors like Mercer Mettl. “Since our teachers are already getting used to conducting classes as well as exams online, we are working towards making the upcoming exam an in-house exam and not extend the contract of the exam vendor,” said the principal, adding that the NMIMS incident had also left students worried. “There’s still no clarity on whether the next semester exams in May will be held online, but in case it continues online, we plan to conduct the exams on our own,” the principal said. This academic year, owing to Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, all university exams were held online. University of Mumbai (MU) chose to decentralise the examination system by giving individual colleges the power to conduct exams. Clusters of eight to ten colleges were formed with one cluster head authorised to oversee the process. Many MU-affiliated colleges chose to hold exams on their own through using software like Google Forms or MS Teams while some hired technology firms to conduct exams for them. “Instead of expecting colleges to find and hire their own service providers, the university should have streamlined this process and saved many institutes from such trouble. Instead, by decentralising the online examination, they managed to wash their hands off the process altogether,” said Sudhakar Tamboli, a member of the Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena (MNVS) and the MU senate. Last October, MU’s distance education wing, Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), had to postpone third-year exams for Bachelors of commerce (BCom) and arts (BA) after more than 90% of its registered students were unable to access the exam link. MU initially said there were “technical glitches” and later cancelled its contract with LittleMORE Innovation Labs, which was responsible for conducting the exams. Tenders were then invited for a new service provider to hold the exams at a later date. IDOL exams were eventually held in the last week of October 2020, after a Pune-based tech firm was hired by MU to conduct the exams. “Till date, there’s no clarity on the action that the university took against LittleMORE Innovation labs. That decision left at least 9,000 IDOL students under a lot of anxiety for two days before the exams were postponed. There is need for stricter policies by the varsity to avoid technology firms getting away with creating trouble for students,” said Tamboli. At Bandra’s RD National College, there was “man-to-man mapping” for all exams by the management despite the service provider ensuring proctoring through technology. “We ensured that one teacher proctors every 20-25 students for exams and along with that, our service provider helped us [conduct] mock tests and demo exams before the final papers began for the previous semester, boosting students’ confidence. We have also made it very clear that students are to share no personal data online,” said Neha Jagtiani, the in-charge principal of the college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-nmims-row-colleges-in-mumbai-bring-changes-to-online-exam-process-101611175041098.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai man falls prey to online sextortion||In yet another case of sextortion, a 40-year-old man from Byculla was blackmailed by a woman on a popular social media site. Agripada police has started probe in the case.The police said the complainant works in a private company. In his complaint to police, he said that recently he received a friends request from a woman on a social media site. The man accepted the request and started chatting with her. A few days later, they shared their contact numbers.In the first week of January, the complainant received a video call from the woman. Upon answering the call, he found the woman was naked but hid her face. “The woman induced him into taking off his clothes. After the video call ended, the man received a regular voice call,” said an officer.“The caller told the man that they have recorded him speaking to a naked woman through video call and threatened to upload the video on various media sites, if he failed to pay them. When the man refused to meet the demand, the caller abused him and threatened to defame him,” said a police officer.The complainant first transferred ₹1,500 to the accused. However, when the accused demanded more money, the complainant approached Agripada police.The police registered a complaint against the unknown woman and have written to the service provider to get details of the accused.Recently, similar cases have been reported to Marine Drive and Agripada police stations. In one such case, the fraudsters extorted a GST superintendent while in the other case, the owner of a popular tea brand was the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-falls-prey-to-online-sextortion-101611174740552.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 120 institutes identified to form network to measures cities’ performance under NCAP||Around 120 scientific institutes have been identified across the country to form a National Knowledge Network (NKN) that will measure the performance of cities in achieving the goals under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Institutes such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Science (IIScs) and labs of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have been identified as Institutes of Repute (IoRs) to aid and measure NCAP.NCAP is a programme initiated by the Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) to reduce ambient air pollution levels. The programme identified 122 non-attainment cities with high pollution levels and directed them to submit an action plan to reduce their pollution levels by at least 20% by 2024. The national target is to reduce particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and 10 by 20%-30% at both rural and urban levels by 2024. The objectives of NCAP are stringent implementation of mitigation measures for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution to augment air quality monitoring network across the country and to increase public awareness.“The NKN will act as an advisory expert group to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). It will also have three independent experts along with nominated officers from CPCB and MoEF,” said Sachchida Nand Tripathi, national coordinator of NKN and professor and head of department of civil engineering, IIT-Kanpur. IIT-Bombay, Delhi, Madras, Guwahati, Roorkee and Kanpur have been identified as nodal coordinating institutes.Tripathi said IoRs will partner with state pollution control boards and urban local bodies to provide knowledge-based support for implementation of NCAP goals. “These institutes may undertake air quality monitoring work, data analysis, data utilisation, compilation and prepare reports. They will also check compliance verification for emission norms to provide input to policymakers,” he said during a webinar on ‘Pathway for India to achieve air pollution goals’ on Wednesday. “The budget is an opportunity for India to show commitment towards its fight against pollution. We would demand focus on the following four areas — a) the finance commission grant for air quality improvement receives further support and the performance framework for receiving these grants is finalised at the earliest, b) budgets allocated under NCAP are sustained and increased substantially, c) that the budget provides clarity on how Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Standards (CAAQMS) will get funded by the Centre, and lastly d) further investments in clean household fuels and schemes like Ujjwala,” said Dr Santosh Harish, fellow at Centre for Policy Research. BOX:CAAQMSWith an aim to build transparency and accountability of efforts taken under NCAP, CarbonCopy and Respirer Living Sciences released a new dashboard at the webinar which presents a comprehensive one-stop platform to access CAAQMS being provided as part of CPCB’s nationwide real-time monitoring network. The dashboard is designed to list the data and also allow viewers to draw comparisons between seasons, monthly and annual averages, and even examine hyper-local monitoring by zooming into specific cities and neighbourhoods to identify polluted pockets. The dashboard has allowed transparency for not just PM2.5 and 10 data but also for harmful gases like Nitrogen Dioxide (NOx), Ozone (O3) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-120-institutes-identified-to-form-network-to-measures-cities-performance-under-ncap-101611174620539.html

The agency said search operations were going on till late in the evening and it had seized drugs worth crores from the drug supplier.NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede confirmed the development and said that they nabbed Pathan and that the search operation was on. Pathan is an alleged member of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s gang and also a relative of late Abdul Karim Sher Khan, known as Karim Lala, a mafia don who was once active in Mumbai.This is not the first case against Pathan. He was earlier arrested by Pydhonie police in a drugs case in August 2019 after he allegedly supplied mephedrone (MD) to Junaid Shaikh, a peddler.Wednesday’s raid was conducted by NCB following a tip-off. Pathan is the main supplier of MD in south Mumbai. “We have got link of several drug suppliers and peddlers who are active in south Mumbai and legal action against them are going on,” said an NCB officer.Earlier, two drug peddlers including a fire safety officer Sandeep Chavan of public sector unit (PSU) were arrested and the agency allegedly seized 65 grams of MD from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-ncb-apprehends-notorious-drug-supplier-seizes-drugs-worth-crores-101611174440542.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt gets farmers’ consent to set up solar power plant in 9 villages||New Delhi: The Delhi government has got consent from farmers across nine villages in the north-western peripheries of the city for setting up solar plants in 225 acres of agricultural land under a long-awaited scheme that aims to enhance the Capital’s power production and contribute to income of farmers.“We have got consent for 225 acres of agriculture land where solar plants can be set up. The lands are located at villages in areas such as Alipur, Lampur and Narela. The project has been given a go ahead and tenders will be issued soon. We aim to launch the project this year,” said a senior government official.In July 2018, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi had announced the Mukhyamantri Kisan Aay Badhotri Yojana – a scheme to increase income of farmers by setting up solar plants in their agriculture land, which would also enhance power production in the Capital.Under the scheme, farmers would be able to continue with agriculture even after the power plants are set up as the solar panels to be installed would be installed at a minimum height of 3.5 metres from the ground, allowing for farming activities, tractors to ply on the fields and other agriculture-related machinery to be used.The farmers would be paid ₹1 lakh per acre a year, and the rent would increase by 6% compounded annually. Once allowed, the plant would exist for 25 years. The farmers would also get 1,000 units of energy produced by the plant each year for every acre they rent out for the project, the official said.However, the scheme is yet to formally kick off.According to the government’s statistical handbook of Delhi, the total area under agriculture in the national capital is 34,750 hectares, which roughly translates to 85,870 acres. “But most of the land is scattered and that turned out to be a big problem for implementing the project,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.According to government estimates, a full six acres will be needed for setting a 1 MW [or, 1000 kW] solar plant, which would be capable of generating over 1.2 million units of electricity annually, under the scheme.On engaging with farmers for more than a year after the scheme was announced, the government also realised that there were concerns. “The most common one being whether the land would lose fertility, or if yield would reduce after the solar panels are installed. This, they assumed, would deprive the land of direct sunlight,” the government official said.In January 2020, the government set up a demo of the project at the campus of an agriculture institute in Kirari, located in the western peripheries of Delhi. Even though the government had got consent for 150 acres of land by then, the project faced delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-gets-farmers-consent-to-set-up-solar-power-plant-in-9-villages-101611173588188.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||INA to become a major hub with RRTS, Metro stations||The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) will integrate its INA station on the Delhi-Alwar Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor with the Delhi Metro station at the same spot to provide seamless connectivity between two mass transit systems.Last year, the NCRTC had changed location of its station on the RRTS corridor from Jangpura to INA to provide seamless connectivity with two of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) corridors -- Yellow line (Huda City Centre to Samayapur Badli) and Pink line (Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar).An NCRTC spokesperson said, “Station locations have been finalized in such a way that they are seamlessly integrated with other modes of public transport for commuters’ convenience. INA-RRTS station will be integrated with the Delhi Metro’s INA station through subways, thereby providing safe and seamless connectivity (between two rail corridors) to commuters.”With this, INA will become an important transit facility in South Delhi. The station will provide direct high-speed connectivity to residents of NCR suburbs such as Ghaziabad, Modinagar, Meerut, Gurugram, Manesar and Panipat to two major hospitals (AIIMS and Safdarjung), markets and new developments planned in the area such as the commercial complex proposed at Nauroji Nagar.While the Delhi Metro station is located on Aurobindo Marg, INA-RRTS station will be located near DDA’s headquarters on Barapullah road. NCRTC officials said the station will have two entry/exits near DDA headquarters, Vikas Sadan, and Aurobindo Marg.“RRTS stations have been planned and designed to ensure multi-modal integration with other modes of public transport in a way that it will eliminate the need for commuters to step out on roads for switching from one public transport to another. We are closely working with DMRC for an integration of the INA and other stations,” the spokesperson said.DMRC’s INA station on the Yellow Line was opened in 2010 and subsequently was converted into an interchange with the Pink line in 2018. The station caters to a number of important landmarks in the area such as the INA Market and Dilli Haat. At INA, the RRTS corridor, the NCRTC official said, will pass below the two existing DMRC corridors.Anuj Dayal, executive director corporate communication, DMRC said, “NCRTC is going to integrate its upcoming station at INA with the Delhi Metro network’s interchange station there through a subway. This will further boost the connectivity in the area and offer more travelling options to the passengers. The integration of the MRTS and RRTS networks in the NCR will be a major milestone in terms of enhancement of the ease of connectivity in the region.”The 198-km-long Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor is one of the three priority corridors—Delhi-Meerut and Delhi-Panipat being the other two-- approved by the Centre. The work on the Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor will be carried out in three stages. In the first stage, 107-km-long corridor between Delhi -Gurugram- Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror (SNB) Urban Complex will be developed.Of the 107kms, 22kms will be in Delhi and it will be completely underground starting from Sarai Kale Khan to Aerocity. “The corridor has got the approval from the state governments and is under active consideration of the central government for approval,” said an NCRTC official.Apart from INA, NCRTC is actively working with DMRC to integrate stations at Sarai Kale Khan, Munirka and Aerocity in Delhi.NCRTC officials said, “Pre-construction activities including geo-technical investigations, initial pile load tests, topographical surveys, shifting of electrical utilities, etc. are being carried out at various locations in Gurugram for this corridor. With a view to save time in executing the Delhi-Gurugram-SNB RRTS corridor, we are focusing on completing most of the pre-construction activities for the corridor so that the civil construction of the corridor can start immediately post the project sanction.”Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “The move to integrate RRTS and Metro corridors will provide better connectivity and bring down the use of private vehicles. Efforts should be made to provide for pedestrian movement outside the stations and develop INA as a transit hub.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ina-to-become-a-major-hub-with-rrts-metro-stations-101611173143642.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||South corp to award ₹10 Lakh to RWAs segregating 100% waste at source||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to incentivise those Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) that conduct 100% segregation of waste at source in their colonies.The civic body on Tuesday moved a proposal to carry out development works up to ₹10 lakh in the colony or society where 100% waste segregation is done at source.The proposal was moved during the south corporation’s budget presentation on Tuesday, wherein it suggested that a fund of ₹5 crore be marked for this purpose.Municipal officials said as per Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, waste segregation should be done at the source both in commercial and residential areas. Wet waste or kitchen waste should be deposited in green bins and dry waste, such as plastic bottles, milk pouches, in blue bins. Hazardous waste —such as needles, sanitary napkins, among others — are to go in red bins.Rajdutt Gahlot, chairman SDMC standing committee, said that the aim of the proposal is to ensure maximum compliance of the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 so that no waste is dumped on landfill sites.“In the budget for 2021-22, we have proposed to incentivise RWAs that have 100% compliance of waste separation at source. We will not directly give the RWAs the amount directly, but we will carry out development works of ₹10 lakh in the locality or society on the recommendations of the local RWA, if they achieve the target of 100% segregation of waste. We have earmarked an amount of ₹5 crore for this purpose,” he said.Officials from the department of environment management services of SDMC said that the process of waste segregation in residential areas under SDMC’s jurisdiction has begun more than a year ago, but in June last year, the civic body made the process compulsory for RWAs to provide segregated waste to garbage collectors.“To ensure compliance, we have taken a number of measures which include educating public about the importance of waste segregation and also provided them manure in exchange of kitchen waste. Other than this, we had issued notices to RWAs regarding waste segregation and also imposed fines against repeat offenders. Now we have come up with the idea of incentivising RWAs to ensure 100% separation of waste in colonies,” the official said.The civic body had performed poorly in the Swachh Survekshan 2020, ranking 31 out of 47 cities. After this, the corporation had started taking strict steps for compliance and issued notices to RWAs in this connection. Till November end, SDMC had issued more than 1,400 notices to RWAs and had fined 122 residents for not segregating dry, wet and hazardous household waste at source.Sanjay Rana, president RWA Greater Kailash-2 welcomed the initiative and said that it would encourage them to ensure 100% waste segregation.“Incentivising the RWAs is a good concept. At present nearly 50% households in our locality are providing separated waste to garbage collectors. This move will further encourage RWAs to achieve the target and help us get development works — such as beautification of colony, park and road improvement — done,” Rana said.Atul Goyal, president United Residents Joint Action (URJA), said that the move is good but can succeed only if the civic body shows a holistic approach and improves its waste disposal system.“With such an initiative, more RWAs are likely to come forward and start segregation. But the main cause of concern is that it should not get mixed in the tippers by waste collectors as is often seen. So the SDMC will have to show a holistic approach, build trust among residents and ensure that such gaps are filled,” Goyal said.Swati Sambhyal, a Delhi based waste management expert, said, “It is a commendable move. With this, more RWAs will be encouraged to comply with waste management rules and also motivate those which are already doing waste segregation on their own.”She, however, said that municipalities should also ensure that waste segregation exercise is not seen as an optional practice instead they should make efforts to make it a compulsory exercise. She said that barring a few localities, the percentage of waste segregation in residential areas is very low. She said that this initiative will also bring a healthy competition among resident bodies to rank best in terms of waste segregation and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/south-corp-to-award-rs-10-lakh-to-rwas-segregating-100-waste-at-source-101611171762719.html
21-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad court awards death to man for rape and murder of 2-yr-old girl||A Ghaziabad fast-track court on Wednesday awarded death to a 30-year-old man for raping and murdering the two-and-half-year-old daughter of his colleague, on the night on October 19, 2020.The court had fast-tracked the case and held the man guilty on January 18, after a trial that had lasted 29 days. While pronouncing the quantum of punishment on Wednesday, Mahendra Srivastava, special judge (Pocso Act), termed the case “rarest of rare” and went on to award the maximum punishment to the convict.According to the prosecution, the crime took place on the night of October 19, 2020, when the convict , who is a colleague of the girl’s father, went to their house and took away the child from her mother on pretext of taking her to a nearby shop.When he did not return till late night, the family went in search of him and also approached the police. The mutilated body of the girl was found the next afternoon, near a drain in an industrial area. The man was nabbed thereafter.The police filed the charge sheet in the case on December 16, 2020, and charges were framed on December 24, 2020, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and also under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302, 201, 376(a), 376(ab).The prosecution said the autopsy report confirmed that child had suffered eight external injuries, including a broken hyoid bone ( U-shaped bone in the front of the neck) pointing to death due to asphyxia from strangling.The court also relied upon the “last seen” theory besides the forensic test reports, which confirmed that the DNA of the man was found on body of the girl.Apart from the death penalty, the man was also awarded life imprisonment for murder (IPC Section 302) and seven years’ imprisonment for destruction of evidence (IPC Section 201).“The man brutally raped the minor girl and murdered her, before hiding her body near a drain at the scene of crime. The prosecution produced 10 witnesses while no one, including the family of the convict, turned up in his defence. We produced witnesses, including the girl’s mother who confirmed that the man took away her daughter despite her trying to stop him. One witness also saw the man carrying the girl on his shoulders near the scene of crime,” said Utkarsh Vats, special public prosecutor (Pocso).The Ghaziabad police also procured CCTV footage from a mobile shop, which confirmed that Pandey between 8.50pm and 8.55pm was seen taking the girl with him.Girl’s father and the man were friends for about 10-12 years and they worked at the same factory. At times, the man would stay with the family and the girl used to call him “Chacha (uncle)”, the police said.“The court relied on several rulings and observed that the act also impacts society at large; besides there is little chance for the convict’s reformation. There was also a high level of brutality perpetrated on the child. Considering all these factors, the court awarded him death penalty,” Vats said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-court-awards-death-to-man-for-rape-and-murder-of-2-yr-old-girl-101611171243340.html

The amount disbursed to them is over and above a similar relief granted to 39,600 construction workers in the city, the government said in a statement.The statement further said that at least 2,000 more construction workers will receive 10,00 each in the coming weeks.“When the lockdown was imposed due to the pandemic, the Delhi government was one of the first states to carry out relief disbursement to all 39,600 workers who were registered with the board. In compliance with orders of the Delhi high court, the board decided to disburse the relief amount to those construction workers who were registered with the board as on September 30, 2018,” Sisodia said, before appealing to more construction workers to renew their membership.More than 53,000 construction workers are currently registered with the board but document verification of a large numbers of them is still underway, said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-disburses-covid-grant-of-rs-10k-each-to-407-more-construction-workers-101611170822618.html

21-01-2021||Mumbai||No offence in merely attending dance bar: Bombay HC strikes down FIR against two Mumbai residents||Bombay high court last week struck down the prosecution of two dance bar customers, observing that no offence was committed by them by merely visiting the bar where purportedly obscene dance moves were being performed by some girls.The petitioners, a Vile Parle resident Rushabh Mehta,28, and Adit Purohit, 29, from Andheri (West) - were apprehended by Santacruz police on January 21, 2017, when they found sitting as customers at a bar. Both of them were rounded up by police along with bar staff and other customers.All of them were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurants and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (working therein) Act, 2016.Both the petitioners moved HC through advocate Sandeep Sherkhane, for quashing of the criminal proceeding against them, contending that no overt acts were attributed to them and even if the material collected by police was taken as it is, no offence was made out against them, therefore the proceeding was liable to be struck down.HC accepted the argument. The division bench of justice Sambhaji Shinde and justice Manish Pitale noted that section 294 (performing an obscene act in public) and 114 (abetment) of the IPC, slapped against them, comes into play only when someone indulges in any obscene act at a public place.As regards the sections of the 2016 Act, the bench said there was no material to indicate ingredients of the sections, except mere mentioning of the names of the petitioners in the first information report (FIR) and the charge-sheet, which the court said was not sufficient to prosecute the petitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-offence-in-merely-attending-dance-bar-bombay-hc-strikes-down-fir-against-two-mumbai-residents-101611170481667.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra cabinet allows govt bodies to use private banks, but for limited use||Nearly a year after the Maharashtra government passed a resolution directing all government bodies, authorities and corporations to conduct banking transactions through public sector banks, the state cabinet on Wednesday gave its nod allowing government offices, public sector undertakings (PSUs), and state-run corporations to use private banks for banking services. However, the government has restricted the use of private banks limiting it to the debit of salaries and other allowances of employees. In March 2020, the finance department had issued a government resolution directed all government bodies to close all banking accounts with private and cooperative banks and open accounts in public sector banks from April 1, 2020. Since April, only public sector banks and later from July 2020, district cooperative banks were used to deposit salaries, other allowances and to maintain funds of a government body.A senior government official said the earlier resolution was taken in the wake of the crisis faced by one of the prominent private banks — Yes Bank — which had been put under moratorium. “Now the cabinet has limited the use of private banks allowing only salary accounts. This reduces the risk, which was the reason why a directive was issued to close all banking operations with private banks. No funds other than depositing salary will be allowed,” the official said. He added that the contractor’s bank guarantee or reserve fund of any government body will still remain in PSBs.A statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) on the cabinet decision said those bodies which opt for private banking service can avail online services through the bank. However, they must ensure that the bank does not charge any additional fees for these services. The cabinet also allowed pensioners to open pension accounts in private banks which have entered into an agreement with the state government before February 28, 2021, the statement said.A political controversy over bank accounts of several municipal corporations and even state police in a private bank had erupted shortly after Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi came to power in 2019. Sena leaders had, in December 2019, raised questions over bank accounts of some Sena-run civic bodies in the private bank where former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ wife Amruta was a senior executive. Thane civic body shifted its account of the private bank. The state government, through a government resolution in March 2020, announced the closure of one of its accounts — National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Projects — in the private bank and shifted it to the state-run SBI.In addition, the cabinet also gave a nod to a proposal providing guarantee for ₹1,500-crore loan required by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Cotton Growers Marketing Federation.The government guarantee will be for the ₹1,500-crore loan which the federation will borrow from Bank of Maharashtra at 6.35% per annum interest rate for ensuring timely payments to farmers on purchase of cotton for 2020-21 season. Due to satisfactory rainfall and favourable weather conditions, around 400 lakh quintals of cotton is expected to be produced this season in the state, said an official.The official added that with the dipping price of cotton internationally and the hike in the guaranteed prices by the Union government, the federation will have to procure large quantities of cotton at the guaranteed price this season as compared to the last season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-allows-govt-bodies-to-use-private-banks-but-for-limited-use-101611170480175.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: ₹63k crore arrears, MSEDCL warns of cutting power supply||With ₹63,740 crore arrears pending till the end of December 2020, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has directed all regional offices to recover the dues immediately or cut-off power supply. It has also asked its offices to conduct campaigns to recover the dues.MSEDCL supplies power to the entire state and some parts of the eastern suburbs in Mumbai. It has over two crore consumers in the state. Assem Kumar Gupta, managing director and chairman, MSEDCL said that the pandemic has added to the ever-increasing financial woes of the state discom.“In March 2020, the arrears were around ₹40,000 crore. In the last nine months, MSEDCL has faced an additional burden of more than ₹1,200 crore per month. We have now given two directives to the regional offices - one is to take the top to bottom approach in recovering dues and the second is to give immediately resolve all pending complaints. We know that cutting off supply is not a win-win situation for anyone,” Gupta said.Following job loss and assurances by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over providing relief over-inflated bills, more than 60 lakh consumers in the state had not paid a single rupee towards their bills between April and November 2020, adding to the financial woes of the discom.In August 2020, the state had said that it is planning to waive excess bill by bearing the surplus amount for the months of April, May and June. State energy minister Nitin Raut in October had also said that consumers will get good news during Diwali. However, in November, in a complete turnaround, Raut announced that the state will not be able to provide any relief to consumers owing to its poor financial status and lack of aid from the Central government.The announcement came as a shock to thousands of consumers, who had reported inflated bills during the lockdown period. Reacting to the warning issued by the state, a consumer, who did not wish to be named, said, “The state moved from its stance to waiving off excess bills to saying that we will now cut-off power supply. This is acceptable for repeated offenders, not for people who have received wrong bills.” Pratap Hogade, a power activist, “The state energy minister had assured citizens that they will provide relief and not disconnect power. How can they threaten consumers now? We (various associations) are now demanding that the state should provide 50% waiver for the six-month lockdown period. We will not let the state disconnect power supply till they meet our demands.” Meanwhile, Swabhiman Shetkari Sanghatana chief Raju Shetti along with power consumer forums met state energy minister Nitin Raut on Wednesday after MSEDCL stated that the discom will cut power supply in case of pending bills. Shetti said that the state cannot cut power supply after assuring consumers of relief. “We have demanded complete waiver of three months for residential consumers. The government has to accept this.” Raut later told mediapersons that the state will take an appropriate decision on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai63k-crore-arrears-msedcl-warns-of-cutting-power-supply-101611170420227.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Maratha reservation case to be heard by the Supreme Court on February 5||The constitutional bench of the Supreme Court (SC) has postponed the hearing on the Maratha reservation case till February. It has now decided to hear the batch of petitions challenging and supporting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act (SEBC) on February 5. It is also likely to hear the state government’s plea against an interim order passed by a three-judge bench in September last year, staying all recruitment to government jobs and admissions to educational institutions under the quota.Earlier, the Apex court has decided to start virtual hearing of the case from January 25.State public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said that the state had requested the SC to conduct physical hearings, as it is a crucial matter with a wide scope. The apex court said it would take a decision on February 5.During the hearing senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing on behalf of the state government, pointed out that as many lawyers are working from different places, and there is a large set of documents involved, it would be difficult to argue the case over virtual hearing. Other senior lawyers such as Kapil Sibal also expressed similar concerns.“We wanted to make the hearing physical as the Apex court had decided to start the virtual hearing from January 25. Considering its wide scope and involvement of many petitions and lawyers who want to argue on the matter, it would not be possible to complete in virtual hearings. The Bombay high court (HC) has started physical hearing in some cases and the Apex court should also consider the same. As the Apex court said they will discuss and decide on our request on February 5, we are expecting a decision on that day,” Chavan said.In the last hearing, the constitutional bench had refused to vacate the stay put by a three-judge bench on recruitment and admissions under the Maratha quota. BJP has criticised the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on the matter, saying they are incompetent. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “The stand taken by the state government has complicated the case. Every time it comes up with a different stand in court. Only the state government is responsible for what all is happening in the court over Maratha reservation. It has handled the case very badly. There is a lack of coordination and indifference. One doesn’t know the decision taken by another. The action of the state is likely to create a question mark against reservation to all communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-reservation-case-to-be-heard-by-the-supreme-court-on-february-5-101611170240156.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Weeks after restarting, junior college await clarity on FYJC exams||More than two weeks after first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in the state began their new academic year, the education department is yet to give clarity on the academic calendar and conduct of exams. Colleges said the department is yet to come up with guidelines on how to plan the academic year since the beginning of the new academic year was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the Supreme Court’s interim stay on Maratha quota. “We are awaiting guidelines about the conduct of exams. Even as FYJC exams are conducted at the college level, some amount of uniformity and clarity is needed,” said the principal of a suburban college. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal of VG Vaze College in Mulund, said the college has already finished about 10% of its syllabus. “Since we started online classes after completing the required number of admissions, we are not worried about completing the syllabus. However, we don’t know about the exams yet as there is no communication from the board or the department so far,” he added. As per the norms for admissions set by the education department, colleges can start their classes after 75% of their total seats are filled. Most colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) began their classes from the first week of January. With very little teaching hours left this year, colleges are now worried about conducting exams. “Time might not permit to conduct these many exams this year and the department can consider having only two exams — a unit test and a semester exam,” said Satram Verhani, vice-principal of CHM College in Ulhasnagar. Admissions for FYJC are still underway with over 1.22 lakh seats remaining vacant. The first-come first-served round, which is currently in process, will end on January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-weeks-after-restarting-junior-college-await-clarity-on-fyjc-exams-101611170000287.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||After rural mandate, civic polls in 5 cities to decide winning political party in Maharashtra||Less than two months after the three-party ruling coalition, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), completed one year in office, elections were held for more than 14,000 gram panchayats or village councils. The results showed that the MVA has won more seats than the opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but also that the latter still has a strong presence in the state. In the next few days, elections will be announced for five civic bodies, including three in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Aurangabad, the results of which will indicate the urban population’s response to the MVA and BJP. In the recently held gram panchayat elections, BJP and Shiv Sena apparently emerged to be the top two performers (the state election commission is yet to officially declare results). In the next few days, five municipal corporations and two district councils are going to polls and expected to be another political test for the political parties. If the panchayat results are any indication, the three ruling parties that fought the elections separately will have no option but to join hands in them.Although almost all the four major parties have claimed to have won the highest number of panchayats, the BJP and Sena appear to have bagged most of them. On the other hand, the three ruling parties —Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — have between them won about 60% panchayats, although they fought the elections separately. This reaffirms the fact that united they fight, like they fought in the legislative council elections in November, they bag more number of seats. The elections for five key municipal corporations and two district councils are expected to be announced in the next few weeks. Three of the corporations, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli and Vasai-Virar are from MMR, while two others are Aurangabad in central Maharashtra and Kolhapur in western Maharashtra. Sena and BJP are in power in KDMC and Navi Mumbai respectively, while Vasai-Virar is controlled by MLA Hitendra Thakur-led Bahujan Vikas Aghadi. Aurangabad is ruled by the Sena for years, while Congress has the reigns of Kolhapur city. Bhandara and Gondia district councils, held by Congress and NCP respectively, in Vidarbha, too, are expected to go to polls simultaneously.During the five years of its rule in Maharashtra until October 2019, the BJP emerged top party in almost all local bodies. Of the total 2,736 seats in 27 municipal corporations, BJP has 1,099, while out of 2,000 in 34 district councils, it had won 526 over the past five years. In 351 Panchayat Samitis’ 4,000 seats, the party has 1,123 members. The three ruling parties are way behind BJP in these local bodies if individual numbers are counted. The biggest challenge before the saffron party would be to retain its position at local levels.BJP’s vice-president Madhav Bhandari said although ruling parties enjoy an edge in the local body elections, his party would retain its top position. “The ruling parties have failed to take that advantage as the voters in rural parties have given us the mandate in panchayat elections. It is true that we lost our two traditional seats in council elections, but taking a lesson from them, we concentrated on village bodies, went for course correction and won most of them. Similarly, our endeavour would be to bag maximum urban and rural local bodies going to polls in near future. Even if the ruling parties fought them together, it would not make any difference,” he added.Ruling parties always enjoy an edge during the local body elections for various reasons. “First of all, government machinery is at your dispense and the BJP had used it ruthlessly in five years. Voters think that allocation of development funds for civic bodies is more if the ruling parties are elected to the local bodies. In recent council elections, the educational institutions in Pune and western Maharashtra responded to us very well when we convened meetings, seeking votes from teachers and constituencies. During the BJP rule, they would not even attend our meetings,” said a senior Congress leader.Minority development minister and NCP leader Nawab said, “The BJP has been lying about its performance in the panchayat elections, the MVA has bagged highest number of village panchayats. We will retain the trend even in the forthcoming local body elections, though we might not fight the polls together. It is part of our strategy because fighting together where BJP is weak will help the opposition,” he said.A Congress leader said the three parties have decided to contest the local bodies under the leadership of the strongest partner. “Like in Kolhapur, we will fight alone as we have strong base there, while in Navi Mumbai, the ruling alliance will fight under the leadership of Sena,” he said.The leader said that with BJP winning sizable seats in the local bodies, like in panchayats, will bring the ruling parties closer for the want of keeping the government floating.“Whether the BJP is number or two in rural polls is not important. What is important is that they still have significant support among rural voters. As such, we will have to stay together to counter them,” said a senior NCP minister. Prakash Pawar, political analyst from western Maharashtra, said it would be a challenge before the BJP to retain its power in local bodies. “Though BJP has been claiming that it won the highest number of panchayats, they are not in the proportion of the assembly segments they hold. It’s almost double than Sena and NCP in terms of MLAs in Assembly, but the number of panchayats it won are not double. The party is at loss after snapping ties with the Sena last year, but the latter has benefited from it. The three ruling parties can benefit if they fight together, but question is if they have the flexibility to do so without flexing muscles at each other,” he said.According to an officer from the state election commission, the elections to the civic bodies are expected to be announced in next few weeks only after electoral data is updated. “We get the electoral rolls from Election Commission of India. Once the updated rolls are received, they will be published at local level for suggestion and objections and the elections to the local bodies are announced,” he said.The officer said that the other administrative process, such as delimitation of wards, drawing of reservations have already been completed and they are all set to hold the elections as soon as the electoral rolls are revised.The elections to these corporations and ZPs were due last year, but were delayed due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-rural-mandate-civic-polls-in-5-cities-to-decide-winning-political-party-in-maharashtra-101611169400242.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to withdraw cases registered for lockdown violation||State home minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Wednesday evening that the state government has decided to withdraw the cases registered under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for violation of the Covid-19 lockdown.“We have decided to withdraw the cases registered for the lockdown violations. The cases will be withdrawn following the judicial process,” he said.According to an official from the home department, thousands of cases have been registered for the violations, such as resorting to the streets, not wearing a mask, maintaining social distance.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Pradeep Deshmukh met the home minister on Wednesday morning demanding the withdrawal of the cases as they have been leading to hardships to the people. “In Pune, police have taken action against 28,000 people for violation of the lockdown norms from April to July. They are being served notices now for lodging FIR. Police had registered their names during lockdown for the violations and the notices are being served now. Though the action was legal, many of them had stepped out of the house, out of compulsion. Such action can cause unnecessary distress,” Pradeep Deshmukh said. He said that lakhs of such cases were registered across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-to-withdraw-cases-registered-for-lockdown-violation-101611169280160.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government upset with MPSC chief Satish Gavai in Maratha reservation case, CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks explanation||The Maharashtra government is upset with the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) chairman Satish Gavai over an interlocutory application filed in the Supreme Court (SC) in the Maratha reservation case. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray is likely to seek an explanation from the MPSC chief and will then take action.It was decided in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, where most of the ministers sought action against Gavai. CM Thackeray too was upset with the MPSC’s decision.In its interlocutory application filed on December 9, 2020, MPSC had sought permission from the Apex court to restart the recruitment process in the state by setting aside the applications received under the provisions of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act (SEBC), more commonly known as the Maratha quota. It stated that MPSC had received thousands of applications for the recruitment process started last year, but could not pursue them following the outbreak of Covid-19.The SEBC Act was stayed by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court in September last year.Now, MPSC wants to restart the recruitment process which cannot be re-advertised without deleting the reservation and relaxations given under the Act, following the stay order. It has also sought a go-ahead from the SC.The application moved by MPSC has upset ministers who expressed their annoyance during the cabinet meeting. Most of the ministers demanded action against the MPSC chairman as the government was not informed of any such move, said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.“The community will see it as a double face of the MVA government. They will think that on one hand, we are pretending to save Maratha reservation in the Apex court, and on the other hand, we want to revise the recruitment process by setting aside the applications called under the SEBC Act. CM Thackeray too was very unhappy with the development and has assured us to call for an explanation from the MPSC chief,” the minister said.MPSC officials said that another application was also filed on January 15, saying that they don’t want to pursue the interlocutory application. “We have moved the fresh application after the state government decided to give two options to the applicants from the Maratha community by issuing an order on December 23. The government has allowed us to ask the applicants to choose either the general category or economically weaker section (EWS) to continue in the recruitment process,” said an official, wishing not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-upset-with-mpsc-chief-satish-gavai-in-maratha-reservation-case-cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-explanation-101611169101288.html

The minister sought finalisation of the draft CZMP for Mumbai at the earliest.Thackeray, in the letter, requested the minister to expedite the matter saying that the state has completed the public consultation for the draft CZMP district-wise. He added that the draft CZMP for Greater Mumbai was “deliberated” by the technical survey committee at Chennai in November 2020.“To expedite the process of finalisation of draft CZMPs of Greater Mumbai, the necessary instructions for the same be kindly issued to National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) at the earliest,” the minister said.The draft CZMP maps were prepared by the NCSCM under the Union environment ministry in 2019 for all coastal districts in Maharashtra based on the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. They were published on January 22, 2020.These maps use distinct colour codes to demarcate CRZ areas (I to IV), high tide and hazard line, fishing zones, intertidal areas, mangrove forests and buffer areas, turtle nesting sites, cyclone shelters, koliwadas and gaothans. These maps also identify coastal areas that can be opened up for infrastructural development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/expedite-czmp-for-mumbai-and-coastal-districts-in-maharashtra-aaditya-thackeray-writes-to-union-minister-101611169099936.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Schools in Mumbai shall not reopen until further orders, Maharashtra edu department clarifies||A letter issued by the office of the deputy director on Wednesday had led to a lot of confusion regarding the reopening of schools in the city. The letter asked the officials to follow the guidelines with respect to reopening of schools in the state for Classes 5 to 8 and prepare accordingly. However, another circular released in the evening clarified that the final decision of reopening would be taken as per the orders of the local authority.Recently, the state education department allowed schools in the state to reopen for lower classes from January 27. However, since the final decision on the reopening lies with the local bodies, schools in the city won’t reopen for now, as per the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s orders in the past. The inconsistency in the orders issued by the civic body and in the letter confused principals. “We were wondering as to why such a circular was issued when the guidelines mandate schools to remain shut in the city,” said Anil Bornare of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Teachers Cell. Sandeep Sangave, deputy director of education for the Mumbai region said that the letter issued on Tuesday in no way invoked the reopening of schools in the city. “The letter had an implied reference to the department’s order and the local administration’s call in this matter. However, it seems to have caused confusion. Hence, we clarified that the final decision of reopening will be as per the orders of the local authority,” he added. A circular stating out the clarification was also issued on late Wednesday evening. In other parts of the state, schools for Classes 9 to 12 have begun from November 23 while those for Classes 5 to 8 will begin from January 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/schools-in-mumbai-shall-not-reopen-until-further-orders-maharashtra-edu-department-clarifies-101611168861101.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||89 doses of Covaxin wasted in three days in Maharashtra||Amid the ongoing technical glitch in the centralised app Co-WIN, the turnout of the first indigenous vaccine—Covaxin has been badly affected in the state. As a result of this, in the first three days of the immunisation programme, 89 doses of Covaxin have been wasted in the state. The vaccine centres are now coming up with new plans to save the wastage.While each vial of Covishield has 5ml of the vaccine with each dose being 0.5 ml, which is equivalent to 10 doses, a Covaxin vial contains 20 doses. In the first three days (January 16, 19 and 20) of the vaccine, as many as 89 doses of Covaxin have been wasted which can only be preserved for four hours after being open.In the six Covaxin vaccination sites in Maharashtra, the government-run Grant Medical College in Mumbai which is also known as Sir JJ Hospital, 13 doses were wasted. While at the Government Medical College (GMC) Nagpur, 26 doses were wasted, the highest in the state. This is followed by GMC Aurangabad (16 doses), GMC Solapur (13 doses), and District Hospital (DH) Pune (14). The DH Amravati has wasted only 7 doses, the lowest in the state till January 19.As per the data collected from the six centres, on January 16, only 17 doses of Covaxin were wasted in the state. But on the second day of vaccination, the amount of wastage increased by 129% when the centres failed to use 39 doses due to low turnout of shortlisted beneficiaries. On the third day, 33 doses were wasted.On January 16, out of the 600 shortlisted candidates for Covaxin, 383 of them got vaccinated in the six centres of the state. However, on Tuesday, due to the technical glitch, the Co-WIN app generated over 250 names of the healthcare workers (HCWs) who were to take the Covaxin jab on Day 1 of vaccination in the state. Due to this confusion, the overall turnout of the HCWs for Covaxin fell to 181 in the state on the second day of the vaccination. However, on the third day, the number increased to 327 in the state due to the walk-in vaccination. Out of this, Amravati recorded 115 vaccination, the highest in the state. Each day, the centres have a target to vaccinate 100 people for which they need five vials of Covaxin. Thus, if vaccination centres get fewer HCWs, the remaining opened dosages will go to waste. For instance, on January 19, GMC Nagpur vaccinated 29 HCWs. This led to the waste of 11 doses in the second vial.“On the first day of the vaccination, as we had recorded 100% turnout, we didn’t lose any unit. However, the next day when only 38 HCWs came forward, we lost two doses from the second vial,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, DHO, Amravati.Now, to address the issue of the low turnout of the beneficiaries, the health department has instructed the six centres to call more than the target number of beneficiaries. Also, Co-WIN application has added another option, ‘add beneficiaries’ under which HCWs who are registered on the app can get vaccinated even if they don’t have an appointment for the day.“We have a target to vaccinate 100 HCWs every day. But from today, we are going to call around 150 people for the appointment to increase the turnout. Also, any interested HCWs who are already registered on Co-WIN app can get vaccinated at our centre even if they don’t have an appointment for the day. These steps will likely help to control the wastage of doses,” said Dr Deepak Selukar, DHO, Nagpur.Earlier, on January 16, Dr Archana Patil, director of state health services had stated that attaining 100% turn out every day isn’t feasible so it is expected that if the vaccination centres don’t get a calculated number of HCWs, then it will lead to wastage of dosages. “But this won’t always happen. As we start the immunisation programme for a higher number of people, we can make optimum use of vaccine doses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/89-doses-of-covaxin-wasted-in-three-days-in-maharashtra-101611168680359.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Tinkering labs in 25 municipal school, Mumbai civic body panel sanctions proposal||Amidst apprehensions of Opposition party members, the standing committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sanctioned a proposal on Wednesday to set up Atal Tinkering Lab in 25 municipal schools across the city. These labs provide students with required material for robotics, electrical and mechanical experiments which are guided by the teachers.The Atal Tinkering Lab initiative is set up by Centre’s NITI Aayog which is said to promote a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the country.A proposal to sanction the selected firm for setting up and maintaining the labs was tabled at the committee meeting, on Wednesday. As per the proposal, the BMC will be spending ₹3.48 crore for setting these 25 labs and maintaining them for five years. The proposal does not mention the 25 schools where the lab will be set up.Earlier, in 2017-18, the BMC had set up its first Tinkering Lab at Colaba Municipal School and later in 2018-19 they set up three more labs at Gundavali MPS School, Pali Chimbai Municipal School and Govandi Station Municipal School on a pilot basis. Members of the Opposition parties raised objections on the existing tinkering labs which they allege have no such courses for students. Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said, “The Pali Chimbai Municipal School is in my ward and I enquired with the school authorities but there was no such lab there. The administration should give a detailed proposal on this.”Echoing the same view, Congress corporator Javed Juneja said, “There are no proper details in the proposal. We have never heard of such labs functioning in BMC schools and the administration should clarify this. The civic administration had made tall promises of setting up digital classrooms in BMC schools but nothing has been done yet.”The proposal was, however, sanctioned by the committee. As per the proposal, it aims to develop creativity, innovation in the mechanical and electrical field, experimentation thoughts and curiosity among students of municipal schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tinkering-labs-in-25-municipal-school-mumbai-civic-body-panel-sanctions-proposal-101611168440067.html
21-01-2021||Chandigarh||Exonerated Mohali cop entitled to service benefits, promotion: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that a government employee exonerated in criminal and/or departmental proceedings was entitled for service benefits for the period (s)he remained out of job.The high court bench of justice Harsimran Singh Sethi allowed a plea of Punjab Police head constable Raghubir Singh, presently posted in the office of senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali, who had challenged the denial of pay and promotion as assistant sub-inspector in view of an FIR against him.On December 17, 2012, a case was registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act while Singh was posted on PCR duty. Without holding any inquiry, he was dismissed from service the same day by the SSP. As no incriminating evidence was found in the probe, an untraced report was filed before the special court, Mohali, which was accepted on September 12, 2017, and the cop was exonerated, said his lawyer Ranjivan Singh.On October 15, 2018, he was ordered to be reinstated by the director general of police (DGP), Punjab, with a stipulation that a departmental inquiry will also be initiated against him. The charges could not be proved again and the departmental charge-sheet was dropped on February 18, 2019, by the SSP.When the petitioner requested for restoration of his salary and arrears for the period he remained out of job, it was turned down on November 19, 2019; he was also denied promotion to the rank of ASI.The HC bench held that denying service benefits to the petitioner was unlawful and directed that the said period be counted for paying arrears and granting promotion to him from the date his juniors were promoted in March 2020.The court found that before the investigating agency started investigation into the allegations, the petitioner was dismissed from service on the date of the registration of the FIR itself.“Nothing has come on record as to why, without waiting for the outcome of the investigation, the action was taken against him in-haste only on the basis of the allegations,” the court said, adding that no service rule had been cited that even on the allegations alleged in the FIR, an employee could be dismissed from service.“It is clear that it was only due to the illegal and arbitrary acts of the department that he was dismissed from service and he could not discharge the duties,” the bench said, adding that his arrears will be cleared within one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exonerated-mohali-cop-entitled-to-service-benefits-promotion-hc-101611168320496.html

This even as police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal had recently banned such songs from being played in public places while stating that these are a bad influence on the youth.In what was supposed to be drive to exhort residents to shun vehicles for a day and taking part in physical activities for fitness, cops were seen throwing caution to the wind and roaming around without masks. The cops had closed the stretch from Ghumar Mandi Chowk to Professor Mohan Singh Chowk (Aarti Chowk) for vehicles, however, some commuters still managed to dodge the police and enter the area.Though the police had planned several activities, including cycling, yoga and badminton for residents, only a handful of came forward and participated in the events. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, traffic) Pragya Jain said that there was an open invite for people to join the event. “It is possible that some people may not have been wearing masks, but the police have advised everyone to follow Covid protocol,” the ADCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-cops-dance-to-tunes-of-songs-promoting-liquor-during-raahgiri-101611168263670.html
21-01-2021||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Jail hospitals well-equipped to monitor Varavara Rao: NIA tells Bombay HC||Asserting that Taloja jail hospital is well-equipped to monitor the health of Elgar Parishad case accused P Varavara Rao, Maharashtra government and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the 82-year-old Telugu poet could be shifted to Taloja jail.The submissions were made while senior counsel Anand Grover insisted that though Rao could be discharged from Nanavati Hospital, sending him back to Taloja jail would result in deterioration of his condition as the jails did not have the atmosphere recommended by Nanavati Hospital for monitoring Rao, after his discharge from the hospital.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition filed by P Hemlatha, wife of Rao, was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA, that the apprehensions of Rao’s wife about Taloja jail hospital is not equipped to take care of Rao, as per the recommendation of Nanavati Hospital, were unfounded.Singh referred to the judgement passed last year in public interest litigations (PIL) that sought various reliefs for jail inmates during the ongoing Covid pandemic and said that the judgement had enumerated various measures for treating jail inmates who contracted the Covid virus and even for those suffering from comorbidities. Singh said that jails had complied with the measures mentioned in the judgement and in light of that Rao would not face the problems which Grover was anticipating.On the question of the court as to whether Rao had dementia, Grover referred to medical study reports and stressed on the fact that delirium could result in dementia. Grover submitted that as the jail hospital was not equipped to monitor the sodium levels in Rao on a regular basis and he had slipped into bouts of delirium there was an apprehension that the delirium attack could progress to dementia which is incurable.Later, senior advocate Indira Jaising also made submissions on behalf of Rao on whether the court had jurisdiction to grant bail on medical grounds under article 226 of the Constitution. She submitted that as Rao was old and had an underlying medical condition which could be life-threatening, if not kept under control, the court could grant him bail. She also referred to the bail on medical ground granted for former justice Mohit Shah to Prof Saibaba and said that though Saibaba was later convicted pending trial, he was granted bail on medical grounds.She further added that though Rao was an accused and was imprisoned, it did not mean that he had to forego his fundamental rights to life of dignity and health. In light of these submissions, Jaising reiterated the prayer for granting Rao bail.After hearing the submissions, the court asked Grover and Jaising to file a short affidavit to fortify their claims and list out the facilities which Rao would require after being discharged from Nanavati Hospital, but were not present in Taloja jail hospital.The NIA and state will argue against the bail application on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-jail-hospitals-well-equipped-to-monitor-varavara-rao-nia-tells-bombay-hc-101611168261662.html

From today (Thursday), the vaccine will be administered at 11 sites in the district, including community health centres and private hospitals.The department of health and family welfare of the state government, in its order, had advised all civil surgeons to start vaccination at all government medical colleges, district hospitals, sub divisional hospitals, community health centers and all private health care facilities, which were identified as part of the vaccination programme and included in the list of 366 sites (identified across the state).Even those healthcare workers who were registered but waiting for their turn for vaccination can visit these sites and get the jabs.Vaccination to resume at civil hospitalA day after suspending vaccination drive at the Ludhiana civil hospital, the health department has decided to resume the process. District immunisation officer Dr Kiran Ahluwalia said the vaccination site was earlier shifted from the civil hospital to a private hospital considering the strength of health workers and convenience. “But we will resume the vaccination drive at the civil hospital from January 22,” she said.So far, 67 out of the 150 employees at the civil hospital who had got themselves registered have been vaccinated. She added, “From Thursday, we will be conducting vaccination drives at the government health facilities of Samrala, Khanna, Jagraon, and Sudhar and private hospitals, including Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, Fortis, SPS Hospital. We have also identified small nursing homes, having a staff strength ranging from 5 to 50 healthcare workers.”“I have also conducted a meeting with Asha and ANM workers and motivated them to take the vaccination dose,” said Dr Kiran.State govt’s instructions:Private healthcare sectors that have been identified for carrying out vaccination are to operate seven days a week while all government health care institutions are to run the drive six days a week.The Co-WIN portal allocates 100 beneficiaries a day per site. But now, there is a provision in the portal to include registered beneficiaries who are not included in the list scheduled for the day. The state govt has asked the civil surgeons to ensure that all willing and available registered beneficiaries at a particular site are included in the session and vaccinated.1 dead, 38 fresh infections in districtA 72-year-old man from Salem Tabri died while 38 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported in Ludhiana on Wednesday.

21-01-2021||Mumbai||68.04% give vaccine a shot on Day 3 in Maharashtra||At 68.04%, the state saw an improvement in the turnout on the third day of the vaccination drive on Wednesday. The turnout was 64.34% of the daily target on Day 1 on Saturday and 52.68% of the daily target on Tuesday. While the state authorities are hopeful about gradual improvement in the response from health care workers (HCWs), the state health department plans to hold a counselling and awareness drive to attract more beneficiaries. A total of 18,166 HCWs were inoculated across 267 centres on Wednesday, taking the tally of beneficiaries to 51,650. Of them, 881 have been given Bharat Biotech Limited’s Covaxin. The number of centres was reduced on Wednesday owing to technical glitches in the CoWIN app. The comparatively backward districts of Amravati (112%), Hingoli (107%), Dhule (92%) and Osmanabad (80%) reported high turnout, while Aurangabad (31%), Pune (38%) and Raigad (35%) saw the lowest turnout. Mumbai met 72% of its daily target, while Thane saw 77% turnout. The state has decided to four sessions a week – on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The state expects 55.5% of the 800,000 HCWs to be vaccinated by mid-February and begin their inoculation for the second dose. The state government has so far been given 983,000 vials of Covaxin and Covishield and need more stock of the vaccine to begin the inoculation of remaining HCWs. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state health department will launch an information, education and communication (IEC) drive and counsel HCWs, to improve the Covid vaccination percentage. “I would not call the turnout low, as Maharashtra saw among the highest responses in the country on Day one. It is true that all enrolled HCWs are not coming for vaccination, but we should not go into the percentage of the turnout. To improve it further, I am releasing a video appealing to our HCWs to come forward and set an example for others. Ultimately, they are the message givers and idols for many,” he said. “We still are facing technical problems with the Co-WIN app and some beneficiaries find their names cancelled after the initial enrolment. Second, the HCWs are still hesitant over safety and want to first gauge the efficacy for a few days. Because of these two reasons the turnout is not up to the mark,” Tope said. The minister said there should not be any apprehension about Bharat Biotech Limited’s Covaxin as it has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India and ratified by scientists as safe for use. The minister said there were very few adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in the state. “We expect gradual improvement in response as fear among HCWs is reducing. We did not get a single case of even minor AEFI in five districts in north Maharashtra,” said Dr PD Gandal, deputy director of health services, Nashik division. Meanwhile, the tally of Covid-19 cases inched close to 2-million mark, as 3,015 new infections took the total to 1,997,992. With 59 new deaths, the death toll has reached 50,582. The state’s case fatality rate stands at 2.53%. Mumbai clocked 501 cases and 9 deaths, taking the tally to 304,126 and toll to 11,268.

We are making estimates for the project. The estimates will not only account for the types of equipment used in open-air gyms but also for general play equipment, benches, and other additional features,” said Bhadana.There are at least 808 parks in the city, of which 483 are maintained by the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), while 325 by the MCG.Bhadana further said that the rationale behind building open-air gyms in parks measuring above one acre is to ensure there is adequate space for accommodating them alongside green belts, benches, footpaths, and other recreational facilities.On Tuesday, the MCG’s finance and contract committee (F&CC) approved a tender for constructing open-air gyms across parks in Ward 23 for a cumulative cost of ₹1.50 crore.Earlier in 2019, MCG officials had announced that they are setting a target of building one open-air gym in every residential sector of the city. However, officials said that they realised that this approach would only cover a fraction of the city. As such, they decided to change their strategy.“There are around 60 residential sectors in the city that come under the jurisdiction of the MCG. We realised that by building 60 open-air gyms, only a small fraction of the residents would be covered. Hence, we decided to change our strategy and cover half of the city’s total number of parks,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The first open-air gyms in the city were constructed on Bhagwan Mahaveer Marg and St Thomas during the MCG’s green Raahgiri initiative in February 2016. However, no such facilities were added over the next two years.It was re-launched on a large scale from April 2018 onwards, with the first such facility being built at a park in Sector 22. Subsequently, 45 open-air gyms were set up across the city over the course of the next two years.An open-air gym has exercise equipment such as air swings, elliptical exercise machine, air walker, rowing machine, chest and leg press machines, and suchlike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-build-open-air-gyms-in-all-city-parks-measuring-more-than-an-acre-101611164359244.html
21-01-2021||Gurugram||Aerial survey underway at landfill to identify space for waste-to-energy plant||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is currently carrying out a drone survey of the Bandhwari landfill site to demarcate land for a proposed waste-to-energy (WTE) plant, to kick off construction later this year. The survey of the landfill, located 40 kilometres from the city, is expected to be completed in two weeks. Officials privy to the matter said the WTE plant is likely to take at least two more years to become functional.Dhiraj Kumar, MCG’s joint commissioner, who is overseeing the implementation of the Centre’s Swacch Bharat Mission, confirmed that plans to move ahead with the WTE plant are underway and that preliminary aerial surveys will be completed early next month. “We are mapping the height of the landfill in various places through drone photography, as it will help in assessing the amount of legacy waste that needs to be cleared immediately, to meet the land requirement,” he said. Kumar pointed out that bioremediation of legacy waste, which commenced three months ago, is continuing at the landfill site, with nine trommel machines. However, he did not provide any data on how much waste has been treated since last September. A spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, the city’s concessionaire for waste management, pegged the estimate of remediated legacy waste at about 250,000 tonnes. This is against nearly 6.7 million tonnes of waste accumulated at the site over the last two decades, as per a 2019 joint committee report drafted by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), IIT-Delhi and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). “We have recently started doing the drone mapping survey of the area, but it is not yet complete. Some of the lands which had been kept for the WTE plant is filled with waste, so we need to map the height of the landfill at various points around the site. Based on that we have to decide where to start the reclamation process, otherwise, the landfill may become unstable,” said the spokesperson, adding that the landfill’s highest point currently stands at 40 metres above the ground, based on results from preliminary drone surveys. On the other hand, officials have not yet been able to address the issue of fresh incoming waste, a large portion of which continues to accumulate there despite the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) orders to stop dumping. “It will take us some time to create enough capacity that we can parallelly process both legacy and fresh waste, but we have successfully started treating about 2,500 tonnes of legacy waste per day already. In some parts of the landfill, the height has also reduced by two to three metres. It will take another two years for the plant to be up and running, until which point bioremediation will continue,” said the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy.The proposed WTE energy plant has received opposition from several quarters of civil society, with residents and experts questioning its environmental repercussions. “Delhi’s experience with the waste to energy model in Okhla should serve as a warning to people in Gurugram, particularly the residents in villages around the landfill. Such a plant in an eco-sensitive zone, right in the middle of the Aravallis, will cause irreversible harm to the ecology and human health,” said Pallavi Tiwari, a campaigner of the Aravalli Bachao group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aerial-survey-underway-at-landfill-to-identify-space-for-waste-to-energy-plant-101611164298826.html
21-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to get country’s tallest outdoor air purifier||The city is set to get the tallest outdoor air purifier in the country. The 78 feet tall air purifier is expected to be installed within three months at one of the five locations shortlisted by the UT administration. UT environment director Debendra Dalai said, “It will be the tallest air purifier in the country and cover 1km area around it. In addition to filters of different types, it will be equipped with sensors to measure air quality index. Besides, live readings of the inlet and outlet air from the machine will be shown on a display board.” The five locations shortlisted for the installation include – two sites in Sector 17, Transport Chowk, Tribune Chowk and the Industrial Area. “We are assessing the best location to install the air purifier and will take a decision shortly. It will be installed in areas with highest pollutant levels,” Dalai said. The equipment will be installed by a private company, at no cost to the administration. “The company, recently got the patent of the technology, and offered to install the purifier. The administration sought it to be installed on a pilot basis and the company agreed. It will cost around ₹1.5 crore and the entire cost will be borne by the company,” said Dalai. Chandigarh is one of the non-attainment cities in the country according to National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) norms, which means it has over a five-year period not consistently met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for harmful PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter), PM 2.5 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide).After remaining “satisfactory” and “moderate” during the lockdown period and a few months after, the air quality index (AQI) had again turned “poor” for the first time in November last year.The UT environment department has already tested the purifier on indoor premises and found its results encouraging, following which its use was recommended outside.10 smaller purifiers also to be installedThe administration has also decided to install around 10 air purifier towers in different locations where the air quality gets poor or worse. These smaller purifiers will be up to 3m in height and cost nearly ₹3 lakh each. The Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee recently floated tenders inviting firms to install the purifiers. “It is being done on a pilot basis. After examining their effectiveness, we will be deciding on expanding the project to other parts of the city,” a CPCC official said. The hired firm will install, operate and maintain the purifiers. The department is likely to open the technical bids by the end of this week.FOR CLEANER AIR• Purifier will be 78 feet tall• Will clean air pollutants in 1km radius around it• Being installed on pilot basis at no cost to administration• Location to be picked from one of five shortlisted areas||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-get-country-s-taller-outdoor-air-purifier-101611163398756.html
21-01-2021||Delhi||Transgender community struggling to cope with lockdown||When the nationwide lockdown was announced to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, Namisha, a transwoman, was left with only ₹3,000 in savings, 2kg flour and some pulses. Within a few days, her stocked ration dried up and saving was also exhausted.The 36-year-old, who would depended on the kindness of strangers in buses at Sarai Kale Khan bus station for her sustenance, now has no one to turn to.“When I was left with nothing to eat I tried to go out to find food. Police threatened me thinking I was out to beg. I did not even have balance in my phone to call anyone. Then I took the help of a neighbour and called an NGO. They supplied some ration to my house and also provide some money last week. Now I will be able to survive for the next few days,” she said.Like Namisha, many transgender persons across the national capital have been rendered helpless amid the lockdown. While most of them begged on the city streets, performed in weddings and celebrations, and took to sex work to feed themselves, they are now struggling to cope in the lockdown.“I could not pay the rent this month for my one-room set in Kalyanpuri. I am just hoping that the landlord doesn’t ask me to leave. Where will I go? My family doesn’t even talk to me,” she said.Hurdles in getting govt helpEven as the Delhi government has set up over 1,400 food distribution centres across the Capital to provide food to those in need, transgender persons said it was tough for them to access these.Ramkali, a transwoman associated with Delhi-based NGO Basera Samajik Sangthan, said they receive distress calls from transgender persons every day for ration and food.“We have also got complaints from many of our sathis (friends) that officials at government food distribution centres mistreated them. People in queues with them passed lewd comments and told them to stay away. The government should make some separate arrangements for the trans community,” she said.A group of 20 transgender persons living in a slum cluster near Lal Qila also raised the same concerns.“All of us work in toli (group) and perform at weddings. It’s been over a month now we have not earned a penny. When we were mistreated by those distributing food at the centre near our slum, we did not go there again. Most of us do not have ration cards to get free ration either. We are completely dependent on NGOs and people who come here to distribute food,” said Nimmu, 45, leader of the group.Amrita Johri of the NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan said that the most pressing concern for these people were the lack of documents.“Since many of them do not have ration cards and identity cards on their preferred gender choice, they are not being able to get the ration. But now the government is providing ration to those without cards too, we hope the transgender community also get benefited,” she said.Delhi social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said that the persons from the transgender community can get the free ration from the fair price shops or distribution centres by just filling the e-coupons and do not need any document for that. “For those who cannot fill e-coupons the government is sending coupons to their houses. The government is providing every possible help to the community without any gender discrimination,” he said.Several transgender persons said that they are not able to get the monetary help announced by the Central government in view of the lockdown. “The government had announced they would transfer ₹1500 directly to the bank accounts. But none in my group has a bank account. We live on daily wages and don’t use the bank,” said Kajal, 36, who lives in Chandni Chowk.Health & mental well-being at stake Simmi, a transwoman, worked in a beauty parlour in Turkman Gate. With services restricted she said that she had no option but to go back to her family when the lockdown was extended on April 14.“I did not have enough money to survive so I returned to my parent’s house in west Delhi. But, now I am going through mental trauma because my parents and siblings pass comments and taunts on my gender choice the whole day. I don’t know what to do. I feel suffocated,” she said.Amrita Sarkar, a transgender rights activist from SAATHI NGO, said many trans persons like Simmi are going through similar mental and emotional trauma during the lockdown. “If the person is not getting acceptance and listening comments like why you are like that? They are living in constant mental pressure. Those who are living alone are totally out of money now,” she said.Sarkar said that they are getting medicine requirements from the transgender persons, many of whom are HIV positive or have recently undergone sex reassignment surgery. “Many of them either don’t have money to buy medicines or they are not getting the supply due to the lockdown.It’s so difficult for them to survive without medicine,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/transgender-community-struggling-to-cope-with-lockdown/story-VIlHs3pArLpe8fTnwZ3k5M.html
21-01-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden proposing 5-year extension of nuke treaty: Report||The Biden administration is proposing to Russia a five-year extension of the New START treaty limiting the number of U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons, U.S. officials said Thursday.Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan planned to convey the extension proposal to Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, on Thursday afternoon, said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter not yet publicly announced by the administration. A second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the proposal but offered no details.The move is almost certain to be welcomed both by Russia and key American allies. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday called on the United States and Russia to extend the treaty and to later broaden it.“We should not end up in a situation with no limitation on nuclear warheads, and New START will expire within days,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels.Stoltenberg underlined that “an extension of the New START is not the end, it’s the beginning of our efforts to further strengthen arms control.”The treaty is set to expire Feb. 5 and is the last remaining agreement constraining U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons. Signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, it limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads.President Donald Trump had been highly critical of the deal, asserting that it put the United States at a disadvantage. His administration waited until last year to engage Russia in substantive talks on the treaty's future. Trump insisted that China be added to the treaty, but Beijing rejected the idea out of hand.Biden, who indicated during the campaign that he favored extending New START, is not proposing any alterations, the U.S. official said. Thus it appeared likely that Moscow would be amenable to an extension.The proposal was reported first by The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-proposing-5-year-extension-of-nuke-treaty-report-101611253367483.html
21-01-2021||World||EU agency urges preparation of stronger measures over coronavirus variants||The EU disease agency ECDC on Thursday urged countries to prepare more stringent measures and speed up vaccine campaigns in the coming weeks because of the risks of more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus.The European Centre Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in a new report that countries in the EU and European Economic Area "should expect increased numbers of Covid-19 cases due to the gradual spread and possible dominance of the variants with increased transmissibility.""The key message is to prepare for a rapid escalation of the stringency of response measures in the coming weeks to safeguard healthcare capacity and to accelerate vaccination campaigns," the agency said.According to the agency the "rate and scale" of the spread would depend on the level of prevention measures and adherence to those measures.The ECDC said that some 16,800 cases of a new more infectious variant of the novel coronavirus had been identified in the UK, where it was first discovered and some 2,000 cases in 60 countries around the world as of Tuesday, of which 1,300 cases were in 23 countries in the EU and EEA area.Around 570 cases of another variant, also more infectious, first discovered in South Africa have been detected in 23 countries, with 27 cases in 10 EU/EEA countries, in addition to the 349 cases confirmed in South Africa as of January 13.The ECDC also urged members to monitor changes in transmission rates or infection severity to identify and assess the circulation and impact of variants, and also to prepare laboratories for increased testing.It also said countries should increase the number of vaccination centres and vaccination staff to speed up the rollout of the Covid-19 jabs.Even though many countries have already begun vaccinations and have strict measures in place the ECDC cautioned against relaxing measures, "since the population groups driving transmission will not be targeted with vaccination for some months."It said because of the evidence of higher transmissibility of the new variants, authorities should be ready to enforce even stricter measures, "communicating and engaging with the population to encourage compliance".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-urges-preparation-of-stronger-measures-over-coronavirus-variants-101611252020591.html

21-01-2021||World||Senate to get Donald Trump's impeachment trial soon: Nancy Pelosi||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the article of impeachment against Donald Trump will be sent to the Senate soon, triggering the start of his trial, but she refused to specify when.The House impeachment managers -- the prosecutors who will present the case against Trump -- are in contact with the Senate about the timing, Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday.“I don’t think it will be long,” she said.The article accuses Trump of inciting insurrection for stoking a crowd of his supporters on Jan. 6 who then stormed the Capitol in a riot that left five people dead. Sending the article to the Senate would require an almost immediate start for the trial, inevitably drawing attention away from President Joe Biden’s first days in office and potentially slowing confirmation of his cabinet picks.Democrats won back the Senate on Wednesday after six years in the minority after two new Georgia senators elected Jan. 5 were sowrn in. Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer has replaced Republican Mitch McConnell as the majority leader, but they are still working out details of how to organize the Senate, including the procedures for the trial.“It’s still unresolved as to when she’s sending it over,” Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, told reporters earlier on Thursday. “It could be today -- unlikely -- could be tomorrow. And then what we’re going to do with it, whether or not it’s going to be a full blown trial with evidence and witnesses or ‘expedited,’ whatever that means, that final decision isn’t even close.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday it’s up to Congress to conduct the trial. Biden is “going to leave it to them to determine what the path forward should be, on the pace, on the steps, on the mechanics,” she told MSNBC. “He’s going to focus on delivering what he feels he promised to deliver on when he was running for office.”After Trump’s first impeachment on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on Dec. 18, 2019, the House didn’t transmit the articles until Jan. 15, 2020. That trial concluded Feb. 5 with Trump’s acquittal.The House speaker dismissed the criticism from some Republicans that proceeding with the trial of Trump, who is no longer in office, would undermine the message of unity that Biden emphasized at his inauguration.“I think we need to speak as soon as possible with as much unity as possible that a second impeachment of President Trump is bad for the country and we’re gonna fight that,” South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who had been a close ally of the outgoing president, said Wednesday.Pelosi said the former president must be held accountable for his role inciting the mob.“Just because he’s now gone, thank God, you don’t say to a president ‘do whatever you want in the last months of your administration, you get a get out of jail card, free,’” she said.At least 17 Republicans would have to join all 50 Democrats to convict Trump. The Senate could then vote to bar him from ever holding public office again with a separate vote by a simple majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-to-get-donald-trump-s-impeachment-trial-soon-nancy-pelosi-101611250008252.html
21-01-2021||World||World has faith in Joe Biden, but not in the US: Survey||President Joe Biden is popular across much of the world and expected to provide greater US leadership on issues such as fighting Covid-19, terrorism and climate change, a new multi-nation survey shows. But trust is low both in the US as a nation and Biden’s ability to deliver.“We wanted to know: If there is a change of administration and if the US is ready to lead again, will anyone follow?” said Michael Broening, Executive Director of the New York office of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, the German think tank that commissioned the survey.The answer from the survey’s 12,400 respondents in Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, Kenya, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the US itself: ‘Yes, but’.“Whatever was here in terms of US trust has really dissipated a lot,” said Broening, adding that US scores on international trust had fallen toward the levels of Russia and China. “That’s a very far stretch from the shining city on a hill.”Asked by polling agency YouGov whether they approved of Biden, and separately if they thought he’d provide more global leadership than predecessor Donald Trump, respondents showed almost as much enthusiasm as similar polls in 2009 -- when Barack Obama replaced George W. Bush, another internationally unpopular US President, in the White House.Eighty-nine percent of Kenyans, 73% of Germans and more than 60% of French, Indians, Indonesians, Mexicans and South Africans said they approved of Biden. Even in countries Trump courted heavily while in office –- such as India and Brazil -– Biden was seen as a welcome change. Only in Russia did more respondents disapprove of the change of guard in Washington.Yet asked whether the new US President should -- and would -- make good on specific goals such as reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or the Paris Agreement on climate change, the survey showed skepticism as to whether he can succeed. Biden signed an order to rejoin the Paris Agreement as soon as he was inaugurated on Wednesday.The results chime with those of another recent survey, this time limited to European nations, published January 19 by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a Brussels think tank. That poll found Biden’s popularity abroad undermined by pessimism, including beliefs that the US political system is broken, that Washington can no longer be relied on to provide allies with security, and that China will be the stronger global power within a decade.“Past polling suggested that the changing of a President really presaged similar changes in attitudes to the US,” said John Ray, director of polling at YouGov Blue, which carried out the poll. He cited the large boosts seen both to confidence in the new president and trust in the US around Obama’s 2009 inauguration. “That’s no longer the case.”The poll for the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung was carried out online in December, after Biden’s election victory had become clear, according to Ray. YouGov surveyed roughly 1,000 respondents from each of the 12 countries, with results weighted for variables such as respondents’ ages, gender, education and religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-has-faith-in-joe-biden-but-not-in-the-us-survey-101611248617326.html
21-01-2021||World||Canada's vaccination drive hindered despite securing enough shots for population||Canada came out No. 1 in the global race to secure vaccines against Covid-19, pre-ordering enough shots to inoculate its 38 million people three times over. You wouldn’t know it, though, from the pace of vaccinations.Canada has administered about 684,000 doses, enough to give first shots to about 1.8% of the population, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker, though some people have already gotten two. That compares with roughly 7.6% in the UK and 5.2% in the US Israel, leading all nations, has administered enough vaccine to give first shots to nearly a third of its population.Canada’s campaign hit another roadblock last week, when Pfizer Inc. said it would temporarily reduce deliveries outside the US as it renovates a factory in Belgium to boost capacity. Canada won’t receive any shipment from the pharmaceutical giant next week.“Pfizer’s global supply issues are not ideal, but that’s why we were so ambitious in the large number of contracts we signed and doses we secured,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters this week. “The total number of doses committed to us is still the same, with every Canadian who wants to get vaccinated able to get vaccinated by September.”Canada has ordered 40 million doses from Pfizer, amounting to less than 20% of the country’s commitments.The delay is a blow to Canada, where a resurgence of the virus since October has pushed hospitals near capacity, prompting provinces to add restrictions, including a curfew in Quebec. While Canada is hardly alone in its struggle to roll out the vaccine, the subdued start and the Pfizer hurdle have increased tensions between Trudeau and the provinces, and emboldened his critics.“Canada is a proud, strong G7 nation,” Erin O’Toole, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said in written statement Tuesday. “We cannot accept this kind of failure -- not with so much at stake.”Canada’s vaccination ratio ranks 14th worldwide on the vaccine tracker, behind Ireland and Iceland and ahead of Austria, Romania and Germany. The sluggish start has been a particularly sore point as vaccinations accelerated in the U.S., which ranks fifth, just below the U.K. The contrast between the North American neighbors was highlighted in news reports showing Canadian snowbirds happily getting shots in Florida.Even though Canada has secured more vaccines per capita than any other nation, “it doesn’t mean much” when the bulk is not yet being delivered, said Jean-Paul Soucy, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto. So far only products produced by Pfizer and Moderna Inc. are authorized for use in Canada, which doubled its Pfizer order from 20 million doses last week.Federal and provincial officials have attributed the slow pace, in part, to Canada’s expansive geography and the industrial freezer storage required for Pfizer’s vaccine, which made it difficult to cover remote areas in the world’s second-largest country by land mass. The country’s decentralized health care system, which leaves it to each province to organize its own vaccination campaign, has made the rollout uneven.Manitoba, for example, confused some people by sending the wrong address for a vaccination center, CTV News reported. Some provinces set aside shots for second doses to complete individuals’ inoculations, while others used up all their stock to give first shots to as many people as possible.Ontario, the country’s largest province, closed vaccination clinics over the December holidays because of low staffing. It was also slow to start inoculating elderly people in long-term care facilities, where thousands died in the spring, Soucy said.“Certainly, we’re behind peer nations in a lot of what we’re doing,” he said.Canadian authorities said Pfizer will ramp up shipping and meet a target of 4 million doses by the end of March. But the disruption of deliveries forced provinces to change plans, with Quebec lowering its targets and Alberta halting appointments.”It’s troubling, it’s a massive concern,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a news conference this week, referring to the Pfizer delay. “My message to the federal government is that nothing else matters right now. Every day we’re giving out less vaccine than we have the capacity to administer is a day we lose.”Pfizer Says It’s Willing to Sell Covid Vaccine Doses to US States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-vaccination-drive-hindered-despite-securing-enough-shots-for-population-101611244831126.html
21-01-2021||World||One in five British adults went further into debt due to pandemic||Almost 9 million people in Britain had to borrow more money by the end of last year to help them through the coronavirus crisis, according to new figures that show widening gaps between the rich and the poor.That’s about a fifth of the UK’s adult population of 47 million people. The findings feed a debate about how Boris Johnson’s administration can best protect segments of the population like the young and lowest paid who have taken the hardest economic hit during the crisis.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have highlighted those concerns in recent weeks and begun talking about measures that could bridge the inequality gap.“The uneven effects of Covid concern me,” Bailey said in a webinar on Wednesday. “It’s clear to me we’ve got to come out of Covid in a way that addresses all parts of the population.”People under the age of 30 and those with household incomes of less than 10,000 pounds ($13,700) were far more likely to be furloughed than the general population, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. The government data also showed self-employed workers were more likely to report reduced hours and income.Among people unable to work, more than half of the top 20% of earners continued to be paid in full, compared with little more than a quarter of those in the bottom 20%. Self-employed workers and the disabled were more likely to have borrowed 1,000 pounds or more. Meanwhile fewer people were able to save for the year ahead.The findings put pressure on Sunak to act in his annual budget statement, which is due on March 3. With the deficit at its highest in peacetime, there are calls for the better off to shoulder the burden of future tax increases.Separate ONS figures showed the gap between rich and poor was widening even before the pandemic struck.Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, rose to 36.3% in the financial year through March, its highest for a decade. The income share of the richest 1% has increased from 7% to 8.3% since 2011.The inflation-adjusted median income of the poorest fifth of people fell by 3.8% between 2017 and 2020. The richest fifth meanwhile saw their incomes steadily grow.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-five-british-adults-went-further-into-debt-due-to-pandemic-101611242955559.html

Divers retrieved its battered casing and cover last week near the location where the flight data recorder was recovered three days after the accident.The Boeing 737-500 jet crashed on January 9, minutes after taking off from Jakarta, the capital.Searchers have recovered plane parts and human remains from an area between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain just north of Jakarta.“After much consideration, we have to close the search and rescue operation today,” Sumadi told reporters.“However, we are committed to continue efforts to find the cockpit voice recorder." The government will provide a ship to take relatives to the crash site for a memorial ceremony on Friday morning, Sumadi said.So far, 43 victims have been identified from more than 300 body bags containing human remains sent to the National Police's disaster victim identification unit.Investigators are working with Boeing and engine maker General Electric to review information from the flight data recorder, which tracks hundreds of parameters showing how the plane was being operated.A team from the US National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration is joining the investigation.Investigators will publish a preliminary investigation report within a month after the crash.The 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 was out of service for almost nine months last year because of flight cutbacks caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The airline and Indonesian officials say it passed inspections, including for possible engine corrosion, before resuming commercial flights in December.Indonesia's aviation industry grew quickly after the nation's economy was opened following the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s.Safety concerns led the United States and the European Union to ban Indonesian carriers for years, but the bans have since been lifted due to better compliance with international aviation standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-ends-search-for-crashed-plane-s-victims-debris-101611238265177.html
21-01-2021||World||US climate envoy Kerry says Glasgow last chance for action||US President Joe Biden’s climate czar promised to make a success of the next round of global warming talks, warning it will be the last chance the world has to avoid climate disaster.In his first speech since becoming US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry said failure is “simply not an option” at COP26, which is taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November.“We really have the world’s last, most important opportunity to come together to raise ambition and to take the next step from Paris,” he said Thursday at B-20, a business leaders event advising G-20 nations.Biden rejoined the Paris Agreement on Wednesday immediately after taking office, reversing a decision by former President Donald Trump. The Paris deal pledges to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, striving to keep temperature increases as low as 1.5°C.That decision was criticized by Republican Senator Ted Cruz on Wednesday evening, who tweeted that it shows Biden “is more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh.”Kerry praised Europe’s policies on tackling climate and blasted Trump’s stance as “reckless” and embarrassing. He said the US will now try to repair its reputation and seek to close the gap by increasing action. Biden plans to set a goal for net-zero US emissions by 2050.Biden’s next task will be to announce a US emissions target for 2030, which will be key to success at COP26. While Kerry said the US will rejoin the accord with increased ambition, he stopped short of suggesting a figure for emissions cuts.Analysts at Climate Action Tracker estimate the US would need a goal to cut emissions by at least 52% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, in order to make a fair contribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-climate-envoy-kerry-says-glasgow-last-chance-for-action-101611239631737.html
21-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel promises widespread vaccine availability before September vote||Chancellor Angela Merkel promised widespread availability of coronavirus vaccines by late September, shortly before voters elect her successor.Amid efforts to boost vaccine supply, Merkel said all Germans who want a shot will get one by the end of the summer on September 21. National elections take place on September 26.Her conservative bloc is still grappling with who should run for chancellor, wary of the difficulties the candidate would have stepping out of her shadow as she runs the country.The choice is between Armin Laschet -- the newly elected head of Merkel’s Christian Democratic party -- and Markus Soeder from the smaller Bavarian CSU sister party. Merkel on Tuesday reaffirmed her intention to not seek political office after 16 years leading Europe’s largest economy. While the CDU/CSU is well ahead in the polls, it faces challenges from the Greens and the Social Democrats.Merkel dismissed suggestions that the election would be influenced by her handling of the pandemic.Ahead of a virtual meeting with European Union counterparts later on Thursday, the German leader called on the bloc to find common ground to beat the pandemic.“The EU is one area” in the fight against the disease, she said. “There is still some time to prevent virus mutations from spreading.”The EU will seek ways to speed up vaccination programs. Merkel said intensive talks are under way with vaccine makers like Pfizer Inc. to accelerate production.The bloc will also consider special privileges for people who have been inoculated and look into whether to apply travel restrictions. Merkel said some border controls might be needed with neighbors, including Switzerland, in case there is no coordinated response.Merkel said Germany will be very cautious about easing restrictions to guard against a renewed spike from fast-spreading strains like in Britain and Ireland.Schools and daycare facilities would be the first priority when authorities do start to roll back curbs, the German leader said in Berlin on Thursday. A broader opening of shops and hairdressers would likely follow.“Any opening strategy must be approached very carefully because of the mutated virus,” she said, two days after extending a lockdown to February 14.While contagion rates in Europe’s largest economy have declined to the lowest since early November, levels remain more than double a government target. Merkel said infections need to fall below 50 per 100,000 people over seven days to consider looser curbs. The current level is 119.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, was cautiously optimistic that the government’s target could be reached in the next three to four weeks, as long as more aggressive variants are held at bay.“Although everyone is tired of the coronavirus, we have to remain very resolute in coming weeks,” he said in an interview with ARD television. “Then we have a fantastic chance that things will improve step by step and we will beat the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-promises-widespread-vaccine-availability-before-september-vote-101611238129615.html

21-01-2021||World||US jobless claims fall slightly but remain elevated||Applications for US state unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week and remained elevated, signaling heightened pandemic-related strain in the US labor market just as Joe Biden begins his first days as president.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs declined by 26,000 to 900,000 in the week ended January 16, according to Labor Department data Thursday. On an un-adjusted basis, the figure dropped by more than 151,000 to 960,668.Continuing claims in state programs -- an approximation of the number of people receiving ongoing jobless benefits -- decreased by 127,000 to 5.05 million in the week ended January 9. The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 935,000 initial applications and 5.3 million continuing claims.The figures continue to far exceed their pre-crisis levels as the resurgent pandemic leads to more stringent business restrictions and stokes people’s fears of infection. Vaccine distribution is expected to restore economic activity later this year, but the rollout has been slower than expected and is limiting the speed at which the job market is able to recover.The latest jobless claims figures coincide with the survey week for the monthly employment report, suggesting that the January jobs figures, which will be released on February 5, could show weak payroll gains in the month.While the US economy has been steady in some areas like housing and manufacturing in recent months, the labor market has struggled to bounce back. The $900 billion pandemic aid package approved in December should provide some relief for workers and businesses in the current quarter, especially if businesses receive Paycheck Protection Program loans and keep employees on payrolls.Last week, Biden released details of his $1.9 trillion economic relief plan. If approved by Congress, it would provide $400 per week in supplementary unemployment benefits through September, aid for state and local governments and direct payments of $1,400 to individuals, on top of the $600 approved in December.Janet Yellen, Biden’s pick for Treasury Secretary, said during a confirmation hearing Tuesday that after the initial relief package, she intends to focus on a second package to “build back better” that would include investment in infrastructure, research and development, training and workforce development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-slightly-but-remain-elevated-101611237028787.html
21-01-2021||World||EU, Turkey call for improved relations after turbulent 2020||The European Union and Turkey pressed each other on Thursday to take concrete steps to improve relations long strained by disagreements over energy, migration and Ankara's human rights record.Turkey, which remains an official candidate for EU membership despite the tensions, is facing the threat of EU economic sanctions over a hydrocarbons dispute with Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, but the mood music between Brussels and Ankara has improved since the new year."We have seen an improvement in the overall atmosphere," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said as he welcomed Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for talks, describing 2020 as complicated."Intentions and announcements need to be translated into actions," Borrell said.The improved tone follows a video conference between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on January 9 in which both stressed the importance of the bilateral relationship.Cavusoglu said he hoped von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the head of the European Council which represents the 27 EU member states, would visit Turkey after an invitation from Erdogan."It is of course important for there to be a positive atmosphere in Turkey-EU ties, but in order for this to be sustainable, we must take concrete steps," Cavusoglu added.STRAINED TIES2020 proved particularly difficult for relations between Turkey and the EU, especially France, with Erdogan expressing publicly his hope that protests in French cities would topple President Emmanuel Macron.Greece and Cyprus, strongly backed by France, want to punish Turkey for what they see as provocative oil and gas exploration by Turkish vessels in disputed waters, but Germany and Italy are reluctant to go ahead with any sanctions on Ankara.Turkey has now withdrawn the vessels and is set to restart talks with Greece, although the EU has accused Ankara of playing "cat and mouse" in a pattern of provocation and reconciliation.EU leaders will decide in March whether to impose sanctions.Brussels also accuses Erdogan of undermining the economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts and media, leaving Turkey's bid to join the EU further away than ever."We remain concerned about the (human rights) situation in Turkey," Borrell said on Thursday.The European Parliament is expected on Thursday to back a resolution calling for the release of Selahattin Demirtas, a leading Kurdish politician jailed in 20216 on terrorism-related charges.But Turkey remains a big destination for EU trade and investment and also hosts some 4 million Syrian refugees. The EU aims to agree fresh funds for the refugees from 2022 to discourage them from coming into the bloc.Ankara wants progress on Turks' right to visa-free travel to the EU, an upgrade of its trade agreement with Europe and recognition of its claims to hydrocarbons off its maritime shelf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-turkey-call-for-improved-relations-after-turbulent-2020-101611236293012.html

The video was aired on Wednesday night hours after Biden took oath as the 46th President of the United States.It begins with Obama's remarks. "Obviously there is a personal element to see my former Vice-President become the 46th President and to see Kamala Harris as our first woman Vice-President. But more broadly, inaugurations signal a tradition of a peaceful transfer of power that is over two centuries old," he says.Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton taped a message of unity in honor of Joe Biden's inauguration https://t.co/jw5mUPtHzq pic.twitter.com/NN9pGr4WUoBush, the 43rd US President, says, "The fact that the three of us are standing here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country. America is a generous country, people of great hearts. All three of us were lucky to be the president of this country."Clinton, 74, and America’s 42nd president says, "This is an unusual thing. We are both trying to come back to normalcy, deal with totally abnormal challenges and do what we do best, which is try to make a more perfect union. It’s an exciting time.”"We have got to not just listen to folks we agree with but folks we don't. One of my fondest memories of the inauguration was the grace and generosity that President Bush showed me, and Laura Bush showed Michelle. It was a reminder that we can have fierce disagreements and yet recognise each other's common humanity and that as Americans we have more in common than what separates us," Obama said.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump skipped the inauguration, a first since Richard Nixon in 1974.If Americans loved their neighbours like they loved themselves, a lot of the division that is there in society would end, Bush says, to which Clinton adds that everybody needs to get off their "high horse" and reach out to their friends and neighbours. "I'm glad you're there. And I wish you well," he says."Mr. President, I am pulling for your success. Your success is our country's success," says Bush while Clinton says he is ready to march with Biden. "Good luck, God bless you!" he says.Obama points out in the video that there is no problem that the Americans can't solve if they work together, adding that this was also the theme of Biden's inaugural speech. "Joe, I’m proud of you. You and Kamala need to know you’ve got all of us here rooting for your success, keeping you in our prayers, and we will be available in any ways that we can as citizens to help you guide our country forward," he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clinton-bush-and-obama-record-joint-video-to-wish-biden-success-101611235798434.html
21-01-2021||World||UK, EU in spat over diplomatic status of bloc's ambassador||Britain has sparked a post-Brexit spat with the European Union by declining to grant the bloc’s first-ever ambassador to the country full diplomatic status.Joao Vale de Almeida is the 27-nation EU’s envoy to the U.K., which left the bloc last year. But the British government says the EU is an international organization, rather than a country, and has not given Vale de Almeida the full rights accorded to ambassadors under the Vienna Convention, including immunity from taxation and prosecution.The EU says the rest of its 143 delegations around the world have all been given full diplomatic status.“The EU’s status in external relations and its subsequent diplomatic status is amply recognized by countries and international organisations around the world, and we expect the United Kingdom to treat the EU Delegation accordingly and without delay,” European Commission spokesman Peter Stano said Thursday.Britain’s Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, said everyone in the EU delegation would get “the privileges and immunities necessary to allow them to carry out their work,” though he did not say whether that amounted to full diplomatic status.He said the Foreign Office “continue(s) to engage with the EU on the long-term arrangements for the EU delegation in the U.K., and I’m not going to pre-empt the outcome.”Tobias Ellwood, a lawmaker with the governing Conservative Party who heads Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government was being “petty.”“We are better than this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eu-in-spat-over-diplomatic-status-of-bloc-s-ambassador-101611235775238.html
21-01-2021||World||9 million people borrowed money to get through pandemic: UK govt data||Almost 9 million people in Britain had to borrow more money by the end of last year to help them through the crisis, according to new figures that show widening gaps between the rich and the poor.The government data also showed self-employed workers were more likely to report reduced hours and income. The findings feed a debate about how Boris Johnson’s administration can best protect segments of the population like the young and lowest paid who have taken the hardest economic hit during the crisis.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have highlighted those concerns in recent weeks and begun talking about measures that could bridge the inequality gap.“The uneven effects of Covid concern me,” Bailey said in a webinar on Wednesday. “It’s clear to me we’ve got to come out of Covid in a way that addresses all parts of the population.”People under the age of 30 and those with household incomes of less than 10,000 pounds ($13,700) were far more likely to be furloughed than the general population, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.Among people unable to work, more than half of the top 20% of earners continued to be paid in full, compared with little more than a quarter of those in the bottom 20%. Self-employed workers and the disabled were more likely to have borrowed 1,000 pounds or more. Meanwhile fewer people were able to save for the year ahead.The findings put pressure on Sunak to act in his annual budget statement, which is due on March 3. With the deficit at its highest in peacetime, there are calls for the better off to shoulder the burden of future tax increases.Separate ONS figures showed the gap between rich and poor was widening even before the pandemic struck.Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, rose to 36.3% in the financial year through March, its highest for a decade. The income share of the richest 1% has increased from 7% to 8.3% since 2011.The inflation-adjusted median income of the poorest fifth of people fell by 3.8% between 2017 and 2020. The richest fifth meanwhile saw their incomes steadily grow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/9-million-people-borrowed-money-to-get-through-pandemic-uk-govt-data-101611235199041.html

The utility will provide power to Danone’s 29 supply points for 10 years, starting from April 2022 under a power purchase agreement.Spain is by far Europe’s busiest subsidy-free photo-voltaic market, and leads the sector’s booming growth in the region, according to a BloombergNEF report. It commissioned 2.9 GW last year, four times the 729 MW of capacity added in 2019.The plant will avoid the emission of 245,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, Iberdrola said. Danone’s suppliers in Spain, Graham Packaging and Salvesen Logistica, will also join the project, dubbed Francisco Pizarro after the famous Spanish conquistador.Other Spanish companies have also committed to developing similar projects. In July, oil producer Repsol SA began the construction of its Valdesolar project, a 264-MW photo-voltaic plant with a planned investment of 200 million euros.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-spain-set-to-get-europe-s-largest-solar-power-plant-101611234721740.html
21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to direct agencies to use Defense Production Act in Covid-19 fight||US President Joe Biden will issue an executive order on Thursday directing agencies to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) and other powers to speed up the manufacturing of testing and vaccine supplies and other items needed to fight Covid-19 in the country.According to The Hill, the Biden administration officials signalled they would be "more aggressive" than former President Donald Trump's administration in invoking the DPA, which allows the federal government to force companies to increase the production of critical supplies during national emergencies."Where we can produce more, we will. Where we need to use the Defense Production Act to help more be made, we'll do that too," said Tim Manning, Biden's Covid-19 supply coordinator, in a call with reporters on Wednesday as quoted by The Hill.Manning said that his team has identified 12 "immediate supply shortfalls", that include N-95 masks, isolation gowns, gloves and swabs needed for tests.Officials said that the new administration will also use the DPA for the acceleration in the production of syringes, raw materials used in vaccines, and other items needed to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible."The team will work with the states and the manufacturers to ensure that we're using the DPA as aggressively as needed to accelerate the supply of the vaccine," said Bechara Choucair, Biden's Covid-19 vaccine coordinator.Critics have argued that while the Trump administration used the DPA to increase the supply of ventilators, masks and other supplies, he was not being aggressive enough to close shortages of supplies."President Trump has not used his DPA authority sufficiently enough to award adequate medical supply contracts for the nation's needs. We must immediately do more to re-shore the most in-demand PPE, such as nitrile gloves, nearly all of which are manufactured in China," a group of Democratic senators wrote in a letter this week to Biden, urging him to invoke the DPA as quoted by The Hill.A key part of the Biden administration's national strategy for defeating the coronavirus is invoking the DPA.Biden's strategy is centered around seven goals, including restoring trust with the American people; mounting a safe and effective vaccination campaign; expanding masking, testing, data and treatments; building the health care workforce; safely reopening schools, businesses and travel while protecting workers; protecting those most at risk for serious illness, including people of colour; and restoring US leadership globally, the plan stated as cited by The Hill."For almost a year now, Americans could not look to the federal government for any strategy, let alone a comprehensive approach to respond to Covid," said Jeff Zients, Biden's Covid-19 response coordinator."This is a plan that is driven by science data and public health, it's not driven by politics," The Hill quoted him saying.The plan also lays out goals to establish an "effective, comprehensive" and "aggressive" vaccination campaign but did not offer timetables for when shots will be available to the general public."We must do this, equitably, we cannot miss vaccinating communities that are hit hardest by the pandemic. This is going to have to be critical to our success... We must do this, equitably, we cannot miss vaccinating communities that are hit hardest by the pandemic. This is going to have to be critical to our success," Choucair told reporters.The administration had already set a goal of getting 100 million people vaccinated within the first 100 days of Biden's first term.The Hill also reported that Biden will also sign executive orders on Thursday increasing federal reimbursement to states and tribes from 75 per cent to 100 per cent of the cost for National Guard personnel and emergency supplies, like PPEs, cleaning and sanitising efforts and opening mass vaccination centers.Biden would also sign another executive order creating a Covid-19 Health Equity Task Force, which will provide recommendations to the president for allocating resources and funding in communities that are disproportionately impacted by the pathogen.At least 24.4 million cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-direct-agencies-to-use-defense-production-act-in-covid-19-fight-101611234298956.html

His resignation needs to be approved by parliament.The protests erupted on Wednesday over what some Mongolians saw as the inhumane treatment of a Covid-19 patient and her newborn baby, Montsame said.Video footage showed the patient, still wearing her nightgown and slippers, being relocated with her baby to a specialist quarantine facility run by Mongolia's National Center of Communicable Diseases.The protests triggered the dismissal of senior health officials. Mongolia's deputy prime minister and health minister also tendered their resignations.The incident came amid growing public dissatisfaction with Mongolia's economic situation and a lack of job opportunities.Mongolia, which earned praise from the World Health Organization in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic for its handling of the health crisis, has recently been battling an outbreak caused by an infected driver entering from Russia.The country, with a population of around 3 million, has so far reported 1,584 cases, but no deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mongolian-prime-minister-submits-resignation-after-covid-19-protests-101611232924561.html
21-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s hasty climate regulations may take long to unwind||On January 13, with the nation’s attention riveted on the vote to impeach President Trump again, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule severely limiting its own ability to regulate heat-trapping gases. A little over a week earlier, as would-be insurrectionists were gathering in Washington, DC, the outgoing administration finalized a rule rendering the vast majority of public health data off limits to policymakers.Eleventh-hour executive actions are a hallmark of presidential transitions, and experts see little in the way of lasting impact as President Joe Biden moves from his inauguration on Wednesday into an expected flurry of policy moves from the new White House. Late environmental rules that conflict with Biden’s ambitious climate agenda can mostly be reversed, some just as hastily as they were implemented.“The last-minute regulations were meant to gum up the works for Biden,” said David Doniger, senior strategic director for climate and clean energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group that filed numerous lawsuits aiming to block the Trump administration’s agenda. “But they were slow, incompetent, and did things that were illegal. They are already getting their comeuppance in the courts.”Eliminating or weakening regulation was a top priority from the start of the Trump presidency, but the mission took on an urgent focus after Biden’s win. In its last days the Trump administration took aim at major provisions ranging from fuel-efficiency standards in appliances to the rules for cost-benefit analysis under the Clean Air Act.The reversals started almost immediately after Biden took office Wednesday, with the signing a slew of executive orders on climate issues. These included a re-commitment to the Paris climate agreement and a request that federal agencies review any and all Trump policies “that were harmful to public health, damaging to the environment, unsupported by the best available science or otherwise not in the national interest.”While the Paris pact can be re-entered with the stroke of a pen and take effect just 30 days later, other Trump regulations will take substantially longer to unwind.There are three main pathways to undoing the regulatory accomplishments of a previous administration. The quickest is the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to nullify a rule within 60 legislative working days of its passage. Once a rule has been nullified, however, the law prohibits any future regulation that is “substantially the same.” What falls into that category has yet to be tested in the courts, and Democrats in particular have been loath to use congressional review for this reason.“The CRA is bad law. It is a bad way to make public policy,” said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “You could be shooting yourself in the foot.”The other two ways of overturning Trump’s climate policies may be more palatable, even if they also take longer. Anyone with standing can use the courts to block regulations on the grounds that they lack scientific justification or are “arbitrary and capricious.” Andrew deLaski of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said his group has already sued to block a last-minute regulation intended to weaken efficiency standards for dishwashers, and that they’re likely targeting at least one more on water heaters.“The hope is the new administration decides not to defend and settles,” said deLaski, who runs the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “If a court agrees, it could put the rules on a fast track for reversal.”Even a positive court decision could set the Biden administration back. A January 19 ruling, for instance, that overturned an attempt by Trump’s EPA to curtail its own ability to regulate greenhouse gases produced by power plants also left the Biden administration without a policy to govern energy emissions. On the one hand, said Kevin S. Minoli, a former EPA lawyer, this means the incoming administration can make a fresh start. “But it also forces the administration to start over again at square one,” he told Bloomberg Law. “That will leave a regulatory gap as the Biden administration sets out on its plan to address climate change.”The rule-making process itself is the third and final tool the incoming Biden administration will have at its disposal. While it’s possible to simultaneously repeal and replace rules at the same time, the process is notoriously cumbersome and full of delays. It’s not unusual for the whole thing to take years.Doniger of the NRDC argues that new rules would have been unavoidable given Biden’s climate policy aspirations, even compared to Obama’s. “Imagine the Trump administration had done nothing,” he said. “It would still be time to revise and strengthen what had been done before.”Even after rules become finalized, there’s one more gauntlet to run. Deregulation advocates argue that rule-making at federal agencies routinely oversteps constitutional and statutory authority to make new laws. A 1984 Supreme Court decision gives deference to agencies when laws are unclear and scientific expertise is required to meet their mandates. More conservative members of the court, including recently seated Justice Amy Coney Barrett, have strongly hinted an openness to overturning this precedent.“At the end of the day the Trump administration’s attacks on environmental law are unlikely to endure,” said Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. “But it is not going to be that easy to replace them with something better.”The real enduring legacy of the Trump administration on the environment, she said, will be the 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. “They are going to look really skeptically at new levels of regulatory authority,” she said.“The Biden administration is packing its agencies with very smart lawyers and administrators who will be crafting the rules with this court in mind,” Horowitz added, “so it will be an interesting game of cat and mouse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-hasty-climate-regulations-may-take-long-to-unwind-101611231586607.html
21-01-2021||World||Thailand approves AstraZeneca vaccine amid second virus wave||Thailand approved AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, paving the way for the country to begin inoculating its 67 million people amid a resurgence in the coronavirus cases.Thailand’s Food and Drug Administration granted the approval for the vaccine on Thursday, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said by phone. AstraZeneca is the first coronavirus vaccine developer to win approval in Thailand, which also has ordered shots developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.“Now we’ll have to wait for the vaccines to be shipped to Thailand, which we’re speaking with the company about,” Anutin said.Thai government has ordered 61 million shots of AstraZeneca vaccine, which has won approvals for emergency use in countries including India, the UK and Brazil. The regulatory nod will also open the door for imports by private Thai companies for administering the doses to people who can afford to pay.Thailand, which was relatively successful last year in containing the pathogen, is betting on wider availability of the vaccine to revive its tourism-reliant economy that’s devastated by the pandemic. The Southeast Asian nation has set a target of inoculating at least 50% of the nation’s population before the end of 2021 as it battles a new wave of infections that’s seen total cases almost triple in the past month to almost 13,000.The government has so far approved plans to purchase a total of 63 million doses and the National Vaccine Institute is in talks with several manufacturers for additional supplies for delivery as early as this quarter. The orders include the AstraZeneca vaccines, some of which will be produced locally by Siam Bioscience Ltd. through technology transfer.The first batch of locally-produced AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be ready for distribution in May, following the rollout of 2 million doses of Sinovac vaccine starting in February. The Chinese vaccine is expected to be approved next month, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-approves-astrazeneca-vaccine-amid-second-virus-wave-101611229909696.html
21-01-2021||World||Transportation nominee Pete Buttigieg calls for improvement in US infrastructure||President Joe Biden's nominee to head the US Transportation Department will tell a US Senate panel on Thursday the United States must improve its infrastructure."We also have a lot of work to do to improve the infrastructure in this country, a mission that will not only keep more people safe, but also grow our economy as we look to the future," former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will say, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.Biden put Buttigieg - a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination last year - in charge of the department that oversees aviation, highways, vehicles, pipelines and transit.In April 2019, then President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders agreed to spend $2 trillion over a decade - but the president never proposed any new revenue source to pay for the upgrades - and never made it a priority."Infrastructure Week" became a long-running joke in the Trump administration as other unrelated events often overtook the effort to rebuild roads, bridges and airports."Now is the time, and we have a real chance to deliver for the American people," Buttigieg will say in his testimony.Biden said last week he will ask Congress in February for "historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy."Biden has also vowed to boost fuel economy standards that were slashed under Trump and take steps to increase the number of electric vehicles on American roads.Congress has abandoned a decades-old policy of largely using fuel tax revenue to fund infrastructure repairs.Since 2008, Congress has transferred about $141 billion to the Highway Trust Fund, according to the Government Accountability Office.Congress failed again last year to approve a multi-year surface transportation bill and instead passed a one-year extension that expires Sept. 30.Congress has not boosted the 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax since 1993. That tax is now worth just 10.2 cents after adjusting for inflation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/transportation-nominee-pete-buttigieg-calls-for-improvement-in-us-infrastructure-101611228231076.html
21-01-2021||World||Now a private citizen, Donald Trump faces an uncertain legal future||Donald Trump issued a list of pardons during his final hours as US president but did not include himself, his children, or personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, even though advisers said he had privately debated the extraordinary step of a self-pardon.Here is how the decision could impact his potential civil and criminal liability as a private citizen:What may have guided Trump's decision not to pardon himself and members of his inner circle?Presidential pardons can only accomplish so much. They can shut down prosecutions by the US Department of Justice, a federal agency. But investigations brought by state-level prosecutors, such as the criminal probe Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance is leading into whether Trump's businesses engaged in fraud, would still be active.Vance has not charged anyone with criminal wrongdoing and Trump has said the investigation is politically motivated.A self-pardon would have only increased calls to prosecute Trump on a state level, said Daniel R. Alonso, a lawyer at the Buckley firm and Vance's former deputy in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.It could also have fueled efforts to hold Trump accountable through civil lawsuits brought by private litigants, such as family members of people who died during the Jan. 6 storming of the US Capitol by Trump followers, said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.Before the attack, as lawmakers were certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s Nov. 3 election victory, Republican Trump took to a stage near the White House and exhorted a crowd of supporters repeatedly to “fight” - using the word more than 20 times - and “not take it any longer.” He also called on his followers to march on the Capitol, the seat of government."With a pardon comes at least the veneer of an admission of guilty," said Levinson. "In a way, I think pardoning himself and his family is almost like a taunt. It would have said 'try to come and get me,' and would have accelerated litigation and investigation."There is also considerable doubt among scholars about whether a self-pardon would hold up in court. Many experts said it violates the basic principle that no person should be the judge in his or her own case.Self-serving pardons might also have drawn the ire of Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who will soon have a trial to determine whether Trump's Jan. 6 speech was incitement, the charge in his impeachment by the House of Representatives.The trial could result in Trump being disqualified from future office.Would a pardon for Giuliani have helped Trump?The answer is likely yes, though hard to speculate, legal experts said.Giuliani had dealings with Ukrainians on Trump's behalf when he was trying to dig up dirt on Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump's efforts led to his first impeachment by the House in December 2019 and the Republican-majority Senate acquitted him in February 2020.In November 2019, federal prosecutors in New York sought records of payments to Giuliani as part of an active criminal investigation, according to a grand jury subpoena seen by Reuters.Prosecutors were investigating money laundering, wire fraud, campaign finance violations, making false statements, obstruction of justice, and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, according to the subpoena.Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing.The scope and status of the investigation is unclear, and Giuliani has not been charged with wrongdoing. It is also unclear if he knows anything about Trump that would be valuable to prosecutors.But not receiving a pardon makes it more likely that Giuliani would cooperate with prosecutors and implicate Trump if charged, said Jessica Roth, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a former federal prosecutor."Without the possibility of a pardon, the prospect of a conviction and potential prison sentence becomes more real, providing an incentive to cooperate to receive more favorable treatment," Roth said.Trump may have decided against pardoning Giuliani because he lost a series of lawsuits brought on behalf of Trump attempting to invalidate Biden as the election winner, Levinson said.Could Trump have pardoned himself and others in secret?It's possible, said former prosecutor Alonso.Pardons are usually made public. But the Constitution does not require this, and Trump could secretly issue preemptive pardons to family members and associates, or even himself, said Alonso.The Presidential Records Act requires documentation of presidential decisions but the law lacks a mechanism for enforcing it, Alonso said. A secret pardon might only become public if the recipient were eventually charged with a federal crime and invoked the pardon as a defense.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/now-a-private-citizen-donald-trump-faces-an-uncertain-legal-future-101611229001436.html
21-01-2021||World||Ex-chief of China’s aircraft carrier programme to be held for graft||The former chief of China’s multi-billion dollar aircraft carrier programme and head of one of the largest shipping companies, will be arrested on charges of corruption, the state media reported on Thursday.Hu Wenming was expelled from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) last year for severely violating party discipline and being suspected of taking bribes and misfeasance.On Thursday, it was announced that the Supreme People’s Procuratorate had decided to arrest Hu, 62, also the former party chief and chairman of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC), over suspicion of taking bribes and abuse of power. The investigation was completed by China’s top disciplinary authority and his case has been transferred to the Supreme People’s Procuratorate for prosecution, an official media report said.As the chief commander of China’s ambitious and rapidly developing aircraft carrier programme, Hu oversaw the development of the country’s first domestically developed aircraft carrier and the second one, named “Shandong” when it was commissioned into the Chinese Navy in December 2019. “On August 30, 2019, Hu retired from his position as CSIC’s Party chief and chairman, the company announced on its website. Investigation into his bribery case was announced in May, 2020, the tabloid Global Times reported.Details of the charges against him include the allegation that he had “lost faith, gone astray from the CPC spirit, engaged in superstitious activities, resisted the investigation and violated party discipline by accepting banquets and bribes”.Hu was accused of violating CPC rules and regulations by “illegally playing golf, visiting private clubs…and taking gifts and gratuities while arranging for subordinate units to pay expenses that should be paid by him personally”.Hu had worked in several major Chinese state-owned arms companies including military aircraft developer and manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), armoured vehicle and munition developer China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO), China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and eventually CSIC, according to the People’s Daily. CSIC was heavily involved in the research, development and manufacturing of military vessels, including for the People’s Liberation Army.Hu retired from CSIC shortly before it merged back with its parent company, the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), forming one of the world’s largest shipbuilders.The CSSC is responsible for developing aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines, warships including the Type 055 large destroyers and Type 075 amphibious warships, as well as commercial vessels, reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchief-of-china-s-aircraft-carrier-programme-to-be-held-for-graft-101611228328879.html
21-01-2021||World||New UK card-purchase data shows 35% drop in consumer spending||UK card purchases were 35% below pre-pandemic levels in the second week of January, according to data made public for the first time by the Office for National Statistics.Spending on credit and debit cards was 4% higher than in February, the last month before the pandemic struck. The Bank of England released its figures from its payment systems to the statistics office to provide more up-to-date information on how the pandemic is affecting the economy.The result gives a taste of the scale of the slump in consumer spending after the government tightened lockdowns to control the coronavirus, raising the risk of a double-dip contraction in the first quarter after the deepest recession in centuries. The ONS will publish retail sales figures on Friday for the month of December, when shops were open for two weeks during a brief loosening of restrictions.Retail footfall was a third of the year-earlier period last week. The proportion of the workforce on furlough leave in which the government subsidizes their wages rose 2 points to 16% in the period to January 10.Some 3% of firms had permanently shut down between December 28 and January 10. Of those still trading, more than a quarter said turnover had fallen by at least a fifth compared to normal levels for this time of year.A separate central bank survey revealed signs of mounting financial distress, with lenders expecting higher default rates on both secured and unsecured loans to households in the first quarter.The BOE’s quarterly Credit Conditions Survey painted a similar picture for the corporate sector. Small businesses found it more difficult to obtain credit at the end of 2020 and investment plans were subdued.Still, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said Wednesday that the economy is adapting to the restrictions and that lockdowns don’t seem to have as big an impact as they did earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-card-purchase-data-shows-35-drop-in-consumer-spending-101611226101676.html
21-01-2021||World||Google and its ethics AI team row: What we know so far||Google has recently locked out artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Margaret Mitchell. This is not the first controversy between the company and its ethics team to have surfaced.What has happened so far:1. Margaret Mitchell is the second AI researcher in the ethics team of Google to have been plugged out of corporate access. The company has said she will be 'locked out for a few days'.2. Margaret Mitchell is the co-lead of Google ethical AI team, responsible for developing the company's technology in a socially responsible manner.3. Google had earlier sacked notable AI ethicist and outspoken critic Timnit Gebru. Mitchell has been a vocal supporter of Gebru on social media and had questioned Google on firing her.4. Gebru claimed to have been abruptly fired by the tech giant after the company demanded retraction of her research paper that questioned the facial recognition technology used by Google. Gebru co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini, as per which there were more errors in identification of black people in comparison to white people, because of largely white data sets used in the algorithm, reported The Verge.5. Google has drawn major criticism on the move of sudden investigation of Mitchell and suspension of her system access.6. Gebru on the latest development had said, "What happens to Mitchell will continue to shape attitudes toward corporate self-governance and speculation about the voracity of research produced with Big Tech funding. "She's not fired **yet**. But apparently they've told her she will be locked out for at least a few days. https://t.co/H1ibkgNQHM7. The Alphabet Workers' Union (AWU) had said, "The Alphabet Workers Union is concerned by the suspension of the corporate access of Margaret Mitchell, AWU member and lead of the Ethical AI team. This suspension comes on the heels of Google’s firing of former co-lead Timnit Gebru; together these are an attack on the people who are trying to make Google’s technology more ethical." AWU further questioning the company added, "Regardless of the outcome of the company’s investigation, the ongoing targeting of leaders in this organization calls into question Google’s commitment to ethics—in AI and in their business practices."8. Google has been facing a number of controversies pertaining to its AI tech and military deals as well as on diversity and inclusivity fronts.Also Read | Google to pay French publishers for online content under new copyright agreement9. Another employee, April Curley, a diversity recruiter at Google in December had alleged that the company is not interested in diversifying its workplace and does not want to hire black talent, as reported by Reuters.10. Mitchell had also tweeted condemning the company CEO Sundar Pichai and the tokenism approach of talking to historically Black universities and colleges after allegations of racism in the company surfaced.A Google spokesperson was quoted by Reuters as saying, "Our security systems automatically lock an employee’s corporate account when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered. In this instance, yesterday our systems detected that an account had exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple external accounts. We explained this to the employee earlier today.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-and-its-ethics-ai-team-row-what-we-know-so-far-101611227280286.html
21-01-2021||World||China congratulates Biden, welcomes US return to WHO, Paris Accord||China on Thursday congratulated US President Joe Biden on his inauguration and called for a reset in Beijing-Washington relations as Donald Trump’s term, marred by a range of bilateral disputes, came to an end.Beijing said it welcomed news that the US would rejoin the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris climate accord, as Biden made his first efforts to pivot Washington back to a central role in global leadership.“With cooperation from both sides, the better angels in China-US relations will beat the evil forces,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a ministry briefing on Thursday.Hua said Biden had used the word “unity” several times in his inauguration speech, and that it was “precisely what is needed currently in US-China relations”.“China and the US had experienced a very difficult time in the past, and the two sides indeed deserve a better future, so we wish Biden a successful presidency,” Hua said. The Trump administration, especially secretary of state Mike Pompeo, had burned many bridges that needed to be rebuilt, and damaged many roads that needed to be fixed. “The two governments should have courage to listen to and respect each other. If we are determined to fix it, it can be fixed,” Hua said.Hours earlier, the Chinese foreign ministry sanctioned Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former Trump, accusing them of “hatred” against the Chinese and carrying out “crazy” moves to harm its interests.The announcement came while Biden was taking oath of office in Washington.The sanctions seemed to signal Beijing’s anger against Pompeo – routinely ridiculed by the Chinese government and state media – who on his final day in office said that China had committed genocide against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The strongly worded statement, and its timing, also signalled Beijing’s anger and frustration against the Trump administration. “Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs, undermined China’s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations,’’ the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.“The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests. China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues,” the statement added.Besides Pompeo, the sanctioned former officials included trade chief Peter Navarro, national security advisers Robert O’Brien and John Bolton, health secretary Alex Azar, UN ambassador Kelly Craft and former top Trump aide Steve Bannon.“These individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China,” the foreign ministry said.On Wednesday, the foreign ministry had dismissed the charges of genocide against the Uighur community in Xinjiang.Responding to the Xinjiang allegations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the regular ministry briefing: “Pompeo has made so many lies in recent years, and this is just another bold-faced lie.”“This US politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughingstock and a clown.”Hua said China hoped “the new administration will work together with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle differences and conduct more win-win cooperation in more sectors.”“We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment on Xinjiang issues, among other issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-congratulates-biden-welcomes-us-return-to-who-paris-accord-101611227188361.html

Merkel said intensive talks are under way to accelerate production of the shots.Germany extended lockdown curbs to Feb. 14 and sharpened select measures on Tuesday, but stopped short of a nationwide curfew and a complete closure of schools amid resistance from some state officials.While contagion rates in Europe’s largest economy have declined to the lowest since early November, levels remain more than double a government target. Authorities are concerned that fast-spreading strains could spark a surge like in Britain and Ireland. The risks were underscored on Thursday with Germany’s coronavirus fatalities surpassing 50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-calls-for-european-solidarity-in-fight-against-covid19-101611226570388.html
21-01-2021||World||Twitter makes Joe Biden's account start with zero followers||The micro-blogging site, Twitter cleared out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts after US President Biden was sworn in on Wednesday, rather than moving the accounts' current followers over to the new administration.According to The Verge, Twitter had said in December that the accounts for @VP, @FLOTUS, @PressSec, @Cabinet, and @LaCasaBlanca would also have their followers wiped.Meanwhile, the @POTUS, @VP and @WhiteHouse accounts are rapidly gathering new followers.Initially, there was a conflict between the Biden camp and Twitter about whether adherents would move over.This is a reversal from what Twitter did in 2017 when the Trump administration took over records from the Obama administration. Back then, Twitter basically copied the current accounts, making a chronicle of Obama-time tweets and followers and building another arrangement of accounts for the approaching organization that held all those followers without any of the tweets.Twitter didn't say why it changed the policy this time. Twitter told The Verge that "It is the ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers."Biden's team seems to be unhappy about this change in policy, given the significant digital advantage they'll be losing. Rob Flaherty, Biden's digital director said the transition team "pushed back and we were told this was unequivocal."Twitter is a major communication tool for the president. The account @POTUS had 33 million followers, @WhiteHouse had 26 million, @FLOTUS had 16 million, and @PressSec had 6 million as of December.As per The Verge, former US President Donald Trump's @POTUS account will be renamed @POTUS45 and 'frozen as-is'. He would have originally been in control of @realDonaldTrump, albeit with fewer protections than before, if Twitter had not banned him for inciting violence on January 8th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-makes-joe-biden-s-account-start-with-zero-followers-101611226396709.html

21-01-2021||World||‘Found only small chunks of remains’: Why Indonesia crash was the 'worst'||Bayu Wardoyo tends to skip the 6 a.m. breakfast of Indonesian fried rice served to divers on the ship searching for wreckage of the Sriwijaya Air passenger jet that crashed in the Java Sea on Jan. 9. He prefers coffee, light snacks and some fruit to prepare for the long day ahead.Later in the morning, kitted out in a black wetsuit and weighed down by diving paraphernalia, he boards a speedboat and heads out under heavy monsoon clouds to the day’s search area. Once there, Wardoyo attaches his scuba regulator and rolls overboard into waters filled with fresh tragedy.Also Read | Explained: Why is Indonesia prone to plane crashesIndonesia has suffered several air disasters over the past decade, and Wardoyo has been involved in more than his fair share of undersea searches. The 49-year-old worked on recovery efforts after an AirAsia jetliner carrying 162 people went down in the Java Sea in December 2014. Less than four years later, he returned to the same waters to hunt for wreckage and bodies in the wake of a Lion Air crash that claimed 189 lives. Now he’s back there again, after Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 plunged into the ocean with 62 people on board. Among them were seven children and three infants.He’s never seen a crash as devastating as this.“This Sriwijaya crash is the worst. The aircraft body is totally destroyed and scattered,” Wardoyo said by text message. “We’ve only found small chunks of human remains. On the Lion Air crash we still found big pieces and the AirAsia crash we found almost a complete human body.”SJ182 plummeted close to 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) in 14 seconds shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on a stormy Saturday afternoon. Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee confirmed that the Boeing Co. 737-500’s engines were running when the plane hit the sea at high speed, indicating the aircraft was in one piece upon impact. What triggered the violent dive remains a mystery.One possibility investigators are looking into is the pilots losing control because a malfunctioning throttle was producing more thrust in one of the engines, according to a person familiar with the situation. The device had been having problems on previous flights, the person said.With the search in its second week, hopes are fading that the cockpit voice recorder -- a crucial jigsaw piece in finding out what unfolded -- will ever be found. Divers retrieved the casing of the so-called black box on Friday, but the memory chip that records communication between pilots and ambient sound in the cockpit had broken loose.The flight-data recorder was recovered last week and will provide clues as to whether this was a problem with the Boeing plane, pilot error, a freak weather occurrence or something else entirely. But the investigation is hamstrung without the other black box. The locator beacons of both were dislodged when the plane smashed into the water, an impact so hard that according to Queensland-based air-safety specialist Geoffrey Dell, it would’ve been like hitting concrete.With the AirAsia crash back in 2014, “the aircraft body was still intact -- only broken into three pieces so we had to pull bodies from inside the aircraft,” Wardoyo said.“The Lion Air crash was different, the aircraft body disintegrated but we could still find big pieces of the fuselage. Sriwijaya is the worst,” he said.Indonesian authorities extended the search period, prolonging the divers’ stay on the command vessel off the coast to Jakarta’s north, but it is due to finish Thursday. Wardoyo is leading a group of 15 civilian professional divers with various qualifications such as deep-sea exploration and cave diving. One is a police officer and diving instructor. The team of volunteers is supporting specialist divers from the National Search and Rescue Agency, or Basarnas. He’s not optimistic about recovering the rest of the voice recorder.“Since the aircraft body is totally disintegrated to very small pieces and the sea floor is very thick mud, it would be very hard to collect anything after more than seven days,” Wardoyo said. “It’s almost impossible to find the memory or other piece of the recorder.”An official from Indonesia’s NTSC said Tuesday that data from the cockpit voice recorder was needed to support findings from the flight-data analysis. Representatives from Boeing, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration and General Electric Co. have traveled to Indonesia to help with the investigation. A preliminary report on the crash should be published in 30 days, local authorities said Tuesday.Bad weather and high seas in Indonesia’s monsoon season have hampered recovery efforts. “Big swells, high winds and rain wouldn’t affect the divers below, but it makes it difficult for the surface team operating dinghies and rubber boats,” Wardoyo said. “It also makes it harder for divers to transfer to the mother ship if the weather is bad.”The command vessel had to return to shore early Wednesday after it was damaged in a collision with another boat at about 1 a.m. in heavy swell and strong winds, according to Wardoyo. The divers returned to the crash site later that morning on a smaller boat.While diving carries some risk regardless of the circumstances, it’s amplified on a search mission, Wardoyo said. Shark attacks aren’t an issue, but decompression sickness, drowning and even heart attacks from overexertion caused by lifting heavy pieces of wreckage in strong currents are among the dangers, he said.“We don’t and won’t take credit for doing this, but at least we can help others with our expertise,” Wardoyo said. “Anyone else would do the same.”The challenging conditions may prompt authorities to use other means to collect aircraft debris instead of relying on divers, according to Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman. “They may use vacuum pumps or dredging once all the victims have been identified or there a no more human remains at the scene,” he said.Wardoyo, who lives with his wife in Jakarta, has been involved in the search since the day after the crash. At sea, the teams wake early, at around 5 a.m., and a briefing is held on the day’s plans after breakfast. Wardoyo runs those meetings along with the commander of the Basarnas specialist diving team. Weather permitting, they head to the search area at 8 or 9 a.m. on rubber boats or rigid inflatables.On good days, visibility underwater is three to five meters, but this week it dropped to one meter or less, Wardoyo said. In the aftermath of the crash, Indonesian officials briefed the media on the number of bags containing body parts and plane wreckage being brought ashore. Members of Wardoyo’s team, in line with Basarnas protocol, wear surgical gloves underneath diving gloves for handling human remains.“It’s not nice for us, but we always think about the families who lost their loved ones,” Wardoyo said. “It’s not easy, we have to move inch by inch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/found-only-small-chunks-of-remains-why-indonesia-crash-was-the-worst-101611219802317.html

Details on how the remuneration would be calculated under the criteria were not disclosed.The announcement follows months of bargaining between Google, French publishers and news agencies over how to apply revamped EU copyright rules, which allow publishers to demand a fee from online platforms showing extracts of their news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-to-pay-french-publishers-for-online-content-under-new-copyright-agreement-101611219685834.html
21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden's inaugural address written by Indian-American earns praise for its powerful message||US President Joe Biden's powerful inaugural speech, penned by Vinay Reddy, has received glowing tributes for its meticulous crafting and emphasis on the importance of democracy, unity and hope in the midst of challenging times.Reddy - an Indian-American from Telangana who wrote the speech that outlined Biden’s goals for his administration, focusing on healing from the current state of division in national politics - has been praised for his “calming” and “inspiring” words.Here are some of the memorable quotes from Biden’s speech:"This is America’s day, this is democracy’s day, the day of history and hope. Today we celebrate a triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause. We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. At this hour my friends, Democracy has prevailed.""For without unity, there's no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only state of chaos...this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge...unity is the path forward.”"Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.""Here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That’s what we do for one another."About halfway through his inauguration speech, President Biden said something very important about the work of Washington - and how he envisions his presidency."Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path," Biden insisted, adding, "Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war"."Hear me out as we move forward,” Biden said at one point in his speech, vowing to be a “president for all Americans”, while asserting: "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue”.Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, described Biden’s inaugural speech as “modest, austere, grave, calming, cleansing” and “inspiring” in a tweet, while other commentators and media columnists said the president “gave the speech the moment demanded.”"Biden’s speech is about appealing to ‘our better angels’, ‘history, faith, and reason’, ‘dignity’, ‘respect’, ‘unity’. It’s literally a rebuttal to Trump’s 'American carnage' Inaugural address," journalist Matt Fuller tweeted."Joe Biden gave the speech the moment demanded. Well done,” Time magazine columnist David French tweeted."Biden is meeting the moment here by being direct about the challenges we face, the gaslighting, the viciousness and the need to come together. Hell of a speech,” said Tommy Vietor, former NSC spokesman for President Obama said.Last month, Biden named his long-time associate Reddy as his speechwriter.Reddy serves as a speechwriter on the Biden-Harris Transition and was the Senior Advisor and Speechwriter for the Biden-Harris Campaign. He previously served as chief speechwriter to former Vice President Biden in the second term of the Obama-Biden White House, after which, he worked as Vice President of Strategic Communications at the National Basketball Association.During the Obama-Biden administration, he also served as senior speechwriter at the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, deputy speechwriter for the Obama-Biden re-election campaign, and speechwriter for his home state Senator, Sherrod Brown of Ohio.Reddy grew up in Dayton, Ohio, the second one of the three sons in an immigrant family and is a product of Ohio public schools from kindergarten to Miami University to The Ohio State University College of Law. He currently lives in New York with his wife and their two daughters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-inaugural-address-written-by-indian-american-earns-praise-for-its-powerful-message-101611220118164.html
21-01-2021||World||European firms improve diversity scores in pandemic year: Study||The number of major European companies with high participation of women in leadership positions has doubled over the past year, but there was less progress on top jobs, a study by a EU-sponsored non-profit organization showed on Thursday.Brussels-based association European Women on Boards, which analysed 668 Europe's top listed companies included in the STOXX 600 index and national benchmarks, said the number of those with high scores on its Gender Diversity Index rose to 62 from 32 in 2019.It defined as high score index readings of 0.8 and above where zero means no women on company boards and in other senior management positions and 1 is the ideal value with a 50% representation.Women made up just over a third of the analysed companies' boards, but held only 14% of "C-suite" jobs, such as chief executive, chief operating or finance officer. Only 6% of companies had female CEOs, the association said, though that marked an improvement from 4.7% in 2019.The study said women were hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic, suffering higher unemployment and greater stress juggling work and family, but did not discuss its impact on the gender diversity scores.The United Nations has set a 2030 goal for achieving gender equality and several EU countries, including its largest member Germany, have laws promoting it. Still, one report estimated that at current path, the bloc was at least 60 years away from accomplishing that goal.Companies from Norway, France, Britain, Finland and Sweden led the rankings, with Switzerland and newly represented Poland at the bottom of the table.Three real state companies added to the STOXX 600 index in 2020, British groups Assura and Grainger, and Sweden's Wihlborgs Fastigheter AB, led with a perfect score.Six of the tracked companies had no women on their boards, executive boards or committees, including two from Germany - Nemetschek and Rational - the study showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-firms-improve-diversity-scores-in-pandemic-year-study-101611219866633.html
21-01-2021||World||Indonesia air crash: Boeing jet’s throttle becomes focus in probe||Indonesian investigators probing the Jan. 9 crash of a Sriwijaya Air flight are looking at the possibility that a malfunctioning automatic throttle could have led to the pilots losing control, according to a person familiar with the investigation.The autothrottle was producing more thrust in one of the Boeing Co. 737-500’s two engines than the other shortly before the plane carrying 62 people crashed into the Java Sea, said the person, who isn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The device had been having problems on previous flights, the person said.Issues involving the autothrottle on the 737 have led to incidents in the past and a similar malfunction on another aircraft model was a cause of a fatal crash in 1995 in Romania.Nurcahyo Utomo, the lead investigator at Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, confirmed that a malfunctioning throttle was “one of the factors that we are looking at, but I can’t say at this point that it’s a factor for the crash or there was a problem with it.”Utomo’s team is working with engineers from Boeing to review the data from the aircraft’s flight-data recorder that was retrieved from the seabed last week. Rescuers are still trying to locate the memory module of the plane’s cockpit-voice recorder, which broke apart upon impact.Unequal thrust from the engines can cause a plane to turn or even roll onto its side and descend abruptly, if it’s not handled properly. Pilots must compensate by manually setting the power or taking other actions.If the autothrottle failure proves central to the probe, it’s likely to put the focus on pilot actions and training as well as how the airline maintained the plane.“Large thrust asymmetry is rare, but pilots are trained to notice this and prevent loss of control,” Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said. “Investigators will determine to what extent asymmetry occurred and look into other factors that let it become a loss of control situation.”Sriwijaya Air Flight 182 abruptly nosedived more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) in about 15 seconds just minutes after takeoff in heavy rain from Jakarta, according to tracker Flightradar24. All aboard died.Boeing’s 737-500 model first flew in 1989 and, according to tracking website Planespotters.net, the particular aircraft that crashed earlier this month entered service in May 1994. The family of jets belongs to an older model than the 737 Max that was involved in two other deadly accidents, including one off the coast of Indonesia, in 2018 and 2019 and that led to a global grounding.Indonesia’s NTSC hasn’t issued any details about what may have led to the crash. It said Tuesday it was planning on releasing preliminary findings within 30 days of the accident. Both engines appear to have been functioning prior to the plane hitting the water, according to the NTSC.Indonesian publication Tempo reported in recent days that there had been recurring malfunctions of the plane’s auto-throttle system prior to the crash.Like an autopilot, an autothrottle on the 737-500 can be used by pilots to set the speed automatically, thereby reducing their workload and wear on the engines.Twin-engine jetliners such as the 737 are designed to fly on a single engine during an emergency, so an autothrottle failure that produced unequal thrust shouldn’t have been enough to take down the plane by itself.However, a severe case of unequal thrust can cause a variety of issues with a plane’s controllability. If an aircraft is in clouds or pilots aren’t closely monitoring the plane’s condition, it can get severely out of control before crews respond.In 2001, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered operators of the family of jets including the 737-500 to replace the autothrottle computer after reports of unequal thrust. While there’s no indication this specific issue occurred in the recent accident, it illustrates how it could create a safety hazard.Boeing had years earlier issued instructions for how pilots should correct the problem -- known as a procedure -- but multiple incidents continued to occur in which crews failed to recognize what was happening soon enough and FAA said more specific repairs were needed.“This procedure does not take into account human factors that may result in the flightcrew failing to recognize an abnormality that develops over an extended period of time, resulting in an excessive bank angle for the airplane,” the FAA said in the 2001 notice to pilots.Out of eight incidents in which pilots didn’t respond properly, two aircraft rolled more than 40 degrees, according to the agency.Unequal thrust on an Airbus SE A310 and a pilot’s inadequate response caused a Tarom airlines flight to crash near Bucharest in 1995, according to Romanian investigators. All 60 aboard died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-air-crash-boeing-jet-s-throttle-becomes-focus-in-probe-101611219911671.html

Health workers in white protective gear took temperatures beside mounded earth and tents as part of Covid-19 precautions.About 600 people are involved in the rescue, with as many as 25 ambulances waiting at the scene, as well as neurosurgeons, trauma specialists and psychologists.A Reuters team saw fire trucks and cars coming and going through a checkpoint on an approach road.China's mines are among the world's deadliest. In December, 23 people died after being trapped in a coal mine in the southwestern city of Chongqing, with one survivor rescued after more than 30 hours of efforts. That had been the region's second fatal accident in just over two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-rescuers-hope-to-drill-shaft-to-free-21-miners-trapped-for-11-days-101611219413791.html
21-01-2021||World||Pakistan faces dilemma of sourcing Covid-19 vaccines||Following Prime Minister Imran Khan’s directive to expedite the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines, Pakistan is grappling with a dilemma – how to source millions of doses to inoculate the country’s most vulnerable.Unlike other countries in the neighbourhood such as Bangladesh, Pakistan didn’t place orders well in advance with foreign vaccine makers. It also doesn’t have a well developed vaccine industry, and authorities are now grappling with the possibility of having to acquire doses at significantly higher prices.On Tuesday, Khan directed the Cabinet committee on procurement to speed up the process for acquiring vaccines. This came days after Pakistan’s regulatory authority approved the emergency use of the AstraZeneca vaccine and the Sinopharm vaccine made by state-run China National Pharmaceutical Group.In early December, Pakistan approved $150 million in funding to buy vaccines, initially to cover the most vulnerable 5% of the population, including frontline health workers and people above the age of 65.Also Watch | India sends vaccines to Nepal & Bangladesh; govt says ready to help others tooThis was almost a month after Bangladesh’s drugmaker Beximco Pharma signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million doses of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine. These doses would be in addition to the two million doses of Covishield provided by India to Bangladesh on Thursday as a gift.Also Read: Bhutan, Maldives first to benefit from India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’There has also been no announcement by Pakistan’s “iron brother” ally China about assistance in the supply of vaccines.Given its troubled relationship with India and reluctance to cooperate even on issues such as the pandemic, Pakistan has not reached out to India for help with vaccines, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.It also doesn’t figure in the list of nine neighbouring and partner countries, including Bhutan, Nepal, Mauritius and Seychelles, to whom India is providing vaccines as grant assistance.Also Read: UAE Air Force to help 3 Rafale fighters reach India, 7 more in AprilAuthorities in Islamabad are now looking to acquire vaccines either through commercial sales or under the Covax facility of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to which the Serum Institute is committed to supplying at least 200 million doses this year.Pakistani authorities are now faced with the possibility of having to pay as much as $6 to $7 a dose if they opt for the AstraZeneca vaccine, and the country’s sole authorised distributor of the vaccine is currently unable to give a timeline for deliveries, the Dawn newspaper reported on Thursday.“Since the government has allowed [the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine] and given us the nod to import the consignments, we have estimated that it would be available to the government for something between US$6 and US$7,” said Usman Ghani of Sindh Medical Stores, one of Pakistan’s biggest importers of vaccines and pharmaceutical products.“The offer has formally and clearly been made to both governments [federal and provincial], but it is a difficult question to answer when it would be made available. Frankly speaking, we don’t have exact idea about this right now.”Ghani also pointed to another key factor – the Indian manufacturer of the AstraZeneca vaccine will first meet the needs of the Indian government, and then the needs of Gavi and other countries such as Bangladesh that concluded commercial agreements in advance.“We have very cordial relations with Serum Institute of India and we would try our best to procure it as early as possible,” he said.Pakistan has so far recorded nearly 530,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 11,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-faces-dilemma-of-sourcing-covid-19-vaccines-101611219687725.html
21-01-2021||World||Amid crippling sanctions, Iran traders seek lifeline in Iraq||Piles of plush carpets line the floors of a northern Iraq shopping center hosting traders from neighboring Iran who hope the spangle of their ornate handicrafts might offer a lifeline out of poverty.In their own country, the economy is in tatters amid crippling U.S. sanctions.“Our money is so devalued, so when we come to this side — apart from the cultural exchange that we share — from a financial perspective it's more profitable for us,” said Iranian Ramiyar Parwiz, the organizer of the exhibition who is originally from Sanandaj. “The money we receive … whether in dollars or dinars has a higher value on our side and it's worth a lot." At least 24 businesses from 15 Iranian cities set up shop this week in the city of Dohuk in the Kurdish-run northern region of Iraq. From Sanandaj to Bijar, they brought luxurious carpets. From Isfahan, Yazd and Hamadan, precious gems, copper and pottery.Iran is among Iraq's largest trading partners and this cooperation has deepened since 2018 amid the Trump administration's maximalist policy on Iran that has seen the U.S. pull out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and levy punishing sanctions on the country.Tens of thousands of Iranian pilgrims visit holy sites in Najaf and Karbala every year, boosting Iraq's fledgling tourism sector. Over 100 trucks ferry construction materials, food, medicine and appliances into Iraq every day.The dependence on Iraqi markets has only deepened as economic conditions worsen in Iran. U.S. sanctions bar American companies and foreign firms from dealing with Iran affecting Iran's energy, shipping and financial sectors, causing foreign investment to dry up.Oil exports have been hardest hit and Iran's economy contracted with dreary forecasts for the future. Unemployment rose and rural populations were disproportionately affected.The exhibition of Iranian businesses is typically held every year in the city of Sulimaniyah, which borders Iran. This is the first year the traders have ventured to Dohuk, which shares closer economic ties to neighboring Turkey, in hopes of enticing new customers and creating greater demand for Iranian goods.Parwiz said the Dohuk venture was the result of desperation.“There is huge pressure on people (in Iran), and the cost of living is unimaginably high,” he said. “We can't afford to buy anything, we cannot even afford to buy medicine.” For Iranian businessmen experiencing difficult times, Iraq has always offered hope for respite.Haji Tousi, a businessman from Mashhad, sells his fine carpets at a lower price than local Iraqi traders. He knows the dollars he takes back home to Iran will keep him afloat. “The type of carpet we are selling here is $200, whereas the same carpet in the market here is sold for $300-350,” he said.But, to the dismay of many Iranian traders, the impact of Iraq's own economic troubles was in plain sight: The exhibition attracts crowds of visitors but many can't afford the marked-down items.“There are many visitors who have warmly welcomed this expo but economic problems have kept them from (purchasing) ,” said Maryam Mradi, a businesswoman from Sanadaj.Iraq is grappling with an unprecedented liquidity crisis brought on by low oil prices. That has slashed state coffers in half and led the government to borrow from the central bank's foreign currency reserves to make salary payments.Some of the Iranian vendors were skeptical their goods would be well received in Dohuk and other areas of Iraq, where Turkish brands dominate shopping isles.“The people's demand is mainly for Turkish goods,” said Shireen Mohammed, a local resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-crippling-sanctions-iran-traders-seek-lifeline-in-iraq-101611218791141.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden administration calls China sanctions on Trump officials 'unproductive'||China's move to sanction former Trump administration officials was "unproductive and cynical", a spokeswoman for President Joe Biden's National Security Council said on Wednesday, urging Americans from both parties to condemn the action.Around the time Biden was sworn in as president on Wednesday China announced sanctions against "lying and cheating" outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former President Donald Trump, a striking repudiation of its relationship with Washington under Trump.China's foreign ministry said Pompeo and the others had "planned, promoted and executed" moves that had interfered in its internal affairs. It banned the ex-officials and immediate family members from entering China, and restricted companies associated with them from doing business in the country."Imposing these sanctions on Inauguration Day is seemingly an attempt to play to partisan divides," Biden's National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement to Reuters."Americans of both parties should criticize this unproductive and cynical move. President Biden looks forward to working with leaders in both parties to position America to out-compete China," Horne said.Pompeo, who unleashed a barrage of measures against China in his final weeks in office, declared on Tuesday that China had committed "genocide and crimes against humanity" against Uighur Muslims."This so-called determination by Pompeo is nothing but paper," a Chinese foreign Ministery spokesperson said in response. "This U.S. politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughing stock and a clown."China has repeatedly rejected accusations of abuse in its Xinjiang region, where a United Nations panel has said at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims had been detained in camps.Biden's choice to succeed Pompeo, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday he agreed with Pompeo's assessment.He told his Senate confirmation hearing there was "no doubt" China posed the most significant challenge to the United States of any nation, and that he believed there was a very strong foundation to build a bipartisan U.S. policy to stand up to Beijing.(Reporting by Michael Martina and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Tom Hogue and Raju Gopalakrishnan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-calls-china-sanctions-on-trump-officials-unproductive-101611218808410.html
21-01-2021||World||Hungary becomes first EU nation to approve Russia's Sputnik V vaccine||Hungary became the first European Union nation to approve Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine as Prime Minister Viktor Orban takes a pre-election risk to accelerate the country’s exit from the coronavirus crisis.Hungary’s drug regulator granted emergency approval for Russia’s Sputnik V, the agency’s director, Matyas Szentivanyi, told state television late Wednesday. The decision followed pressure by Orban to fast-track it and skirt the EU, which has yet to authorize the vaccine.While Orban is regularly criticized in the EU for his cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party leadership, he may only be the first rather than the sole western leader to secure alternative supplies from the east amid the slow roll-out of western vaccines that have left governments exasperated. The government in Budapest is also considering procuring a Chinese vaccine from Sinopharm.Like many of its EU peers, Hungary has faced public skepticism of the vaccines and so far has administered them for only a little more than 1% of its population amid a trickle of doses from Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc.The government has warned that without a ramp-up, curbs like an evening curfew and the closure of some businesses could be in effect through the summer.Orban is also under the gun before 2022 parliamentary elections, which are expected to be the closest in years after the opposition united against the four-term leader. He has pledged to protect the living standards of Hungarians, a tall order after his cabinet projected a 6.4% economic decline for 2020.Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto will be in Moscow on Friday where he may agree to a large purchase of the Russian vaccine. Despite the emergency approval -- which is for six months and an option to extend that for another six -- Hungary’s health authority is still reviewing the Russian version in tests, and mass inoculations may happen only after its sign-off, state television reported.Hungary is also ready to purchase more than a million doses from Sinopharm within days of regulatory approval, Orban told state radio on January 15.Ideological ShiftThe willingness to go ahead with eastern procurements follows Orban’s ideological shift from once being a staunch supporter western values to a leader who has vowed to eradicate liberal democracy, cultivated ties with strongmen and frequently clashed with the EU over his decade-old consolidation of power.Orban has sought to follow the warming of political ties with business deals, including a Russia-backed $15 billion expansion of Hungary’s sole nuclear plant and a $2 billion rail link between Budapest and Belgrade, part of the China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Both contracts are at least partly classified.Extending the deal-making to vaccines the EU hasn’t yet approved isn’t without risks. Chinese and Russian developers have been slow compared with their western peers in releasing clinical trial data, raising questions over transparency, efficacy and safety.Getting Hungarians to trust vaccines is also a challenge after Orban, an early supporter of Russia’s Sputnik, said people wouldn’t be told which doses they’d be getting. He has since said people would be informed.Hungarians are still generally skeptical of Covid-19 vaccines, with 27% responding “Yes” to a question on whether they would get the jab if it became available, compared with 29% who said “No,” according to a survey by the state statistics office published on January 14. That compared with 15% in favor of the vaccine and 36% against a month earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-becomes-first-eu-nation-to-approve-russia-s-sputnik-v-vaccine-101611218555378.html

21-01-2021||World||Twin suicide bombings kill at least 32 in Baghdad||Twin suicide bombings ripped through a busy market in the Iraqi capital Thursday, killing at least 32 people and wounding dozens, officials said.The rare suicide bombing attack hit the Bab al-Sharqi commercial area in central Baghdad amid heightened political tensions over planned early elections and a severe economic crisis. Blood smeared the floors of the busy market amid piles of clothes and shoes as survivors took stock of the disarray in the aftermath.No one immediately took responsibility for the attack, but Iraqi military officials said it was the work of the Islamic State group.Iraq's health minister Hassan Mohammed al-Tamimi said at least 32 people were killed and 110 others were wounded in the attack. He said some of the wounded were in serious condition. Iraq's military previously put the number of dead at 28.The Health Ministry announced that all of its hospitals in the capital were mobilized to treat the wounded.Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, which includes an array of Iraqi forces, said the first suicide bomber cried out loudly that he was ill in the middle of the bustling market, prompting a crowd to gather around him — and that's when he detonated his explosive belt. The second detonated his belt shortly after, he said.“This is a terrorist act perpetrated by a sleeper cell of the Islamic State,” al-Khafaji said. He said IS “wanted to prove its existence" after suffering many blows in military operations to root out the militants.The suicide bombings marked the first in three years to target Baghdad's bustling commercial area. A suicide bomb attack took place in the same area in 2018 shortly after then-Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State group.No one immediately took responsibility for Thursday's attack, but Iraq has seen assaults perpetrated by both the Islamic State group and militia groups in recent months.Militias have routinely targeted the American presence in Iraq with rocket and mortar attacks, especially the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone. The pace of those attacks, however, has decreased since an informal truce was declared by Iran-backed armed groups in October.The style of Thursday's assault was similar to those IS has conducted in the past. But the group has rarely been able to penetrate the capital since being dislodged by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition in 2017.IS has shown an ability to stage increasingly sophisticated attacks across northern Iraq, where it still maintains a presence, three years after Iraq declared victory over the group.Iraqi security forces are frequently ambushed and targeted with IEDs in rural areas of Kirkuk and Diyala. An increase in attacks was seen last summer as militants took advantage of the government's focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic.The twin bombings Thursday came days after Iraq's government unanimously agreed to hold early elections in October. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi had announced in July that early polls would be held to meet the demands of anti-government protesters.Demonstrators took to the streets in the tens of thousands last year to demand political change, and an end to rampant corruption and poor services. More than 500 people were killed in mass demonstrations as security forces used live rounds and tear gas to disperse crowds.Iraq is also grappling with a severe economic crisis brought on by low oil prices that has led the government to borrow internally and risk depleting its foreign currency reserves.

21-01-2021||World||Biden reverses Trump travel ban, halts wall construction||President Joe Biden on Wednesday began reversing Donald Trump’s immigration policies, part of an aggressive push to roll back some of the most controversial actions of his predecessor and chart a new course for the nation.In one of his first acts as president, Biden signed an executive action ending restrictions on travel and immigration from some predominantly Muslim countries. The measure directs the State Department to resume visa processing for those countries and develop a plan to address people affected, such as those who were denied entry to the U.S.The action also orders reviews of other “extreme vetting” practices used by the Trump administration, while directing the U.S. to improve information-sharing with foreign governments to bolster screening of travelers.Biden is also proposing a sweeping immigration bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for roughly 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday night that the president had sent the text of his proposal to Congress.The legislation marks a stark contrast with the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict both legal and illegal immigration during its four years in power.The new president issued a proclamation ordering a stop to construction of Trump’s wall along the border with Mexico. It rescinds the national emergency that Trump declared to secure funding for the wall.The travel ban and border wall were the fulfillments of Trump’s central 2016 campaign promises, to crack down on immigration and limit the number of Muslims coming to the U.S. Biden condemned them as an attack on racial and religious minorities.Just one week after taking office, Trump announced he would suspend entry to travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations: Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. The policy also suspended refugee resettlement. Federal judges blocked the first version of the ban from being implemented. A third version went into place following numerous court challenges.The ban that Biden ended blocked entry to most people from Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and North Korea. It also restricted immigrant visas for people from Nigeria, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Eritrea as well as for certain others from Venezuela and Tanzania.Biden’s immigration legislation is ambitious, and as a result, it could face obstacles in Congress.The proposal calls for an eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, down from 13, and an even shorter one for those known as Dreamers who were brought illegally as children to the U.S., as well as those with temporary protected status.The bill seeks to address the root causes of migration by bolstering assistance to Central American countries. It eases immigration for people fleeing violence and increases prosecution of human traffickers and drug smugglers. But it does not call for a major increase in border security measures in exchange, which could make it difficult to garner support from Republicans in Congress.The travel ban reversal is part of a 10-day onslaught of executive actions intended to overturn key Trump policies without waiting for Congress, on topics ranging from the Covid-19 pandemic to climate change and criminal justice.Biden on Wednesday also signed an executive order rescinding the Trump administration’s immigration-enforcement priorities that stepped up patrols along the U.S. southern border and cast a wider net in the interior of the country. The decision clears the way for the Biden administration to set narrower targets.Strengthening DACA ProgramAnother order signed by Biden directs the Department of Homeland Security to shore up the Deferred Action for Childhood Migrants program the Trump administration sought to terminate. The program provides deportation reprieves and work permits for the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers.The new president is also restoring deportation protections for Liberians, which the Trump administration attempted to scale back.Biden next week is expected to issue an order directing federal agencies to speed the reunification of families who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border as part of Trump’s crackdown on migrants. The new administration is also considering a broad moratorium on deportation in the coming days.In another immigration matter, Trump issued an order on Tuesday night deferring the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants in the U.S., citing the “autocratic government” of Nicolas Maduro, which his administration had unsuccessfully sought to topple. It isn’t clear if Biden will allow the order to stand.Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-reverses-trump-travel-ban-halts-wall-construction-101611206050815.html

21-01-2021||World||'Even in dark times, we not only dream, we do': says Kamala Harris||In her first remarks to the nation as US Vice President, Kamala Harris has highlighted "American aspiration" and underlined that President Joe Biden has summoned the people to look beyond crisis and aspire to unite.Harris, 56, made history on Wednesday when she was sworn in as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president. The former senator was sworn in just before Biden took the oath of office to become the 46th US President."In many ways this moment embodies our character as a nation. It demonstrates who we are, even in dark times. We, not only dream, we do. We not only see what has been, we see what can be."We shoot for the moon, and then we plant our flag on it. We are bold, fearless and ambitious. We are undaunted, in our belief that we shall overcome, that we will rise up. This is American aspiration," Harris said outside the Lincoln Memorial.She cited the accomplishments of President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, who "saw a better future and built it with land grant colleges, and the transcontinental railroad."She also highlighted how Martin Luther King Jr fought for racial and economic justice."In the middle of the civil rights movement, Dr King fought for racial justice and economic justice. American Aspiration is what drove the women of this nation, throughout history, to demand equal rights,” Harris said addressing 'Celebrating America', a primetime special that wrapped up a busy day of Biden-Harris inauguration events.Harris said a great experiment takes great determination. The will to do the work and then the wisdom to keep refining, keep tinkering, keep perfecting.The same determination is being realised in America today, she noted."I see it in the scientists who are transforming the future. I see it in the parents who are nurturing generations to come and in the innovators, the educators, in everyone, everywhere who is building a better life for themselves, their families and their communities."This too is American aspiration. This is what President Joe Biden has called upon us to summon now. The courage to see beyond crisis, to do what is hard, to do what is good, to unite, to believe in ourselves, believe in our country, believe in what we can do together," Harris said.In his remarks, Biden said the nation faces difficult challenges, but he is optimistic that the country can meet them.“We’ve learned again that democracy is precious, and because of you, democracy has prevailed...To overcome the challenges in front of us requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy: unity. It requires us to come together in common love that defines us as Americans: Opportunity, liberty, dignity and respect. And unite against common foes: Hate, violence, disease and hopelessness,” he said.“The question is: are we up to it? Will we meet the moment like our forebears have? I believe we must, and I believe we will,” Biden said.The 'Celebrating America' event showcased the American people's resilience, heroism and unified commitment to coming together as a nation to heal and rebuild.Hosted by Tom Hanks and featuring appearances by Eva Longoria and Kerry Washington, the 90-minute programme included performances at iconic locations across the country by Foo Fighters, John Legend, Lin Manuel Miranda, Bruce Springsteen, Demi Lovato, Justin Timberlake, Ant Clemons and Jon Bon Jovi.Prior to taking the oath at the US Capitol, Harris paid tribute to the women who she says came before her."I stand on their shoulders," she said in a video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/even-in-dark-times-we-not-only-dream-we-do-says-kamala-harris-101611213970025.html
21-01-2021||World||Pope urges US reconciliation as bishops call out Joe Biden on abortion||Pope Francis told President Joe Biden on Wednesday that he was praying that God would guide his efforts to bring reconciliation in the United States, while the head of the nation's Catholic bishops condemned Biden's pro-choice stand on abortion.In a message sent shortly after the second Catholic U.S. president was sworn in, Francis also said he hoped Biden would work towards a society marked by true justice, freedom and respect for the rights and dignity of every person, especially the poor, the vulnerable and those with no voice."Under your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding," Francis said."I likewise ask God, the source of all wisdom and truth, to guide your efforts to foster understanding, reconciliation and peace within the United States and among the nations of the world in order to advance the universal common good," he said.Three days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Congress by supporters of former president Donald Trump, Francis said the violence had left him "astonished".In Wednesday's message to Biden, the pope said the "grave crises facing our human family call for farsighted and united responses".The president of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference, Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, served notice that the bishops will continue to fight Biden over his position on several moral issues, mainly abortion.Biden, like many other Catholic politicians, has said he is personally against abortion but cannot impose his position on others.Gomez praised Biden for what he called the new president's "moving witness" on how his faith brought him solace in times of tragedy and his commitment to the poor but said bishops had to proclaim all the truth of the Gospel."So, I must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender," Gomez said.In a move that underscored the deep divisions among U.S. bishops on how to approach the new administration, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago said Gomez's statement was "ill-considered" and that many bishops had not been consulted.Many Catholic conservatives supported Trump. Francis had a rocky relationship with Trump, disagreeing with him on a series of issues including immigration and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-urges-us-reconciliation-as-bishops-call-out-joe-biden-on-abortion-101611212755939.html
21-01-2021||World||Two Canadian MPs join commemoration of Kashmiri Hindu exodus||With two Canadian MPs joining in the commemoration of the 31st anniversary of the “ethnic cleansing” of Kashmiri Hindus in 1990, members of the diaspora are hopeful that the tragedy will also be acknowledged in the country’s Parliament.In a statement on the 31st anniversary of the attack on Hindus in Kashmir sent to the Indo-Canadian Kashmir Forum (ICKF), Warren Steinley, an MP from the province of Saskatchewan, expressed his “deep sadness” in commemorating the “attack on the Hindu population of Kashmir valley in January 1990 by cross border militants.”He also commended the “resilience and courage” exhibited by members of the Kashmiri pandit community “who survived this gruesome ethnic cleansing.”These views were also echoed by Indo-Canadian MP Bob Saroya who had earlier issued a similar message and conveyed his condolences “to the families and friends of all those who were killed, raped and injured in this massacre.” Saroya, who represents a riding (constituency) in the Greater Toronto Area became the first-ever Canadian MP to issue a statement of this nature, and described the events of 1990 as a “gruesome genocide”.Both MPs also supported the Indian government’s “plans to help Kashmiri Hindus return safely back to their homes.”Getting such support from MPs for the first time has enthused members of the community in Canada. Vidya Dhar, director of the ICKF, said they were hopeful that a motion would soon be tabled in Canada’s Parliament that is an “acknowledgement” of the violence and persecution the community faced prior and during its exodus from the Valley.While community groups usually take out a procession to mark the anniversary each year, restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic led to them adopting an inventive manner this year. The ICKF, along with the Hindu Forum Canada, had a truck with LE display panels marking the event, travel through the GTA, including Toronto and Vaughan, where it stopped in front of the Pakistani Consulate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-canadian-mps-join-commemoration-of-kashmiri-hindu-exodus-101611212487866.html
21-01-2021||World||Canada disappointed at US move to revoke Keystone pipeline permit||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is “disappointed” at US President Joe Biden’s decision to revoke the permit granted earlier for the contentious Keystone XL Pipeline project.Rescinding the permission given by his predecessor Donald Trump was among the campaign promises made by Biden and was among the first actions he took after being sworn in as president on Wednesday.In a statement released by the PMO, Trudeau said, “While we welcome the President’s commitment to fight climate change, we are disappointed but acknowledge the President’s decision to fulfil his election campaign promise on Keystone XL.”This matter will figure in a scheduled telephonic conversation between Trudeau and Biden on Friday, as the Canadian PM will be first foreign leader to be called by the new American president.“I spoke directly with President Biden about the project last November, and (Canada’s) ambassador (to the US Kirsten) Hillman and others in our government made the case to high-level officials in the incoming administration,” Trudeau said in the statement.“Workers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and across Canada will always have our support. Canada is the single-largest supplier of energy to the United States, contributing to US energy security and economic competitiveness, and supporting thousands of jobs on both sides of the border,” the statement added.While the reaction from Ottawa was tempered, that from the province of Alberta, which is reliant on natural resource-driven projects like Keystone, was far less restrained. Jason Kenney, Alberta’s Premier, called on the federal government to “impose meaningful trade and economic sanctions (on the US) in response to defend our country’s vital economic interests” if the Biden Administration “refuses to open the door to a constructive and respectful dialogue about these issues.”Construction for the project had commenced earlier and the proposed 2700 km pipeline was expected to carry nearly 830,000 barrels of oil from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas via multiple Midwestern American states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-disappointed-at-us-move-to-revoke-keystone-pipeline-permit-101611211646767.html
21-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to unveil Covid plan on first full day in office||US President Joe Biden was expected Thursday to unveil his administration's plans to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he starts his first full day in the White House with America confronting a slew of challenges.Biden was sworn in as the 46th US president on Wednesday, delivering a calming call to heal a nation riven by festering divisions that had grown deeper under four years of Donald Trump.Biden took the presidential oath standing on the steps of the US Capitol, the building complex that had been attacked two weeks earlier by a pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn his victory. Moments earlier Kamala Harris had taken the oath to officially become America's first female vice president."Democracy is precious, democracy is fragile and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed," Biden said before a National Mall that was virtually empty due to the ultra-tight security and a raging Covid-19 pandemic that he vowed to confront swiftly.Absent from the ceremony was Trump, who had earlier left Washington for Florida, breaking 152 years of tradition by refusing to attend his successor's inauguration.Trump has not publicly conceded defeat and spent the months since November's election falsely claiming he was cheated out of a second term.Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama did however attend the inauguration."I think if Americans would love their neighbor like they would like to be loved themselves, a lot of the division in our society would end," said Bush, a Republican.Shortly after walking into the White House, his wife Jill by his side, Biden signed a flurry of executive orders, starting with rejoining the 2015 Paris climate accord from which the US withdrew under Trump."We are going to combat climate change in a way we have not done so far," the new US leader said, speaking in the Oval Office as he signed papers on the Paris deal which was negotiated when Biden was Obama's vice president.Biden's spokeswoman Jen Psaki said his first call to a foreign leader would be Friday to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- after Biden blocked the Keystone XL pipeline fiercely opposed by environmentalists but backed by Ottawa.Biden also halted the US exit from the World Health Organization, stopped construction of Trump's cherished wall on the Mexican border, and rescinded a ban on visitors from several Muslim-majority nations.- A full in-tray -Biden's presidency will initially be shaped by his response to Covid-19, which has killed more than 400,000 people in the US, and the associated economic emergency.He will look to move quickly on coordinating a federal plan to combat the virus, which for months ran rampant across the country as the Trump administration bungled its response.Biden is expected to outline his administration's plans later Thursday after he is briefed by his Covid-19 team.Whereas Trump seldom acknowledged the tragic toll the virus was inflicting on Americans, Biden paused in his inaugural address to offer a moment's silent prayer for the victims.The veteran Democrat also appealed to supporters of Trump, who shattered political norms by ruthlessly belittling rivals, denouncing entire ethnic groups and trying to cast doubt on basic facts."I will be a president for all Americans," Biden said.Still, he confronted head-on the rise of domestic extremism, as evidenced during Trump's presidency by the Capitol assault, deadly attacks on synagogues and immigrants, and a violent march by neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia.The United States faces "a rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront, and we will defeat," Biden said.Biden's inauguration ceremony, while steeped in pomp and tradition, was different from previous events, with no crowds and the National Mall closed.Washington normally parties hard after an inauguration, but the US capital stayed quiet Wednesday.A-listers made a valiant effort to keep up the energy at a mostly virtual, pre-produced show dubbed "Celebrating America."At 78, Biden is the oldest-ever US president, a job he first sought in 1987, and is only the second Roman Catholic president after John F Kennedy.Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, became the highest-ranking woman in US history, and the first Black person and first person of Asian heritage as the nation's number two.She and her husband Doug Emhoff -- America's first-ever "second gentleman" -- were escorted to the inauguration by Eugene Goodman, a Black police officer at the Capitol who became a hero by luring away the mostly white mob away from the Senate chambers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-unveil-covid-plan-on-first-full-day-in-office-101611211037916.html
21-01-2021||World||Angry China sanctioned Pompeo, 27 Trump officials as Biden took oath||China sanctioned outgoing US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and 27 other top officials under former President Donald Trump, accusing them of “hatred” against the Chinese and carrying out “crazy” moves to harm its interests.The announcement came as new US President Joe Biden was taking oath in Washington.The Chinese foreign ministry’s move seemed to signal Beijing’s anger against Pompeo – routinely ridiculed by the Chinese government and state media – who on his final day in office said that China had committed genocide against Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR).The strongly worded statement, and its timing, also signalled Beijing’s anger and frustration against the Trump administration.“Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs, undermined China’s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations,’’ the Chinese foreign ministry statement said.“The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests. China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China’s sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such U.S. moves on China-related issues.” Other sanctioned former Trump officials include trade chief Peter Navarro, national security advisers Robert O’Brien and John Bolton, health secretary Alex Azar, UN ambassador Kelly Craft and former top Trump aide Steve Bannon.“These individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China,” the foreign ministry said.Earlier on Wednesday, the foreign ministry had dismissed the charges of genocide against the Uighur community in Xinjiang.Responding to the Xinjiang allegations, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the regular ministry briefing: “Pompeo has made so many lies in recent years, and this is just another bold-faced lie.”“This US politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughingstock and a clown.”Hua said China hoped “the new administration will work together with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle differences and conduct more win-win cooperation in more sectors.”“We hope the new US administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment on Xinjiang issues, among other issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angry-china-sanctions-pompeo-27-trump-officials-during-biden-oath-101611210806713.html
21-01-2021||World||On day one, Biden takes US back to Paris climate accord, World Health Organization||On his first day in office on Wednesday, President Joe Biden signed executive orders that returned the US to the Paris Agreement on climate crisis and the World Health Organization, and ended the Muslim travel ban, reversing some of his predecessor Donald Trump’s most controversial decisions.Biden signed 15 executive orders in all. The first — of the three he signed in the presence of reporters — mandated masks on federal property and interstate transportation, launching a “100 Day Masking Challenge”, reaffirming the highest property he is according to combating the Covid-19 pandemic.The White House had earlier announced an immigration legislation — of particular interest to Indian aspirants for Green Cards, the permanent residency that are a stepping stone to citizenship — that allows H-1B dependents to work and protects their children from “aging out” of their parents’ visas when they turn 21, and “improves access” for foreign students of advanced STEM degrees to Green Cards, which allows permanent residency as a mandatory next step to citizenship.“I thought, with the state of the nation today, there’s no time to waste, get to work immediately,” President Biden said before signing the orders, picking them up from a pile of folders — each of them containing an order — on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.Biden returned the US to the Paris Agreement that his former boss, President Barack Obama, had helped forge. But his predecessor, Trump, had pulled the US out of it claiming, wrongly, it favoured India and China at the expense of the US.Biden’s decision to rejoin the WHO was also a significant move, recognising the importance of the global body in the middle of the deadliest pandemic the world had seen in more than 100 years. Trump had ordered the pullout to shift blame for his own mishandling of the epidemic on to the WHO, accusing it of covering up for China.In her first daily news briefing, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who was reviled by Trump and was sent death threats by the former president’s supporters, will lead the US delegation to the world body in America’s renewed engagement with the world body.President Biden also told reporters Trump had left him a “generous” note but refused to share its content saying it was a private matter. He said he must speak first about it with Trump. But a spokesperson said there were no plans for him to call his predecessor.Trump and Melania Trump had left the White House without waiting to receive their successor, violating one of the many rituals of transfer of power. They had also not attended Biden’s inauguration and Melania Trump had not given First Lady Jill Biden a customary tour of the White House.The Bidens’ first day in the White House marked the return of a familiar style and manner of American politics and governance that had been overshadowed by Trump’s unpredictable and irascible brand of governance.Nothing signified the change more than Biden’s instructions to nearly a thousand political appointees he swore in on web video call: “If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treated another colleague with disrespect — talk down to someone — I promise I will fire you on the spot. On the spot...Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-day-one-biden-takes-us-back-to-paris-climate-accord-world-health-organization-101611208106277.html
21-01-2021||World||Indian-American lawmakers say Biden, Harris will heal America||Indian-American lawmakers hailed the leadership of US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, expressing confidence that the two leaders will heal the country, courageously face challenges and build back better.During the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s official Asian American inaugural ball, hosted virtually by the leading Indian-American advocacy organisation IMPACT, Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi from Illinois said he is extremely happy that both Biden and Harris are finally able to take over leadership.Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th Congressional District, located in the heart of Silicon Valley, said he cannot stress “what an amazing moment this is for our community and for the multi-racial democracy in America.”Congressman Ami Bera, representing California’s 7th Congressional District in the US House of Representatives, said Biden and Harris are humble people who get the importance of this moment in time to heal this country, to bring the nation together and “face with courage the challenges that are ahead of us.”Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal said at the AAPI ‘Inaugural Ball: Breaking Barriers’ that she is proud and excited to call Harris the next US Vice President - the first woman, first South-Asian American and the first Black American to ever be elected to this "position of public trust.“Today we prove that our democracy still works and that the power always belongs to the people through the power of our vote,” she said at the virtual inaugural ball held on Tuesday, and added that she cannot wait to see the brighter world that “we will build together.”Indian-American Neera Tanden, nominated by Biden as the Director of Office of Management and Budget at the White House, said she is honored to be part of the Biden-Harris administration.“I know for many in our community there is so much to be proud of. Not only can we celebrate an incredibly diverse cabinet, but we can also celebrate the fact that we have the first vice president” who is of an Asian descent.Following the swearing-in of Harris, IMPACT Executive Director Neil Makhija said generations of immigrants came to the US for a better life for their children. "Today, the daughter of an Indian immigrant, who made dosas on the campaign trail, and spoke to her 'chithis' in her nomination speech, took her oath of office as Vice-President of the United States.“And as Kamala Harris takes her place in the American story, the hearts of her countrymen and women are swelling with pride and hope for the future,” he said, adding that the inauguration of Harris is not only the culmination of an American dream, but “marks the launching of millions of new dreams.Beginning today, a generation of American children will grow up knowing only an Indian-American and Black woman as vice-president of the United States.”As Harris has said, she may be the first, but she won't be the last. “And, with her as an inspiration, we look forward to helping the next generation prove her right,” Makhija added.National, grassroots organisation South Asians for Biden’s National Director Neha Dewan said Biden and Harris are the "right leaders” for this moment “when we are experiencing multiple, converging crises, and their leadership gives us all hope that we can emerge from this as a stronger country.”She said the organisation is heartened by the fact that the South Asian community played a critical role in the 2020 election, and looks forward to deepening the community's engagement in government and politics in the months and years ahead.With Harris breaking barriers as the first Black and South Asian woman elected to national office, Dewan said “for South Asians who wondered whether this moment could ever be possible, today affirms that America at its best is a land of limitless opportunities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-lawmakers-say-biden-harris-will-heal-america-101611205897937.html
21-01-2021||World||Avril Haines is first official member of President Joe Biden's cabinet||The US Senate on Wednesday (local time) confirmed Avril Haines for director of national intelligence making her the first official member of President Joe Biden.According to a report by CNN, Haines' confirmation as the first woman to lead the US intelligence community, which was approved in the Senate by 84 to 10, continues a recent Senate precedent of confirming Cabinet nominees the day a new president is sworn in, though Biden is getting fewer nominees approved quickly than his predecessors.Meanwhile, two of former President Donald Trump's have been confirmed by the Senate and several from President Barack Obama and George W.

Americans can rest easy tonight knowing Avril Haines has been confirmed as the Director of National Intelligence," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avril-haines-is-first-official-member-of-president-joe-biden-s-cabinet-101611205211176.html
21-01-2021||World||Taiwan's 'de-facto' ambassador to US attends Joe Biden's inauguration||Taiwan's ties with its most important global backer the United States are off to a strong start under President Joe Biden's government, after the island's de facto ambassador attended an inauguration for the first time with an official invitation.Former President Donald Trump's administration ramped up support for Taiwan, increasing arms sales and sending senior officials to Taipei, angering China and stirring even greater enmity from Beijing towards Washington.That had made Trump a popular figure in democratic Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed, and raised concern in its government that Biden may not be as helpful.Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the U.S. commitment to Taiwan was "rock-solid" after the island's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's swearing in on Wednesday."President Biden will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in the Asia-Pacific region - and that includes Taiwan."Taiwan's foreign ministry said it was the first time an inauguration committee had formally invited the island's Washington representative and showed the close friendship between Taiwan and the United States based on shared values."These shared values are democracy, freedom and human rights," said ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou.The United States ended formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, switching recognition to China, though Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.In a video message on her Twitter account, Hsiao, who is close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, said she was honoured to be there representing Taiwan's government and people."Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective," she said.Tsai sent her congratulations too, saying she hoped the two sides could work together to maintain regional democracy, freedom, peace and stability.Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday he was in favour of greater engagement with Taiwan.Tsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwans-de-facto-ambassador-to-us-attends-joe-biden-s-inauguration-101611204858289.html
21-01-2021||World||China to impose virus testing on Lunar New Year travellers, cases rising||China plans to impose strict Covid testing requirements during the Lunar New Year holiday season, when tens of millions of people are expected to travel, as it battles the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.Millions of residents in Hebei province surrounding Beijing, the northeastern Jilin province and Heilongjiang have been put into lockdown in recent weeks amid what is the worst wave of new infections since March 2020.Authorities are asking people to stay home during the Lunar New Year holidays in February as part of the efforts to prevent another debilitating outbreak.A total of 144 new cases were reported on Jan. 20, the National Health Commission said on Thursday, matching the total reported on Jan. 14 and marking the highest number of daily infections since March 1. This still remains a fraction of what China saw during the height of the outbreak in January-February 2020, however.Of the 126 new local infections, Heilongjiang accounted for 68 while Jilin reported 33. Hebei, which had so far seen the biggest spike in cases this month, reported 20 new cases, and Beijing reported two cases.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed infections, rose to 113 from 58 a day earlier.In a notice posted online, China's National Health Commission said people returning to rural areas from other provinces over the Lunar New Year period would have to produce a negative COVID-19 test taken within seven days.A majority of China's 280 million rural migrant workers usually travel home to their villages at this time of year.Those that work with imported cold chain products, or quarantine facility workers, among other groups, would also have to produce a test, even if they remained in the same province, said the notice.Rural areas' epidemic control, as well as infections spread via imported frozen goods, have been blamed by officials as weak links partially responsible for the current outbreaks.An announcement from an NHC official during a Wednesday news conference had suggested everyone returning home would have to take a test. Official media Xinhua then published an article urging officials to clarify details "as soon as possible."The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 88,701, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-impose-virus-testing-on-lunar-new-year-travellers-cases-rising-101611203484001.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden bets big on immigration changes in opening move||For the opening salvo of his presidency, few expected Joe Biden to be so far-reaching on immigration.A raft of executive orders signed Wednesday undoes many of his predecessor’s hallmark initiatives, such as halting work on a border wall with Mexico, lifting a travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries and reversing plans to exclude people in the country illegally from the 2020 census.Six of Biden's 17 orders, memorandums and proclamations deal with immigration. He ordered efforts to preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program known as DACA that has shielded hundreds of thousands of people who came to the U.S. as children from deportation since it was introduced in 2012. He also extended temporary legal status to Liberians who fled civil war and the Ebola outbreak to June 2022.The Homeland Security Department announced a 100-day moratorium on deportations “for certain noncitizens,” starting Friday, after Biden revoked one of Trump’s earliest executive orders making anyone in the country illegally a priority for deportations.That's not it. Biden’s most ambitious proposal, unveiled Wednesday, is an immigration bill that would give legal status and a path to citizenship to anyone in the United States before Jan. 1 — an estimated 11 million people — and reduce the time that family members must wait outside the United States for green cards.Taken together, Biden's moves represent a sharp U-turn after four years of relentless strikes against immigration, captured most vividly by the separation of thousands of children from their parents under a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings. Former President Donald Trump's administration also took hundreds of other steps to enhance enforcement, limit eligibility for asylum and cut legal immigration.The new president dispelled any belief that his policies would resemble those of former President Barack Obama, who promised a sweeping bill his first year in office but waited five years while logging more than 2 million deportations.Eager to avoid a rush on the border, Biden aides signaled that it will take time to unwind some of Trump's border policies, which include making asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Homeland Security said that on Thursday it would stop sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico to wait for hearings but that people already returned should stay put for now.It "will take months to be fully up and running in terms of being able to do the kind of asylum processing that we want to be able to do,” Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told reporters.Despite the deliberative pace in some areas, Biden's moves left pro-immigration advocates overjoyed. Greisa Martinez Rosas, executive director of United We Dream, called the legislation “the most progressive legalization bill in history.”“We made it,” she said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. "We made this day happen."It is even more striking because immigration got scarce mention during the campaign, and the issue has divided Republicans and Democrats, even within their own parties. Legislative efforts failed in 2007 and 2013.More favorable attitudes toward immigration — especially among Democrats — may weigh in Biden’s favor. A Gallup survey last year found that 34% of those polled supported more immigration, up from 21% in 2016 and higher than any time since Gallup began asking the question in 1965.Seven in 10 voters said they preferred offering immigrants in the U.S. illegally a chance to apply for legal status, compared with about 3 in 10 who thought they should be deported to the country they came from, according to AP VoteCast. The survey of more than 110,000 voters in November showed 9 in 10 Biden voters but just about half of Trump voters were in favor of a path to legal status.Under the bill, most people would wait eight years for citizenship but those enrolled in DACA, those with temporary protective status for fleeing strife-torn countries and farmworkers would wait three years.The bill also offers development aid to Central America, reduces the 1.2 million-case backlog in immigration courts and provides more visas for underrepresented countries and crime victims.The proposal would let eligible family members wait in the United States for green cards by granting temporary status until their petitions are processed — a population that Kerri Talbot of advocacy group Immigration Hub estimates at 4 million.Unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens who have been waiting outside the country for more than six years are just getting their numbers called this month. Waits are even longer for some nationalities. Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens from Mexico have been waiting outside the United States since August 1996.The bill faces an enormous test in Congress. Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said Wednesday that he would lead the Senate effort. Skeptics will note that Ronald Regan's 1986 amnesty for nearly 3 million immigrants preceded large numbers of new arrivals and say to expect more of the same.In a taste of what's to come, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, described the bill as having “open borders: Total amnesty, no regard for the health and security of Americans, and zero enforcement.”To be clear, enforcement has expanded exponentially since the mid-1990s and will remain. Biden's bill calls for more technology at land crossings, airports and seaports and authorizes the Homeland Security secretary to consider other steps.Biden warned advocates last week that they should not hold him to passage within 100 days, said Domingo Garcia of the League of United Latin American Citizens, who was on a call with the president.“Today we celebrate," Carlos Guevara of pro-immigration group UnidosUS said Wednesday. "Tomorrow we roll up our sleeves and get to work.”___Associated Press writers Mike Schneider in Orlando, Florida, and Hannah Fingerhut in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-bets-big-on-immigration-changes-in-opening-move-101611203491888.html
21-01-2021||World||Pak election commission issues notices to 19 political parties||The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday issued notices to 19 political parties in the parliament regarding scrutiny of financial statements and funds.According to The Express Tribune, a five-member bench, headed by the chief election commissioner, gave the parties a deadline of February 24 to submit their responses.On behalf of the petitioner, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) counsel Shah Khawar appeared before the ECP. During the proceedings, the political finance wing of the ECP submitted a report regarding scrutiny of financial statements of all political parties serving in the parliament.The election commission directed for a copy of the report to also be provided to Khawar, asking him to review the report and file his objections, if any, reported The Express Tribune.This comes after separate rallies led by different constituent members of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)--the opposition's 11-party alliance--hold a protest outside the ECP against an 'unacceptable delay' in the PTI foreign funding caseDuring the protest, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Maryam Nawaz termed the case as the 'biggest fraud in Pakistan's history'.On Monday, the ECP suspended the membership of 154 members of the country's Senate, national and provincial assemblies after they failed to submit statements of their assets and liabilities.The lawmakers will remain suspended until the submission of their financial statements, Dawn reported.According to the Pakistan daily, every year ECP suspends the membership of several lawmakers for not submitting the statements.

21-01-2021||World||US to re-enter Paris Agreement: All you need to know about climate accord||One of the first executive orders Joe Biden signed as US President was to reverse his predecessor Donald Trump’s order to exit the Paris Agreement on climate change. This was one of several decisions taken by Biden on his first day in office.Here’s a look at some key points on Paris Agreement:1. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It comes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As of December 2020, all 197 UNFCCC members have signed the agreement and 189 still remain party to it.Also Read | On Day 1, Biden sets the ball rolling on immigration, climate change, Covid-192. The agreement was negotiated and adopted by 196 parties in Paris on December 12, 2015 and came into effect on November 4, 2016. India, too, is a party to the agreement, having ratified it on April 22, 2016.3. The Paris agreement aims to substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, limit the increase in average global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius and, if possible, limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.4. Under the agreement, countries have to determine, plan and regularly report on what they are doing to mitigate global warming. However, it is not binding on any country to set specific targets to be achieved by specific dates.5. On June 1, 2017, then-US President Donald Trump announced that his country would exit the accord and re-enter only on terms that are “fair to the United States.” Trump said his decision to withdraw from the accord under his “America first” policy.6. The US’ exit from the accord came into effect on November 4, 2020, a day after presidential elections took place. The Trump administration had given a formal notice to exit the agreement exactly a year earlier.7. Under Article 28 of the Paris Agreement, a party can give notice to leave the accord only three years after the agreement has come into effect in that country. The deal came into effect in the US on November 4, 2016, four days before that year’s presidential polls. The withdrawal from the treaty, meanwhile, comes into effect 12 months after the notice is given.8. Besides the US, eight other countries are not a party to the agreement, including Iran. The US is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China and ahead of India.9. Now that President Biden has signed an executive order to re-join the treaty, the United States will once again become a member of the Paris Agreement in 30 days’ time.10. The third meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement will take place in Glasgow, Scotland from November 1-12, 2021. It will take place as a part of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-re-enter-paris-agreement-all-you-need-to-know-about-climate-accord-101611201064366.html
21-01-2021||World||Immigrants feel positive about reforms to immigration rules under Biden||Immigrants cheered President Joe Biden's plan to provide a path to US citizenship for about 11 million people without legal status, mixing hope with guarded optimism Wednesday amid a seismic shift in how the American government views and treats them.The newly inaugurated president moved to reverse four years of harsh restrictions and mass deportation with a plan for sweeping legislation on citizenship. Biden also issued executive orders reversing some of former President Donald Trump's immigration policies, such as halting work on a US-Mexico border wall and lifting a travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries. He also ordered his Cabinet to work to keep deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the US as children."This sets a new narrative, moving us away from being seen as criminals and people on the public charge to opening the door for us to eventually become Americans,” said Yanira Arias, a Salvadoran immigrant with Temporary Protected Status who lives in Puerto Rico, a US territory.Arias is among about 400,000 people given the designation after fleeing violence or natural disasters.“It sets a more hopeful future for immigrants in the US, but it all depends on the Congress, especially the Senate,” Arias, a national campaigns manager for the immigrant advocacy group Alianza Americas, said of the citizenship effort.Success of the legislation is far from certain in a divided Congress, where opposition is expected to be tough. The most recent immigration reform attempts on a similar scale failed — in 2007 under then-President George W. Bush and in 2013 under then-President Barack Obama.Ofelia Aguilar, who watched Biden's inaugural address on TV with four other female farmworkers in agricultural Homestead, Florida, said she nevertheless felt positive about prospects for immigration reform.“I am hopeful that he'll give us legal status,” said Aguilar, who was pregnant and alone when she came to the US from Mexico in 1993. She worked in the fields for years before starting her own business farming jicama root.“There is hope!” Aguilar cried out after Biden was sworn in. “So many people have suffered.”Some of the farmworkers at the backyard gathering about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Miami said they were disappointed Biden didn't mention immigration reforms in his speech.“I have faith in God, not in presidents,” said Sofía Hernández, an agricultural worker who has lived in the US without legal status since 1989. “So many have said they are going to do things, and I don't see any results."Hernandez came from Mexico, seeking economic opportunity. Her three children were born in the US and she regularly sent money to her family back home before her parents died.“My dream is to go and see my family and come back to stay with my children,” Hernandez said.In New York, Blanca Cedillos said she also was disappointed Biden did not mention immigration during the speech she watched with a half-dozen other masked immigrants at the Workers Justice Project.“I was hoping he would say something,” said Cedillos, a Salvadoran who lost her job as a nanny during the coronavirus pandemic and now gets by with a few housecleaning jobs and a weekly food box from the nonprofit that offers services to immigrants.Cedillos has lived in the US without authorization for 18 years and hopes to eventually visit her four children in Central America, then return legally to the U.S.“I have told them that that trip may happen now. Hopefully, if this new president gives me the opportunity,” she said.Guatemalan construction worker Gustavo Ajché, who came to the U.S. in 2004, watched the Spanish language broadcast with Cedillos.“I don’t want to get too excited because I might get frustrated afterward, like has happened in the past,” Ajché said. “I have been here many years, I have paid my taxes, I am hoping something will be done.”In Phoenix, Tony Valdovinos, a local campaign consultant who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico as a small child, said he isn't celebrating yet.He's among those who have benefited from the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which protects immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.“It's hard to put your heart into it when these things have failed in the past,” Valdovinos said. “We've been beaten down so much.”Maria Rodriguez, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition in Miami, said she feels much the same way.“I’m so happy and relieved, but we are still afraid of getting our hearts broken again,” she said. “We’ve been through this so many times, but we really need to bring through a solution that goes forward.”Los Angeles janitor Anabella Aguirre wants that solution not only for herself, but for her two daughters, both DACA recipients now starting their careers.“Like thousands of mothers and fathers, I want for my daughters to have something better in this country,” Aguirre said. "We hope that today, this dawn, brings hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrants-feel-positive-about-reforms-to-immigration-rules-under-biden-101611200644124.html

Trump’s disclosure, which listed 10 gifts, was the fourth of his presidency, but the previous ones listed no gifts.Other presents included sets of golf clubs from former PGA President Derek Sprague, former Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg, PetProducts.com CEO Allen Simon and Illinois sporting goods maker Bettinardi Golf.Trump received two championship belts — one from the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s Colby Covington and another from wrestling fan Randy Jackson of North Carolina.Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr. gave Trump a leather bomber jacket worth $529.And Apple CEO Tim Cook gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro computer — the first built at an Apple factory in Austin, Texas.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem presented Trump with a $1,100 bronze sculpture of Mount Rushmore, where Trump once held a rally.A spokeswoman for the former president did not immediately return a message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-discloses-40-000-in-gifts-received-during-final-year-101611198696436.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden signs order to end Trump's Muslim travel ban||In a blow to his predecessor Donald Trump's actions to limit immigration, US President Joe Biden on Wednesday has ended the 'Muslim travel ban', which blocked travel to the United States from several predominantly Muslim and African countries.Hours after taking the office, Biden on Wednesday signed 17 executive orders memorandums and proclamations including ending the Muslim travel ban.He has directed the State Department to restart visa processing for individuals from the affected countries and to develop ways to address the harm caused to those who were prevented from coming to the United States because of the ban, The New York Times reported.Implemented in 2017 during Trump's first week in office, the Muslim Ban initially restricted travel from seven Muslim-majority nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The ban faced several legal challenges, but the Supreme Court in 2018 upheld the final version of the measure.The Muslim travel ban so far restricts citizens from 12 countries -- Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan, Tanzania and North Korea -- and some Venezuelan officials and their relatives from obtaining a broad range of US visas, NPR reported.With another executive order, Biden has bolstered the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects from deportation immigrants brought to the United States as children, often called Dreamers.Another executive order revoked the Trump administration's plan to exclude non-citizens from the census count, and another overturns a Trump executive order that pushed aggressive efforts to find and deport unauthorised immigrants.Biden has also halted construction of Trump's border wall with Mexico. The order includes an "immediate termination" of the national emergency declaration that allowed the Trump administration to redirect billions of dollars to the wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-order-to-end-trump-s-muslim-travel-ban-101611197159886.html

I expect they will certainly discuss the important relationship with Canada and his decision of Keystone XL pipeline," she said."His early calls will be with partners and allies," Psaki said.President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have an all-female White House senior communications team.Psaki was also a State Department spokesperson during the Obama administration and previously served as deputy White House communications director and deputy White House press secretary.Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order that revokes a key permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, hours after taking office as the 46th commander-in-chief.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he is "disappointed" to see Biden sign an executive order revoking the Keystone XL oil pipeline's permit."Earlier today, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States of America. While we welcome the President's commitment to fight climate change, we are disappointed but acknowledge the President's decision to fulfill his election campaign promise on Keystone XL," Trudeau said in a statement.

21-01-2021||World||Where Biden stood, reminders of a failed insurrection||On the very spot where President Joe Biden delivered his inaugural address, an insurrectionist mob had tried — and failed — to overturn his election just two weeks before. Nearby, at the Capitol's West Terrace doors, a police officer was brutally assaulted with a flagpole in a one of the siege's most chaotic moments.And from the podium, the starkest sight of all: a National Mall mostly empty, dotted with troops, the usual crowd of spectators replaced by a silent field of American flags.The Associated Press has the privilege of a seat on the inaugural platform every four years in a tradition dating as far back as anyone can remember. But there had never been a ceremony quite like this, in the still-fresh aftermath of a violent challenge to the peaceful transition of power that the inaugural is designed to celebrate.Solemn in purpose and demeanor, Biden did not work the room — not much, anyway. He was on a clock. At noon, he would become president.And at that moment, the Democratic-heavy crowd gave the new president hearty applause, with some of the House lawmakers in attendance audibly voicing relief.Unlike Trump's 2017 inauguration, which featured a speech that promised an end to decades of “American carnage," Biden returned again and again to a theme of national unity.“I thought that inaugural ceremony today was so filled with energy, spirit and love,” said Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, senator and a losing presidential candidate in 2008 and 2016.Performers included Lady Gaga, whose soaring rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner" left some in the audience agape. Garth Brooks, a country superstar and Republican with a huge following in Trump strongholds, led the group in “Amazing Grace."The blue jean-clad Brooks, obviously elated, almost danced away, but not before greeting the new president and three ex-presidents — including an oops-I-almost-missed-you hug with former President George W. Bush.“He just said, ‘I love you guys,'" Clinton said, with a hearty laugh. “And we said, ‘We love you too, Garth.'"Republican Sen. James Lankford, from Brooks' native Oklahoma, said the message of grace is just what a riven nation needs.“He made time when he finished singing to then go personally greet every one of the former presidents there and give them a very non-socially distanced hug, to be able to touch base with everybody and to try to set an example for people to say, ‘Hey, let's figure out if we can actually extend some grace to each other during this time.'"Young poet laureate Amanda Gorman was beaming — under her mask — after receiving plaudits from Vice President Kamala Harris, Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton.“I was really nervous while I was doing it, so I'm kind of glad it's over," Gorman told The Associated Press. Given the reception she was getting from so many big names and important people, she said, “I'm smiling but you can't see it."Biden delivered his 21-minute address before a teleprompter in a stand of photographers. The teleprompter ensured a quick pace and gave Biden helpful hints such as a reminder to “build" to the finish. Biden had just a handful of small verbal stumbles and couldn’t resist adding an unscripted “folks” — a personal trademark — toward the end.Before the ceremony, a morning mist left the platform icy. The wind whipped throughout. There were just enough snow flurries to tell stories about. And by the end, the sun came out and shown brilliantly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-biden-stood-reminders-of-a-failed-insurrection-101611195536326.html
21-01-2021||World||China sanctions Pompeo, 28 other US lawmakers, for disrupting relations||Moments after Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States, China announced that it has decided to sanction 28 Americans including former state Secretary Michael Pompeo and other Trump administration officials for violating Beijing's sovereignty, stating they had made "crazy moves" that "seriously disrupted" US-China ties.The Americans sanctioned by China include former Trump advisor John R Bolton and former White House chief strategist, who was charged with defrauding political donors who supported building a border wall that Trump advocated.The sanctioned individuals and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering the mainland, Hong Kong and Macao of China. They and companies and institutions associated with them are also restricted from doing business with China, according to the statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.The Ministry said that anti-China politicians in the US have "planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-US relations"."China has decided to sanction 28 persons who have seriously violated China's sovereignty and who have been mainly responsible for such US moves on China-related issues. They include Michael R Pompeo, Peter K Navarro, former President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser Robert C O'Brien, David R Stilwell, Matthew Pottinger, Alex M Azar II, Keith J Krach, and Kelly DK Craft of the Trump administration as well as John R Bolton and Stephen K Bannon," it added.The statement comes a day after the Trump administration, in one of its final acts, declared that Beijing was committing genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslims in a far western region.A day before Biden was to be sworn in as the president of the United States, then-Secretary of State Pompeo said that he has directed the Department of State to continue to investigate and collect relevant information regarding the ongoing atrocities occurring in Xinjiang.Antony J Blinken, Biden's pick for secretary of state, said on Tuesday that he agreed with Pompeo's move to declare that China's repression of the Uyghurs constituted genocide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sanctions-pompeo-28-other-us-lawmakers-for-disrupting-relations-101611192301321.html
21-01-2021||World||Explainer: What's next after US accused China of genocide||The US's accusation of genocide against China touches on a hot-button human rights issue between China and the West.In one of his final acts as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo declared Tuesday that China’s policies against Muslims in its Xinjiang region constitute “crimes against humanity” and “genocide.”The same day, British lawmakers narrowly rejected a proposal aimed at China that would have barred trade deals with any country deemed to be committing genocide.The far western region of Xinjiang is home to the predominantly Muslim Uighur ethnic group. China denies human rights violations and says its actions in Xinjiang are necessary to counter a separatist and terrorist threat.WHY IS CHINA ACCUSED OF GENOCIDE?Pompeo cited forced birth control among Uighurs, which an Associated Press investigation documented last year, and forced labor, which has been linked by AP reporting to products imported to the US, including clothing, cameras and computer monitors.“I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,” Pompeo said in a written statement, using an alternative spelling for Uighurs.WHAT IS CHINA'S RESPONSE?China strongly defends its human rights record and policies in Xinjiang, saying its constitution and laws treat all citizens equally. It denies imposing coercive birth control measures or forced labor, saying those behind the allegations are lying in an effort to smear China’s reputation and impede its development.Xu Guixiang, a deputy spokesperson for the Xinjiang branch of the ruling Communist Party, told reporters last week that birth control decisions were made of the person’s own free will and that “no organization or individual can interfere.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on Wednesday called Pompeo a “doomsday clown” and said his designation of China as a perpetrator of genocide and crimes against humanity was merely “a piece of wastepaper.”WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?The genocide designation does not trigger any immediate repercussions, but requires the US to take it into account in formulating policy toward China.It puts pressure on President Joe Biden to maintain a tough line against China. He and members of his national security team have expressed support for such a designation in the past.Antony Blinken, Biden’s choice to be secretary of state, said Tuesday that the Trump administration was right to take a tougher stance on China, but that it had approached the matter poorly by alienating US allies and not fully standing up for human rights elsewhere.HOW WILL CHINA RESPOND?China may wish to avoid an early skirmish with the Biden administration, saving its invective for Pompeo and calibrating its response based on the possibility of tensions easing now after they flared under Donald Trump.As with most sensitive issues, China has heavily restricted foreign media access to Xinjiang and sought to limit any domestic discussion to official pronouncements.Still, the “parting shot" from the Trump administration will likely further stress the relationship in the near term, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China. He said the already slim chances of reducing China-US tensions have been further limited in the coming weeks and months.WHAT HAPPENED IN LONDON?Lawmakers rejected by a 319-308 vote an amendment to a post-Brexit trade bill that would have forced the British government to revoke bilateral trade agreements with a country if the High Court of England found that it had perpetrated genocide.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab last week called the amendment “well-meaning” but ineffective and counter productive.A significant number of rebel Conservatives backed the proposal, as did Jewish, Muslim and Christian community leaders. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to continue facing vocal calls within his Conservative party for a stronger and more coherent policy on China over its alleged rights abuses and violations of international norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-s-next-after-us-accused-china-of-genocide-101611192168953.html

Biden’s call for unity bears significance in the aftermath of Capitol riots when his predecessor, Donald Trump, egged on his supporters to storm the Capitol building, leading to five deaths. In an apparent reference to the tumultuous period of transition, Biden said the country has learnt that democracy is “precious” and “fragile.”Here are 10 memorable quotes from Biden’s speech:1. "This is America’s day, this is democracy’s day, the day of history and hope. Today we celebrate a triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause. We have learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile. At this hour my friends, Democracy has prevailed."2. "I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days. I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. I also know they are not new.”3. “Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonisation have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial, and victory is never assured.”Read | 'My whole soul is in it': Joe Biden becomes emotional as he remembers Lincoln4. “Through civil war to the Great Depression, World War, 9/11...our better angels have always prevailed. And each of these moments...enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward...we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbours...we can treat each other with dignity and respect”5. “For without unity, there's no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only state of chaos...this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge...unity is the path forward.”6. “And today, we marked the swearing-in of the first woman in the American history elected to national office - vice president Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things can't change.”7. “Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever."Read | 'Ready to serve': Kamala Harris' first tweet as US Vice-President8. "To all of those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear me out as we move forward. Take a measure of me and my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy. That's America. The right to dissent peaceably...is perhaps this nation's greatest strength."9. "Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. There is truth and there are lies. Lies told for power and profit. Each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens, as Americans, especially as leaders ... to defend the truth and defeat the lies."10. "Here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That’s what we do for one another."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/battle-is-perennial-top-10-quotes-from-joe-biden-s-speech-101611168685610.html
21-01-2021||World||Youngest Inaugural poet Amanda Gorman: 'Even as we grieved, we grew'||Amanda Gorman, the youngest poet in US history to mark the transition of presidential power, offered a hopeful vision for a deeply divided country on Wednesday with her poem "The Hill We Climb".Gorman, 22, a Los Angeles resident, joined the ranks of previous inaugural poets Robert Frost, Maya Angelou and Elizabeth Alexander, with a powerful performance at the swearing-in of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris."Being American is more than a pride we inherit. It's the past we step into and how we repair it," Gorman said, in a short poem that was greeted with a hail of critical acclaim on social media."We will not march back to what was. We move to what shall be, a country that is bruised, but whole. Benevolent, but bold. Fierce and free."Speaking on the steps of the US Capitol just two weeks after a violent mob laid siege to the seat of American government with Confederate flags, pipe bombs and a noose, Gorman said Americans could rise above the hatred."While democracy can be temporarily delayed, it can never be permanently defeated," Gorman said. "Let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left," Gorman said. "We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.""The new dawn blooms as we free it," said Gorman, who was named the first US National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017.John F. Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also had poets read at their inauguration.Critical acclaim poured from across the country and the political spectrum, including Republican strategist Lincoln Project and Stacey Abrams the Democratic organizer and gubernatorial candidate from Georgia, who said, "Amanda Gorman's message serves as an inspiration to us all."Singer Sheryl Crow tweeted: "If the future looks like inaugural poet laureate Amanda Gorman, we are in good shape.

21-01-2021||World||Over 6 million followers and counting: A look at US Vice Prez Kamala Harris’ Twitter handle||Kamala Harris was on Wednesday sworn in as the first female Vice President of the United States by Justice Sonia Sotomayor during a grand inauguration at the West Front of the US Capitol. Harris, 56, who is the 49th Vice President of the US is also the first African-American and Indian-origin woman to hold this position. Leaders from across the globe congratulated her and President Joe Biden and looked forward to strengthening ties with the United States further.After taking the oath, Harris took to Twitter and wrote, “Ready to serve’- which already garnered over 525,000 likes and over 86,000 re-tweets at the time of writing this piece. Her official Twitter handle currently has more than 6 million followers, 778 followings and the bio states: “Vice President of the United States. Wife to the first @SecondGentleman. Momala. Auntie. Fighting for the people.” Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is the first ‘Second Gentlemen’- the first male spouse of a Vice President in the United States. He will use @SecondGentleman account on the social media site from today.Out of the 778 profiles that Harris follows, there are tennis player Serena Williams, actors Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Neil Patrick Harris, Mark Hamill and Chris Evans. She also follows celebrated author Padma Lakshmi and the official handle of The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The tweets on her official handle are majorly focused on the ongoing coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and the impact of the crisis on the American economy, precautions to combat the disease and updates on the number of cases and deaths.Also Read| 'Ready to serve': Kamala Harris' first tweet as US Vice-PresidentKamala Harris was born in Oakland, California in 1964 to an Indian mother and an African-American father from Jamaica. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris- who hailed from Chennai, was a breast cancer researcher and had died of cancer in 2009. While her father, Donald, is a Jamaican American professor of economics. During the US 2020 Presidential campaign trail, Harris often spoke about how her parents would push her in her stroller at civil rights marches.Harris had won her first race for San Francisco district attorney in 2003, becoming the first black female to hold such an office in California. She also became the first black woman to be elected as California attorney general in 2010 and in 2016, she was the only second black woman ever to be elected as a US senator. Before departing as a senator from California, Harris tweeted, ‘ Thank you California—it has been an honor serving as your senator for the past four years. Our country has faced many challenges, but I remain certain that our best days are ahead. I promise to keep standing up for our shared values as your Vice President.”Meanwhile, during Wednesday’s event- Harris and Emhoff, stood on the Capitol steps Wednesday to bid farewell to her predecessor, former Vice President Mike Pence, and his wife, Karen. The two couples stood and talked for a few moments even laughing, on the steps before the Pences got into a vehicle and were driven away.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-6-million-followers-and-counting-a-look-kamala-harris-twitter-handle-101611168868489.html
21-01-2021||World||Biden assumes US presidency with a rousing call to unity||Joseph Robinette Biden Jr took office on Wednesday as the 46th US president, calling for an “end (to) this uncivil war” in a rousing speech that was aimed at uniting a country bitterly divided by his predecessor Donald Trump, and help it overcome challenges posed by Covid-19 pandemic, distrust of each other, and “a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated, and even manufactured”.On a cold and blustery morning on the US Capitol, Kamala Harris was sworn in as Vice-President before Biden, marking a series of firsts that will secure her a unique place in American history as the first woman, African American and American of Indian, South Asian and Asian descent ever elected to the high office that will put her just a heartbeat away from the presidency. She was administered the oath by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice.“Today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause; the cause of democracy, the people, the will of the people, has been heard,” Biden said after being sworn into office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. “On this hallowed ground just a few days ago, violence sought to shake the Capitol’s very foundation. We come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power. As we have for more than two centuries.”The president said, “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, and conservative versus liberal. We can do this. If we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and you really need. And if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes as my mom would say just for a moment. Stand in their shoes.”In a message to the world, President Biden said: “America has been tested, and we’ve come out stronger for it.” He promised to “repair our alliances” and engage with the world once again, not to face yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s challenges”.Biden’s inauguration was nothing like any before. It took place amid unprecedented security with more than 25,000 National Guard troops deployed all around the US Capitol and the White House, with military vehicles, tall wire fences and concrete blocks turning downtown Washington DC into a fortress, in anticipation of “armed protests by pro-Trump supporters who had on January 6 stormed the US Capitol, fired up by Trump’s false claims of election fraud.The Trumps did not attend the inauguration. They were on their way to their adoptive home state of Florida before the ceremony got underway. Former presidents and first ladies Barack Obama and Michelle Obama , George W Bush and Laura Bush and Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton attended the event. Former President Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn Carter did not attend, as they are staying away from public events in recent months because of their advance age and Covid-19. Former Vice-President Dick Cheney and wife Lynne Cheney were also invited but were unable to attend on their doctors’ advice.Trump and Melania Trump took their last ride out of White House on Marne One, the presidential helicopter, at 8:00 am local time as scheduled, not honouring a long-running transfer-of-power ritual of welcoming their successors, President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden. Trump did leave a note for Biden on the Resolute Desk, respecting one part of the ritual at least.In a farewell speech at a military base outside Washington DC, Trump spoke of his achievements and boasted of his 75 million votes in an election he lost convincingly to Biden, by 232-306 in electoral college votes and 7 million in popular votes, which he has refused to acknowledge. “I will be watching; I will be listening. And I will tell you that the future of this country has never been better,” Trump said to a modestly attended event, skipped by most Republicans leaders, including Vice-President Pence, who were mostly all at Biden’s inauguration. “I wish the new administration, great luck and great success. I think they’ll have great success. They have the foundation to do something really spectacular. And again, we put it in a position like it’s never been before.”“We love you,” he said in conclusion. “We will be back in some form.”But the power capital was already coming together, with one of the most divisive US presidents out of the way. Congressional Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy joined Biden and Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer and at a prayer service before the inauguration, and then attended the swearing-in. Vice-President Mike Pence attended the inauguration as well as did Ted Cruz, one of the leading Republican senators to challenge Biden’s election.Biden will get down to work right away, and is expected to sign around a dozen executive orders, which his chief of staff Ronald Klain has said, return the United States to the Paris Agreement on climate change and rescind a travel ban on nationals from certain Muslim-majority countries, reversing some of Trump most controversial orders. Biden will also issue an order mandating masks on federal property and interstate transport, in what has been called a “100 Day Mask Challenge”.Biden arrived from Wilmington, Delaware on Tuesday, and headed to a solemn memorial service at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool for those who died in the Covid-19 pandemic. “To heal, we must remember. And it is hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal,” Biden said in brief remarks, adding, “It is important to do that as a nation.”“Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we have lost,” he said.The Biden inauguration committee, which organised the memorial, installed 400 lights around the pool, each representing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths. They were lit as Biden and Harris spoke.Iconic buildings outside Washington DC, such as the Empire State Building in New York and the Space Needle in Seattle were illuminated similarly as were others across the country.At a brief event in Wilmington, Delaware, before starting for Washington DC, the president-elect got emotional speaking about his journey so far and his eldest son Beau Biden who died of brain cancer in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assumes-us-presidency-with-a-rousing-call-to-unity-101611168860065.html

In 2018, Donald Trump stopped all financial and security aid to Pakistan, citing lack of cooperation in the fight against terrorism.As Biden is now at the helm of US presidency, alliances are likely to be rewritten. In his inauguration speech too, Biden talked about repairing alliances, of leading "not by the example of power but by the power of the example".Biden's defense pick Gen Lloyd Austin has recently expressed his understanding of India and Pakistan. Asked if there had been any change in Pakistan’s cooperation with the US after American security aid was cut off in 2018, Austin replied: “I understand Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-congratulates-joe-biden-mentions-peace-as-joint-agenda-101611167167324.html

21-01-2021||India||5 dead as fire breaks out at Serum facility||Five people were killed in a blaze that ripped through the top floor and partially damaged another floor of a five-storey building at a facility of the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune on Thursday, but the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer said the incident will not hit the production of coronavirus shot Covishield. Officials said at least four people were rescued from SII’s Manjari premises in an operation spanning over an hour to bring the fire under control and save those trapped. They added that the nearest Covishield production and storage units are at least a kilometre away from the under-constructionbuilding that went up in flames. The Maharashtra government ordered a probe into the incident. State health minister Rajesh Tope said initial findings suggested that the fire was caused due to welding work and spread fast due to the presence of inflammatory material on the premises. “We have just received some distressing updates; upon further investigation we have learnt that there has unfortunately been some loss of life at the incident. We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,” SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla tweeted in the evening, a little more than an hour after posting that there were no casualties or major injuries. All of those killed were contractual labourers involved in work related to electricity; two of them from Uttar Pradesh, one from Bihar and two from Pune, according to according to Manjari legislator Chetan Tupe. Their bodies were found on the fifth floor of the building called MSEZ-03. Later in the day, SII announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹25 lakh each for the families of the deceased.“I would like to reassure all governments & the public that there would be no loss of #COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies at @SerumInstIndia. Thank you very much @PuneCityPolice & Fire Department,” Poonawalla said in another tweet. His organisation is manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in India, where the world’s largest inoculation drive began on January 16 thanks to SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s indigenously produced Covaxin. India is also shipping Covishield to its neighbours, strengthening them in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Six countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles and Myanmar – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance. On Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was anguished by the loss of lives. “In this sad hour, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. I pray that those injured recover at the earliest,” he tweeted. Television visuals showed huge plumes of smoke billowing from the building as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze. “Fire at Serum Institute of India in Pune has been brought under control...I have been informed that the Covid vaccine manufacturing plant is safe,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told the media during an interaction at a guest house at Malabar Hill on Mumbai’s suburbs on Thursday evening.Thackeray will visit the Manjari facility on Friday noon, according to Pune district officials.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said directives “have been issued to the Pune police commissioner for a detailed investigation into the incident”. He said a fire audit will be conducted at the building. “(Also) A team of experts will determine the cause (of the fire),” Pawar added.Officials said the five-storey building (ground plus five floors) was planned as an extension to the production facility for rotavirus. It is a part of the Manjari facility, which falls in a special economic zone and is around 15km from Pune, which began functioning in September 2019 as an extension to SII’s Hadapsar facility in the city. The fire broke out at on the fourth and fifth floors of the building and the fire department received a call around 3:50pm, according to Pune fire brigade control room officials. It rushed at least 10 fire-tenders to the spot. The fire was brought under control around 5pm and the bodies were found during a rescue operation around 5:30pm. Embers resurfaced at around 7pm during the cooling process, but the situation was quickly brought under control.“It is the fire experts who will only be able to ascertain the actual cause of the fire,” said Tupe, the local legislator. SII is producing around 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine a month at other facilities in the complex. It also has plans to make up to 50 million doses of a vaccine candidate developed by Novavax Inc from around April. SII, which also makes shots against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella, plans to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a World Health Organisation-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.

21-01-2021||India||IT panel quizzes Facebook, Twitter over data protection||New Delhi: The parliamentary panel on information technology on Thursday quizzed Facebook and Twitter over their data-sharing and protection protocols in the wake of recent changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that have since been deferred , people familiar with the proceedings said. “It was a constructive debate, with all parties agreeing that technology is evolving everyday,” said a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is a constant and persistent challenge and everyone agreed that they need to work together to find a solution.”The panel summoned Facebook, WhatsApp’s parent company, after the latter’s new privacy policy, which stated that the messaging app would mandatorily share data with the social media website, caused a storm. Some of WhatsApp’s users decided to leave the platform. The resulting controversy forced WhatsApp to defer the implementation of its policy from February to April. Experts said the new policy would allow Facebook to collect a vast amount of metadata. The ministry of electronics and information technology has also written to WhatsApp asking it to withdraw the changes. Officials from the ministry were present at the meeting and said that they were keeping tabs on the situation, with the need of the hour being straightening India’s personal data policy. At the meeting, Facebook did not mention whether the policy will be revoked. “They did reassure the panel that individual rights were its priority and asserted that the policy was introduced in 2016. They maintained that the new policy will not infringe on the rights of users and there should be no concerns regarding data sharing.”A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter also faced criticism for doing too little to curb hate speech, the person mentioned above said. Twitter said it takes immediate action when it comes to tackling abusive content. “We appreciate the opportunity of being able to share our views before the Standing Committee on Information Technology. We put the people who use our service first at every step, and have made progress when it comes to making Twitter a safer place,” a Twitter spokesperson said. Interestingly, one of the panel’s members, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey, criticised Twitter for overreach in banning former US President Donald Trump from the platform. “Twitter can’t act as both an intermediary and a publisher, it has to be one or the other,” a second person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. Representatives from WhatsApp also attended the meeting. “We wish to thank the Honorable Parliamentary Committee for giving us an opportunity to appear before them and provide our views. We look forward to assisting the Hon’ble Committee in future as well,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-quizzes-facebook-twitter-over-data-protection-101611253650499.html
21-01-2021||India||‘Construction in our own territory’: China on Arunachal village report||BeijingChina on Thursday dismissed a report that said it had built a village in Arunachal Pradesh, saying the construction activities were within its own territory and its sovereign right.The Chinese foreign ministry was responding to the report based on satellite imagery, which showed rows of houses in Indian territory that has been under Chinese control since 1959, and which is disputed.“First, I would like to tell you that China’s position on the east sector of the China-India boundary, or Zangnan (the southern part of China’s Tibet), is consistent and clear. We have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established on Chinese territory,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing while responding to a question on the report on Thursday.“China’s normal construction on its own territory is entirely a matter of sovereignty,” Hua added.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet opposing New Delhi’s consistent stand that the northeastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India.Using satellite images dated November 1, 2020, television channel NDTV reported the village is located on the banks of the Tsari Chu river, which lies in the area disputed between India and China.The report said the village comprises more than 100 homes; an image dated August 26, 2019, did not show any habitation in the same area.The India-China border dispute covers the 3488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).The report about the new village in Arunachal Pradesh comes amid a military stand-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh, which has lasted for over eight months.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off in eastern Ladakh but no significant headway has been made so far.Earlier this week, Chinese state media said New Delhi was trying to hype news about the village.The Indian media reports were “a blatant attempt to stir up troubles on the China-India border,” Zhang Yongpan, a research fellow of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the tabloid Global Times on Tuesday.The external affairs ministry in India when asked about the development said on Monday that it keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on the country’s security and takes necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.India had stepped up the construction of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges for the improvement of livelihood of its citizens, MEA said.“Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-in-our-own-territory-china-on-arunachal-village-report-101611253590424.html
21-01-2021||India||Army plans to deploy 10,000 troops as LAC reinforcements||NEW DELHI: With a planned and gradual drawdown of soldiers underway in the Northeast ,where the security situation has significantly improved, the Indian Army plans to redeploy up to 10,000 extra troops by the year-end to carry out the force’s primary task --- dealing with the Chinese threat in the eastern sector, people familiar with the development said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. These soldiers are part of a reserve division whose elements can be swiftly marshalled to support front-line troops guarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China to deal with any contingency in the sensitive sector, the people said. While around 3,000 soldiers have already been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties in the Northeast, another 7,000 soldiers are expected to be withdrawn by the year-end, said one of the people cited above. The move will help the army focus on the borders and train for conventional operations, experts said. Several parliamentary panels have made recommendations in their reports to reduce the army’s exposure to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties because it results in blunting the force’s focus on its main task --- defending the country from external aggression. Also, the Kargil Review Committeem (KRC), which tabled its report in Parliament in February 2000, said the army’s role in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties was resulting in the development of a mindset that distracts it from performing its primary role. The KRC underlined the pressing need to evolve a long-term strategy to reduce the army’s role in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations. On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the army was in the process of reducing its footprint in the Northeast to sharpen its focus on external threats. No such drawdown of troops is currently planned in Jammu and Kashmir though, he stressed. The planned pull out of some units from a counter-insurgency role in the Northeast is a good step, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “The security situation is almost completely under control and it can now be handled by the police and central armed police forces. It will enable Eastern Command formations to focus on their primary role along the Northern borders,” he said. With both the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan and LAC being volatile, any reduction in internal security duties would be of great help in effective management of the borders and training for conventional operations, Hooda added. The internal security situation in the Northeast has improved considerably with a large number of insurgent cadres surrendering before the security forces, and successful operations carried out last year. Compared to 2018, there was a 40% increase in the apprehension of insurgents last year, a 60% decline in violent incidents and a140% increase in seizure of contraband, resulting in choking the supply of funds, according to government data accessed by Hindustan Times. “There has been a progressive decline in violence over a period of time. However, continued efforts are needed to achieve the desired level of peace, especially in Manipur, Nagaland and south Arunachal Pradesh,” said a second official. More troops will be withdrawn when the situation further stabilises in these states. Excellent coordination with Myanmar (Op Sunrise) has also made it hard for Indian insurgent groups to set up camps and operate from there, said a third official. However, one concern that remains is that the cadre strength of valley-based insurgent groups (VBIGs) in Manipur remains intact, he said. “The current focus of all stakeholders is primarily on the ongoing Naga peace talks,” said a fourth official. On the situation in Assam, he said the army had gradually started disengaging from the counter-insurgency grid in lower Assam and begun handing over the operational responsibility to the state government. “A comprehensive view of the security situation in lower Assam is being taken post the Bodoland Territorial Council elections that were held in December 2020 and a decision on disengagement of remaining forces will also be deliberated upon subsequently,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-plans-to-deploy-10-000-troops-as-lac-reinforcements-101611253350932.html
21-01-2021||India||Delhi HC refuses to stay Netflix premiere of ‘The White Tiger’||The Delhi high court on Thursday refused to stay the release of Priyanka Chopra-starrer ‘The White Tiger’ on Over the Top (OTT) platform Netflix on January 22.Hours before the release of the movie based on the Booker Prize winning novel of the same name written by Aravind Adiga, the court dismissed an urgent plea to injunct the makers and Netflix from premiering the movie, which also stars Rajkummar Rao and Adarsh Gourav in central roles.Justice C Hari Shankar dismissed an application by John N Hart Jr, an American film and theatre producer who had bought the copyright from Adiga for the movie adaptation in March, 2009.The court held that Hart Jr and others were “no stranger” to the production and release of the movie and that they have approached the court at the “nth” hour despite knowing about the making of the movie since the last one and half years.The judge came down heavily on Hart Jr and others for their concealment of certain documents and agreements which they had signed with the producers and the makers.After an urgent hearing on Thursday evening, the court said that postponement of the film will have larger ramifications on the producers, directors and actors since finances are involved.“You cannot blame the Coronavirus pandemic for your delay in coming to the court. You are coming at the nth hour and you are disentitled for the relief even on this ground,” the judge remarked.The court was hearing an injunction suit filed by Hart and his associate Sonia Mudbhatkal, a filmmaker, who had said that the movie makers infringed their copyright which they had got after giving a lot of money to the original author Adiga.Appearing for them, senior counsel Kapil Sankha said that Hart Jr had thought of a magnum opus like Slumdog Millionaire and he would be emotionally and financially shattered if the movie is released.He said that since he was in America, he did not have any clue about the making or release of the movie in India. He said that they had expected that the movie would not move due to the pandemic.Countering his submissions, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, for the producer, said that Mudbhatkal had sent a legal notice in October 2019, raising objections to the movie and a reply was given within a few days. However, till now, no objection has been raised and plaintiffs have come at the last moment.He said that there would be huge ramifications as a gamut of stakeholders are involved in the process even if the release is online. The court agreed to his submission.Appearing for Netflix, senior advocate Sai Rajagopal told the court that the movie has already been released in the US on January 11, 2021 and no objection was raised by the plaintiffs. He also said that the makers had gone ahead only after one of the plaintiffs, Mudbhatkal, had signed an agreement with them.The court took umbrage at concealment of documents by Hart Jr and turned down the plea for stalling its release.It, however, kept the suit pending and asked the makers of 'The White Tiger' to maintain the account of profit from the movie. The case will now come up before a registrar on March 22 for completion of pleadings and paper work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-refuses-to-stay-netflix-premiere-of-the-white-tiger-101611252431660.html
21-01-2021||India||The community dogs of Dhanbad: pampered, protected, proud||They recognise his white car from a distance. Almost as if they can read the number plate. Observant, hopeful eyes light up at its sight. “Aye, aye” (come, come) Anutosh Bagchi tells them in Bangla, signalling them to gather. They show up from different directions, excited to break bread together. Kalu, Kalia, Sheru, Chhota Sheru…they know their names well and respond with respect and affection. This is how the “community dogs of Dhanbad” begin their day. “Our dogs are well fed and they are well behaved, too. We don’t address them as strays,” says Bagchi, who lives in the Coal Capital of India situated in Jharkhand. The 71-year-old general manager of Skylark Hotel leaves from home a little early every morning to ensure the dogs get their share of fish and rice laddoos on time. The dogs are fed once again in the evening by members of Bagchi’s animal lovers group.The group of ten members came into being when the pandemic struck. “In the initial few days of the lockdown, one didn’t realise what animals were going through. With dhabas shut, there was suddenly no one to give them leftovers. That’s when we got into action and formed this group, connecting to members via Whatsapp,” shares Bagchi.The city was divided into various zones with one person heading each. “Soon, we included even a few cows and oxen in our feeding program, along from cats, dogs and birds,” says Bagchi. Oxen and cows are fed gud, choker and kutti (cattle feed). “We realised what a challenge it was for these big animals to keep their stomach full. Thus abandoned oxen and cows in the city became a part of the feeding initiative,” he shares.Cultivating compassion Bagchi has also started organising sensitisation classes across the city to encourage people to do their bit for animals. “We want to reduce the human-animal conflict. I come across instances of mischievous people pelting stones on dogs or beating them with sticks mercilessly for no reason. This leads to aggression in them. Hunger is also a big trigger. It’s a battle for survival. As long as you give them love and feed them, they don’t pose any threat to humans,” he says. Bagchi and his team conduct sensitisation meetings in various localities across the city to pass this message. “We go to clubs, schools and play grounds where we talk to children and their parents as well as grandparents and show them videos explaining dos and don’ts of taking care of dogs living in the community,” he says.“Dogs are quick to learn and inherently compassionate. Once they are assured of food, love and care, they start trusting you and treat you with 100 times more love and care,” says the animal lover.Greeting passers-by with exuberant tail wagging in the daytime, the loyal community doggos are always willing to play chowkidaars as night falls, guarding localities from suspicious elements, he says. Bagchi’s group is also getting the dogs sterilized through non-invasive methods. “Female dogs are given oral contraceptives during the estrous cycle . This is quite an effective measure that our group is carrying out to control the population of dogs,” he says. No one’s a stray hereBaghchi also corrects people when they use the terms stray or street dogs. “If you address dogs with such terms, you are likely to mistreat them. They are community dogs. If they live with us, they are a part of our community. Let’s give them the place they deserve,” says Bagchi whose group has been taking care of some 10,000 dogs in Dhanbad.Bagchi’s four-legged friends are grateful for all the love. There’s no growling and teeth gnashing for food. They wait for their turn to be fed patiently, for they know there’s enough meal for everyone. They are the community dogs of Dhanbad. Pampered, protected, proud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-community-dogs-of-dhanbad-protected-pampered-proud-101611252091593.html
21-01-2021||India||SC upholds bail for Azam Khan, wife and son in forgery case||The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the Uttar Pradesh government’s appeal challenging the bail granted to Samajwadi Party Member of Parliament Mohammad Azam Khan in a case of alleged forgery of his son’s birth certificate.His son, Abdullah Azam Khan is a member of UP Legislative Assembly from Suar constituency.Azam Khan’s wife Tazeen Fatima and son are also accused in the forgery case. The Allahabad High Court had granted bail to the trio on October 13 last year against which the UP Government approached the top court. Although Abdulla and Tazeen were immediately released, Azam Khan was released after police had recorded the statement of the complainant in the case.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah dismissed the state’s appeal as it noted that the order was limited to grant of bail. The Allahabad High Court had further directed the three accused persons not to tamper with the prosecution evidence by intimidating the witnesses during investigation and cooperate during the trial.The state represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta pointed out the concern of the state that the grant of bail should not have a bearing on trial. The bench agreed to make that clarification. In its final order.“The special leave petitions are dismissed. We make it clear that any observation made in the impugned order shall have no bearing in trial since it was only with regard to granting bail.”It was in February 2020, Khan had surrendered along with his wife and son in a Rampur court in the alleged forgery case. The case against the Rampur MP and his family was lodged on a complaint by one Akash Saxena in 2019.Saxena had alleged that Azam Khan and his wife secured two birth certificates for Abdulllah. One was issued by Nagar Palika Parishad, Rampur on January 28, 2012 while the other was issued on April 21, 2015 from Nagar Nigam, Lucknow.According to the state government, the matter was serious as Abdullah used the fake birth certificate to contest the Assembly elections which he won. In December 2019, the Allahabad High Court had set aside his election following which in February 2020, the UP Legislative Assembly disqualified him from membership of the House and declared his seat vacant.The matter is being separately contested by Abdullah in the Supreme Court which had in November last year stayed holding fresh election for the Suar Assembly seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-bail-for-azam-khan-his-son-and-wife-in-forgery-case-101611250150731.html
21-01-2021||India||India lodges protest after fishermen die in crash with Sri Lankan naval craft||India on Thursday lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over the death of three fishermen from Tamil Nadu in a collision between their vessel and a Lankan naval craft, saying Colombo should take steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.Four fishermen from Ramanathapuram district in Tamil Nadu had been reported missing on January 19. They were out fishing in a mechanised boat along with many other vessels from the same area. The Sri Lankan Navy initially said an Indian boat, with four fishermen on board, sank when patrol vessels sought to apprehend it with other fishing boats that were allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters.“We are shocked at the unfortunate loss of lives of three Indian fishermen and one Sri Lankan national following a collision between their vessel and a Sri Lankan naval craft,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.“Our strong protest in regard to this incident was conveyed by our high commissioner to the Sri Lankan foreign minister (on Thursday). A strong demarche was also made to the Sri Lankan acting high commissioner in New Delhi,” it said.The Indian side expressed “deep anguish at the loss of lives” and emphasised the need to deal with issues related to fishermen in a humanitarian manner, the statement said.“Existing understandings between the two governments in that regard must be strictly observed. Utmost efforts should be made to ensure that there is no recurrence,” it said.According to media reports, the bodies of the four fishermen were recovered in the Palk Strait by the Sri Lankan navy.The issue triggered protests by fishermen in Tamil Nadu on Thursday. Tamil Nadu chief minister EK Palaniswami announced compensation of ₹10 lakh each for the families of the fishermen and accused the Sri Lankan navy of destroying the livelihood of fishermen from the state.External affairs minister S Jaishankar had raised the issues of Indian fishermen during a visit to Sri Lanka this month. The bilateral joint working group on fisheries recently discussed outstanding issues were discussed, and Jaishankar said the Indian side was looking forward to the “early return” of fishermen detained in Sri Lanka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-lodge-protest-after-fishermen-die-in-collision-with-sri-lankan-naval-craft-101611248006952.html
21-01-2021||India||On eve of PM Modi’s visit, TMC, BJP face-off in Bengal over Netaji’s birthday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Kolkata on January 23 to celebrate Subhash Chandra Bose’s birthday as Parakram Diwas, or day of valour, is intended to woo Bengal’s voters before the crucial assembly polls, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) said on Thursday while the state government announced that it will celebrate the day as Desh Nayak Diwas, or day of the national hero.The Bengal government also appealed to people through televised advertisements to blow conch shells at 12.15 pm, the time of Bose’s birth in 1897. Both the Centre and the state have decided to organise various programmes till Bose’s 125th birthday next year.The Forward Bloc, which Bose formed in 1939, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the other hand said they would celebrate January 23 as Desh Prem Diwas, or day of patriotism, as declared by the erstwhile Left Front government in 2010.Despite the TMC and the Left parties’ demand that January 23 be declared a national holiday and designated after the names they had chosen, the Modi government declared on January 19 that the day will be celebrated as Parakram Diwas but remained silent on the demand for declaration of a national holiday.This is the first time since the BJP came to power at the Centre that PM Modi will be celebrating the iconic freedom fighter’s birthday in Kolkata. He will attend two programmes, at the National Library and the Victoria Memorial Hall, during his day-long visit.“This is a publicity stunt and politically motivated. The BJP is utterly confused. It is worshipping Gandhi as well as his killer (Nathuram Godse). It is worshipping Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who wanted to ban the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Is the BJP even aware that its founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee opposed every move of Subhash Chandra Bose? It is only to woo Bengal’s voters that the BJP is praising Rammohan Roy, Vidyasagar and other legendary figures,” said Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy.BJP state vice-president Ritesh Tiwari criticised the TMC for being narrow-minded.“It is the Modi government that gave proper recognition to the Azad Hind movement that Netaji (as Bose is popularly known) had begun. Nobody did it in decades. It celebrated Gandhi Jayanti amid nationwide fanfare in 2019. Mamata Banerjee should remember that the Congress, to which she originally belonged, was led by Jawaharlal Nehru, who never recognised Bose’s sacrifice and patriotism,” said Ritesh Tiwari.TMC leaders said they had no information whether the chief minister would attend the Prime Minister’s programmes on Saturday although she has been invited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-eve-of-pm-modi-s-visit-tmc-bjp-face-off-in-bengal-over-netaji-s-birthday-101611248783963.html

We look forward to assisting the Hon’ble Committee in future as well," the spokesperson said as quoted by news agency ANI.The committee met the officials of Twitter and Facebook and the ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to hear their views on safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social and online news media platforms.The meeting was held at 4pm today, according to ANI.The Centre recently asked WhatsApp to withdraw its new privacy policy which had led to a global outcry about privacy protection and resulted in thousands of users switching to other online messaging platforms like Signal and Telegram.WhatsApp, however, has assured that they do not expand its ability to share user data with its parent company Facebook and is working to address the "misinformation" that was being spread about its privacy norms.“We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses...” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.The app promises end-to-end encryption which means that no third party, even WhatsApp itself, would be unable to access someone's personal chats.The company delayed the implementation of its new privacy policy from January 16 to May 15 after massive global backlash resulting in thousands switching over to other online messaging platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-thanks-parliamentary-committee-after-meeting-on-data-privacy-101611246128738.html

"They had no reply," said a member.The member also claimed that company representative agreed that data was being monetised.The committee interacted separately with representatives of Facebook, Twitter and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.After the meeting, a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement, "We wish to thank the Honorable Parliamentary Committee for giving us an opportunity to appear before them and provide our views. We look forward to assisting the Hon'ble Committee in future as well."In a strongly-worded letter to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology had earlier this week said the proposed changes to the WhatsApp Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, without giving users an option to opt-out, "raise grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens".The letter noted that with over 400 million users in India, the changes will have a disproportionate impact on the country's citizens.WhatsApp had earlier this month begun asking its 2 billion users worldwide to accept an update of its privacy policy if they want to keep using the popular messaging app. The new terms caused an outcry among technology experts, privacy advocates and users and triggered a wave of defections to rival services such as Signal and Telegram.In the updated policy, it got a right to share data it collected from WhatsApp users with the broader Facebook network, which includes Instagram, regardless of owning any accounts or profiles there. Some businesses, as per the new policy, were to use Facebook-owned servers to store messages.This triggered an outcry regardless of WhatsApp's assertion that all private messages between friends and family members remain end-to-end encrypted.WhatsApp had on January 16 delayed the introduction of the new privacy policy to May 15 after user backlash over sharing of user data and information with the parent company, Facebook Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliamentary-panel-members-concerned-over-whatsapp-s-proposed-privacy-policy-101611247806665.html

A profile that has either a verified email address or a phone number, a profile image or display name.> It has sent automated email and notifications to users who are at the risk of losing the blue ticks. They have been asked to make changes to their profiles by January 22.> Accounts which have repeatedly violated Twitter rules are also at the risk of losing verification.> How to apply for verification? It will be processed using both automation and human review. Go to your account settings page. You will find the option of request verification. "The process will include asking applicants to select a category for their verified status and confirming their identity via links and other supporting materials," Twitter said.> "We also plan to give people the option to share demographic information after completing the new verification application so that we can better measure and improve the equity of our verification process," Twitter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-to-restart-giving-blue-ticks-from-january-22-all-you-need-to-know-101611247298167.html

One cannot afford to have operational voids when the enemy is at the gate,” Naravane said. He said dependence on imported military hardware could create vulnerabilities during a crisis, and self-reliance in the defence sector was a “strategic necessity.”“It is imperative for us to invest in building long-term indigenous capabilities for application across the entire spectrum of conflict,” he said.The army also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM) to power the indigenisation drive in the defence sector and reduce dependence on imported military hardware.“Increasing security challenges due to India's rising stature in the international community, apart from unresolved borders and revisionist adversaries have led to Indian Army being embroiled in protracted conflicts such as insurgencies and proxy wars. Continuous and concerted capability building of the army through modernisation to address these security challenges is a national imperative,” the army chief said.He said the Covid-19 pandemic had exposed the fragility of global supply chains and self-reliance was the only way to insulate the military from such disruptions.Enabling policy measures, swift decision making and speeding up timelines for delivery have induced a new sense of direction and there is a strong Make in India traction in many major areas such as combat vehicles, guns, rockets, ammunition, missiles, radars and electronic warfare systems, he said.He said defence exports had witnessed a seven-fold increase in three years and concerted actions by manufacturers and facilitation by industry associations will help the country achieve the $5 billion export target by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lagging-a-little-in-military-modernisation-compared-to-adversaries-army-chief-101611245913546.html

We found that names of all faculty members (assistant professor and above) and college staff are missing from the portal,” said NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh.NMCH's principal Dr Hiralal Mahto has flagged the issue with Patna civil surgeon.“We have asked the NMCH to send us its list once again so that we can re-verify and re-load the names of those missing from the portal,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh.Asked how long it would take for the process to be completed on the portal, Dr Singh said, “Let’s hope for the best”.The NMCH has been struggling to reach vaccination targets. It achieved 31% target on day one (January 16), 28% on day two (January 18), 11% on January 19 and 40% on Thursday.“Though it should not have happened, these are IT issues and sometimes technical glitches do take place. We will re-load the names of those missing from the portal,” said executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, who is also the state nodal officer for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/names-800-health-care-workers-go-missing-from-co-win-portal-in-bihar-101611244718216.html

For uninterrupted performance of different Nitis of the deities inside the temple, it is suggested that all Sevayats and their families may please be vaccinated on a priority basis. Further, there are 500 temple officials who may also be vaccinated on priority,” the letter said. The decision for quick vaccination of priests and temples officials was discussed in the Chhatisa Nijog meeting of the temple.On Thursday, the Jagannath Temple administration waived off the requirement of a Covid-19 negative report for devotees, but made wearing of masks mandatory for those entering the shrine.Odisha on Thursday exceeded its target of Covid-19 vaccination by inoculating 44,880 frontline health workers against a target of 37,076 as the vaccinators in 20 of the 30 districts managed to surpass the target. Till now more than 1.12 lakh health workers have been vaccinated while the target is 3.92 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puris-jagannath-temple-administrators-seek-early-vaccination-for-priests-staff-101611243668527.html

The Raj Bhavan in Chennai said that an official communication would follow after receiving information from solicitor general Tushar Mehta."Our part is over, it is up to the governor and the Centre now," said AIADMK leader and law minister C Ve Shunmugam.For more than a decade, political parties and activists have been demanding the release of the convicts - Nalini Sriharan, V Sriharan alias Murugan, AG Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran. It gained momentum with elections nearing and a series of observations by the top court after it expressed unhappiness, earlier over the recommendation for remission of sentence of Perarivalan pending with Purohit for more than two years.Perarivalan's mother Arputham Ammal who has been fighting for his release on Thursday tweeted that she hoped the government would release her son.The DMK and AIADMK have concurred on the convicts’ release but continue to tussle over who is responsible for their delayed freedom. Though the Gandhi family and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul and daughter Priyanka have forgiven the convicts, the state and central Congress leadership has been in disagreement over convicts’ release.DMK’s ally Congress in Tamil Nadu too has opposed political parties demanding their release stating that they will accept the decision of the court. Dalit party Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), also in alliance with the DMK and Congress, have been closely involved with the case.In 2019, VCK leaders accompanied Perarivalan’s mother Arputham Ammal to meet union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. “With the court’s intervention, the governor doesn’t have too many options and he is unlikely to reject Perarivalan’s plea as it would create political problems in the state and affect the AIADMK-BJP alliance,” said VCK’s leader and MP Ravikumar.In 2014, the top court commuted the death penalty of Perarivalan and two other convicts (Murugan and Santhan) to life sentences. In 2015, Perarivalan applied for pardon to the governor. In 2018, Tamil Nadu government had recommended the release of Perarivalan after remitting his life sentence. The same year, the cabinet had also unanimously recommended remission for the seven convicts under provision of Article 161.“We have been demanding that the AIADMK government do this since 2014 when J Jayalalithaa was the chief minister and they eventually did it in 2018 but haven’t been able to pressurise the governor to act,” said DMK spokesperson A Saravanan.In November, DMK president MK Stalin met Purohit urging him to release the seven prisoners on ‘humanitarian grounds’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-on-release-of-rajiv-gandhi-killers-in-3-4-days-supreme-court-told-101611243999623.html

He is expected to take up his assignment shortly, the ministry said.India first posted a dedicated ambassador to ASEANin 2014 following the elevation of ties between the two sides to a strategic partnership and in view of growing cooperation in areas ranging from security to trade.Pakistan had said in September last year that Khobragade was too senior for the post of deputy chief of mission in Islamabad.The Indian and Pakistani missions in the two national capitals have been headed by the deputy chiefs of mission since August 2019, when Pakistan asked India to withdraw the then high commissioner as part of a slew of retaliatory actions in response to India’s decision to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status.The Indian side had proposed Khobragade’s name in June 2020, days before New Delhi asked Islamabad to reduce the strength of its high commission by 50%. The move had triggered a reciprocal decision by the Pakistani side.Khobragade had earlier served on deputation with the Department of Atomic Energy since 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jayant-khobragade-named-india-s-next-envoy-to-asean-secretariat-101611242792074.html

21-01-2021||India||Six shooters involved in murder of Mukhtar Ansari’s aide, say Lucknow police||Six shooters were present at the crime scene when Ajit Singh, henchman of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, was shot dead near Kathauta crossing in Lucknow on the evening of January 6, senior police officials said on Thursday after the arrest of one of the shooters.Ajit Singh’s accomplice Mohar Singh was injured in the shooting.Lucknow joint commissioner of police (JCP), law and order, Nilabja Choudhury said the arrested shooter was identified as Sandip Singh alias Baba, 42, who is a history-sheeter of Chanduali district and wanted in a 2006 murder case of Kerakat in Jaunpur.He said a reward of ₹10,000 was declared on Baba in the same case in 2018 and that he has a long criminal record since 1998 with 15 criminal cases, including four murders and two attempt to murder, registered against him.Choudhury said Baba was arrested Thursday from his Ambedkarnagar hideout where he had reached by a roadways bus after the assassination.He said during interrogation Baba revealed that Ajit Singh was killed at the behest of two gangsters Dhruv Kumar Singh alias Kuntoo Singh and Akhand Singh who are now lodged in Azamgarh jail.The police officer also said that Baba further said Ajit Singh was key witness against Kuntoo Singh in the murder case of former MLA Sarvesh Singh alias Sipu Singh of Azamgarh in 2013. He said Ajit was gunned down as he refused to turn hostile in the case despite multiple threats.A senior police official privy to the investigation, said there were two teams of shooters, with one being the backup in case the first team failed or faced any problem in executing the crime.“Other than Baba, five others including Kanhaiya Vishwakarma alias Girdhari Sharma, Ravi Yadav, Shivendra Singh alias Ankur, Bunty alias Viru alias Mustafa and Rajesh Tomar alias Jai were present at the crime scene. One of their facilitators named Bandhan was present at some distance from the spot in a car, which was later used by four shooters to reach a flat in Alakhnanda Apartments in Gomti Nagar Extension,” Choudhury said.“One pistol and five cartridges have been recovered from the flat on revelation made by Baba,” he said.The JCP said one of the shooters Rajesh Tomar had suffered bullet injury in retaliatory firing by Ajit Singh’s accomplice Mohar Singh and was initially treated at the same flat by a Lucknow doctor with the help of Vipul Kumar Singh (now named facilitator) and was later taken to a Sultanpur hospital for treatment.Another police official said the four shooters executed the crime while two shooters were present at some distance from the spot as a backup team. “The main shooter Girdhari Sharma and Ravi Yadav had left separately on two-wheelers after the incident while the four others reached the bus stand and later escaped in the car driven by Bandhan.’Baba is the second shooter to have been arrested in the case after Girdhari was nabbed in Delhi earlier. Efforts are on to arrest the remaining four shooters and other facilitators involved in the crime.The JCP said a reward of ₹25,000 each has been announced for the remaining four shooters and two facilitators -- Bandhan and Vipul Kumar Singh.Lucknow Commissioner of Police (CP) DK Thakur said a former MP is still under the scanner for possible involvement since it was on his call the Sultanpur doctor got the injured shooter admitted to his hospital and treated him for two days. He said one of the facilitators Vipul Kumar Singh is a close aide of the former MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-shooters-involved-in-murder-of-mukhtar-ansari-s-aide-say-lucknow-police-101611241738243.html

This is at the people’s level, it is the public who are suffering the most from Covid-19," said Nepal's Minister for Health and Population Hridayesh Tripathi.I thank Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji as well as the Government and people of India for the generous grant of one million doses of COVID vaccine to Nepal at this critical time when India is rolling out vaccination for it's own people. pic.twitter.com/uO7qQpLiSxThe gesture comes at a time that India's ties with Nepal have been strained by a territorial dispute and Indian concern over China's expanding political and economic influence in the Himalayan nation sandwiched between the Asian giants.China, which had promised Nepal help to deal with the pandemic, is awaiting Nepali clearance for its Sinopharm shots."We've asked them to submit more documents and information before we give them the approval," said Santosh K.C., spokesman for Nepal's department of drug administration.Chinese rivalryBangladesh was supposed to get 110,000 doses of vaccine free from Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, but Bangladesh refused to contribute towards the development cost of the vaccine leading to a deadlock.Bangladesh has instead turned to India for urgent supplies and on Thursday was due to receive 2 million shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a gift from India.Also Read: India sends 3 mn vaccine doses to Bangladesh, Nepal. China steps in for Pakistan"India is making the AstraZeneca vaccine which makes all the difference. It can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated temperatures and countries like Bangladesh have that facility," a Bangladesh health official said.Meanwhile, India's arch-rival Pakistan on Thursday thanked China, its close strategic ally, for a pledge to provide half a million doses of the vaccine free of charge by the end of the month.India for years has struggled to match the pace of Chinese investment in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives, where China is building ports, roads and power stations as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.But the demand for vaccines in these countries desperate to revive their tourism-dependent economies has offered Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government a way to claw back ground, diplomats say.India is considering giving away anything from 12 million to 20 million shots to its neighbours in the first wave of assistance over the next three to four weeks, one government source said.India is also helping with the training of health workers in some of these countries and the setting up of the infrastructure to administer the shots, the source said."It's a well-crafted, calibrated series of actions you are seeing, they confirm the validity of our 'neighbourhood first' policy," said a former Indian ambassador, Rajiv Bhatia."It plays to our strengths in science and pharma, and this is our moment to shine."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccine-diplomacy-in-south-asia-pushes-back-against-china-101611241255109.html

"The total number of persons found infected with the UK strain of Covid-19 is 145," the ministry said on Thursday.Those infected by the virus have been kept in single room isolation in designated health care facilities by respective state governments, officials had said earlier.The close contacts of the infected individuals have also been put under quarantine, the health ministry said. Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on, the ministry said.The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium) labs.The B.1.1.7 variant genome, which is much more infectious, has prompted comprehensive contact tracing for co-travellers, family members and others of those who have travelled to the UK in the last two monthsys.From November 25 to the midnights of December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK, the government said. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to RT-PCR tests to detect the presence of the new variant.The government took cognisance of the reports of the virus reported from the UK and said it has put in place a proactive and preventive strategy to detect and contain the mutant variant.This strategy included temporary suspension of all flights coming from the UK from December 23 to January 7 and mandatory RT-PCR test for all UK-returnees.The samples of all those found positive in the RT-PCR test will be genome sequenced by a consortium of 10 government labs.Countries like Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore have also reported cases of the new variant so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-strain-infects-145-people-in-india-situation-under-careful-watch-says-govt-101611240426853.html

As we rise in our stature and influence, we will face increasingly higher security challenges," he said at the seminar organised by the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM).Referring to increasing security challenges along India's unresolved Northern borders, he said a continuous and concerted capability building of the Army through modernisation to address these security challenges is a national imperative.Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a tense standoff in eastern Ladakh for over eight months.The Chief of Army Staff said India was lagging behind slightly considering the quick pace of defence modernisation being undertaken by its adversaries, and called upon the indigenous industry to invest in research and development to boost the country's overall military capabilities."The continuous and heavy dependence of the armed forces on equipment of foreign origin needs to be addressed in the right earnest through indigenous capability development and towards meeting the modern day defence requirements," he said."The defence industry is a big enabler for self reliance and capability building and it is a prerequisite to maintain our strategic influence and freedom of action," Gen Naravane said.He further said: "We are committed to procuring indigenous equipment and weapon systems as nothing is more motivating for any army then to fight and win its wars with indigenous technologies and weapons."Encouraging the private industry to take advantage of the government's reform measures to boost domestic defence production, he said the Army was strongly committed to support them."Our external dependence for weapons and ammunition creates vulnerabilities during times of crisis. However, in the past few years, we have tried to reverse this trend by boosting indigenisation and focusing on dual purpose high-end technology." he added."It may be noted that 75 percent of our priority one projects in the 13th Army plan, costing over ₹1,50,000 crore are supporting efforts towards the Make in India programme," Gen Naravane said.At the seminar, an MoU was signed between the Indian Army and the SIDM that will provide for further impetus to indigenisation under the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative. This MoU was signed on the occasion of 25 years of Army-industry partnership with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)m officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-face-higher-security-challenges-in-line-with-rising-stature-naravane-101611240755277.html

On Thursday, the doctors said he was fit to be discharged.Only a few lung transplants on Covid-19 patients have been performed across the world and the minister’s critical condition necessitated the procedure.“This is different from a regular lung transplant, which is commonly done, as these are the sickest of patients who have been on a ventilator for months,” said Dr KR Balakrishnan, who performed the surgery and is chairman-director, cardiac sciences and director of the Heart and Lung Transplant, MGM Healthcare. “The patients are on ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and have been given tons of steroids, several drugs and sedation. They have profound muscle weakness where they haven’t even moved their fingertips. Even if we change the lung; it takes a long time to rehabilitate them,” he added.Sitting in his hospital room, Mahto spoke to reporters via video link, “I’m well and wish to come back soon to serve the people of Jharkhand.”The 54-year-old minister was infected by the coronavirus in October and was admitted to a Ranchi hospital where he was on ventilator. Mahto also had comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease.The Jharkhand government contacted the Chennai hospital who flew a team that brought him to Chennai in an air ambulance. “He was unconscious for a week,” said Dr Balakrishanan. Mahto was tracheostomized on October 28 last year. The fibrosis had severely damaged the cells of his lungs that there was no gas exchange possible. When his CT scan did not show any improvement, he was enlisted under the lung transplant program. “This patient was kept alive for more than a month by an external machine and because Tamil Nadu has such an excellent system of organ donation and distribution, he fortunately received a good pair of lungs,” said Dr Balakrishnan.Mahto underwent a bilateral lung transplant on November 10.“The transplanted lungs were functioning normally and he started breathing spontaneously,” said Dr Suresh Rao, co-director, heart and lung transplantation. “After the lung transplant, a bronchoscopy was done to check if anastomosis was perfect.”Mahto met guidelines prescribed for lung transplants in Covid-19 patients - which is the person should be under the age of 65, fully conscious and no other organ should have been affected. The hospital has done bilateral lung transplants on eight other Covid-19 patients. As the virus affects both sides, a single lung transplant isn’t done.The surgery was done while the patient was on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine. Both the chest cavities were opened, the old lungs were taken out and replaced one by one with the donor lungs. “Technically the lung transplant is a straightforward operation though the Covid situation makes it challenging because the lungs are badly stuck so they tend to bleed a lot more,” said Balakrishnan. “Managing the patients is more complicated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-jharkhand-minister-recovers-after-double-lung-transplant-in-chennai-101611239581351.html

21-01-2021||India||Supreme Court grants bail to Kannada actor accused of drug peddling||The Supreme Court on Thursday granted bail to Kannada actor Ragini Dwivedi who is accused of arranging sale and consumption of drugs at rave parties.The Court, on a prima facie reading of the evidence produced by the prosecution, Karnataka Police, concluded that at best the actress could be found guilty of consuming drugs for which the maximum punishment under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act Section 27 is one year's imprisonment.The order came as a big relief to the 30-year-old actor who was arrested in September last year and has been in custody for over 140 days. On November 3, 2020, the Karnataka High Court had dismissed Ragini’s bail plea along with that of her co-accused.Ordering her release, a bench of justices RF Nariman, Navin Sinha and KM Joseph noted that the charges against her of possession, sale and purchase of commercial quantity of drugs punishable under Section 21(a) of NDPS Act with 10 years or more was “prima facie” not made out.The Court noted three arguments to support this conclusion as pointed out by Ragini’s counsel and senior advocate Sidharth Luthra. He stated that pursuant to search of the petitioner’s residence, no drugs were found by police and the entire case against her rested on the statement of a co-accused BK Ravishankar. At best, Luthra told the Court that the petitioner could be faulted for consuming drugs at rave parties. In addition to these grounds, the bench further noted that the charge of criminal conspiracy between the actress and other drug peddlers for sale of drugs was found to be “tenuous” by the High Court.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the state government informed the Court that investigation of the case was still on as the charge sheet was yet to be filed. He told the Court that the petitioner was in regular contact with drug peddlers and such contraband was sold at rave parties organized by her.The bench told Mehta that their view was only “prima facie” and said that similarly placed persons who are accused in this case would get benefit of this judgment. The Court added a line that the observations made in this judgment will not hamper investigation of the case and will not be used to influence trial.Twelve people including Ragini were named in a FIR registered in September 2020 by the Cottonpet police station in Bengaluru. The Crime Branch which began investigation in the case had arrested two actors – Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjana Galrani and other persons linked with the film industry in connection with supply and consumption of drugs. Sanjana had obtained bail in December on medical grounds.The single judge bench of the Karnataka High Court while dismissing bail to Ragini had said, “The very purpose of participation of accused Nos. 2 (Ragini) and 14 (Sanjana) was to attract a large number of consumers as they are celebrities. The materials so far collected by the investigating officer show that accused Nos. 2 and 14 are not only consumers but also sellers and facilitators.”The state police had found a diary from Ragini’s possession where she disclosed that on her birthday party, she consumed cocaine with Ravishankar and offered to sell it to a witness for ₹5,000 per gram. Another witness had stated to have paid three lakh rupees to accused no.14 towards purchase of drugs. The police had also begun investigations into the financial wealth amassed by the two actors through sale of drugs at parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-bail-to-kannada-actor-accused-of-drug-peddling-101611237438667.html

Abbas Siddiqui is a new player. But it is hard to do anything in just three months. He won’t be able to do anything. If he manages to snatch even a single vote of the TMC it would help the BJP. Now he will have to decide whether it would in any way help the minority. We believe the minorities are with the TMC and will remain so,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.Significantly, other members of the Siddiqui family, especially Toha Siddiqui, the most prominent among the elders and whose support had helped the CPI(M) and TMC in the past had criticized Abbas’ foray into politics and had even maintained silence on Owaisi’s visit.Furfura Sharif is built around the mausoleum of Pir Abu Bakr Siddiqui. It also has a mosque built in 1375. Furfura Sharif draws millions from across the country during the Urs festival and the annual fair dedicated to the Pir.Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01% during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30% now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/popular-muslim-cleric-abbas-siddiqui-floats-new-political-party-in-bengal-101611236598916.html

21-01-2021||India||In a first, Hawk-i aircraft fires smart anti-airfield weapon off Odisha coast||Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday announced that a Hawk-i aircraft successfully fired a Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon (SAAW) for the first time off the coast of Odisha, in what is being seen as a significant boost to an upgrade programme for the Hawk advanced jet trainer operated by the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy.The SAAW is a precision strike weapon that can be used to target enemy airfield assets such as radars, bunkers, taxi tracks and runways. Indigenously developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s Research Centre Imarat, the weapon has a range of 100 km. It has been test-fired from the IAF’s Jaguar fighter planes.It is the first smart weapon to be fired from an Indian Hawk Mk132 trainer aircraft. The Hawk-i project (or upgraded Hawk) seeks to equip the trainer jet with combat capabilities through an internally-funded HAL programme. HAL is in talks with the IAF and navy for the weaponisation of their Hawks, officials said.“HAL has been focusing on the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign. The company-owned Hawk-i platform is being extensively used for certification of systems and weapons developed indigenously by DRDO and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research labs,” HAL chairman R Madhavan said.The plane was flown by HAL test pilots Wing Commanders (retd) P Awasthi and M Patel. “The pilots executed the weapon release in a text book manner and all mission objectives were met. The telemetry and tracking systems captured all the mission events confirming the success of the trials,” HAL said in a statement.Arup Chatterjee, director, engineering and R&D, HAL said the state-owned plane maker was indigenously enhancing the training and combat capability of the Hawk-i aircraft, and it was in talks with the Indian military for integration of various weapons on the Hawk platform.The IAF inducted the British-origin Hawk Mk132 aircraft in 2008 to simplify the training of its fighter pilots. The planes are crucial for the training of combat pilots as they serve as a bridge between subsonic trainers and supersonic fighters such as Rafales, Sukhoi-30 MKIs, Mirage 2000s and Jaguars. Pilots carry out the final stage of their training on Hawks for one year at Bidar in Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-hawk-i-aircraft-fires-smart-anti-airfield-weapon-off-odisha-coast-101611232574089.html

We are always of the belief that the judiciary and agencies like the RBI, CBI, ED and so on should act independently and impartially," Justice Shinde said."There is a threat to the very democracy if these agencies do not act independently," the court added.Khadse (68), who quit the BJP and joined the NCP In October 2020, appeared before the ED in Mumbai on January 15 this year to record his statement in the alleged land grab case, pursuant to summons issued against him.The bench further noted that the petitioner was cooperating with the probe and has also appeared before the agency for questioning."If somebody is ready to cooperate and honour summons then we ask ourselves what is the need for arrest," the court said."At the end of the day, he (Khadse) has cooperated and honoured the summons issued...he has appeared for questioning. We can understand if someone is not cooperating," Justice Shinde said.Khadse in his plea claimed the land in question was purchased by his wife and son-in-law from the owner legally and there was no illegality in the procedure.In reply to Khadse's petition, the ED in its affidavit on Thursday said an initial investigation has clearly revealed various evidences showing money laundering in the case.The ED claimed the ECIR was registered in October 2020 against Eknath Khadse, his wife Mandakini Khadse and son-in-law Girish Choudhari in the alleged land grab case in Pune, causing a loss of ₹62 crore to the public exchequer.According to the agency, the land was purchased at a low rate of ₹3.75 crore with a criminal intent to later seek compensation from the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), which was to acquire the land in future.It alleged that Khadse misused his official position as state revenue minister in 2016."The petitioner (Khadse), using his official position and government machinery, manipulated the actual market price which was more than ₹31 crore at that time," the affidavit said.It said the petition seeking to quash the ECIR was premature and hence, should be dismissed.Khadse in his petition claimed that an FIR was lodged in the same case in 2017, but the police later filed a closure report before a court in Pune.The ED in its affidavit said the court has till date not accepted the closure report and hence, the FIR is not closed.The agency also said it was probing the money laundering angle in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judiciary-agencies-like-cbi-ed-should-act-independently-bombay-hc-101611231546304.html
21-01-2021||India||5 killed in fire at Pune's Serum Institute’s Manjari plant||At least five people were killed in a fire that tore through India's Covid-19 vaccine producer Serum Institue of India in Pune on Thursday. The deaths were confirmed by state officials three hours after the fire engulfed the vaccine production unit."Four people were evacuated from the building but when it came under control, five bodies were found by our jawans," Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol told news agency ANI. The mayor added that the five people who died, were perhaps the workers at the under-construction building. "The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained but it is being speculated that welding, that was going on at the building, caused the fire," Mohol said. The state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the fire was caused by welding sparks at the construction site at the SII. "The inflammable material at the site aggrivated the fire," Tope said. As the smoke filled the building, authorities rushed and evacauted nine people trapped inside in the Serum Institute of India's Manjari premises, police said.SII CEO Adar Poonwalla said there would be no loss in vaccine manufacturing because the company has other available facilities."Thank you everyone for your concern and prayers. So far the most important thing is that there have been no lives lost or major injuries due to the fire, despite a few floors being destroyed," Poonawalla tweeted.Serum Institute of India is the world’s largest maker of vaccines and has been contracted to manufacture a billion doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine. Of the more than 12 billion coronavirus vaccine doses expected to be produced this year, rich countries have already bought about 9 billion, and many have options to buy even more. As a result, Serum Institute is likely to make most of the vaccines that will be used by developing nations.The Manjari facility is where the Covishield vaccine used in the nationwide inoculation drive against the pandemic is made. The building where the fire broke out is part of the under-construction site of the Serum facility and is one km from the Covishield manufacturing unit, sources said."I would like to reassure all governments & the public that there would be no loss of #COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies at @SerumInstIndia. Thank you very much @PuneCityPolice & Fire Department," he added.Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the state government has ordered a probe into the fire.The fire, which broke out at 2.45 pm on the fourth and fifth floors of the SEZ 3 building in the Serum Institute premises, was brought under control in two hours, police said.Viral visuals from the site showed smoke billowing out from the Serum Institute facility.A fire brigade official said cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.A National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team was rushed to the spot, an official said.Pune Police Commissioner Amitabh Gupta said all the people trapped inside the building where the fire broke out have been evacuated.Chief Fire Officer Prashant Ranpise said cooling work has commenced at the spot. Nobody was injured in the fire, he added.Fifteen water tankers were pressed into action and the fire was brought under control around 4.30 pm, he said."The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Furniture, wiring, cabins were gutted. No major machinery or instruments were stored on the floors where the fire broke out," he said."I have taken information from the Pune Municipal Corporation about the incident and an instruction has been given to carry out a detailed probe into the incident," Ajit Pawar said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked the state machinery to ensure that the fire is brought under control, his office tweeted. He is in touch with the Pune Municipal Commissioner, the CMO added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-dead-in-fire-at-serum-institute-s-manjri-plant-in-pune-101611231917506.html
21-01-2021||India||BSF threatening people in border villages to vote for particular party: TMC||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India alleging that the Border Security Force (SF) was threatening people living along the Bangladesh border and asking them to vote for a particular political party.Meanwhile, the BJP has urged the poll panel to order a special audit of the electoral roll.“BSF personnel are going to bordering villages and threatening villagers to vote for a particular political party. Villagers are being told that the state administration won’t be able to help them and that they would be left at the mercy of the BSF. We have taken up the matter with the ECI,” said Partha Chatterjee, TMC general secretary and state education minister, after meeting the Chief Election Commissioner.The BSF has refuted the allegations, calling them baseless and far from truth“The BSF is a professional border guarding force. We have actively checked on illegal infiltration and smuggling and criminals involved in such activities have been brought to book. The statements made by Chatterjee, are without any basis and far from truth,” said a statement issued by the BSF.Representatives of both the TMC and the BJP met the Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and the two election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar on Thursday. The ECI team is on a two-day visit to West Bengal to take stock of the election preparedness and law and order situation in the poll-bound state.“Bordering areas are very sensitive. We have urged the ECI to cross-check the voter’s list in some areas where there has been an alarming increase in the number of electors,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP president in West Bengal.The BJP in its letter to the ECI alleged that at least five bordering districts – Malda, Murshidabad, Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur, and South 24 Parganas – have registered high population growth in the last four years. Three of these – Malda Murshidabad and Uttar Dinajpur have a Muslim majority, according to the 2011 census.The BJP team also demanded that central forces be deployed at least 15 days before the polls. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-member legislative assembly.Ghosh also claimed that between 4 to 5 lakh Rohingyas who illegally entered the country through the Indo-Bangla border, have been included in the voters' list. But the BJP’s letter to the ECI made no mention of this point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-threatening-people-in-border-villages-to-vote-for-particular-party-tmc-101611231154136.html
21-01-2021||India||Farmers' protest: No nod for Republic Day rally; SC panel begins consultation||The panel appointed by the Supreme Court to find a solution to the impasse after studying the farm laws and talking to the stakeholders interacted with 10 farmer organisations on Thursday, beginning its consultation process. The committee will have to submit its report within two months and until that time the implementation of the farm laws will be stayed, the Supreme Court had ordered.Meanwhile, farmers who are protesting at Delhi borders met Delhi Police officials on Thursday over permission for tractor march on Delhi's Outer Ring Road.The protest of the farmers against the three contentious laws began on November 26 and is still going strong. Several parallel developments have taken place in the last few days.1. The talks between the protesting farmers and the Centre is going on. The 10th round of meeting was held on Wednesday in which the Centre has proposed to hold the implementation of the laws for 1.5 to 2 years. In the next meeting on January 22, farmers' union leaders will reply to the Centre after discussing among themselves.2. The consultation of the SC-appointed committee will be going on separately from the talks between the protesting farmers and the Centre. This committee is supposed to talk to as many as farmers organisations possible, not only the protesting ones. In fact, the protesting unions earlier refused to attend any meeting of this panel as they said the members are supporters of the farmers' laws.3. On Thursday, the panel virtually interacted with 10 farmers' organisation from eight states, including Uttar Pradesh. Other states were Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.4. Currently, there are three members in the panel — president of Maharasthra-based Shetkari Sanghatana Anil Ghanwat and agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi. Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann has recused himself from the committee.5. The panel issued a statement, which said, "The farmers' unions participated in the discussion and gave their frank opinion including suggestions to improve the implementation of Acts."6. Protesting farmers are planning a peaceful tractor march on Republic Day on the Outer Ring Road. This case too reached the Supreme Court which said it was Delhi Police's decision whether they would allow the march or not.7. Delhi Police has not granted the permission to hold tractor march on Outer Ring Road. Police officers tried to convince them to hold the rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway, which the farmers didn't accept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-no-nod-for-republic-day-rally-sc-panel-begins-consultation-101611230836077.html

Our frontline warriors are getting vaccinated across the nation. At 1:15 PM tomorrow, 22nd January, I would interact with beneficiaries and vaccinators of Covid vaccination drive in Varanasi, via video conferencing," PM Modi said in a tweet on Thursday. The world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India. Our frontline warriors are getting vaccinated across the nation. At 1:15 PM tomorrow, 22nd January, I would interact with beneficiaries and vaccinators of Covid vaccination drive in Varanasi, via video conferencing.The interaction with the drug inoculators and beneficiaries comes amid the continuous dialogue and discussion by the prime minister with scientists, political leaders, officials and other stakeholders to proactively ensure smooth conduct of the world’s largest vaccination drive, PMO said in a statement.Helmed by PM, the interaction comes within a week of the country's vaccination drive - largest ever held globally - where more than 8 lakh healthcare workers have been vaccinated so far. The health ministry has maintained that there was no case of serious/severe AEFI attributable to vaccination to date.Ten cases of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) -- four in Delhi, two in Karnataka, and one each in Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and West Bengal -- have required hospitalisation so far, additional secretary in the Health Ministry Manohar Agnani said.In the initial round, 30 million health care and front line workers - such as the police and defense forces - were administered the injections. The second phase is targeted at about 270 million people above the age of 50 and those at particular risk to Covid. The process will draw on existing networks used to vaccinate tens of millions of babies each year against diseases such as polio.The Union health ministry official said that the Centre has advised states to keep vaccination sessions four days a week to avoid disruption of routine health services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-varanasi-s-covid-19-vaccinators-beneficiaries-tomorrow-101611229824201.html
21-01-2021||India||Fadnavis writes to Maharashtra CM to relocate Metro car shed to Aarey||Leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday appealed to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to relocate a proposed Metro car shed to Aarey Colony in Mumbai.Aarey Colony was the old site for the construction of the proposed car shed for Metro-3 line between Colaba in south Mumbai and SEEPZ, before the state government announced shifting of the project to Kanjurmarg.In a letter addressed to Thackeray, Fadnavis alleged that some state officials were "misguiding" the government over the proposed car shed project for Metro-3 line.It will lead to a major delay in the completion of the work and over-expenditure, the former chief minister said."If the car shed is shifted to Kanjurmarg, it will end up in cutting of more number of trees, the project will be delayed and crores of rupees will be wasted," he claimed.The BJP leader said it is also a "lie" that the Aarey car shed land is available only till 2031.While planning for the Metro-3 line car shed, planners have estimated the population growth till 2053, he said.The depot will have enough space to accommodate the number of Metro cars that would be required in 2053, when the movement of Metro trains "will be at its peak", he said.In the beginning, only 31 trains would be required, while the number would later increase to 42 with each train having eight coaches, Fadnavis said."The technical committee set up for studying the car shed at Aarey land had recommended use of 25 hectares of land at the beginning. The remaining 1.4 hectares could be used later. There are 160 trees on that small piece of land, which can be translocated by 2053," he claimed.Fadnavis also said it is impractical to merge Metro-2 and 3 lines.A committee headed by Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, which was set up to recommend the site for the construction of the Metro car shed, on Monday visited Kanjurmarg and Aarey Colony sites.The Bombay High Court on December 14 last year stayed an order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acre of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area for the construction of an integrated Metro car shed.The court had also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land.The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon.The Union government has filed a petition in the HC, challenging the October 1, 2020 order passed by the collector allotting the land for construction of the car shed, and said the land belongs to its (Centre's) salt department.The previous Maharashtra government led by the BJP had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line-3 at Aarey Colony in the western suburbs, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavis-writes-to-maharashtra-cm-to-relocate-metro-car-shed-to-aarey-101611230118005.html
21-01-2021||India||Paddy procurement sparks war of words between BJP and BJD in Odisha||The politics over paddy procurement in Odisha intensified on Thursday with opposition BJP organising a protest of thousands of farmers in the state’s western town of Sambalpur accusing the Biju Janata Dal government of doing a shoddy job of paddy procurement.At the congregation of farmers, BJP leaders alleged that despite the Odisha government's claim of record procurement in the current kharif marketing season thousands of farmers have not been able to sell their paddy to the government.Addressing the farmers, Bijaypal Singh Tomar, Rajya Sabha MP and in-charge of Odisha BJP, alleged that farmers in western Odisha as well as other districts are facing a lot of problems during the paddy procurement and many are being forced to sell their paddy below the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,868."The Narendra Modi govt raised the MSP of paddy to ₹1,868 per quintal, yet several farmers are not able to get the MSP," he alleged.Bargarh MP Suresh Pujari, alleged that the state government has no reply to farmers' grievances over lapse of advance tokens issued to them. "Though the government claims that this year they have procured 22 per cent more paddy than last year's, the reality is totally opposite. Farmers are being forced to sell their paddy much below the minimum support price fixed by the Centre at ₹1,868 per quintal. Food supplies minister Ranendra Pratap Swain had promised that criminal cases will be filed if paddy is procured below the MSP at any place. However, no such action has been taken anywhere so far,” alleged Pujari.He further said the procurement ceiling of 19 quintal for irrigated lands and 13 quintal for non-irrigated lands was completely unjustified and has resulted in hundreds of quintals of paddy lying unsold.Farmers led by state BJP president Samir Mohanty and leader of opposition Pradipta Naik also scuffled with police when they tried to gherao the revenue divisional commissioner office in Sambalpur. They have been arrestedThe ruling BJD rubbished the BJP’s allegations. BJD spokesperson Pratap Deb said that the Odisha government has already procured 23 per cent of more paddy as compared to the corresponding period of last year.“At a time when the procurement is more than last year, claims of lacuna in the procurement process are totally wrong and based on fake evidence. Instead of gheraoing the RDC's office claiming that farmers are facing problems, the BJP should first address the country-wide protest over the farm laws,” said Deb, referring to procurement of 36 lakh tonne of paddy during the current kharif marketing season.Farmer leaders in western Odisha, said the state government's claim of record procurement was misleading. "This year the harvest was good due to adequate rain. However, the government did not revise its ceiling of paddy procurement of 19 quintals for every acre of irrigated land and 13 quintals for every acre of non-irrigated land. As a result thousands of farmers were left with unsold paddy which they had to sell at half the price of MSP fixed by the government. The government should have re-oriented its policy looking at the record harvest," said Ashok Pradhan, farmer leader of western Odisha.Pradhan alleged that apart from the losses suffered by the farmers due to distress sale, foregoing 4-6 kg of paddy for every quintal during procurement was hurting the farmers.Meanwhile, Odisha's food supplies and consumer welfare minister Ranendra Pratap Swain in a letter to Union consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Piyush Goel claimed that that the Centre is yet to give ₹6,039 crore towards pending subsidy claims for paddy procurement. Swain in his letter said the Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation which procures paddy, has so far borrowed a staggering sum of ₹15,000 crore to run the programme due to non-release of subsidy by the Department of Food and Public Distribution. "As all resources including the sanctioned limit of bank finances have been exhausted by OSCSC, the pending subsidy may be released urgently as further paddy procurement from farmers will be severely affected," he wrote.Swain also took exception to the Food Corporation of India's missive to Odisha government for limiting the delivery of surplus parboiled rice of Odisha to the extent of 50% of the last year delivery and not to accept any surplus in the form of parboiled rice during the Rabi season of the current Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21.“Odisha is primarily a parboiled rice consuming state which is consumed in 24 out of 30 districts. As most of the rice mills in the state are parboiled mill, asking the state to deliver surplus rice in the form of raw rice in Rabi and to limit procurement of parboiled rice in the Kharif to the extent of 50% of last year FCI delivery will have far-reaching adverse consequences for the state,” Swain said.Political analysts said the fight between BJD and BJP over paddy procurement was essentially a tussle over retaining their political base in western Odisha. "As BJP has regained its bastion in western Odisha in 2019 Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, the BJD wants to dent BJP's base in the region where allegation of distress sale of paddy is heard frequently. Such fights would become more intense before the panchayat polls next year," said Maheswar Duriya, assistant professor of political science in Bhawanipatna college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-sparks-war-of-words-between-bjp-and-bjd-in-odisha-101611229325260.html

They have besmirched the name of a great state through their misconduct," Tharoor tweeted.An FIR against the web series starring Pankaj Tripathi, Ali Fazal among others was filed by one Arvind Chaturvedi at Mirzapur Kotwali (Dehat) police station for hurting religious sentiments and spoiling the image of Mirzapur.This was a development close on the heels of Tandav controversy where several BJP leaders took objection to the Ali Abbas Zafar directed political thriller and now some controversial scenes have also been edited.माननीय प्रधानमंत्री @narendramodi जी एवं माननीय मुख्यमंत्री @myogiadityanath जी के नेतृत्व में मिर्ज़ापुर विकासरत है।यह समरसता का केंद्र है। मिर्ज़ापुर नामक Webseries के ज़रिए इसे हिंसक इलाक़ा बताकर बदनाम किया जा रहा है।इस सीरीज़ के माध्यम से जातीय वैमनस्य भी फैलाया जा रहा है।1/2Though the action against Mirzapur escalated after Tandav row, the complaint against Mirzapur is an old one.

21-01-2021||India||MP transfers cash directly to farmers, earns additional borrowing capacity||Madhya Pradesh has become the first state to implement the direct cash transfer of power subsidy to farmers as stipulated by the Union finance ministry under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) stimulus package. This has earned the state an additional borrowing capacity equivalent to 0.15% of its gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the current financial year, two officials said.Madhya Pradesh is the only state to undertake the specific power sector reforms to unlock an additional borrowing limit offered under the package announced on May 17, the Union finance ministry officials said, requesting anonymity.The Centre had allowed states to borrow beyond their set fiscal road map to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, states are allowed to keep their fiscal deficit at 3% of GSDP.The Centre on May 17 raised states’ borrowing limit by 2% of GSDP in 2020-21; a part of which was based on certain conditions. A 1% of the additional borrowing limit was available to states on implementation of four citizen-centric reforms with a 0.25% value each -- one nation, one ration card system, ease of doing business, reform of urban local bodies and the power sector.Also Read: India still hopes oil majors will join race for biggest saleAfter the launch of the scheme under the package, 14 states have so far carried out at least one of the four stipulated reforms and have been granted reform linked borrowing permissions worth ₹62,762 crore, the officials said. Eleven states have implemented the one nation, one ration card system. Eight states have done ease of doing business reforms. Four have carried out local body reforms and Madhya Pradesh has implemented power sector reforms, the officials said.“...to earn special borrowing dispensation, MP [Madhya Pradesh] has launched direct transfer of electricity subsidy to farmers in one district of the state from December 2020. Thus, it earned the eligibility to mobilise additional financial resources equivalent to 0.15% of its GSDP,” one of the officials said.The finance ministry on Tuesday granted permission to the state to mobilise additional ₹1,423 crore through open market borrowings.The state has to work on other areas of the power sector to earn the full 0.25% of the dispensation, the official added. Under the power sector reforms, states are required to meet three conditions to avail additional financial resources of up to 0.25% of the GSDP.They get additional borrowing space of 0.05% of GSDP each by reducing aggregate technical and commercial losses and by narrowing the gap between the average cost of supply and average revenue realisation (ACS-ARR) in the state as per prescribed targets. Balance space of 0.15% of GSDP is earned by introducing Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in power subsidy to the farmer.“According to the special borrowing dispensation policy stipulated by the department of expenditure, an arm of the Union finance ministry, states were expected to frame a scheme for transfer of cash power subsidy to the farmer and implement the same in at least one district by December 31, 2020,” a second official said. “MP met the criteria by framing the policy and implementing the same in Vidisha.”Madhya Pradesh framed a DBT scheme for agricultural power consumers and the MP Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited has distributed over ₹32 crore directly into bank accounts of over 60,000 farmers within the stipulated time, the second official said.The scheme will also be launched soon in other districts such as Jhabua and Seoni and the state government has informed the Centre that the DBT system will be rolled out in the entire state in the next financial year.Abhishek A Rastogi, a partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, said: “Out of the four reforms offered to avail the special dispensation under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat stimulus package, Madhya Pradesh is the only state which has boldly initiated the power sector reforms. This is commendable as most states seem reluctant to undertake power reforms due to various reasons. Leakage of power subsidy is a bane. DBT must be introduced across the country. Power sector reform is must to take India into a higher growth trajectory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-transfers-cash-directly-to-farmers-earns-additional-borrowing-capacity-101611224908268.html
21-01-2021||India||Kerala assembly turns down motion for removal of Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan||After nearly a four-hour long heated debate, the Kerala Assembly on Thursday rejected a motion moved by the opposition seeking the removal of Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan alleging his role in the gold smuggling case.The house rarely takes up such motions and during the debate Deputy Speaker V Sasi presided over the house as the Speaker sat with the other members. Introducing the motion, Muslim League legislator M Ummer said the Speaker denigrated his office by allegedly supporting a smuggling racket.He said it would be ideal for him to keep away from the post till the multi-agency probe was over. He also alleged serious irregularities in the modification of the assembly building and funding of the assembly-controlled TV news channel.Based on the statement of the prime accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, the Speaker is set to be interrogated by the Customs. On January 8, his personal assistant was interrogated for more than 10 hours by officials probing the dollar case related to the gold smuggling incident. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala also said it would be ideal for the Speaker to quit till he gets a clean chit.But ruling party members defended him. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the motion was politically-motivated and it will set a bad precedent in legislature history. Later, the Speaker also replied to allegations saying since his hands were clean so he was not worried.“Other than media reports I haven’t got any calls or summons from anyone. I can’t run after media churning choicest stories. All allegations are without any basis and I am ready for any probe,” he said adding the opposition notice was a personal attack against him.“I am confident that there was no lapse on my part. So I have no anxiety or fear,” he said claiming that he would end his political career if the charges against him were proved. Later, the house rejected the motion and the opposition staged a noisy walkout.After seizure of 30 kg gold from a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic luggage in last July, there were reports allegedly linking the Speaker with main accused Suresh. He later admitted that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and he attended some functions after being invited by her. But the opposition Congress and BJP alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and that Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with her several times to the West Asian countries.They also alleged the accused smuggled US dollars to Gulf countries using the Speaker’s green channel access. They also alleged that a major portion of the smuggled US dollar was commission obtained from various government projects.When the Customs broke up the gold smuggling racket, Suresh was working as a senior consultant with the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she worked at the UAE consulate in the state capital as its public relations officer. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, her degree was also found to be fake.Two months back Suresh told a court in Kochi that her life was in danger and sought special protection for herself and her family members. She said she was under pressure not to take big names and some people met her in the jail a couple of times to put pressure on her. Later, the court directed the prisons department to provide her with adequate security. Detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa), Swapna Suresh is lodged in the women’s jail in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-turns-down-motion-for-removal-of-speaker-p-sreeramakrishnan-101611224506187.html
21-01-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan assures people on safety, efficacy of Covid vaccines||Vaccination against Covid-19 will lead to people not transmitting the disease and its eradication in some time, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday as he unveiled IEC posters to address the emerging issue of vaccine hesitancy in some sections of the population.Commenting on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, he said, "The paradox is that countries across the globe are asking us for access to the vaccines, while a section of our own is fomenting misinformation and doubt for narrow political ends."More than eight lakh healthcare workers were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the country till 7 am on Thursday, according to the health ministry.Vardhan reminded everyone of the achievements of India, the second-most populous country in the world, which is seeing a steady decline in the number of active coronavirus cases."The elimination of polio and small pox was made possible by large-scale immunisation. Once immunised, not only that person is not capable of catching the disease, he or she is also unable to transmit the disease to others, thus passing on the social benefit to the larger society he or she interacts with. This was also the logic of undertaking mass immunisation of women and children against 12 diseases under Mission Indradhanush."The vaccination against Covid will similarly create persons incapable of transmitting the disease and eradicate the disease altogether in some time," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the health ministry.The minister urged everyone to counter the "vested campaigns of untruth and misinformation"."Let us put a stop to these falsehoods," he said.Vardhan appealed to people to seek correct information regarding the Covid-19 vaccines from credible and authentic sources such as the health ministry, the information and broadcasting ministry, the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the MyGov website etc., according to the statement.He reiterated that "truth is powerful and shall prevail" and encouraged everyone to share the IEC posters to multiply the virtuous cycle of truth.Commenting on the safety and efficacy of the Covid vaccines, the health minister said, "All eminent doctors of well-known hospitals have taken the vaccines and praised the exercise for its desired end. It is only a handful of vested political interests who are interested in spreading rumour and encouraging vaccine hesitancy among those vulnerable to such propaganda in the population."The paradox is that countries across the globe are asking us for access to the vaccines, while a section of our own is fomenting misinformation and doubt for narrow political ends."He said eminent doctors, along with many other healthcare workers within the government as well as the private sector, have taken the vaccines and returned to work without any side-effects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-assures-people-on-safety-efficacy-of-covid-vaccines-101611223862989.html
21-01-2021||India||HT Environment Conclave: Prepare for more heatwaves and floods, says Rajeevan Nair||Frequency and duration of heatwaves, droughts, flash floods, urban floods, short intense rainfall events, probability of cyclones to become severe storms will increase in the coming years due to climate change, said M Rajeevan Nair, secretary ministry of earth sciences at Hindustan Times Environment Conclave. At a session on Climate Change and Green Economy, he said India needs to be ready and come up with specific projection models for how these changes are going to affect agriculture, health, water resources, energy and other sectors to cope with impact. Agreeing with him, Sunita Narain, director general of Delhi-based advocacy group, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the ministry’s study shows that the impact of climate change was intensifying and India needs to amplify its vulnerability at the international global negotiations, which are expected to get steam with the United States deciding to re-join the Paris Climate Agreement.Narain said the absolute emissions of US have increased in the four years of Donald Trump government and it is an opportunity for India to push for three agendas at the negotiations. “One, the world is today talking about how we can involve markets in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. India needs to push for transformational markets, a market mechanism that pays us the true cost of carbon dioxide reduction. We don’t want any cheap convoluted market-based mechanism which takes away our cheapest options,” she said. Also read | Climate crisis can be new area of cooperation for India, US: Antony BlinkenNarain said the second agenda that India should push is the role within markets of land-based sinks. “Sinks are those which absorb carbon dioxide. And there is a huge debate on how accurate is the estimation of the role of sinks in carbon dioxide reduction. India needs to put this on the table because the fact is our forests are the habitats of our very poor people. And we cannot look at forests just as carbon sinks. If we can come up with the right formula and invest in the livelihoods of forest-based communities, build our forest resources, it will be good for us,” she said. Lastly, she said, the world will have to move towards much tougher emission reduction targets. “Today’s targets set under the Paris Agreement amount to nothing. We must drive the issue of equity in the target setting. We must insist that countries have to take reductions based on the contributions to the problem. And we must ask for burden-sharing in the target setting when it comes to Paris Plus, when it comes to talking about what we will do to reduce emissions so that we can stay within the phase two threshold,” she said.Coming back to India’s vulnerability, Nair said based on the climate change projections and past data, it has become evident that though Indian monsoon is robust, rainy days are coming down, dry spells are increasing, India is warming equal to global warming elsewhere in the world and cold waves are reducing. “This will have a serious impact on agriculture and farmers need to devise ways to cope up with these changes,” he said. Stressing that Indian climate change models are improving day by day, Nair said for the first time India has developed an Indian climate model from which it has started making future climate change projections. “And for the first time, our climate change projection model will be included in the IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report coming in 2022 or so. We are collaborating with foreign scientists and improving our projection models and reducing uncertainty in projections,” he said. Under Paris Agreement of December 2015, the goal is to limit global warming to below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius (°C), compared to pre-industrial levels by turn of the century. Studies shows at the present rate of emissions the temperature rise would be 3°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/longer-heatwaves-more-droughts-in-future-says-earth-sciences-secy-101611223648221.html

21-01-2021||India||India using vaccine diplomacy in south Asia to push back against China||India will give millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccine to South Asian countries in the next few weeks, government sources said on Thursday, drawing praise from its neighbours and pushing back against China's dominating presence in the region.Free shipments of AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest producer of vaccines, have begun arriving in the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.Myanmar and the Seychelles are next in line to get free consignments as India uses its strength as one of the world's biggest makers of generic drugs to build friendships."The government of India has shown goodwill by providing the vaccine in grant. This is at the people’s level, it is the public who are suffering the most from Covid-19," said Nepal's Minister for Health and Population Hridayesh Tripathi.The gesture comes at a time that India's ties with Nepal have been strained by a territorial dispute and Indian concern over China's expanding political and economic influence in the Himalayan nation sandwiched between the Asian giants.China, which had promised Nepal help to deal with the pandemic, is awaiting Nepali clearance for its Sinopharm shots."We've asked them to submit more documents and information before we give them the approval," said Santosh KC, spokesman for Nepal's department of drug administration.Bangladesh was supposed to get 110,000 doses of vaccine free from Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, but Bangladesh refused to contribute towards the development cost of the vaccine leading to deadlock.Bangladesh has instead turned to India for urgent supplies and on Thursday was due to receive 2 million shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a gift from India."India is making the AstraZeneca vaccine which makes all the difference. It can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated temperatures and countries like Bangladesh have that facility," a Bangladesh health official said.India for years has struggled to match the pace of Chinese investment in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives, where China is building ports, roads and power stations as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.But the demand for vaccines in these countries desperate to revive their tourism-dependent economies has offered Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government a way to claw back ground, diplomats say.India is considering giving away anything from 12 million to 20 million shots to its neighbours in the first wave of assistance over the next three to four weeks, one government source said.India is also helping with the training of health workers in some of these countries and the setting up of the infrastructure to administer the shots, the source said."It's a well-crafted, calibrated series of actions you are seeing, they confirm the validity of our 'neighbourhood first' policy," said a former Indian ambassador, Rajiv Bhatia."It plays to our strengths in science and pharma, and this is our moment to shine."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-using-vaccine-diplomacy-in-south-asia-to-push-back-against-china-101611220681510.html
21-01-2021||India||India to kick off major drills in Andaman Sea to sharpen military synergy||The Indian military will carry out complex drills off the Andaman and Nicobar Islands next week to fine-tune joint war-fighting capabilities and sharpen operational synergy between the three services, with the high-tempo exercise involving fighter jets, transport aircraft, helicopters, warships, infantry combat vehicles and elements of special forces, the defence ministry announced on Thursday. Indian forces will execute high-intensity offensive and defensive manoeuvres in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal as part of the wargames, the ministry said. The Andamans are located more than 1,200km away from mainland India. Also Read: UAE Air Force to help 3 Rafale fighters reach India, 7 more in AprilThe exercise, codenamed Kavach (shield), is being conducted at a time when India and China are locked in a border standoff in the eastern Ladakh theatre and the Indian Navy has stepped up surveillance in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to keep tabs on China’s moves to expand its footprint in the strategic waters. The military drills will be coordinated by the Port Blair-based Andaman and Nicobar Command—India’s only tri-services command. “The exercise will involve synergised application of maritime surveillance assets, coordinated air and maritime strikes, air defence, submarine and landing operations,” the defence ministry said in a statement. The scope of the exercise will cover joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks that will involve the military’s technical, electronic and human intelligence elements. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the IOR, India’s focus remains on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. “The ISR exercise will validate the capabilities of intelligence gathering from space, air, land and sea-based assets/sensors, its analysis and sharing to achieve battlefield transparency for quick decision making at different stages of operations,” the statement said. The drills will witness the deployment of the assets belonging to the army, navy, air force and coast guard. The exercise will involve the air force’s Jaguar maritime strike aircraft, transport aircraft, elements of the Indian Army’s amphibious brigade, destroyers, anti-submarine warfare corvettes and amphibious warships with ship-borne helicopters of the Vishakhapatnam-based Eastern Naval Command, the statement said. The waters in which the exercise is being conducted hold strategic value for India as China is trying to open multiple routes to the Indian Ocean to overcome the Malacca Dilemma (China’s strategic weakness), officials said. The Malacca Dilemma refers to China’s apprehension of major naval powers controlling the Malacca Strait between Malaysia and Indonesia and interdicting vital supply lines. A significant volume (more than 80%) of China’s oil imports passes through the strait connecting the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The Malacca Strait is about 350km from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. “The joint force would execute multi-domain, high-intensity offensive and defensive manoeuvres in the Andaman Sea and Bay of Bengal and carry out amphibious landing operations, air-landed operations and helicopters-borne insertion of Special Forces from sea, culminating in tactical follow-on operations on land,” the statement added.Since all wars are ‘joint’ in nature, it is imperative that constituents of a fighting force plan and exercise together, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “The exercise off the Andaman coast is vital in nature for any amphibious operation. In the present security environment, with both neighbours testing us, it is essential that such war-fighting expertise be kept honed for any eventuality,” Bahadur added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-kick-off-major-drills-in-andaman-sea-to-sharpen-military-synergy-101611220587721.html

But, the world is surprised and watching the V-shaped recovery of the Indian economy," Shah said.The GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent in the June 2020 quarter due to the lockdown, and the contraction narrowed down to 7.5 per cent in the September quarter as compared to the same in the year-ago period, as the unlock process began.The demand situation has shown further improvement in the December quarter which witnessed the festivities, with several high-frequency indicators illustrating the same.The Union government now expects the GDP to close FY21 with a contraction of 7.7 per cent.Shah also said that infrastructure development carried out under the Narendra Modi regime in the last six years exceeds that done by governments in the 20 years preceding the NDA government."The work done in the infrastructure sector in last six years is equivalent to that done in 20 years of previous governments," he said.He listed various infrastructure works like Metro lines, bullet train and other projects taken up by the Centre.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is working hard to develop infrastructure in the country, be it rural or urban areas.The Modi government has provided electricity to all villages of the country, road connectivity, and has provided one bank account to every family."Ten crore families, or 30 crore people, in India were not having their own houses, and the way construction of houses for low income groups is going on, we are confident that every family will get a home by 2022," Shah said."Another big project that we have taken up is providing piped water to every household by 2022," he said.Shah said the government has also taken up the work of removal of one lakh railway crossings on national and state highways by building over-bridges or under-bridges on them. The work on around 5,000 such crossings has been completed and it is currently on in 8,000 other places, he said."The Shilaj bridge (inaugurated here on Thursday) is one such among the one lakh bridges (being built) on the railway crossings," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-undergoing-a-v-shaped-recovery-world-is-surprised-amit-shah-101611219568180.html

In the past, our education policy was job-oriented but the British imposed their policy on India and adopted ours.”He added that education needed to generate confidence in an individual that it would help in employment and contribution to the society.“Education is an important aspect of one’s life apart from health and food. Education should be such that it generates confidence in a person so that one can run one’s family while fulfilling obligations towards society. As such job-oriented education is a must,” said Bhagwat.He added that the education system in India was helping in creating a self-reliant ecosystem.‘We need not look towards others for education reforms as we have an education system which is leading to Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat,” he said.He also applauded the efforts of Vidya Bharti for rendering ethics-based education.“Education system in the glorious past of our nation was such that it gave employment to all,” he said.

See list here||A week after expanding his cabinet, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday allocated portfolios to the new inductees and also effected a reshuffle of the departments of some ministers.The CM has retained at least eight ministries that include Bengaluru development, energy, finance, intelligence, infrastructure development and all other unallocated portfolios as a measure to manage expectations and quell dissent in the ranks of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state.The list was released by the Department of Information and Public Relations (DIPR), Karnataka.Umesh Katti, the legislator from Hukkeri, has been named as the new minister for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs that was earlier held by K Gopalaiah, who was among the 17 legislators who helped bring down the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal(S)-Congress coalition government.N Nagaraju (M.T.B), another turncoat legislator who lost his seat in the bypolls, has been named in charge of excise department after Yediyurappa let go of H Nagesh, an independent candidate who transferred his support from the coalition government to the BJP.Murugesh Nirani, who had allegedly led a large contingent of legislators against Yediyurappa, has been named as the minister for mines and geology department.Arvind Limbavali and CP Yogeshwar, the two people who were instrumental in safeguarding the support of the turncoats, have been given forest and minor irrigation departments, respectively.K Sudhakar, the health and family welfare minister was forced to part with the medical education portfolio which was handed to JC Madhuswamy, who was earlier the minister for law, parliamentary affairs and legislation department. Sudhakar had fought hard to retain both medical education and health in the peak of the pandemic from B Sriramulu.Former mining baron and turncoat Anand Singh was relieved of the forest department and has been handed the tourism portfolio that was earlier held by CT Ravi, who has since assumed charge as general secretary of the BJP. Singh has also been entrusted with the environment and ecology department.R Shankar, who won as an independent before merging his party with the Congress, has been made minister for municipal administration and sericulture.Former chief minister Jagadish Shettar retained the industries portfolio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bs-yediyurappa-allocates-portfolios-in-new-karnataka-cabinet-see-list-here-101611217949869.html

We’re clear that we will conduct tractor parade there only. After tomorrow’s meeting with Centre, we’ll hold another meeting with police,” news agency ANI quoted Pal as saying.Govt has said tractor parade on R-Day can't be conducted on Delhi's Outer Ring Road, due to security reasons. We're clear that we'll conduct tractor parade there only. After tomorrow's meeting with Centre,we'll hold another meeting with police: Darshan Pal, Krantikari Kisan Union pic.twitter.com/cHrRlTb74UPal’s organisation is a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions, which has been leading protests against the three contentious agricultural laws. Pal is also in the group of over 40 farmer leaders which has held ten rounds of talks with the government thus far.Thursday’s meeting between the farmers and Delhi Police is taking place a day after they held their first meeting to decide upon the route on which the rally will take place. While farmers are adamant to hold their march on the Outer Ring Road, albeit “peacefully,” the police have proposed that the march take place on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, where a “trailer” tractor march was held on January 7. As no consensus could be reached, the first meeting ended inconclusively.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to withdraw its plea filed in the court through the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction on the rally. In its plea, the police said that the march would “malign the image of the nation.” The top court, however, said that only the police can take a call on the matter.Also on Wednesday, the government told farmer leaders that it was ready to put the laws on hold for the next 18 months. The farmers will communicate their decision in Friday’s meeting. The implementation of the laws has already been stayed by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-hold-r-day-tractor-parade-only-on-outer-ring-road-reiterates-farmer-leader-101611217392004.html
21-01-2021||India||India hopes for more Iran and Venezuela oil exports under Biden||India is hoping US President Joe Biden’s administration will take a softer line against adversaries Iran and Venezuela, enabling the world’s third-largest oil importer to diversify its sources of crude.The country would be happy if the number of oil-producing nations rise, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in an interview on Bloomberg TV, reiterating comments that he made last month. “Some geopolitical changes are there,” he said. “Let us wait for how things unfold.”The South Asian economy is heavily reliant on energy imports and its refiners struggled to cope as the White House’s aggressive foreign policy over the last few years restricted access to Iranian and Venezuelan oil. Pradhan also expressed his exasperation with Saudi Arabia, after the de-facto leader of OPEC announced unilateral output cuts in response to a resurgence in Covid-19.The sudden change in production policy has made economic planning more difficult and will add to inflation, he said. “We never expect low oil prices. But it should not be a knee-jerk reaction.”India halted imports from Iran, previously its third-largest oil supplier, in mid-2019 after the expiration of U.S. exemptions from sanctions. It purchased 7.65 million tons of Venezuelan crude from January to October last year, compared with 15.9 million tons in 2019. Iran has pledged to increase its oil exports, with shipments to China almost doubling last month from November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopes-for-more-iran-and-venezuela-oil-exports-under-biden-101611217117901.html

Everyone should get equal protection just like our doctors," Vardhan said.He further said that the message is clear that vaccine is completely safe and effective."The said adverse events or side effects surfacing are common and it can be seen after any vaccination," Vardhan added.India is currently administering vaccines to 30 million healthcare and frontline workers.The second phase of the programme will involve 270 million people over 50 and those with compromised immunity or underlying medical conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to be in this batch, said a highly placed official in the vaccination drive, adding that the exact dates hadn’t been determined.India is currently administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, made by Serum Institute of India (SII) and known locally as Covishield, and the Bharat Biotech-manufactured Covaxin.Dr Vinod Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog and who heads the government’s Covid-19 task force, said the second phase was crucial. “Phase 2 is our real focus of effort after healthcare and frontline workers. These are people who are above 50 and all political workers would feature in this section,” said Dr Paul.Currently, about 10 million healthcare workers are being administered the vaccine. Other frontline workers will perhaps start getting the vaccine in about a week’s time, according to Dr Paul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-will-be-last-nail-in-coffin-of-covid-19-harsh-vardhan-101611212564250.html
21-01-2021||India||Paddy procurement mess in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, states blame Centre||After Chhattisgarh, Odisha government has accused the Centre of stalling the paddy procurement process in the state, resulting in many farmers having to sell their produce at a price lesser than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) fixed by the Centre or keep their produce at marketing yards.A farmer, Ramcharan Patel, of Sambalpur district, has been keeping a vigil during the wintry nights on his 200 quintals of paddy, which has been lying unsold at the Jamankira purchase center run by the state government, where about 270 farmers take turns to protect their paddy bags. Around 16,000 tonnes have been stacked at the centre. At the neighbouring Demrinmunda marketing yard, another 5,900 tonnes of paddy is waiting to be procured.“I have no option but to wait for procurement to start as the price being offered by private players is very less than the MSP. I will lose up to ₹500 per quintal,” he said, urging the state’s food minister Ranendra Pratap Swain to re-start the procurement. However, some farmers have sold their harvest below the MSP as the moisture level was increasing in the produce, thereby deteriorating its quality.Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh had a bumper paddy harvest this year due to good rains. In Odisha, experts said the state did not revise its ceiling of paddy procurement of 19 quintals for every acre of irrigated land and 13 quintals for every acre of non-irrigated land. “As a result, thousands of farmers were left with unsold paddy which they had to sell at half the price of the MSP fixed by the government,” said Ashok Pradhan, farmer leader of western Odisha.Paddy procurement has been stopped by the government at many places, especially in the rice bowl area of western Odisha, forcing the farmers to either store the produce at their homes or to sell them at low prices.In a letter to the Union food minister, Piyush Goyal, Odisha’s food minister, Swain, blamed the Centre for the present crisis saying it has failed to pay a pending subsidy amount of ₹6,039 crore towards paddy procurement.“The Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation, which does paddy procurement, has so far borrowed a staggering sum of ₹15,000 crore to run the programme due to non-release of subsidy by the Department of Food and Public Distribution. As all resources including the sanctioned limit of bank finances has been exhausted by OSCSC, the pending subsidy may be released urgently as further paddy procurement from farmers will be severely affected," he wrote.The Odisha minister also took exception to the Food Corporation of India's (FCI) missive to the Odisha government for limiting the delivery of surplus parboiled (partially boiled in husk) rice of Odisha to the extent of 50% of the last year’s delivery and not to accept any surplus in the form of parboiled rice during the Rabi season of the current Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21.“Odisha’s own consumption under the PDS (public distribution system) and other welfare schemes currently comes to 24 lakh MT (metric tonne) of rice. The estimated surplus that needs to be evacuated by the FCI from the State in the current kharif season would be in the range of 30 lakh MT,” Swain said.The BJP has, however, blamed the Biju Janata Dal government for the mess.Bargarh BJP MP Suresh Pujari, who would spearhead the protest on Thursday at Sambalpur, blamed the state government for farmers' grievances. “Farmers are being forced to sell their paddy much below the minimum support price fixed by the Centre at ₹1,868 per quintal as the state has been unable to procure. The minister had promised that criminal cases will be filed if paddy is procured below the MSP at any place. However, no such action has been taken anywhere,” said Pujari.State Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department had recently claimed that it has procured 35.06 lakh tonne of paddy during the current kharif marketing season, 22% cent higher than that of the procurement made in the corresponding period last year. About 28.81 lakh tonne of paddy was procured last year.In Chhattisgarh, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had accused the Centre of reducing paddy procurement target. “The Centre agreed on 60 lakh (MT) procurement of paddy from Chhattisgarh but has reduced it to 24 lakh(MT) putting additional financial burden on us,” Baghel said.The CM said it was responsibility of the Centre to procure its quota of grains from the state at the MSP and pay the state accordingly. “It is a conspiracy to disrupt paddy procurement in the state,” said state Congress president Mohan Markam.However, former chief minister and BJP leader Raman Singh hit back saying the paddy procurement has stopped in the state due to mismanagement of the state government. “They (the government) are blaming the Centre to hide its shortcomings,” he said.Jharkhand also faced paddy procurement delays as it wanted the Centre to increase its quota because of the bumper crop, but it did not happen. “Due to the bumper crop this year, we are expecting better procurement this season compared to previous season. We will procure whatever we can,” said Jharkhand food minister, Rameshwar Oraon.The issues in paddy procurement comes at the time when the Central government is holding negotiations with about 40 farmer bodies on three farm laws and a legal MSP guarantee. The 10th round of talk on Thursday between the Central government and farmer bodies remained inclusive.(With inputs from Sanjoy Dey in Ranchi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paddy-procurement-mess-in-odisha-and-chhattisgarh-states-blame-centre-101611213333774.html

21-01-2021||India||SC dismisses Aadhaar review petitions: All you need to know||The Supreme Court has, by a majority verdict, dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking a review of its 2018 judgment that validated the Aadhaar Act even as one of the five judges on the bench that heard the matter termed it a “constitutional error”. Here is all you need to know about the matter: • A Constitution Bench affirmed by 4-1 the verdict in September 2018 when the top court upheld the country’s biometric identity system and also cleared mandatory Aadhaar enrolment of recipients of government welfare benefits. • The court, in its verdict, had also approved the passage of Aadhaar law by Parliament as a money bill, which did not require the approval of the Rajya Sabha. • The Supreme Court considered the bunch of review petitions in judges’ chambers on January 11. The court order was released on Wednesday in which the five-judge bench, headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, held that “no case for review” of the 2018 judgment had been made out. Also Read: Supreme Court-appointed panel to begin consultations with farmers• Justice DY Chandrachud disagreed and wrote a separate order, suggesting that any decision must wait for a larger bench to determine whether the Aadhaar verdict was correct in interpreting what could constitute a “money bill.” • In split verdicts, the view of the majority holds. • Justice Chandrachud had in the 2018 judgment also held that Aadhaar could not have been passed as a money bill. • The majority view refused to await a word from the larger bench, as it declined to take into account a subsequent judgment in 2019 by another five-judge bench. • That bench had raised doubts on the correctness of the Aadhaar verdict and preferred that a seven-judge-bench re-examine it. The seven-judge-bench is yet to be constituted. • The majority view in the Aadhaar case has said that the 2019 judgment was not sufficient to press for a reconsideration of the 2018 Aadhaar judgment. • Justice Chandrachud dissented with the majority view and said that the 2019 judgment questioning the correctness of the Aadhaar verdict was a relevant fact and that the apex court must wait for the larger bench of seven judges to decide these pertinent issues. • In his separate order, the judge added that dismissal of the review petitions without waiting for the larger bench’s decision would place a seal of finality on the issues in the present case, without the court having the benefit of the larger bench’s consideration of the very issues which arise before the bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-aadhaar-review-petitions-all-you-need-to-know-101611212490183.html

21-01-2021||India||After six months, SC permits CERC to resume work||The Supreme Court has allowed the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to resume its functioning, six months after the restraining order was issued against the regulatory body.A bench, headed by Justice Sanjay K Kaul, also lifted its prohibitory order against the two non-judicial members of the Commission, permitting them to deliver judgments and perform administrative works.The order on Wednesday will enable delivery of 177 judgments and orders that have remained pending disposal before the CERC since August when the bench suspended the Commission’s functioning for not being able to appoint a judicial member.The CERC is a regulatory body to determine power tariffs as well as for all interstate generation, transmission and supply of power.On Wednesday, Attorney General KK Venugopal informed the bench, which also had justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, that the appointment of judicial members has now come through.“The appointment committee of the Cabinet has cleared the appointment of the Member-Law on December 16. He is currently a member of the state electricity commission in Jharkhand. He will join very soon,” Venugopal submitted.The law officer added that there is now a compliance with the court’s 2018 judgment, directing the CERC and all state commissions to make certain they appoint a Member-Law, who must be either a sitting or a retired judge, or a person with substantial knowledge and practice of the law whenever the next vacancy arises.The bench took on record the AG’s submissions, and requested him to use his good offices so that the Member-Law can join as soon as possible.Also read | Executive not following court orders will lead to anarchy: SCAt the same time, the court accepted senior advocate Maninder Singh’s plea that the other two members should be allowed to deliver judgments and orders in cases already heard by them.The court, in its order, said that the CERC could begin its adjudicatory functions after the judicial member joins it and till such time, the other two members can pronounce judgments and carry out other administrative work.With this order, the bench also wrapped up the contempt proceedings against the CERC.Anguished at the “prima facie contempt” of its judgment, the court had, in August, ordered two CERC members to go on leave till the time a Member-Law is appointed. This left the regulator non-functional with just the chairperson, PK Pujari, whereas the quorum for a hearing is two members in addition to the chair.After the last hearing in December, the bench had come down heavily on the Central government, stating the court cannot help consumers when the “government does not seem to be interested in coming to the aid of the consumers or making the Commission functional.”“The Executive cannot be expected to act nor permitted to act in breach of the judgment of this court. This would be an invitation to anarchy! The mutual respect of the three pillars of democracy requires each of them to respect the role and functioning of the other,” the court said in its last order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-six-months-sc-permits-cerc-to-resume-work-101611211227000.html

The petitioners had claimed that no evidence had been found against them and so they should be immediately released.The counsel for prosecution, however, had argued that digital evidence had been collected and are being processed, and since all the accused are influential people, any release could lead to destruction, following which the high court declined to release them.The three, along with several others, were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) under various sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The Central Crime Branch of Bengaluru police and the NCB had jointly arrested Dwivedi on September 14 and Sanjjanaa two days post that.All the three apart from seven other accused are lodged at the Parappana Agrahara Jail on the outskirts of Bengaluru.In September, a special NDPS court in Bengaluru had also rejected the bail plea of Galrani and Dwivedi and one Rahul in connection with the case.The actors have been arrested following a FIR registered in the Cottonpet police station under various sections of CrPC and NDPS acts dealing with illegal drug possession, consumption and dealing.Several other well known Kannada movie personalities, including star couple Diganth Manchale and Aindrita Ray, anchor Akul Balaji and actor Arryan Santosh have been called in for questioning till now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-grants-bail-to-kannada-actor-ragini-dwivedi-in-sandalwood-drugs-case-101611209664429.html

21-01-2021||India||Covid-19: PM Modi likely to get vaccinated in 2nd phase of inoculation drive||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to get vaccinated for Covid-19 in the second phase of the immunisation programme, and it may happen in March or April, said two top government officials on Wednesday, underlining that the leader opposed politicians jumping the queue of inoculation determined by the government and experts.India is currently administering vaccines to 30 million healthcare and frontline workers. The second phase of the programme will involve 270 million people over 50 and those with compromised immunity or underlying medical conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19. Modi, 70, is likely to be in this batch, said a second highly placed official in the vaccination drive, adding that the exact dates hadn’t been determined.Also Read: 15,223 new Covid-19 cases take India’s tally to over 10.61 million“PM will take the vaccine when his turn will come after completion of the first phase,” said an official in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). “He himself said this in his meeting with chief ministers that politicians shouldn’t try to break the queue and only take the vaccine when their turn comes,” the official added. He was referring to a January 11 meeting between Modi and chief ministers where the PM shot down suggestions of including politicians in the first phase of vaccination.A third official, from the Union health ministry, said the PM’s turn is likely to come by March or April. When asked if the PM would opt for a particular vaccine, the official refused to respond. “It’s too early to say anything,” he said.The country is currently administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, made by Serum Institute of India and known locally as Covishield, and the Bharat Biotech-manufactured Covaxin.Dr Vinod Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog and who heads the government’s Covid-19 task force, said the second phase was crucial. “Phase 2 is our real focus of effort after healthcare and frontline workers. These are people who are above 50 and all political workers would feature in this section,” said Dr Paul. Currently, about 10 million healthcare workers are being administered the vaccine.. Other frontline workers will perhaps start getting the vaccine in about a week’s time, according to Dr Paul. “It’s not that every doctor or nurse has to be inoculated to begin the next phase. It is being done in waves. Healthcare workers inoculation will go on and the other phases can also start, we have enough supply,” he added.It wasn’t clear whether the Prime Minister would have to register on the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) app, which is being used to monitor vaccinations. HT reported last week that the Centre may allow self-registration by the elderly and those with comorbidities on platform, which is currently closed to the public, for faster and easier enrolment of beneficiaries. Neither the PMO nor the Union health ministry had details about the logistics for the PM’s vaccination.Dr Paul said the government was trying to fight vaccine hesitancy. “We are trying to make ‘role models’ of prominent doctors taking vaccines willingly to remove hesitancy about vaccines,” said Dr Paul, adding, “You must also remember that six lakhs have been given the vaccine already and so they are our role models.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pm-modi-likely-to-get-vaccinated-in-2nd-phase-of-inoculation-drive-101611208766609.html

Sreeramakrishnan is also set to be interrogated by the customs authorities regarding his alleged involvement in the gold smuggling case. Earlier on January 8, Kerala Assembly Speaker’s assistant was called before the customs officials who were probing the dollar smuggling cases in the state.Kerala deputy speaker V Sasi chaired the session on Thursday as Sreeramakrishnan sat among legislators as opposition members took up the resolution against him. Kerala speaker Sreeramakrishnan had earlier admitted that he knew main accused Swapna Suresh as an employee of the UAE consulate and participated in functions organised by Suresh.CPI(M) leader S Sharma said that the allegations against the speaker cannot be taken into consideration as they are based on 'media speculations'. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at the opposition politicians for moving the resolution against the assembly Speaker. "164 statements given by the accused in gold smuggling case in the court has not come out yet. From all these months, the investigation agency was questioning the accused. How 164 statements given by such accused can be trusted?" Vijayan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the assembly is a temple of democracy and tainted leaders should not be associated with it. "P Sreeramakrishnan will be the first person to hold Speaker's chair in state's history while being tainted for his association with smugglers. Assembly is temple of democracy. No charges like association with gold smugglers came against any speaker," Chennithala was quoted as saying by news agency ANIThe opposition alleged that Sreeramakrishnan had deeper ties with Suresh. They also raised questions about the Kerala speaker inaugurating a shop of one of the accused in the gold smuggling case. Sreeramakrishnan had inaugurated the shop of Sandeep Nair, accused in the gold smuggling case, months ago.“I am fully confident that there was no lapse from my side. So I have no anxiety,” the Kerala speaker had said, claiming that he would end his political career if the charges against him are proved.The Kerala gold smuggling case had come into light after 30 kg gold worth ₹14.82 crore which was being smuggled in diplomatic cargo was found by customs department in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-legislators-bring-resolution-against-house-speaker-101611206959946.html

The saffron camp, however, bagged the district’s Hooghly Lok Sabha seat. One EVM can record up to 2000 votes.“The TMC pressured district officials to not count the votes in 16 machines. Otherwise, the BJP would have won the Arambagh seat. But we are surging ahead in the district. A number of TMC legislators will join us because they cannot work for the people if they stay in the ruling party,” Adhikari said at a rally at Mankundu in Hooghly district.He made the allegation hours before the chief election commissioner of India, Sunil Arora, arrived in Kolkata with his entire team to review the ground situation before the assembly polls due in March-April.Reacting to the allegation, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Adhikari is making random allegations. If such a malpractice took place, why didn’t he speak up one year ago?”The TMC lost a prominent legislator on Wednesday, when Arindam Bhattacharya, who represents the Santipur assembly seat in Nadia district, joined the BJP in Delhi.Bhattacharya, 40, an international trade lawyer and social entrepreneur who studied in foreign universities, won the seat on a Congress ticket in 2016 but joined the TMC a year later. He was earlier made president of the Bengal youth Congress. “I left my career to join politics because I wanted to work for the people. But there has been no progress, no industrialisation and no employment generation during the TMC regime,” said Bhattacharya.Ranjan Banerjee, senior vice-president of a nationally known industrial group, also joined the BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday.At the rally, Adhikari accused the TMC of corruption, saying it was running sand and coal smuggling operations. He also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of telling lies to the people and running the Centre’s welfare schemes by changing their names in Bengal.“It is essential that the same party rules the nation and Bengal. Unless you (voters) drive out the TMC, people won’t get jobs. This government has kept appointments by the school service commission on hold for years. There is no industrial growth but you see only hefty expenses being made on annual investment summits,” said Adhikari.He also appealed to Left voters to support the BJP in the interest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-accuses-tmc-of-rigging-lok-sabha-polls-101611205084216.html

Eight volunteers were given the jab on day one of the 10-day-long trial, said officials.“This is the third phase of the trials for the corona vaccine Sputnik. Eight of the 23 volunteers selected were vaccinated today. Only those above 18 years will be included as volunteers,” said Dr Prabhat Agarwal from the medicine department of SNMC.Dr Sanjay Kala, principal of the medical college, vaccinated the first volunteer to begin the trial.“About 100 people will be selected as volunteers and they must be in good health. A total of 46 have got their registration done,” added Dr Agarwal.The development coincides with Sputnik V getting approval in Argentina for use in people over 60 after it was earlier cleared for the younger age groups in the country, agencies reported.New documents and data on Sputnik V, including a clinical report on the vaccine’s use among the 60-plus age group, says it showed an efficacy of around 91.8% in people over 60.On Tuesday, Russia applied for registration of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine in the European Union and it has also filed for the WHO’s approval, but no timetable has yet been set on its authorisation by the World Health Organisation, according to an exclusive AFP report.Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite, was registered in August 2020, months ahead of Western competitors but before the start of large-scale clinical trials, which left some experts wary.Its developers have since said that the jab is more than 90 percent effective and Russia launched its mass vaccination campaign using the shot this week.

In its advisory, seen by HT, the home ministry asked the state governments to undertake mass awareness programmes regarding the use of flags made of paper only and to dispose them in private to maintain the flag’s dignity. “It has been brought to the notice of this ministry that on the occasions of important national, cultural and sports events, national flags made of plastic are being used in place of paper flags. Since plastic flags are not biodegradable like paper flags, these do not get decomposed for a long time; and ensuring appropriate disposal of national flag made of plastic with dignity is a practical problem,” MHA said. Also Read: Rafale jets to debut in Republic Day flypastThe advisory asked states/UTs to ensure that only paper flags are used by the public under the provisions of the Flag Code of India, 2002 and such flags are not discarded or thrown on the ground after the event. According to Section 2 of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971, “Whoever in any public place or in any other place within public view burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words, either spoken or written, or by acts) the Indian National Flag or any part thereof, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.”The MHA added “There is universal affection and respect for and loyalty to the national flag. Yet, a perceptible lack of awareness is often noticed amongst the people as well as organisations and agencies of the government in regard to laws, practices and conventions that apply to ‘display of the national flag’”.An official who didn’t want to be named said such advisories are regularly sent to the states/UTs for creating awareness among the public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-republic-day-mha-asks-people-not-to-use-plastic-flags-101611200006048.html

Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses...” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.The spokesperson added that WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption, so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them.On January 16, WhatsApp delayed the introduction of these changes to May 15 after massive backlash and users moving en masse to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.The 30-member parliamentary standing committee on IT is headed by Dr Shashi Tharoor, Lok Sabha MP from Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-twitter-officials-to-appear-before-parliamentary-panel-on-it-today-101611199022854.html

However, Mann later recused himself from the committee saying that he is duty-bound to protect the interests of farmers.Earlier on Monday, Ghanwat said that the panel faces the challenge of convincing farmers’ unions representatives to come and share their concerns with them. “The biggest challenge for the panel is to convince agitating farmers to come and speak with us. We will try our best,” Ghanwat was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Ghanwat also outlined that the panel will take the views of every stakeholder into consideration while trying to break the deadlock which has led widespread agitations at Delhi’s borders for more than eight weeks. He also added that panel members will keep their personal views on the newly passed farm laws aside while discussing means to mitigate the problems arising from the new laws. “Panel members will keep their personal views on farm laws aside while preparing reports to be submitted to the Supreme Court. We want to request those farmers who don't want to come before us that we are neither from any party nor on behalf of the government. The Supreme Court has sent us,” he said.Farmers’ have been protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 claiming that these laws will help multinational companies enter the agricultural sector and adversely impact farmers’ incomes. Farmers also say that these laws will affect government procurement of crop yields under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-appointed-panel-to-begin-consultations-with-farmers-101611198957155.html

So far, 10 people have been hospitalised in six states due to reported adverse event following Covid immunisation, of which seven have been discharged. Delhi has reported four hospitalisations, of which one healthcare worker is under observation at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Shahdara. Karnataka has reported two cases, and one is still under observation at the district hospital in Chitradurga. Uttarakhand, Chattissgarh, Rajasthan and West Bengal have all reported one hospitalisation each related to AEFI. While three from other states have been discharged, the case reported from West Bengal is still under observation at Sub-Divisional Hospital, Jangipura, Murshidabad. “No case of serious or severe AEFI is attributable to vaccination to date,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secteaty, health ministry.The country has vaccinated close to 800,000 (7,868,42) healthcare workers against Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) through 14,119 sessions till Wednesday, government data shows, of which 112,007 beneficiaries were vaccinated till 6pm on Wednesday.Two more deaths were reported of healthcare workers who were vaccinated, taking the total number of deaths to four since the launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive in India, according to the government data.

21-01-2021||India||Ninong Ering: Union minister turned MLA who is also a part time teacher||A 500 m walk on a cobbled street leads former Union minister Ninong Ering to a single-story building, the Remi government school, located deep in the interior of the lush green foothills of Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh.“They fondly call all of us teachers, mama,” Ering says. Ering served as the minister of state for minority affairs from October 2012 to May 2014.For him, the school was like a second home before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. He would frequently saunter into a classroom, reciting nursery rhymes to teach the students English. “I have always believed that the correct pronunciation is extremely important,” Ering says. “There is no better way to teach this than by using nursery rhymes, or even songs. I personally think Sound of Music has some of the instructional rhymes.”Ering, 62, who was elected as the legislator from Pasighat (West) in June 2019, moved to the village of Remi six months ahead of the polls. He spent five years as a teacher, before he became a civil servant in 1981. The pull of his former profession led him back to the schools in his constituency last year, as he started teaching in some, assessing and helping the others grow in whatever way he could. He used to visit Remi at least thrice a week before the pandemic caused the schools to shut.“It was after a very long hiatus that I got to return to the school,” Ering said. “Now, schools are slowly opening up and I could not miss the chance to return to the classroom.”On Tuesday, Ering shared a video on Twitter reciting the rhyme Doe a Deer to the students of class 1. “He used to visit the school often but then the pandemic happened,” said Tagon Padho, a teacher at the school. “We have around 136 students who are studying in classes one to eight.”Eloquence of the language, Ering asserts, can be a means to achieving great success in life. Before Ering entered politics in 1989, he served as a teacher for five years in Mirbuk and Miren schools. “I often teach them in Hindi and make sure they understand what the word means in English as well.”He laughs as he recalls his teaching days from 1975 to 1980. “There were just the three of us, we would teach everything from mathematics to the social sciences,” he says. “Back then, the schools barely had 40-50 students and now they have nearly a 1,000.”He fondly recalls the bamboo-based furniture and the thatched roofs under which he taught. “Now the schools have better infrastructure, but a lot more needs to be done. Arunachal needs more full-time teachers, especially those with training in the English language.”Although he laments that the state of education in Arunachal is still basic, he wants to try whatever he can to help. “Sometimes I try and train the teachers as well; a lot of them find it difficult to converse in English.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ninong-ering-union-minister-turned-mla-who-is-also-a-part-time-teacher-101611197221680.html

According to the party's media in-charge Manish Dixit, during the visit Nadda will hold various meetings and attend other programmes.On Thursday, Nadda will hold meetings with BJP office bearers and later in the day meet Uttar Pradesh ministers at the BJP office here.The BJP national president will on Friday address a conference of social media volunteers and intellectuals and also attend a meeting of Chinhat rural area and booth and district presidents, Dixit said.According to Hindustan Times' sister publication Livehindustan, Nadda will also hold crucial meeting with party workers in the wake of next year's Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.The visit also comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trusted bureaucrat Arvind Sharma joined the BJP and got nominated to the upper house of the UP Assembly.Sharma's nomination to the legislative council had led to speculation about his possible induction in the state government.Nadda completed the first year as BJP president on Wednesday. On the occasion, he wrote an open letter to BJP workers lauding the party's recent victory in a number of state and local body polls and setting the target of “historic” wins in the next round of assembly elections.Nadda, who had taken over from Union home minister Amit Shah on January 20 last year, also praised the party's welfare work during the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-jp-nadda-on-two-day-visit-to-up-from-today-101611195934815.html
21-01-2021||India||Day after rejecting alternative route, farmers likely to meet cops again over proposed tractor rally||The farmers are expected to meet the police officials in Delhi on Thursday over their proposed tractor rally on Republic Day. This will be the second meeting over the issue in two days.On Wednesday, officers of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana police had met the farmer unions to discuss the route and arrangements of the proposed rally on January 26. The cops suggested an alternate route, but the farmers rejected it.According to news agency PTI, farmer leaders were given the option to take out their rally on the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway, but they did not agree.They want to take out the rally on the Outer Ring Road which passes through several areas of Delhi such as Vikaspuri, Janakpuri, Uttam Nagar, Burari Peeragarhi and Pitampura. The farmer unions said their preparations are in full swing and authorities should facilitate the "peaceful march", instead of stopping it.The rally has been opposed by the Centre and the police. The Centre filed a petition in the Supreme Court through Delhi Police seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor or trolley march or any other kind of protest, which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of the Republic Day on January 26.The Centre has said the right to protest can never include "maligning the nation globally".However, the top court turned down the plea, saying the matter must be decided by the police. The bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, said police have the authority to deal with the issues pertaining to the proposed tractor rally.The farmers have been protesting near Delhi for nearly 60 days against the three farm laws passed by Parliament. The proposed tractor rally is against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Ten rounds of talks have taken place till now over the issue. While the farmers want the government to repeal the three laws, the Centre has proposed to suspend three contentious agricultural laws for one-and-a-half years. The step back came during the tenth round of talks on Wednesday. The farmers said they will discuss the government’s offer on January 21, and make their stand clear when the next round of talks takes place on January 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-likely-to-meet-police-officers-today-over-proposed-tractor-rally-101611194108303.html
21-01-2021||India||Congress steps up attack on Centre over Arnab Goswami's chats||Stepping up its attack over WhatsApp chat leaks of Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami that showed the former may have had advance knowledge of the Balakot strike in 2019, the Congress party on Wednesday rallied its top guns to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah on what the party alleged was a breach of national security.A day after former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi demanded a probe of the matter, the Congress fielded former defence minister AK Antony, former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, the United Progressive Alliance government’s foreign minister Salman Khurshid and Rajya Sabha leader of the Opposition, Ghulam Nabi Azad, to allege that “the Arnab Goswami saga reveals an ugly spectre of inexcusable compromise with national security and an unforgivable trade off with the oath of Constitution by the Prime Minister-Home Minister and those holding high offices.”In a purported WhatsApp chat with Partho Dasgupta, former chief executive officer of the television viewership measurement agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), three days before the Indian Air Force strike on a terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan, Goswami is purported to have said that “something big” would happen soon. The chat transcripts were part of a chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police last week.The Congress leaders claimed in a statement that the chats “conclusively prove leaks of top secret information detrimental to national security & integrity” and held members of Cabinet committee on security responsible for the leak.“The responsible Minister/Official violated the OSA (Official Secrets Act) and the Constitutional Oath of Secrecy- should be brought to book and sacked,” the Congress leaders said.“The confidence with which Arnab Goswami flaunts his proximity with the Prime Minister and his office is shocking,” the leaders added.Reacting to the developments, Goswami, in a statement on Tuesday, said: “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-steps-up-attack-on-centre-over-arnab-goswami-s-chats-101611192401766.html
21-01-2021||India||Bhutan, Maldives first to benefit from India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’||Bhutan and the Maldives on Wednesday became the first countries in India’s neighbourhood to benefit from the government’s roll-out of millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines under a grant assistance programme dubbed “Vaccine Maitri”.Two aircraft took off several hours apart, carrying 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccine for Thimphu and 100,000 doses for Male. The external affairs ministry has said India will initially provide vaccines to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles.On Thursday, India will supply two million doses of Covishield to Bangladesh and another million doses to Nepal. This assistance reflects the government’s commitment to “Neighbourhood First” policy, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.With the shipping of doses to Bhutan and the Maldives, India also became the first country to provide South Asian nations with vaccines as aid.Bhutan’s Prime Minister Lotay Tshering, health minister Dechen Wangmo and senior officials received the vaccines ferried by an Indian Air Force aircraft to Paro international airport.“As we celebrate the arrival of vaccines as the new milestone in our battle to beat the pandemic at home, we applaud the gesture that signifies the compassion and generosity of the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, and the people of India for the well-being of humanity,” Tshering said. “It is of unimaginable value when precious commodities are shared even before meeting your own needs, as opposed to giving out only after you have enough,” he added.New Delhi has assured Thimphu that it will “cover the two doses requirement of Bhutan’s target population of slightly over 533,500 and has committed to deliver the remaining consignments soon”, said a statement from Tshering’s office.In the Maldives, President Ibrahim Solih thanked India for supplying the vaccines during a televised address to the nation. “The government had commenced the work of obtaining vaccines for the entire population,” he said.During a ceremony to hand over the vaccines, Indian high commissioner Sunjay Sudhir said the Maldives had received the doses within 96 hours of the nationwide roll-out in India, highlighting the country’s special place in India’s foreign policy. It also bolstered India’s credentials as the first responder for the Maldives during emergency situations, he said.India will also help the Maldives secure vaccines at affordable rates from Indian manufacturers, the people cited above said. “The vaccines being supplied are made by the Serum Institute of India in Pune. The relevance of an Atmanirbhar Bharat is reiterated through this timely delivery of ‘Made in India’ vaccines,” said one person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhutan-maldives-first-to-benefit-from-india-s-vaccine-maitri-101611191910201.html
21-01-2021||India||One in 3 new coronavirus cases recorded in Kerala||More than one in every three new Covid-19 cases recorded in India over the last week have come from Kerala, a state that is defying the national trend of falling infections and has been the biggest outbreak centre in the country since late October.The latest statistic -- Kerala recorded 6,815 new cases on Wednesday, and 37% of all cases reported across the country since January 13 have been in the state -- has health experts worried, even as state government points to a low case fatality rate (CFR) to contend that the pandemic is under control.“Due to our effective intervention we delayed the peak and controlled death rate considerably. Our death rate is still lowest in the country, below 0.4% when the national average is more than 1.4%,” state health minister KK Shailaja said, adding that timely government intervention delayed the peak and saved many lives.A low CFR means that while the pandemic may have affected a high number of people, fewer are dying of the coronavirus on account of either effective treatment or immediate isolation following detection.Yet, the continuing high numbers -- for example, Kerala’s share in new cases across India went to as high as 45% on Tuesday -- has led experts to call for changes in the state’s Covid management strategy. They have called for the government to increase testing, and to increase the number of RT-PCR tests, which have a lower rate of false negatives than antigen tests.The test positivity rate in the state stood at 11.8% on Wednesday as against 1.8% across India.“The situation is really serious. Test rate of the state is still poor and emphasis is on antigen tests. At least 40% of tests are still antigen. The government will have to rope in more experts and engage private players in a big way before it is too late,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal.Since India’s Covid-19 peak in its first and only wave, the national case trajectory has dropped 85% — from 93,617 on September 16 to 14,376 on January 19. In Kerala, by contrast, the case trajectory has dropped only 34% —from 8,728 cases (seven-day average) on October 13 to 5,374 cases a day in the past week.The health minister attributed the high caseload to the local body elections held in December, and the festive season which began in September and continued till New Year’s eve. She asked people not to lower their guard. “We have noticed some people behave as if a remedy is around (in terms of the vaccine) and refuse to take precautions. Many fail to turn up for tests and vaccinations as well. It is not good,” she said.The state has also seen a series of unlocks, with some restrictions, in the past few months. Last month, local body elections were held, and hotels and bars were opened. On January 1, schools were opened for Class 10 and 12 students, and on January 13, cinema halls were opened at half capacity. Spas and ayurvedic resorts have also opened in the state owing to a revenue loss of an estimated ₹15,000 crore to the exchequer, the state tourism minister said earlier this month.(With inputs from Jamie Mullick)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-in-3-new-coronavirus-cases-recorded-in-kerala-101611191313693.html
21-01-2021||India||JP Nadda hails BJP cadre, sets goal of ‘historic’ poll wins||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Wednesday lauded the party’s latest victories in various state and local body elections and set the target of “historic” wins in the next round of elections slated to be held this year.Assembly elections are scheduled to be held in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and West Bengal in 2021.In an open letter to party workers, Nadda exuded confidence that the ‘lotus’, the party’s poll symbol, will bloom in West Bengal after the assembly elections.The BJP chief, who completed a year in office after taking over the role from Union minister Amit Shah on January 20 last year, congratulated party cadres for working “tirelessly and with full devotion” during the Covid-19 pandemic and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “putting the brakes on the corona cases” through the country’s own Covaxin produced by vaccine maker Bharat Biotech.He said that the BJP had set an example of how a political party can “effectively work as a potent tool of social service and help people in times of need”.“As a leading political party our goal is to win elections and work tirelessly for the goodwill and betterment of common people; but how a political party can effectively work as a potent tool of social service and help people in times of need, the world has witnessed an unmatched example of this through your service and hard work during the Corona pandemic,” he wrote.During the nationwide lockdown that was imposed to check the spread of Covid-19, the party chief had set a target for the workers to feed five families each day, besides ensuring the availability of basic necessities for the needy.The BJP leader also referred to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the contentious agricultural bills and the Citizenship Amendment Act and termed the concerns raised by the opposition parties as “misleading”.He lauded the efforts of party workers in West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala where, he said, the teams worked “under very adverse circumstances”.Recollecting the attack he faced during a rally in Bengal when his convoy was pelted with stones, Nadda said, “When a person like me, who is the national president of India’s largest political party and who is always covered with security personnel, had to face a murderous assault in daylight while on a visit to West Bengal, it can be well imagined how difficult it would be for a common BJP worker to work under such tough and demanding circumstances.”He also credited the Prime Minister for producing the Covid vaccine. “...India reported the least death rate while our recovery rate kept on improving. Yet again in response to the call of the honourable Prime Minister our scientists were successful in making Corona vaccines, a feat which only 4 to 5 nations have been able to achieve,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jp-nadda-hails-bjp-cadre-sets-goal-of-historic-poll-wins-101611190377641.html
21-01-2021||India||Bird flu: New cases trigger second wave concerns||A second wave of bird flu seems to be underway in some Indian states with fresh cases of the virus reported from Kerala after a hiatus of about 10 days and suspected cases surfacing in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.The first case of bird flu was reported from Jhalawar in Rajasthan on December 29, and the infections, deadly for birds, spread to 10 other states, resulting in the deaths of thousands of poultry, and hundreds of common crows and some migratory species. The animal husbandry departments of state governments have culled hundreds of thousands of birds to prevent the spread.On Wednesday, Kerala was on high alert after fresh cases of bird flu were reported from Alapuzha, said the state animal husbandry department, after the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases confirmed the presence of virus in at least 300 samples.Officials said the culling of birds will begin anew on Thursday and in the first phase 5,000, mostly ducks, will be destroyed. In early January , at least 80,000 ducks and 10,000 chicken were culled in Alapuzha and Kottayam districts and the Centre dispatched a high-level team to the state.In Chhattisgarh, at least 45 mynas were found dead near a Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF) camp in Bijapur district of Bastar region, officials said on Wednesday. Samples of five mynas have been sent for avian influenza tests, they said.“There is a CRPF camp in Naimad area where the carcasses of the birds were found on Monday and Tuesday. We rushed to the spot and sent five dead birds for tests on Tuesday evening,” said AP Dohare, deputy director of veterinary services.In Jharkhand, around 200 pigeons were found dead in Hazaribag and authorities have scrambled teams there.The department has so far sent 4,300 samples of birds from across the state to a Kolkata lab for testing but no death due to the virus has been confirmed yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-new-cases-trigger-second-wave-concerns-101611190145903.html
21-01-2021||India||4-1 verdict: Supreme Court dismisses pleas seeking Aadhaar ruling review||Even as one of the five judges on the bench termed it a “constitutional error,” the Supreme Court by a majority verdict has dismissed a clutch of petitions seeking a review of its 2018 judgment that validated the Aadhaar Act.By 4-1, a constitution bench affirmed the verdict delivered in September 2018 when the top court upheld the country’s biometric identity system and also cleared mandatory Aadhaar enrolment of recipients of government welfare benefits. The court, in its verdict, had also approved the passage of Aadhaar law by the Parliament as a money bill, which did not require an approval of the Rajya Sabha.The SC considered the bunch of review petitions in judges’ chambers on January 11. The court order was released on Wednesday, in which the five-judge bench, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, held that “no case for review” of the 2018 judgment was made out. Other judges signing off on the majority view were justices Ashok Bhushan, SA Nazeer and BR Gavai. Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud disagreed and wrote a separate order, suggesting that any decision must wait for a larger bench to determine whether the Aadhaar verdict was correct in interpreting what could constitute a “money bill.” In split verdicts, the view of the majority holds.“This is an interesting judgment. Even though one judge on the bench has dissented, the court did not allow a hearing in the open court for the lawyers to make arguments. Open court arguments, I feel, was imperative in this situation. We still have the legal remedy of moving a curative petition. We will consider this option in due course,” said Prasanna S, a lawyer associated with several petitioners in the matter.The majority view refused to await a word from the larger bench, as it declined to take into account a subsequent judgment in 2019 by another five-judge bench. That bench had raised doubts on the correctness of the Aadhaar verdict, and preferred that a seven-judge-bench re-examine it. The seven-judge-bench is yet to be constituted.The majority view in the Aadhaar case has said that the 2019 judgment was not sufficient to press for a reconsideration of the 2018 Aadhaar judgment.“We hasten to add that change in the law or subsequent decision/judgment of a coordinate or larger bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review. The review petitions are accordingly dismissed,” it held.Justice Chandrachud dissented with the majority view and said that the 2019 judgment questioning the correctness of the Aadhaar verdict was a relevant fact and that the apex court must wait for the larger bench of seven judges to decide these pertinent issues.“With the doubt expressed by another constitution bench on the correctness of the very decision which is the subject matter of these review petitions, it is a constitutional error to hold at this stage that no ground exists to review the judgment,” said Justice Chandrachud, who had in the 2018 judgment also held that Aadhaar could not have been passed as a money bill.In his separate order, the judge added that dismissal of the review petitions without waiting for the larger bench’s decision would place a seal of finality on the issues in the present case, without the court having the benefit of the larger bench’s consideration of the very issues which arise before the bench.Justice Chandrachud concluded: “As such, the present batch of review petitions should be kept pending until the larger bench decides the questions referred to it in Rojer Mathew (2019 case). In all humility, I conclude that the constitutional principles of consistency and the rule of law would require that a decision on the review petitions should await the reference to the larger bench.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/41-verdict-supreme-court-dismisses-pleas-seeking-aadhaar-ruling-review-101611189869910.html
21-01-2021||India||Supreme Court turns down plea seeking to stop farmers’ tractor rally||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stop a proposed tractor rally in capital on January 26 by the farmers protesting against the contentious agricultural laws, and questioned why the Centre was looking for its nod on an issue relating to law and order.Declining to pass any order on the plea by the government, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, remarked that it was not for the court to remind the authorities of the policing power they have by passing an order in this regard.“Does the Union of India need Supreme Court to tell what powers it has under the Police Act? Why do you want us to tell what powers you have?” the bench asked Attorney General KK Venugopal, who implored the court to issue a prohibitory order on the application of the Delhi Police so as to injunct farmers’ groups from causing any disruptions in the Republic Day celebrations by taking out tractor rally or any other processions.CJI makes indirect appeal to farmersSeparately, CJI Bobde made an indirect appeal to the farmers to come on board and meet with the court-appointed committee that has been tasked with finding ways to address the impasse.After being told that none of the farm unions protesting on the Delhi border wants to meet with the court-appointed committee, the CJI Bobde urged Prashant Bhushan, the lawyer for some of the unions, “In cases such as this, it may not be enough to act only as a lawyer. We would want you to counsel your clients in a way that it brings peace.

Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses...” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.The spokesperson said WhatsApp protects personal messages with end-to-end encryption, which ensures that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can access them. “We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions,” the spokesperson said.The Centre, in a letter dated January 18, asked WhatsApp to withdraw the latest changes to its policy that triggered boycott calls and said the “unilateral changes” are unfair and unacceptable.Facebook-owned WhatsApp rolled out a new privacy policy recently that included mandatory sharing of data with its parent company.The tweak triggered backlash, with users moving en masse to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.On January 16, WhatsApp delayed the introduction of the changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-backs-policy-says-addressing-misinformation-101611189190384.html
21-01-2021||India||Electoral rolls, not NRC, to determine voters in Assam: Election Commission||The Election Commission of India (ECI) made it clear on Wednesday that those living in Assam whose names are missing from the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC), but are listed in the electoral rolls can vote in the assembly elections due in April-May this year.“A union home ministry notification dated August 29, 2019 clearly stated {that} non-inclusion of a person’s name in NRC doesn’t amount to him/her being declared a foreigner. By implication, such persons remain in voters’ list and shall be eligible to vote until a decision is taken by the concerned tribunal,” said Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora.Around 1.9 million (of 33 million applicants) were left out of the updated NRC published for Assam on Augst 31, 2019. The NRC was a list intended to identify legal residents and weed out illegal immigrants from Assam. Those left out of the updated NRC were given the option of appealing to foreigners’ tribunals.“The NRC is yet to be notified and several matters related to it are still pending in Supreme Court. Hence, there no question of our party reacting to the CEC’s remarks on allowing those left out of the NRC to vote,” said Roopam Goswami, a spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The NRC is yet to be become a legal document hence it is desirable that till it is notified, those left out of it should be allowed to vote. But we also want that the updated NRC is notified soon as it was one of the promises made by the BJP prior to coming to power in Assam in 2016,” said Debabrata Saikia, leader of the Congress legislature party in the Assam assembly.NRC is expected to be a poll issue in a state where there has always been a distrust of outsiders.“There’s no link of NRC with voters’ list as the latter is not updated with inputs from the former. Additionally, the Registrar General of India is yet to notify the updated NRC. So, if those left out of NRC are allowed to vote based on their listing in electoral rolls, there’s nothing to be surprised about,” said Abhijeet Sharma of the Assam Public Works (APW), a Guwahati-based non-government organisation whose petition in the Supreme Court had led to the start of the NRC updating process in 2015.Arora spoke to reporters in Guwahati on the last day of a three-day visit by a high-level ECI team to the state to take stock of its preparedness for the upcoming polls.Arora said the election in Assam will be held keeping in mind the Bohag Bihu festival that falls in mid-April and the poll process would be over before May, on the day the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examination starts.Because of Covid-19 safety protocols, the ECI has decided to reduce the average number of voters in each polling station from 1,500 to nearly 1,000. This would lead to an increase of around 5,500 polling stations in the state; total number of polling stations could reach 33,000.“We will be giving Covid-19 kit to polling teams and in order to further decongest polling spaces and allow more free movement of voters, polling time has been increased by one hour,” said Arora.“Nomination forms and affidavits can be filled by candidates online and print out submitted to returning officers. Security money can also be paid online. Number of persons accompanying candidates at the time of filing of nomination has been restricted to two,” he added.Door-to-door campaigning will be restricted to five persons, including the candidate. Road shows are allowed subject to a convoy being broken up every half-an-hour. District deputy commissioners will ensure maintenance of social distancing norms at election rallies.Arora mentioned that discussions are under way to ensure the vaccination of poll officials for Covid-19 before the elections and added that the t law and order situation in Assam was “under control.".“The voluntary code of ethics agreed upon by social media platforms during interactions with EC would apply to Assam election as well to ensure social media doesn’t play a mischievous role in inciting violence and communal riots,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/electoral-rolls-not-nrc-to-determine-voters-in-assam-election-commission-101611188802621.html

21-01-2021||India||CBI arrests two of its officials in bribery case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested its deputy superintendent of police (DSP), R K Rishi, inspector Kapil Dhankad and an advocate Manohar Malik in connection with its probe into a “bribes-for-relief” scandal in the agency, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.Rishi, who is accused of running a well-oiled racket in the central anti-corruption agency along with another DSP, R K Sangwan, Dhankad, a stenographer Sameer Kumar Singh and some lawyers for extending favours to private companies under investigation in bank fraud cases, was arrested on Tuesday night, the people cited above added.The allegation is that crucial case related information and documents have been leaked since 2018 to individuals/companies being investigated for bank frauds.Rishi’s home in Deoband (Uttar Pradesh) and his wife’s residence in Roorkee (Uttarakhand) were also searched by a team.The agency claims to have already established that Rishi took ₹30 lakh bribe in two tranches for facilitating the leak of information from the agency and that Dhankad had taken around ₹25 lakh from two companies.A case was registered last week naming four CBI officers , Rishi (deployed in CBI academy at Ghaziabad), Sangwan (DSP in Special Crimes Unit), Dhankad (Inspector in Bank Securities and Fraud Cell) and Singh (Stenographer in BS&FC); two lawyers , Manohar Malik and Arvind Kumar Gupta; and Mandeep Kaur Dhillon (additional director of a company, Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd) and Sujai Desai and Udai Desai of Mumbai based company Frost International Pvt Ltd, who alleged paid the bribes and sought information on the probes from CBI.According to the CBI First Information Report, the four CBI officers, along with two advocates, and certain other accused have been “compromising the integrity of investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”.Both Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd (SSPBML) and Frost International are being investigated by the premier investigating agency for defrauding banks. The case against Frost International was registered in August 2020 for cheating 14 banks of over ₹3,500 crore.CBI’s FIR states that “in the case of SSPNML, RK Sangwan, who was the previous investigating officer in the case, offered and paid a bribe of ₹10 lakh in cash on behalf of Mandeep Kaur to Inspector Kapil Dhankad”. “On his part, Dhankad conveyed confidential information relating to the investigation of this case to RK Sangwan, with an intention to favour the accused.”It is further alleged that RK Rishi paid ₹10 lakh bribe to Dhankad on behalf of the Desais of Frost International.For facilitating the bribe, Rishi received ₹15 lakh twice through advocates Malik and Gupta to extend favours to a Chandigarh based company against which a corruption case was being investigated by CBI, the FIR adds. “In this matter, Dhankad twice received ₹2.5 lakh from Gupta for having brokered the deal through Rishi,” read the CBI FIR.Rishi, Dhankad and Malik were produced before a court on Wednesday.The accused’s legal representatives could not be located for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-two-of-its-officials-in-bribery-case-101611187925548.html
21-01-2021||India||Supreme Court irked over criticism of farm committee picks||The Supreme Court on Wednesday strongly defended its choice of members for the committee that will weigh in on the contentious farm laws, and cautioned critics against attributing motives to the court or “maligning” members of the panel just because they had in the past come out in favour of these legislation aimed at opening up farm markets.An SC bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde disapproved of the criticism, saying that “public opinion will not determine who should be a member and who should not” and that it had “serious objections” to people and the press casting aspersions either on members of the panel or the apex court.“If you muster a public opinion to malign people, brand people, should that be a ground of disqualification? We have very serious objections to our members being called names, accused of bias etc. And then they say this court had some interest. What interest can we have? We entered into this in the interest of common people, especially farmers,” commented the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Emphasising that people have the right to hold an opinion and they were also entitled to change it at a later point in time like judges do sometimes, the CJI added that the members of this committee had reputations none of their critics actually had.“They are some of the best minds, brilliant minds in this country. You cannot brand people like this. We are not forcing anyone to appear before the committee but there is no need to brand people, and on top of that, cast aspersion on the court. The Supreme Court appoints people and their reputations are torn to shreds like this. We don’t understand this. How lightly can this be taken?” asked the CJI.The bench’s outburst was triggered by a plea by advocate Ajay Choudhary, who appeared for a farmers’ organisation from Rajasthan, Kisan Mahapanchayat. Choudhary had moved an application for reconstitution of the committee, which the court appointed on January 12 when it also stayed the implementation of the three laws in question.The composition of this four-member committee triggered a controversy since all four had previously made statements in support of the reforms. The criticism was such that one of the members, BS Mann, later chose to leave the panel, expressing solidarity with the farmers.The other three members are Pramod Kumar Joshi, the director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, New Delhi; agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and Anil Ghanwat of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a Maharashtra-based farm union. Gulati is the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the advisory body of the Government of India on food supplies and pricing policies.While Choudhary cited various news reports about the committee members, senior counsel Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, on being asked, said the eight farm unions, which they represented and were currently a part of the protest, had nothing to do with the composition of the committee because they did not want to engage with it at all.At this point, apart from Choudhary, advocate AP Singh also pressed his application on behalf of the Bharatiya Kisan Union - Lokshakti, demanding removal of the other three members, alleging bias.The bench was livid. “This has become almost a cultural thing to brand people and criticise them for one reason or another. The committee has not been given any power of adjudication. They only have been given the power of hearing parties. So, where is the question of a bias? If you don’t want to appear, don’t appear but why do you have to brand people like this? We are very sorry to see the kind of opinions published in the media.”The court then asked attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the Central government, to formally respond to the plea on reconstitution of the committee, and also address the issue of a vacancy that has arisen after Mann’s resignation.Meanwhile, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre and Delhi Police in the matter, supported the bench, saying it was unfortunate to see the kind of attacks being made on the committee members.Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for a Delhi resident, implored the bench to clarify that the committee’s role was confined to assisting the court and that it would do so even if no farmer union appeared before the panel. Salve added he was inclined to move a contempt plea if the committee members were “wrongly” criticised in the press.At this, the bench included in its order a portion to the effect that the committee had not been set up to adjudge any issue but to only hear the parties. The committee’s role, the court order said, “is to share the grievances of the parties affected by the impugned legislations and make a report to the court.”Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 26, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops. Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the minimum support prices and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporate entities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-irked-over-criticism-of-farm-committee-picks-101611187535464.html
21-01-2021||India||Government writes to WhatsApp, asks it to withdraw new privacy policy||The government has written to WhatsApp head Will Cathcart asking him to “respect the informational privacy and data security of Indian users” and withdraw the latest terms and privacy policy in India proposed by the messaging service for users. In a letter, it has expressed strong concerns over the policy days after HT on January 11 reported that the government was closely examining the matter.WhatsApp on January 4 updated its privacy policy to allow it to share user data with its parent company Facebook and other group firms . The data includes location and phone number.The move has triggered a backlash across the world and led to a surge in the downloading of alternative messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram. India is WhatsApp’s biggest market with 400 million users.The government has sent a questionnaire to WhatsApp seeking more details about its data-sharing protocols and business practices. It has sought the exact categories of data that the application collects from Indian users, details of the permissions and user consent sought by and utility of each of these with respect to the functioning and specific service provided. The service has been asked whether it profiles users based on their use of the application.The government has also sought details of the difference between WhatsApp’s privacy policies in India and other countries along with details of its data security, information security, cyber-security, privacy, and encryption policies.A WhatsApp spokesperson said, “We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.”Also read | The government can, and must, stand for privacyThe government has highlighted the latest policy will lead to the collection of “a vast amount of highly invasive and granular metadata”.“With this, any meaningful distinction between WhatsApp and Facebook companies will cease to exist. Given the huge user base of WhatsApp and Facebook in India, the consolidation of this sensitive information also exposes a very large segment of Indian citizens to greater security risks and vulnerabilities creating a honeypot of information,” a person familiar with the matter said, citing the contents of the letter to the WhatsApp chief.“This all-or-nothing approach takes away any meaningful choice from Indian users. This approach leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain, which may infringe on their interests in relation to informational privacy and information security. It is expected that Facebook will value the principles of privacy and consent as laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment of Justice K S Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017). The PDP [Personal Data Protection] Bill is under consideration, then why these changes.”The letter noted the “integration of data between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies” denies the user the choice to opt out of the policy.Also read | Don’t use WhatsApp if concerned about data: Delhi HCThe government has “raised strong objections against the differential treatment by WhatsApp to its users in India and in the European Union”. It added this has triggered serious criticism and “shows lack of respect for the rights and interests of Indian citizens, who form one of the largest user bases for WhatsApp”.The government underlined such treatment is “prejudicial to the interests of Indian users and is viewed with serious concern. “In this context, it [the letter] reminds WhatsApp that the Government of India owes a sovereign responsibility to its citizens to ensure that their interests are not compromised and therefore it calls upon WhatsApp to respond to concerns raised in this letter,” said the person cited above.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has summoned Facebook officials on January 21 amid privacy concerns about WhatsApp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-writes-to-whatsapp-asks-it-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-101611186928426.html
21-01-2021||India||Centre says can put farm laws on hold for 1.5 years||The Union government on Wednesday proposed to suspend three contentious agricultural laws for one-and-a-half years, taking a step back to try and assuage farmers with its most far-reaching proposal yet to end months-long protests against the legislation passed in Parliament in September.In the 10th round of negotiations with a 41-member delegation representing protesting farm unions on Wednesday, the government said it will move an affidavit before the Supreme Court to put the laws in abeyance till a solution to the farmers’ demands is found. Leaders of major farm unions who took part in the talks said they will discuss the government’s offer on January 21, and make their stand clear when the next round of talks takes place on January 22.To discuss the farmers’ issues, which include a law guaranteeing assured prices for their produce, the government also told farm unions that it proposed to set up a committee of representatives as well as experts who should be nominated both by the protesters and the government to examine “all agitation-related issues”.“The talks were held on the solemn occasion of Guru Parab, the birth anniversary of (Sikh) Guru Govind Singh. Farmers have agreed to discuss our proposal and I believe that we will move towards success on January 22, when we meet again,” Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the talks concluded at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhavan on Wednesday.Farm unions have not rejected the government’s offer outright, unlike in the past, and said it was a proposal worth discussing, which offers a glimmer of hope to end the standoff. The unions will hold a two-tier discussion on January 21 to discuss the government’s proposal.The government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.Farmers staging a massive protest on several of Delhi’s border points say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. The agriculture minister said the government proposed to put the laws on hold till such time a committee representing both farm unions and the government finalised its “recommendations on what should be done with the laws”.On January 12, after two days of deliberation, the Supreme Court had suspended the farm laws. Judges dealing with the case also appointed a committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws.Tomar said the Supreme Court had put the laws in abeyance for a short time. “Our proposal is to put the laws on hold for a full year-and-a half or even more till a solution is found.” He added that if farmers accepted the proposal in principle, then the government would begin work on setting up the committee and its modalities, adding that the laws would be suspended so that the panel could find a settlement.“The government has proposed to put the laws on hold for one-and-half years but at the same time, it has accepted that the time frame could be fixed according to a mutually agreeable duration. That could be two or even three years,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farmers’ representative.According to senior farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, the farm unions “feel the proposal is worth discussing but a decision will only be collectively taken and thorough discussions will take place tomorrow”.“We told the government we still want a repeal but we will discuss the government’s offer,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-can-put-farm-laws-on-hold-for-1-5-years-101611186008238.html
21-01-2021||India||Covid: South African, Brazilian strains raise new fears on vaccines, immunity||Mutations of the Sars-Cov-2 virus found in South Africa and Brazil have begun worrying authorities and scientists who say that these – they are distinct from the new variant first found in the UK – could trigger more re-infections, even reduce vaccine efficacy, though more tests are underway.The first major mutation of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was reported from the UK in the so-called B.1.1.7 variant (also called VOC202012/01) ; authorities said in December that it was more infectious, and it was later seen as a factor in leading to the country’s worst wave yet.Scientists also discovered a handful of other significantly mutated strains. Two of these, B.1.351, found in South Africa, and P.1 found in Brazil, now seem like they can escape, at least partly, the immune response in people who have been vaccinated or were infected earlier, preliminary studies and government reports published this week say.“It is possible that these mutations and others that emerge in individuals with suboptimal or waning immunity will erode the effectiveness of natural- and vaccine-elicited immunity. The data suggests that Sars-CoV-2 vaccines may need to be updated,” said a team led by researchers from Rockefeller University in a study submitted to Biorxiv on January 19.Mutations in a virus are a natural phenomenon and the Sars-Cov-2 was seen to be gaining two significant mutations every month. But in December, researchers began discovering some strains with unusually high number of mutations – the UK-associated strain has 23 changes, the South Africa-linked one has eight and the Brazil-linked one has 20.Among these changes are N501Y and E484K. These letters refer to descriptions of how a particular portion of the virus has changed – these in particular are all changes in the Spike protein, the component that the virus uses to infect cells. Of these, N501Y has been linked to the virus becoming more infective, while E484K is the mutation that possibly makes the virus more resistant.The variant in UK carries N501Y, the one seen in Brazil carries E484K and the one seen in South Africa has both.The researchers took these mutations for laboratory tests to check how immune cells triggered by vaccines reacted to them. With plasma from 14 people who received the Moderna vaccine and from six who got the Pfizer-BioNTech dose, they saw a “modest” but significant drop in how the immune cells neutralised the mutated strains as compared to how they neutralised the older one.Similar findings were shared by South African authorities on January 18. The variant B.1.351 (which contains E484K) did not react with antibodies in 21 out of 44 serum samples collected from people infected in the first wave, South African scientist Salim Abdool Karim said at a discussion streamed online on January 18.There is also at least one confirmed case of re-infection caused by the P1 variant (which too has E484K). This was detailed by Brazilian researchers in a study published on January 18, detailing the case of a 29-year-old woman in Manaus, Brazil, who developed a symptomatic infection in March. In late December, she was infected again with symptoms such as fever. Genetic sequencing showed the second infection was with the P1 variant.The Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium said the emergence of such variants raises the concern that there might be an evolutionary convergence that could make the virus capable of spreading faster and harder to fight. “However, the effect of this mutation in relation to natural immune or immunity from vaccination has yet to be determined,” they added in a report released on January 19.Researchers also say that the evolution of Sars-Cov-2 at present does not pose a major risk since the changes seen even till now do not make existing immunity (from older infections) or vaccines completely obsolete.It ties into projections that Covid-19 could become endemic, where it will be able to keep circulating by evolving but not lead to as debilitating effect. “What the long-term effect of accumulation of mutations on the Sars-CoV-2 on the pandemic will be is not known, but the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E evolves antigenic variants that are comparatively resistant to the older sera but remain sensitive to contemporaneous sera,” the researchers in the first study said.In a study published in Science on January 12, a team led by researchers from Emory University used transmission modelling and estimates of immunity prevalence to suggest that once Sars-Cov-2 becomes endemic, it will resemble a common cold since childhood infections will confer protection against severe disease later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-south-african-brazilian-strains-raise-new-fears-on-vaccines-immunity-101611184220986.html
21-01-2021||India||Covaxin recipients to be monitored for three months after second dose||Covaxin recipients will be monitored for three months after getting the 2nd dose for any adverse reactions, according to a detailed plan released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in an attempt to dispel safety concerns about the vaccine whose efficacy data isn’t publicly known.If a serious adverse event is linked to vaccination, then the recipient will be compensated based on the national drug controller’s recommendations after thorough investigation, said the plan. Covaxin is one of two vaccines – the other being the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine known locally as Covishield – being used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme that kicked off on Saturday. It was developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR, which released the plan on January 18.For the first 35 days after the first dose of the vaccine, the recipients will be actively monitored, said the document. For seven days after taking each dose, the recipient will have to will have to document their health condition in writing, and submit the form to health authorities. The second dose of the vaccine is administered 28 days after the first.A district-level team will contact and enquire about any adverse events over phone, added the document.“Day 1-7: The vaccine recipients will be given an adverse event form to record the adverse events. Day 8-27: The vaccine recipients will inform the vaccination site, if they have encountered any health-related issues or adverse events. The vaccine recipients will return the adverse event form during the visit for the administration of the second dose of vaccine (Day 28),” said the plan.“Visit 2 (Day 28): The vaccine recipients will be administered the second dose… Day 28-35: The vaccine recipients will be given an adverse event form to record the adverse events... The vaccine recipients will inform the site, if they have encountered any health-related issues or adverse events. Vaccine recipients will return the filled-in adverse event reporting form after completion of 7 days post-vaccination,” it added. “All the vaccine recipients will be followed-up for a period of 3 months after the second dose of vaccination,” the document added.According to the plan, any report of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), including serious ones, will be submitted to the designated immunisation officer or health care worker. Vaccination officers will also help in providing psychological support to recipients.Causality assessment of all severe adverse events, medical management and compensation will be determined by the existing practices under the government immunisation program and central ethics committee as appropriate.“In case of any adverse events or serious adverse events, vaccine recipients will be provided medically recognized standard of care in the government designated respective state hospitals,” the plan said.Experts say safety is not a concern with Covaxin, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. “The studies are done in a robust manner, and the data that has so far been generated has already established Covaxin’s safety profile. So, safety isn’t a concern,” said Dr MC Misra, former director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Bharat Biotech developed Covaxin in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research.Individuals with the following conditions will not be eligible for vaccination: Those with a history of allergies; those with fever, bleeding disorder or those who are on blood thinners; those who are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects their immune system; are pregnant; are breastfeeding; have received another Covid-19 vaccine; any other serious health related.Side effects reported with Covaxin include injection site pain, swelling, redness, itching, stiffness in the upper arm, weakness in injection arm, body ache, headache, fever, malaise, weakness, rashes, nausea and vomiting. There is a chance that the vaccine may cause a severe allergic reaction that includes difficulty in breathing, swelling of face and throat, fast heart beat, body rash, dizziness, and weakness.“These may not be all the possible side effects… Serious and unexpected side effects may occur... Covaxin is still being studied in clinical trials,” the document said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-recipients-to-be-monitored-for-three-months-after-second-dose-101611183910202.html
21-01-2021||India||Congress Working Committee meet on Jan 22 with eye on party polls||Five months after the Congress’ interim president Sonia Gandhi asked the party to relieve her from the top post, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet on Friday to draw up a schedule for the long-pending organisational elections that could also pick a new party chief, people aware of the developments said on Wednesday.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi is widely preferred within the party to replace Sonia Gandhi as efforts to pick a non-Gandhi party president have not succeeded in the past two years ago. Sonia Gandhi offered to step down at a CWC meet last August following a letter by more than 20 prominent party leaders that demanded an “active, full-time and visible” president.“It will be a meeting of the full CWC,” a senior Congress leader said on condition of anonymity. The meet will include 19 members, 26 permanent invitees and nine special invitees other than the Congress president.No agenda, however, has been circulated so far for the meeting that will begin at 10.30am on Friday, according to the person quoted above. But party insiders pointed out that during the eventful meeting of CWC in August last year, it was decided that the next meeting will be held within six months to decide on the elections. “Next meeting will be called soon, probably within next six months, to elect new chief. Till then, Sonia Gandhi agreed to remain interim president,” PL Punia, a member of CWC, the top executive body of the Congress, had said in August.When the CWC met last on August 23, Sonia Gandhi asked her party colleagues to begin the process of selecting her successor. Her letter, which was read out to those attending, said: “In the interest of the party, I ask CWC to begin deliberations to put in place the process of transition to relieve me of my duties.” More than four party leaders said that while the election isn’t on the agenda formally, it will feature as one of the major issues that the CWC will take up.A leader, however, said that the meeting is also likely to have a threadbare discussion on national security in the backdrop of the situation in Ladakh where troops of India and China are locked in a boundary standoff.The CWC meeting also comes just days before the all-important budget session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-working-committee-meet-on-jan-22-with-eye-on-party-polls-101611183474725.html
21-01-2021||India||Need focus on removing obstacles to ‘good’ jobs||By: Kunal Dasgupta, Srinivasan Murali and Vidhya SoundararajanThe Covid-19 pandemic brought into sharp focus the plight of thousands of small businesses in the country. As businesses struggled to stay afloat, the government announced a number of measures targeted towards the so-called Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Many of these measures, part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package, are aimed at easing financial constraints faced by businesses. But there are a multitude of obstacles facing businesses, not just financial; easing some of these obstacles could go a long way in raising worker productivity and ultimately lead to the creation of good (high-paying) jobs.1) Finance not the only constraintOur argument is built on a unique survey conducted by the World Bank called the Enterprise Surveys. The survey draws a representative sample of businesses and collects a wealth of information, including measures that try to quantify different obstacles faced by such businesses. We use data for the organised manufacturing sector in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available for India. Interestingly, almost 70% of the firms covered in this survey fall under the MSME definition applicable during this survey, and the findings are therefore highly relevant for issues facing such firms. In one of the survey questions, respondents were asked to choose their biggest obstacle from a set of 15 that could potentially affect production.Their response is summarised in Figure 1. Some of the obstacles are clearly more important than others. In terms of their importance, the top six are corruption, electricity, tax rates, competition from the informal sector, access to finance, and labour regulations. Hence, although finance is an obstacle for businesses, it may not be the most severe obstacle. Furthermore, the ranking of obstacles does not change much if we look separately at small and large businesses.2) Many factors hurt labour productivityFurther analysis sheds light on each of the obstacles. Take electricity. On average, businesses faced roughly 27 power cuts per month, with the average duration of each power cut being around two hours. Of course, one can minimise the disruption from power outages by using generators. In fact, 80% of businesses that faced power outages in the previous fiscal year owned generators. Because power created through generators is significantly more costly, however, this clearly affects the bottom line. Lower profits, in turn, could limit their ability to invest in productivity enhancing technologies. While experts often suggest that the government should encourage technology adoption among MSMEs, this is impossible to achieve without an input as critical and fundamental as uninterrupted and reliable power. Figure 2 suggests that there might be some truth to the above hypothesis. For each of the above-mentioned factors, the plot shows the average labour productivity of businesses that reported the factor to be an obstacle versus those that did not (The survey asked respondents to assign a score between 0 and 4 to each factor, with 0 denoting no obstacle and 4 denoting a very severe obstacle. We assigned businesses with a score of 0 to the No obstacle group and the rest to the Obstacle group).Out of the 15 factors, businesses that faced an obstacle for 13 of those factors had lower labour productivity compared to their counterparts that did not face an obstacle. The differences are especially stark for access to finance, labour regulations, tax rates and transport. Of course, Figure 2 simply displays correlations, and one needs to be careful before drawing causal inferences. For example, businesses that have lower labour productivity could be located in regions that have less reliable power supply. Nevertheless, a clear negative correlation between labour productivity and severity of obstacle for a wide range of factors is indicative of something deeper: it is likely that some, if not all of these obstacles, could be limiting the ability of businesses to hire more productive workers.3) Labour productivity matters for wagesWhy should policymakers care? Because, at the end of the day, labour productivity is intimately tied to wages. Intuitively, a more productive worker is more attractive than a less productive one. This results in higher demand for the former, ultimately pushing up their wage. This fact is borne out in Figure 3 which plots average annual wages paid by businesses against their labour productivity. It is clear from the figure that businesses with a more productive workforce also pay higher wages. In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, easing the financial constraints of MSMEs was the top policy priority, and rightly so. From a medium- to long-term perspective, however, help offered to the MSMEs must extend beyond finance.MSMEs employ about 110 million workers and contribute to about 40% of exports (MSME census, 2006-07), and have a huge role to play in creating quality jobs, improving export competitiveness, and increasing aggregate productivity. To achieve these, policies should also focus on delivering critical infrastructure (electricity access, transportation, land), easing bureaucratic hurdles (courts, tax administration), and liberalising business-related policies (trade and customs, labour regulations, friendly and simplified tax rates). One popular approach for holistically achieving these is through the setting up of place-based policies that have been successful in the US, European Union, and China.In India, evidence is limited, but some policies have had positive impact, for example, the 1994 tax exemption for backward districts , and the 2003 tax exemptions and capital subsidies for firms in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The need of the hour is to design a focused policy in this regard that majorly overhauls the current Special Economic Zones (SEZ) framework (SEZ act, 2005) using learnings from the successes and failures from other countries, and our own past. The upcoming budget is a timely opportunity to think about these structural changes in initiating a transformation.(The authors are faculty members at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-focus-on-removing-obstacles-to-good-jobs-101611182836280.html
21-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine doses wasted in more states over hesitancy||Authorities in at least six states on Wednesday said that doses of coronavirus vaccines are going to waste because people are not turning up, underscoring a persistent vaccine hesitancy problem in the country that may now impact inventories stockpiled in the millions.India’s start to the Covid-19 vaccination programme has been one of the strongest in the world, reaching more people on its first day than any other country. By 6pm on Wednesday, 786,842 people were inoculated in the 14,119 sessions held since the launch on January 16, Union health ministry data showed.But this still translates to a cumulative coverage rate of 55% — every day, 100 people are selected and invited for shots for each session, and on average roughly 45 of them are not turning up.Experts have called for opening up access to more people that just health care workers — perhaps even to the general public — if targets are not being met.To address the problem thrown up by vaccine hesitancy, the government on Tuesday tweaked the digital platform to allow willing health workers (who have been selected as initial beneficiaries) to take doses even if they were not scheduled to, and on Wednesday, it decided to hand out provisional first-dose certificates.But, as on Wednesday, the numbers were yet to pick up in any significant manner. According to preliminary government figures, the turnout for the day was approximately 65%.This, officials in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Bihar and Assam said, was leading to doses being wasted since vials need to be used up within four hours once opened, and each vial contains 10 (in the case of Covishield) or 20 (for Covaxin) doses.“On the first day of the vaccination, as we had recorded 100% turnout, we didn’t lose any unit. All the registered 100 health care workers opted for vaccination. All five vials that we had opened were successfully utilised. However, the next day when only 38 HCWs came forward, we lost two doses from the second vial,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, district health officer, Amravati.HT reported on Wednesday that officials in Delhi estimated that at least 1,000 doses were wasted across the Capital when opened vials were discarded for want of enough recipients.The issue also led to a political fight, with former Union finance minister P Chidambaram calling on the government on Twitter to open the vaccination drive up to more volunteers.To this, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan replied: “... (health ministry) has already taken steps to address the issue. We are ensuring that no vial or session is wasted and in case of absenteeism, vaccines are being allotted to another beneficiary.”While officials in the six states argued that the overall wastage was less than the 10% margin that they have assumed, the loss was not uniform and more doses of Covaxin had to be thrown away at some locations since they were in vials of 20.“In case of Covaxin, it is difficult to mobilise 20 health care workers at a time, given that hospital functioning should not be interrupted,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, where 25% of doses were thrown away.“Each vial has 10 doses, and if only five people are coming, either we have to deny vaccination for these five people or waste five doses,” said Tamil Nadu’s director of public health and preventive medicine Dr TS Selvavinayagam.Tamil Nadu’s health secretary said some of this problem is inevitable. “Unused doses are inevitable as some session sites will have less beneficiaries while other sites will have more than the prescribed 100 beneficiaries in a day,” said J Radhakrishnan, while adding: “This is going to be a long process which may take up more than 1.5 years.”But authorities in some other states continued to be concerned at the low turnouts. “We felt that the frontline workers should be contacted first to know their willingness to get the jab and availability, then selected for the next day. It is a matter of concern for us that fewer numbers of health workers are turning up to receive the dose,” said Dr Ramesh Verma, co-investigator of the clinical trials at the PGIMS, Rohtak.Several state governments such as Punjab, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh reported negligible wastage of doses. Dr Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, immunisation officer in Uttarakhand, said facilities in the state “open vials only after around ten candidates are lined up for vaccination. Along with this, there is strict supervision over vaccinators to ensure that doses are not wasted”.In Assam, the wastage was due to a logistical error when authorities had to discard 100 vials of Covishield after they were found frozen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-doses-wasted-in-more-states-over-hesitancy-101611182030965.html
21-01-2021||India||New Parliament building: Gandhi statue hurriedly shifted, move raises eyebrows||Mahatma Gandhi’s iconic statue in the parliament complex was shifted prematurely from its place facing the main gate to a space overlooking gate number 3 on Tuesday morning. The hurried shifting has raised eyebrows as the initial plan was to do so during the one-month gap between the first and the second part of the Budget Session that begins on January 29.The shifting was planned to make space for the ongoing construction of the new Parliament building.Officials in the Speaker Om Birla office were surprised at the hasty shifting. The space in front of the statue has been a preferred location for the Opposition lawmakers to protest against the government policies and proposed laws. During the last monsoon session, some Opposition lawmakers camped overnight in front of the statue to protest against the hurried passage of the farm bills.Officials said the Public works Department, the government’s construction arm, carefully shifted the statue and placed it in a small lawn near the gate used exclusively by the Speaker to reach his office.Also read | RT-PCR tests for MPs; Zero, Question hours back in Budget sessionOfficials added the Gandhi statue is eventually planned to installed just outside the current Parliament building, where that of late former Union home minister Govind Ballabh Pant currently stands. Pant’s statue is planned to be shifted to New Delhi Pant Marg named after him.Gandhi’s 16-feet high bronze statue in a meditating posture, sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by then President Shanker Dayal Sharma on October 2, 1993.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-parliament-building-gandhi-statue-hurriedly-shifted-move-raises-eyebrows-101611170523492.html
21-01-2021||India||CBI arrests two of its officials in Bribery case||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has arrested its deputy superintendent of police (DSP), R K Rishi, inspector Kapil Dhankad and an advocate Manohar Malik in connection with its probe into a “bribes-for-relief” scandal in the agency, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. Rishi, who is accused of running a well-oiled racket in the central anti-corruption agency along with another DSP, R K Sangwan, Dhankad, a stenographer Sameer Kumar Singh and some lawyers for extending favours to private companies under investigation in bank fraud cases, was arrested on Tuesday night, the people cited above added. The allegation is that crucial case related information and documents have been leaked since 2018 to individuals/companies being investigated for bank frauds. Rishi’s home in Deoband (Uttar Pradesh) and his wife’s residence in Roorkee (Uttarakhand) were also searched by a team. The agency claims to have already established that Rishi took ₹30 lakh bribe in two tranches for facilitating the leak of information from the agency and that Dhankad had taken around ₹25 lakh from two companies. A case was registered last week naming four CBI officers , Rishi (deployed in CBI academy at Ghaziabad), Sangwan (DSP in Special Crimes Unit), Dhankad (Inspector in Bank Securities and Fraud Cell) and Singh (Stenographer in BS&FC); two lawyers , Manohar Malik and Arvind Kumar Gupta; and Mandeep Kaur Dhillon (additional director of a company, Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd) and Sujai Desai and Udai Desai of Mumbai based company Frost International Pvt Ltd, who alleged paid the bribes and sought information on the probes from CBI. According to the CBI First Information Report, the four CBI officers, along with two advocates, and certain other accused have been “compromising the integrity of investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”. Both Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd (SSPBML) and Frost International are being investigated by the premier investigating agency for defrauding banks. The case against Frost International was registered in August 2020 for cheating 14 banks of over ₹3,500 crore. CBI’s FIR states that “in the case of SSPNML, RK Sangwan, who was the previous investigating officer in the case, offered and paid a bribe of ₹10 lakh in cash on behalf of Mandeep Kaur to Inspector Kapil Dhankad”. “On his part, Dhankad conveyed confidential information relating to the investigation of this case to RK Sangwan, with an intention to favour the accused.” It is further alleged that RK Rishi paid ₹10 lakh bribe to Dhankad on behalf of the Desais of Frost International. For facilitating the bribe, Rishi received ₹15 lakh twice through advocates Malik and Gupta to extend favours to a Chandigarh based company against which a corruption case was being investigated by CBI, the FIR adds. “In this matter, Dhankad twice received ₹2.5 lakh from Gupta for having brokered the deal through Rishi,” read the CBI FIR. Rishi, Dhankad and Malik were produced before a court on Wednesday. The accused’s legal representatives could not be located for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-two-of-its-officials-in-bribery-case-101611168320906.html
21-01-2021||India||SC irked over criticism of farm committee picks||The Supreme Court on Wednesday strongly defended its choice of members for the committee that will weigh in on the contentious farm laws, and cautioned critics against attributing motives to the court or “maligning” members of the panel just because they had in the past come out in favour of these legislation aimed at opening up farm markets. An SC bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde disapproved of the criticism, saying that “public opinion will not determine who should be a member and who should not” and that it had “serious objections” to people and the press casting aspersions either on members of the panel or the apex court. “If you muster a public opinion to malign people, brand people, should that be a ground of disqualification? We have very serious objections to our members being called names, accused of bias etc. And then they say this court had some interest. What interest can we have? We entered into this in the interest of common people, especially farmers,” commented the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Emphasising that people have the right to hold an opinion and they were also entitled to change it at a later point in time like judges do sometimes, the CJI added that the members of this committee had reputations none of their critics actually had. “They are some of the best minds, brilliant minds in this country. You cannot brand people like this. We are not forcing anyone to appear before the committee but there is no need to brand people, and on top of that, cast aspersion on the court. The Supreme Court appoints people and their reputations are torn to shreds like this. We don’t understand this. How lightly can this be taken?” asked the CJI. The bench’s outburst was triggered by a plea by advocate Ajay Choudhary, who appeared for a farmers’ organisation from Rajasthan, Kisan Mahapanchayat. Choudhary had moved an application for reconstitution of the committee, which the court appointed on January 12 when it also stayed the implementation of the three laws in question. The composition of this four-member committee triggered a controversy since all four had previously made statements in support of the reforms. The criticism was such that one of the members, BS Mann, later chose to leave the panel, expressing solidarity with the farmers. The other three members are Pramod Kumar Joshi, the director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, New Delhi; agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and Anil Ghanwat of the Shetkari Sanghatana, a Maharashtra-based farm union. Gulati is the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the advisory body of the Government of India on food supplies and pricing policies. While Choudhary cited various news reports about the committee members, senior counsel Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, on being asked, said the eight farm unions, which they represented and were currently a part of the protest, had nothing to do with the composition of the committee because they did not want to engage with it at all. At this point, apart from Choudhary, advocate AP Singh also pressed his application on behalf of the Bharatiya Kisan Union - Lokshakti, demanding removal of the other three members, alleging bias. The bench was livid. “This has become almost a cultural thing to brand people and criticise them for one reason or another. The committee has not been given any power of adjudication. They only have been given the power of hearing parties. So, where is the question of a bias? If you don’t want to appear, don’t appear but why do you have to brand people like this? We are very sorry to see the kind of opinions published in the media.” The court then asked attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the Central government, to formally respond to the plea on reconstitution of the committee, and also address the issue of a vacancy that has arisen after Mann’s resignation. Meanwhile, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre and Delhi Police in the matter, supported the bench, saying it was unfortunate to see the kind of attacks being made on the committee members. Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for a Delhi resident, implored the bench to clarify that the committee’s role was confined to assisting the court and that it would do so even if no farmer union appeared before the panel. Salve added he was inclined to move a contempt plea if the committee members were “wrongly” criticised in the press. At this, the bench included in its order a portion to the effect that the committee had not been set up to adjudge any issue but to only hear the parties. The committee’s role, the court order said, “is to share the grievances of the parties affected by the impugned legislations and make a report to the court.”Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 26, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops. Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the minimum support prices and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporate entities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-irked-over-criticism-of-farm-committee-picks-101611168319242.html
21-01-2021||India||Electoral rolls, not NRC, to determine voters in Assam: EC||GUWAHATI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) made it clear on Wednesday that those living in Assam whose names are missing from the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC), but are listed in the electoral rolls can vote in the assembly elections due in April-May this year. “A union home ministry notification dated August 29, 2019 clearly stated {that} non-inclusion of a person’s name in NRC doesn’t amount to him/her being declared a foreigner. By implication, such persons remain in voters’ list and shall be eligible to vote until a decision is taken by the concerned tribunal,” said Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora.Around 1.9 million (of 33 million applicants) were left out of the updated NRC published for Assam on Augst 31, 2019. The NRC was a list intended to identify legal residents and weed out illegal immigrants from Assam. Those left out of the updated NRC were given the option of appealing to foreigners’ tribunals.“The NRC is yet to be notified and several matters related to it are still pending in Supreme Court. Hence, there no question of our party reacting to the CEC’s remarks on allowing those left out of the NRC to vote,” said Roopam Goswami, a spokesperson for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “The NRC is yet to be become a legal document hence it is desirable that till it is notified, those left out of it should be allowed to vote. But we also want that the updated NRC is notified soon as it was one of the promises made by the BJP prior to coming to power in Assam in 2016,” said Debabrata Saikia, leader of the Congress legislature party in the Assam assembly. NRC is expected to be a poll issue in a state where there has always been a distrust of outsiders.“There’s no link of NRC with voters’ list as the latter is not updated with inputs from the former. Additionally, the Registrar General of India is yet to notify the updated NRC. So, if those left out of NRC are allowed to vote based on their listing in electoral rolls, there’s nothing to be surprised about,” said Abhijeet Sharma of the Assam Public Works (APW), a Guwahati-based non-government organisation whose petition in the Supreme Court had led to the start of the NRC updating process in 2015.  Arora spoke to reporters in Guwahati on the last day of a three-day visit by a high-level ECI team to the state to take stock of its preparedness for the upcoming polls. Arora said the election in Assam will be held keeping in mind the Bohag Bihu festival that falls in mid-April and the poll process would be over before May, on the day the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examination starts. Because of Covid-19 safety protocols, the ECI has decided to reduce the average number of voters in each polling station from 1,500 to nearly 1,000. This would lead to an increase of around 5,500 polling stations in the state; total number of polling stations could reach 33,000. “We will be giving Covid-19 kit to polling teams and in order to further decongest polling spaces and allow more free movement of voters, polling time has been increased by one hour,” said Arora. “Nomination forms and affidavits can be filled by candidates online and print out submitted to returning officers. Security money can also be paid online. Number of persons accompanying candidates at the time of filing of nomination has been restricted to two,” he added. Door-to-door campaigning will be restricted to five persons, including the candidate. Road shows are allowed subject to a convoy being broken up every half-an-hour. District deputy commissioners will ensure maintenance of social distancing norms at election rallies. Arora mentioned that discussions are under way to ensure the vaccination of poll officials for Covid-19 before the elections and added that the t law and order situation in Assam was “under control.". “The voluntary code of ethics agreed upon by social media platforms during interactions with EC would apply to Assam election as well to ensure social media doesn’t play a mischievous role in inciting violence and communal riots,” said Arora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/electoral-rolls-not-nrc-to-determine-voters-in-assamec-101611168264114.html
21-01-2021||India||‘Goli Maaro’ chants at BJP leader Suvendu’s rally in Bengal||Kolkata Supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday allegedly raised the controversial “goli maaro” slogan at a roadshow in West Bengal’s Hooghly district, a day after a similar slogan was raised by supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress.The slogan, “desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro” (shoot the traitors of the nation), was raised by people carrying the BJP flag who were seen trailing a truck carrying former Trinamool Congress leader Suvendu Adhikari who is now with the BJP, the BJP’s Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh and BJP’s Hooghly MP Locket Chatterjee in the district’s Chandannagar area. Condemning the incident, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said the party “does not endorse it”. “Our party does not endorse it at all. People carrying the BJP flag cannot talk like that,” he told mediapersons in Kolkata.The BJP spokesperson also hit out at the TMC, saying that the slogan raised at the Chandannagar rally was aimed at terrorists while workers of the ruling party had used it against “traitors of Bengal”. “However, one must understand that when we talk of traitors of India we mean mercenaries and terrorists who kill innocent citizens and pose a threat to the nation. The intention of TMC workers was quite different because they talked of traitors of Bengal,” he said. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh targeted the BJP and said that the party believes in the “culture of violence”. “The TMC workers should not have uttered it but the BJP has proved once again that it believes in the culture of violence in letter and spirit,” he said. On Tuesday, the BJP had alleged that a section of people who took part in a massive TMC road show in Kolkata shouted slogans about “shooting traitors in Bengal”. Asked about the purported “goli maaro” slogan, TMC leader Madan Mitra said: “Bullets are not part of Bengal’s political culture, but the people could certainly slap BJP leaders.”In January last year, Union minister Anurag Thakur egged the audience at a Delhi election rally to raise the slogan by repeatedly chanting the first half of it, and waiting for the crowd to complete it. West Bengal is scheduled to go polls before May this year.(With Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goli-maaro-chants-at-bjp-leader-suvendu-s-rally-in-bengal-101611168260259.html
21-01-2021||India||One in 3 new Covid cases recorded in Kerala||Thiruvananthapuram: More than one in every three new Covid-19 cases recorded in India over the last week have come from Kerala, a state that is defying the national trend of falling infections and has been the biggest outbreak centre in the country since late October.The latest statistic -- Kerala recorded 6,815 new cases on Wednesday, and 37% of all cases reported across the country since January 13 have been in the state -- has health experts worried, even as state government points to a low case fatality rate (CFR) to contend that the pandemic is under control. “Due to our effective intervention we delayed the peak and controlled death rate considerably. Our death rate is still lowest in the country, below 0.4% when the national average is more than 1.4%,” state health minister KK Shailaja said, adding that timely government intervention delayed the peak and saved many lives.A low CFR means that while the pandemic may have affected a high number of people, fewer are dying of the coronavirus on account of either effective treatment or immediate isolation following detection. Yet, the continuing high numbers -- for example, Kerala’s share in new cases across India went to as high as 45% on Tuesday -- has led experts to call for changes in the state’s Covid management strategy. They have called for the government to increase testing, and to increase the number of RT-PCR tests, which have a lower rate of false negatives than antigen tests.The test positivity rate in the state stood at 11.8% on Wednesday as against 1.8% across India.“The situation is really serious. Test rate of the state is still poor and emphasis is on antigen tests. At least 40% of tests are still antigen. The government will have to rope in more experts and engage private players in a big way before it is too late,” said public health expert Dr SS Lal. Since India’s Covid-19 peak in its first and only wave, the national case trajectory has dropped 85% — from 93,617 on September 16 to 14,376 on January 19. In Kerala, by contrast, the case trajectory has dropped only 34% —from 8,728 cases (seven-day average) on October 13 to 5,374 cases a day in the past week.The health minister attributed the high caseload to the local body elections held in December, and the festive season which began in September and continued till New Year’s eve. She asked people not to lower their guard. “We have noticed some people behave as if a remedy is around (in terms of the vaccine) and refuse to take precautions. Many fail to turn up for tests and vaccinations as well. It is not good,” she said. The state has also seen a series of unlocks, with some restrictions, in the past few months. Last month, local body elections were held, and hotels and bars were opened. On January 1, schools were opened for Class 10 and 12 students, and on January 13, cinema halls were opened at half capacity. Spas and ayurvedic resorts have also opened in the state owing to a revenue loss of an estimated ₹15,000 crore to the exchequer, the state tourism minister said earlier this month.

21-01-2021||India||Covaxin recipients to be monitored for three months after 2nd dose||New DelhiCovaxin recipients will be monitored for three months after getting the 2nd dose for any adverse reactions, according to a detailed plan released by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in an attempt to dispel safety concerns about the vaccine whose efficacy data isn’t publicly known. If a serious adverse event is linked to vaccination, then the recipient will be compensated based on the national drug controller’s recommendations after thorough investigation, said the plan. Covaxin is one of two vaccines – the other being the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine known locally as Covishield – being used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme that kicked off on Saturday. It was developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR, which released the plan on January 18.For the first 35 days after the first dose of the vaccine, the recipients will be actively monitored, said the document. For seven days after taking each dose, the recipient will have to will have to document their health condition in writing, and submit the form to health authorities. The second dose of the vaccine is administered 28 days after the first.A district-level team will contact and enquire about any adverse events over phone, added the document. “Day 1-7: The vaccine recipients will be given an adverse event form to record the adverse events. Day 8-27: The vaccine recipients will inform the vaccination site, if they have encountered any health-related issues or adverse events. The vaccine recipients will return the adverse event form during the visit for the administration of the second dose of vaccine (Day 28),” said the plan.“Visit 2 (Day 28): The vaccine recipients will be administered the second dose… Day 28-35: The vaccine recipients will be given an adverse event form to record the adverse events... The vaccine recipients will inform the site, if they have encountered any health-related issues or adverse events. Vaccine recipients will return the filled-in adverse event reporting form after completion of 7 days post-vaccination,” it added. “All the vaccine recipients will be followed-up for a period of 3 months after the second dose of vaccination,” the document added.According to the plan, any report of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI), including serious ones, will be submitted to the designated immunisation officer or health care worker. Vaccination officers will also help in providing psychological support to recipients.Causality assessment of all severe adverse events, medical management and compensation will be determined by the existing practices under the government immunisation program and central ethics committee as appropriate.“In case of any adverse events or serious adverse events, vaccine recipients will be provided medically recognized standard of care in the government designated respective state hospitals,” the plan said.Experts say safety is not a concern with Covaxin, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. “The studies are done in a robust manner, and the data that has so far been generated has already established Covaxin’s safety profile. So, safety isn’t a concern,” said Dr MC Misra, former director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. Bharat Biotech developed Covaxin in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Individuals with the following conditions will not be eligible for vaccination: Those with a history of allergies; those with fever, bleeding disorder or those who are on blood thinners; those who are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects their immune system; are pregnant; are breastfeeding; have received another Covid-19 vaccine; any other serious health related. Side effects reported with Covaxin include injection site pain, swelling, redness, itching, stiffness in the upper arm, weakness in injection arm, body ache, headache, fever, malaise, weakness, rashes, nausea and vomiting. There is a chance that the vaccine may cause a severe allergic reaction that includes difficulty in breathing, swelling of face and throat, fast heart beat, body rash, dizziness, and weakness.“These may not be all the possible side effects… Serious and unexpected side effects may occur...

21-01-2021||India||SA, Brazil strains raise new fears on vaccines, immunity||Mutations of the Sars-Cov-2 virus found in South Africa and Brazil have begun worrying authorities and scientists who say that these – they are distinct from the new variant first found in the UK – could trigger more re-infections, even reduce vaccine efficacy, though more tests are underway. The first major mutation of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was reported from the UK in the so-called B.1.1.7 variant (also called VOC202012/01) ; authorities said in December that it was more infectious, and it was later seen as a factor in leading to the country’s worst wave yet. Scientists also discovered a handful of other significantly mutated strains. Two of these, B.1.351, found in South Africa, and P.1 found in Brazil, now seem like they can escape, at least partly, the immune response in people who have been vaccinated or were infected earlier, preliminary studies and government reports published this week say. “It is possible that these mutations and others that emerge in individuals with suboptimal or waning immunity will erode the effectiveness of natural- and vaccine-elicited immunity. The data suggests that Sars-CoV-2 vaccines may need to be updated,” said a team led by researchers from Rockefeller University in a study submitted to Biorxiv on January 19. Mutations in a virus are a natural phenomenon and the Sars-Cov-2 was seen to be gaining two significant mutations every month. But in December, researchers began discovering some strains with unusually high number of mutations – the UK-associated strain has 23 changes, the South Africa-linked one has eight and the Brazil-linked one has 20. Among these changes are N501Y and E484K. These letters refer to descriptions of how a particular portion of the virus has changed – these in particular are all changes in the Spike protein, the component that the virus uses to infect cells. Of these, N501Y has been linked to the virus becoming more infective, while E484K is the mutation that possibly makes the virus more resistant. The variant in UK carries N501Y, the one seen in Brazil carries E484K and the one seen in South Africa has both.The researchers took these mutations for laboratory tests to check how immune cells triggered by vaccines reacted to them. With plasma from 14 people who received the Moderna vaccine and from six who got the Pfizer-BioNTech dose, they saw a “modest” but significant drop in how the immune cells neutralised the mutated strains as compared to how they neutralised the older one. Similar findings were shared by South African authorities on January 18. The variant B.1.351 (which contains E484K) did not react with antibodies in 21 out of 44 serum samples collected from people infected in the first wave, South African scientist Salim Abdool Karim said at a discussion streamed online on January 18. There is also at least one confirmed case of re-infection caused by the P1 variant (which too has E484K). This was detailed by Brazilian researchers in a study published on January 18, detailing the case of a 29-year-old woman in Manaus, Brazil, who developed a symptomatic infection in March. In late December, she was infected again with symptoms such as fever. Genetic sequencing showed the second infection was with the P1 variant. The Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium said the emergence of such variants raises the concern that there might be an evolutionary convergence that could make the virus capable of spreading faster and harder to fight. “However, the effect of this mutation in relation to natural immune or immunity from vaccination has yet to be determined,” they added in a report released on January 19.Researchers also say that the evolution of Sars-Cov-2 at present does not pose a major risk since the changes seen even till now do not make existing immunity (from older infections) or vaccines completely obsolete. It ties into projections that Covid-19 could become endemic, where it will be able to keep circulating by evolving but not lead to as debilitating effect. “What the long-term effect of accumulation of mutations on the Sars-CoV-2 on the pandemic will be is not known, but the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E evolves antigenic variants that are comparatively resistant to the older sera but remain sensitive to contemporaneous sera,” the researchers in the first study said. In a study published in Science on January 12, a team led by researchers from Emory University used transmission modelling and estimates of immunity prevalence to suggest that once Sars-Cov-2 becomes endemic, it will resemble a common cold since childhood infections will confer protection against severe disease later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sa-brazil-strains-raise-new-fears-on-vaccines-immunity-101611167959193.html
21-01-2021||India||Sasikala hospitalised in Bengaluru week before her release from prison||Just seven days before her release, the late J Jayalalithaa’s close aide V K Sasikala was shifted from Bengaluru prison to the Bowring Hospital as she complained of fever and breathlessness on Wednesday evening,Sasikala, 63, who also suffers from hypertension, diabetes and hypothyroidism was admitted with cough and fever, said a medical bulletin from the hospital."On arrival at hospital, (her) oxygen saturation at room air was 79 % and febrile. Stable with supportive measures and antibiotics and oxygen. She will be further evaluated and monitored. Investigation reports are awaited," the hospital said in a statement.Sasikala, a former interim general secretary of Tamil Nadu’s ruling AIADMK, is serving a four-year jail term in the disproportionate assets case in Bengaluru’s Parappana Agrahara jail and is set to walk out in the morning hours of January 27 after completing her sentence and having paid a fine of ₹10 crore. Her release will not be affected due to her health, her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian told reporters.“She is rapid (Covid test) negative now,” said Dr H V Manoj, director-dean of the hospital. “We have done all the investigations, her sugar was low and we are treating her. She was complaining of breathlessness and her saturation was around 80. After oxygen, she has become stable. She will be staying through the night.”Pandian earlier said that none had met Sasikala recently due to pandemic restrictions. “I met her in March 2020 and I haven’t received permission to meet in person after that,” Pandian said on Tuesday while confirming the information of her release.Sasikala’s release is expected to add another complicated dimension to politics in Tamil Nadu which goes to assembly polls in April-May. As a high-stakes behind-the scene operator, her moves will be keenly watched.A day ago, after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi, Tamil Nadu chief minister and AIADMK’s coordinator Edapaddi Palaniswami ruled out inducting Sasikala into the AIADMK after the party had expelled her and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran in 2017.Sasikala’s supporters are now with Dhinakaran’s party the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK). Palaniswami also scorched at questions of whether their ally, the BJP was compelling the AIADMK to merge with the AMMK in its effort to defeat the principal opposition, the DMK saying her return to the party was “impossible.” Palaniswami will also inaugurate a memorial for Jayalalithaa in Chennai on January 27- the same day Sasikala is expected to walk out of prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-hospitalised-in-bengaluru-week-before-her-release-from-prison-101611167428092.html
21-01-2021||India||Those excluded from Assam NRC can vote if their names are on electoral rolls: EC||Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora on Wednesday cited a Union home ministry notification and said those excluded from Assam’s updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) can vote in the assembly polls due in the state in April-May this year if their names are on the electoral list.He said the press note dated August 20, 2019, says the exclusion of a person’s name from NRC does not amount to her declaration as a foreigner. “By implication, such persons remain on the voters’ list and shall be eligible to vote until a decision is taken by concerned tribunals [about their citizenship],” said Arora, who was on a three-day visit with an Election Commission (EC) team to take stock of poll preparedness in Assam.Also Read: Assam Assembly polls: Voting to be held in over 33,000 booths, announces ECIAround 1.9 million people were left out of the updated NRC published on August 31, 2019, as part of a process to identify and deport alleged undocumented immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Only those who could prove they came to the state by March 24, 1971, the day before Bangladesh was liberated from Pakistan, were included in the NRC. The NRC was first created in 1951.Arora said elections in Assam will be held keeping in mind the Bohag Bihu festival in mid-April. He added the poll process would be over before the Central Board of Secondary Education exams begin in May. Arora said the EC will give Covid-19 kits to polling teams. He added polling time will be increased by one hour to decongest polling spaces and allow more free movement of voters. “Nomination forms and affidavits can be filled by candidates online and print out can be submitted to returning officers. Security money can also be paid online. The number of persons accompanying candidates at the time of filing of nominations has been restricted to two,” said Arora as he explained measures being taken for the polling in view of the pandemic.The EC has decreased the average number of voters in each polling station from 1,500 to 1,000. This would lead to an increase of around 5,500 polling stations in Assam. Around 33,000 polling stations are expected to be set up in the state.Arora said door-to-door campaigning will be restricted to five people including the candidate. “Roadshows are allowed subject to [restrictions]... Deputy commissioners of districts will ensure the maintenance of social distancing norms at election rallies.”Arora said they are in discussions with the government to ensure the possibility of Covid-19 vaccination of poll officials before the elections. He added a voluntary code of ethics agreed upon by social media platforms would apply to the Assam election as well to ensure they are not used for inciting violence even as the law and order situation in the state is presently under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-excluded-from-assam-nrc-can-vote-if-their-names-are-on-electoral-rolls-ec-101611144425805.html
