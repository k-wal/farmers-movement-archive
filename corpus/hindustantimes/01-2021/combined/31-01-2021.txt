31-01-2021||News||The life and times of a Patna intellectual||After battling ill-health for years, while keeping up his engagements, Bihar’s foremost social scientist, its most visible public intellectual, and the man considered to be the one-person economic think-tank for the state government of the day passed away on Thursday.Shaibal Gupta was a remarkable figure in India’s intellectual life. From his base in Patna, he combined the local (he was deeply immersed in the politics, society, economy and finances of Bihar); the national (he paid close attention to central politics and worked closely both with government and institutions working in Delhi); and the international (he engaged with universities abroad, was a guide to a range of international academics who specialised in Bihar, and frequently hosted conferences that brought together fine global minds — the last such mega-conference, displaying Gupta’s intellectual breadth and interests, was to mark 200 years of Karl Marx’s birth and his legacy).Indeed, Shaibal-da, as he was popularly known, had the ability to combine the practice of everyday politics with theory, and in a truly interdisciplinary fashion, weave together an understanding of statecraft, society and economy. And he did all of this while building and sustaining the institution that remained his true passion till the very end — the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI). It was arguably Gupta’s presence and work that lent Patna a degree of intellectually vibrancy and edge often missing in other state capitals in the heartland, including Lucknow.Gupta also made a pioneering contribution in explaining the historical roots and the evolution of Bihar’s politics, which have today become the staple of everyday political analysis.Conversations with him — either at his home or the ADRI office in Patna — often began with the debilitating, long-term impact of the Permanent Settlement regime, a severely exploitative method of extracting revenues during the colonial period, and how it set Bihar back. It meandered, in true adda-style over a cup of chai, to the absence of a sub-national identity in Bihar — Gupta was truly invested in efforts by Nitish Kumar, in his earlier terms, to bolster a broader Bihari identity beyond caste lines.And then the conversation swung to the present political arithmetic, where Gupta’s formulation of a “coalition of extremes” — the dominant castes and the most marginalised sub-castes coming together within the Nitish Kumar-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance — was instrumental in explaining the persisting dominance of the National Democratic Alliance in the state. Returning to his economic roots, Gupta would often focus on State capacity and rule of law, where he thought that Kumar had done more than his predecessors in improving things. But he would also say, wistfully, that till Bihar got special status, it would not be able to move to the next stage of investment and industrialisation.Beyond his intellectual beliefs and interests, two qualities of Gupta stood out. The first was his warmth, generosity and humour. He was often the first stop for anyone seeking to understand the state of play in Bihar. And Gupta was unfailingly courteous in sharing his wisdom and insights, and curious about the views and background of his interlocutors. In a way, besides his impressive written work, this came from his belief in the oral tradition of knowledge-transmission. And through it, Gupta never took himself seriously, often engaging in self-deprecatory humour.The second was his commitment to institution-building, which, in the complex policy ecosystem in state capitals, also requires the ability to network and a high degree of pragmatism. Gupta was often seen as being too close to the government, especially with Kumar. But he appeared to believe that a policy institute, which used to produce the economic survey for the state government every year and worked with various departments on projects, had far more room in making a difference quietly than by engaging in blanket public criticism. This explained his relative reticence to criticise Kumar in public, even when he had apprehensions about his political moves in private.Shaibal Gupta was rooted and cosmopolitan; idealistic and pragmatic; and an insider and outsider — all at the same time. Patna’s public life will not be the same without him.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-life-and-times-of-a-patna-intellectual-101612012281038.html

The order came four days after the Union ministry of home affairs had further relaxed Covid-19 restrictions for the country on Wednesday. The restriction on social or any form of gatherings, including weddings, where only 50 guests are allowed, however, will continue. In an order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, the DDMA reiterated all the guidelines and standard operating procedures notified by the Central government for the opening of facilities and activities, including trade exhibitions and sports events.“The situation of Covid-19 has been reviewed and considering that the number of active and new cases of Covid-19 have been declining steadily during the last two months, it has been decided that guidelines of the MHA order dated January 27, along with SOPs issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting for cinema halls and theatres, ministry of youth affairs and sports for operation of swimming pools, and for opening up of stadiums for sports events and department of commerce and government of India for holding trade exhibitions shall be applied mutatis mutandis in NCT of Delhi,” read the DDMA’s order issued on Sunday.All of these activities will be allowed from Monday (February 1) till February 28 until further orders.Delhi recorded 140 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday as the city’s positivity rate slipped to 0.23%, authorities said. According to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department, the fresh cases came after 60,695 tests having been conducted for detection of the virus.With this, the total number of cases for Covid-19 in the national capital has touched 635,096, while the death toll hit 10,853, with four more people succumbing to the infection on Sunday. The number of active cases in the national capital dropped to 1,361 from 1,436 on Sunday.Starting Monday, cinema halls and theatres in Delhi will be able to function with 100% seating capacity, instead of 50% which was allowed till January 31.The multiplexes have been asked to follow staggered show timings to avoid crowding and longer intermissions have been recommended so that the audience seated in different rows of the auditorium can move in a staggered manner. However, cinema halls located inside containment zones will continue to stay shut. Apart from physical distancing of at least 6 feet in the common areas, the SOPs also recommend digital booking of tickets be encouraged and contact number of ticket-holder be noted at the time of booking to facilitate contact tracing. Only asymptomatic people are to be allowed entry inside halls, the order stated. Gautam Dutta, CEO, PVR Limited, India’s largest film exhibition company, welcomed the decision of allowing cinema halls to operate at 100% capacity and said the move will boost the multiplex industry.“India has done well to control the spread of Covid-19, along with the large scale roll out of the vaccination drive. This move will give confidence to film producers to release their much awaited movies. It will also improve the sentiment of the audience who, we now hope, will return to the cinemas to watch their choicest movies in the company of their loved ones. PVR continues to keep safety and hygiene as paramount and abide by all SOPs as laid down by the government at its cinemas,” said Dutta.For swimming pools, the SoP states that alternate lanes of the pool will have to be used from both directions to maintain physical distancing of swimmers to the extent feasible. It also mandated CCTV monitoring to check crowding of pools and the visitors gallery, while stating that swimming pool should ensure adequate and regular water filtration and chlorination as per the standards laid down by WHO.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which maintains and operates a number of sports complexes, stadiums and swimming pools in the city, said it will soon start re-applying for the pre-requisite licences to open its facilities. “Once we formally received the government’s SOPs, we will take a decision. We will have to apply for licence from the municipal corporations and Sports Authority of India. We will then also have to apply to Delhi police’s licencing department to renew our permit,” said a senior DDA official. However, the DDMA maintained status quo on the restriction on public gatherings. A senior DDMA member said number of guests for weddings will continue to be 50 in Delhi for now and that for funerals will be 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-allows-cinema-halls-to-operate-at-full-capacity-opens-swimming-pools-101612117466298.html

The reason — negligible international tourists, meagre inter-state travellers as well as lack of corporate clients.This is according to the figures released by HVS-Anarock, a hospitality consulting firm, which pointed out that the current occupancy is from leisure travel and local businessmen. “There are hardly any international tourists. Currently, the occupants consist of tourists on short vacations within motorable distances and within short flight distances from their home town,” said Mandeep Lamba, president (South Asia), HVS-Anarock.According to experts, a hotel needs to have at least 50% occupancy to sustain itself.After being shut for more than four months, the state government allowed hotels to reopen from July 8, 2020, under various conditions.The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), an apex body of hoteliers, said that hotels are running into huge losses due to lack of occupancy. “Many hotels have cut their tariffs to one third to woo consumers. In addition, many have not even opened their establishments as the losses are too heavy to bear,” said Dilip Datwani, spokesperson, HRAWI. “Since even outstation trains are not travelling at full capacity, we have lost those patrons also,” he added.Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport Hotel has currently opened 96 rooms for their patrons. “We see full booking during the weekends but the response during weekdays is not very encouraging,” said Pankaj Saxena, general manager, Radisson Blu Mumbai International Airport Hotel.Kamlesh Barot, who manages Empresa Hotel at Andheri, listed a variety of things for the low occupancy. “Though the Central government has asked for easing restrictions at the airport, the situation is very chaotic. Tourists from other states are afraid they will be tested and forced to quarantine, thus spoiling their vacations,” said Barot. “The corporate sector, which offers some of the biggest clientele, is working at meagre capacity and most businesses are holding online meetings. This has hurt the hotels,” he added.Mumbai hotels are now attempting to woo local guests with staycations and are offering slashed tariffs, food festivals and customised menus for the same.Lamba of HVS-Anarock pointed out that despite poor business, the situation in India is better than in other countries. “There are hardly any hotel occupancies in other countries as they were not able to control the spread of Covid-19 as we did. Besides, things will improve as the vaccine rolls out,” said Lamba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hotels-in-mumbai-struggle-to-survive-post-covid-lockdown-due-to-low-occupancy-101612117346641.html

He said that the judge also sought the reply of the Investigating officer (IO) in a bail plea moved by Punia.“Mandeep was sent to judicial custody for 14 days by the Duty Magistrate,” Naved said. He said that Puniya’s bail application would be heard on Monday at the Rohini Court Complex.Puniya, through his counsel, has contended that he was detained last night without any information to his family members. He said that it was only when the fellow journalists that the information about the FIR were given to them.The bail plea has said that there was a delay of seven hours in the registration of the FIR and the case was registered at 1.21 AM even when the incident took place at 6.44 PM. The petition said a differential treatment was given to Puniya because he was not carrying a press ID card.Advocate Harpreet Singh Hora, counsel for the farmers arrested during the violence at the Singhu border on Friday, said that a total of 33 accused persons have been produced before the duty magistrate at the Tihar jail complex on Saturday after which they were sent to judicial custody.Advocate Hora also said that their team shall contest these cases on behalf of the farmers who are missing, arrested falsely or are injured. He also stated that there are relatives approaching them to figure out the whereabouts of their missing kin.“Our main priority at this stage is to locate all the missing persons who have been either detained or arrested. We are tracing them at various police stations and see that they are not assaulted by the police. Some reports of assault by police have also been received and we are taking proper legal recourse in these cases,” he said.Despite multiple barricades and at least 1,000 personnel of Delhi Police and paramilitary forces at the Singhu border, a mob of 200 people managed to reach near the main stage of the protest on Friday and attacked the farmers with sticks, besides pelting them with stones, leading to clashes.Videos on social media — none of which could be verified independently —showed a group of men pelting stones while police personnel stood next to them and watched. One video showed a masked man throwing stones. Another showed some police personnel in anti-riot gear standing and watching during the stone-pelting.Delhi police had on Friday night released a statement saying they had arrested 44 persons for Friday’s violence, including a 22-year-old protesting farmer, who had allegedly stabbed a police inspector with a sword on his left palm. Police in their statement did not specify how many of the 44 people were farmers or locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/30-including-freelance-journalist-arrested-for-violence-at-singhu-101612117224767.html

31-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG to review status of proposals approved in 2020 house meetings||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has decided to review the status of proposals approved last year during the special meeting scheduled for February 4.Originally Thursday’s meeting, which will be held at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines, was to review all proposals approved in MCG house meetings since November 2017. However, Mayor Madhu Azad said they realised that this would take a lot of time and result in rushed and improper scrutiny.“The idea behind holding such a meeting in the first place was to ascertain if MCG officials were taking the house meeting seriously. There is no point for us to put agendas forward, deliberate them in great length, only for it to remain on documents. We want to check and identify officials who may not be forwarding some agendas to the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) for final approval or not implementing them within Gurugram, and subsequently initiate disciplinary action against them,” said Azad, adding that the officials would also be directed to expedite work on approved agendas that had seen little to no progress.Some of the key proposals approved last year included exchanging MCG revenue roads with the land of private builders amounting to the same monetary value; forming a committee to review the existing drainage system on Golf Course Road (GCR), sectors 27 and 28; developing a city forest in Sikanderpur; building a prefabricated boundary wall to preserve civic land against encroachers; constructing dispensaries in every municipal ward; and providing financial assistance to condominiums and residential societies for setting up compost plants within their respective areas. According to MCG officials, although many there had been some action taken on many of these proposals, the Covid-19 had put the brakes on others. “Most agendas approved in the February 2020 house meeting had been taken before the emergence of the pandemic. Things on-ground have changed since then. The MCG’s resources have largely been focussed on preventing the virus from spreading and its financial condition has also taken a hit. Hence, there has been little to no progress on these agendas,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter. The official, however, added that most agendas floated and subsequently approved in the house meetings following the national lockdown were conceptualised keeping Covid-19 in mind and hence, have had seen more progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-review-status-of-proposals-approved-in-2020-house-meetings-101612116144677.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Schools to reopen for classes 6 to 8 from February 1||Schools in the state will reopen for students in classes 6 to 8 for the first time since March on Monday. While most private schools said they were likely to continue with online classes, government schools, on the other hand, said were expecting a good turnout since students had not visited the school for nearly 11 months. As per the SOP (standard operating procedure) for reopening of schools, students need to produce a written consent letter from parents and a health clearance. Classes will take place for the duration of nearly 3 hours starting from 10 am. School across the country were shut in March last year amid the outbreak of Covid-19. Voluntary visits to schools for doubt-clearing sessions were allowed from September, followed by regular classes from November 2 for students in classes 9 to 12. Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that students had been informed about the required documents for school visits through WhatsApp groups. “Necessary directions regarding the health clearance have been conveyed to students. Since the strength of students on campus will increase significantly, maintaining physical distancing will be crucial. There will be no prayer or recess sessions,” said Sharma, adding that physical distancing within the classroom might be a challenge. Shyam Raghav, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school was expecting students to turn up in good numbers since students had no interaction with teachers or their peers in the past 11 months. “We hope to see students since physical classes had not been taking place for a very long time. Students who have difficulty in catching up with lessons online will be able to get their doubts cleared more freely now,” said Raghav. Many private schools said that they’d wait for the situation to stabilise further before calling students. Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said that the school would call students based on feedback from parents. “For now, only students in classes 9 to 12 are visiting the school. For other classes, we will take feedback from parents,” said Erry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/schools-to-reopen-for-classes-6-to-8-from-february-1-101612116145107.html

Farmers from Bawal, Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Hanumangarh and Ganganagar renewed their agitation on Sunday even though some locals from Haryana raised concerns against the blocking of the route. Sinu Jaisinghpuria, a resident of Jaisinghpur Khera, said that petrol pump owners along with villages had approached the protesting farmers to share their grievances. “People are incurring losses due to the blockade. Due to the increased movement of vehicles passing through the village, there have been accidents too. People share the concerns of the farmers but there was no headway,” said Jaisinghpuria.. Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, said that around 50 people had reached the protest site for discussions. “Some petrol pump owners came here in the morning. They said that they were not against farmers but were facing financial losses due to the protest. We told them that the Haryana government had barricaded the routes,” said Sohlot. In a video shared on Twitter, Yogendra Yadav, head of Swaraj India, said that attempts were being made to create a disturbance at the protest site as had been the case at other places on the Delhi-Haryana border. “There are many petrol pumps on this stretch in Haryana. The owners of these petrol pumps are facing issues. Their workers are being portrayed as locals,” said Yadav. He said that the protesting farmers were ready to engage with people who had genuine concerns. “If locals have issues, they can reach out to us. Others shouldn’t play games under the garb of nationalism,” said Yadav. He said that the situation had changed for the better with the government on the back foot now. Yadav said the protest at Shahjahanpur was swelling with farmers from Rajasthan, Haryana, and Bawal. “People from Haryana are strengthening the protest here as well as in other protest sites in Delhi now. People from Bawal also arrived here and joined the agitation,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-renew-protest-at-haryana-border-despite-opposition-from-locals-101612116084745.html

While officials said they do not anticipate a gross increase in the incidence of leprosy, they said that the likelihood of undetected cases remains high. “There are currently 20 active patients under treatment for two kinds of leprosy, but they have either self-reported their symptoms or were already in treatment before March 2020. ASHA workers usually conduct routine surveillance for leprosy, but since they were busy with contact-tracing of Covid-19 patients in May and June of last year, we had to suspend our campaign to actively detect new cases,” said Dr Vinit Yadav, district leprosy officer, Gurugram.A total of 148 cases of leprosy have been reported from the district since 2018, of which 20 cases are active patients. The majority of these were detected either prior to the Covid-19 induced lockdown, while a few self-reported their symptoms. “However, in case of self-reporting, many times the patients have already suffered irreversible damage to their skin and limbs. The incubation period for the disease can take up to five years. This is why active surveillance needs to resume urgently so that clinical interventions can be made in time,” said Dr Yadav.A total of 120 ASHA workers will, over the next two weeks, survey nearly 27,000 individual households for the disease, in those areas where leprosy has been previously detected over the past three years. The health department has also enrolled male volunteers to assist ASHA workers in certain cases, such as when male patients need to be undressed for screening. “We have completed the training programme for medical officers, who will brief healthcare workers on Monday. The door-to-door survey will begin within this week itself,” Yadav added.As per a centrally revamped scheme to increase surveillance for the disease — which was declared to be statistically eradicated in 2011 — workers will be provided an incentive of ₹200 for each household surveyed, while the incentive for detecting individual cases is ₹600 per diagnosis. Informal housing clusters, which suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, are the most vulnerable.“We assume that 5 percent of any given population is at risk, particularly in slum clusters. Of the current group of active leprosy patients, 15 are from slum areas in urban Gurugram, while the rest are from similar settlements in Farrukhnagar and Sohna,” said Dr Yadav. He added that, starting this year, all neighbourhoods with a low incidence of leprosy (equal to one case per 10,000 people) will be surveyed annually, while half-yearly surveys will be conducted in areas with a higher incidence of the disease, i.e. those areas with more than one notified case per 10,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-health-department-to-begin-survey-to-detect-cases-of-leprosy-101612116024731.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram: Businessman cheats private bank with fake gold for ₹8-lakh loan||A Gurugram based catering businessman managed to fool a private bank to issue ₹8-lakh worth loans against fake jewellery, said police on Sunday. Police suspect the man bought the cooperation of the jeweller that the bank relied on for ascertaining purity of gold. Both suspects -- catering businessman Shashi Kumar and an unnamed city jeweller-- were on the runs, said police.Police said Kumar, a resident of Bhiwani, approached the Sohna Road branch of IDBI Bank in March last year for a gold loan. He tried to mortgage four gold bangles that he claimed weighed 134 grams and was 22 carat pure. The bank then, as per norms, got the gold tested by the jeweller and then sanctioned a ₹3.70 lakh loan.A month later, Kumar approached the same branch and wished to mortgage another four bangles. Again the bank had its purity tested by the same jeweller and then sanctioned ₹4.25 lakh. In August, Kumar repaid the principal and interest and got back his gold.In the second week of January this year, Kumar attempted to get a ₹2-lakh loan from the same bank’s Manesar branch. Each branch had its own jeweller and this time, the Manesar branch’s authorised jeweller found that bangles were fake. KK Rao, Gurugram commissioner of police, said, “It was found that from inside the bangles were not of gold but some other metal on which gold was plated and placed with a fake hallmark (certification of purity).”When this was brought to the notice bank officials, they investigated Kumar’s previous loans and found discrepancies.Dhanesh Chaudhary, regional head of IDBI Bank, in his complaint filed on Sunday with the sector 50 police station said Kumar in connivance with the city-based jeweller, cheated the bank of ₹8.65 lakh. “Had the jeweller done his job properly, the bank would not have financed the fraudster and could have been saved from the loss,” said the complainant. On the basis of the complaint a case was registered against the accused and jeweller under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of IPC. “We are conducting raids to arrest the suspect,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-businessman-cheats-private-bank-with-fake-gold-for-8-lakh-loan-101612116025220.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Faridabad: Gang dupes many using ‘magic’ pen, four arrested||The Faridabad police have arrested four members of a gang from Delhi for allegedly duping several people of lakhs of rupees by using ‘magic’ pens on the pretext of offering extended warranty on their cars. According to the police, the suspects posing as officials of private automobile companies used to offer their pens to the customers for filling up the cheques. However, the ‘magic’ ink would later disappear and the gang would fill in amounts in lakh and withdraw the same from the persons’ accounts, said the police. The suspects were identified as Pawan alias Gaurav Sharma of Jahangirpuri in Delhi, presently living on rent in Sector 15 of Gurugram; Rahul Kumar of Hapur who was living on rent in Delhi’s Kailash Colony; Balbir Singh alias Ballu alias Ankit of Delhi and Amit Saxena alias Mona of Harsh Vihar in Delhi. The police said the suspects used to make calls to the people who had bought new cars in the past three years after taking their details from the agents. OP Singh, Faridabad police commissioner, said that the suspects used to offer extended warranty on their cars. “They used to visit the customers’ residences and offices and ask them to pay ₹1,100 for extended car warranty which was a nominal amount and people easily fell prey to their tricks. They used to offer their pens to the victims and later they would use heat to remove the amount section and filled lakhs instead of ₹1,100 and duped them,” he said. The gang members operated from different areas of Delhi and called up people everyday and made at least 10 calls each, said the police. The incident came to fore when a Faridabad’s Sector 15 resident approached police and lodged a complaint that he was duped of ₹1.90 lakh on January 16. Singh said the suspects also used to divert the calls of the victims to their own phone numbers before presenting cheques in the banks, and if the manager or bank executive called to confirm the cheque then the call was received by them confirming the amount. A case under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code, including Section 420 (cheating), was registered at cyber police station, said the police. Basant Kumar, inspector at the cyber police station, said that they had formed a team, and based on technical surveillance, call detail records and human intelligence, arrested the suspects from different parts of Delhi on January 27. The team has recovered ₹1 lakh, four mobile phones, and four magic pens, among others, from their possession, Kumar said. “The gang members had duped more than 50 people in Delhi-NCR. In another case, the gang had duped a Sector 28 resident of ₹3.40 lakh after he paid a cheque of ₹1,050 on October 29 last year,” he said. “After receiving the cheque, they used to put the negotiable instrument in front of a bulb. The heat evaporated the ink and they later filled in huge amounts,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/faridabad-gang-dupes-many-using-magic-pen-four-arrested-101612115964666.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Rewari villagers start patrol to prevent protesters from returning||Local villagers of Rewari belt have started night patrolling on the Delhi-Jaipur highway from Sangwari Chowk in Rewari to Masani village near Dharuhera to ensure that protesters do not return to the vacated sites. The villagers are also keeping a check on their base camp at Shahjahanpur to ensure that protestors do not move towards Rewari and set up camps there. On January 27, panchayats of 20 villages in Rewari held a meeting and gave an ultimatum to protesting farmers at Masani, asking them to vacate by January 28. Capt (retd) Lala Ram, sarpanch of Masani village, said that villagers of Rajasthan are supporting the farmers and are providing them with food and shelter. “Although we are ready to support them but cannot allow them to return to the earlier sites due to the losses we have already suffered. The protesters have damaged our field. We are working to improve them and make them ready for cultivation. We are yet not over with the cleaning part and it will take another week or so. As such, we want to be vigilant and do not want them to occupy the space again,” he said. The villagers were unhappy with the way the protestors had vacated the sites without cleaning up. Teams have been formed which are patrolling between 7pm and 5am everyday. “We have asked the youth to take charge of the patrolling team but not to indulge in any kind of violence. They have been asked to inform us if they find any protestors. Further, dhaba owners have been asked not to entertain or give space to protestors to set up their tents,” he said. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 farmers from different parts of Haryana reached Shahjahanpur on Sunday and renewed their protest. They have taken over langars and tents, which were left by the farmers who returned home on January 27. Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said they had started a silent protest in Delhi. He added that some of them, along with other leaders including Rampal Jat, leader of Kisan Mahapanchayat, were detained by Delhi police on Saturday. “We were picked by Daryaganj Police from Rajghat and were let off late at night. Though, we had written to Delhi police commissioner but we did not get any permission,” he said. Sitting on the main carriageway at Shahajahanpur, farmer leaders addressing the gathering, stated that they would not be moving from this site. They also mentioned that they will ensure that more and more farmers join the protest from villages across Rajasthan and Haryana. Nehra said they are planning to visit the local villages in order to rally support. They need at least 3,000 more protesters at the site to show their strength, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rewari-villagers-start-patrol-to-prevent-protesters-from-returning-101612115904745.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Bhondsi Jail starts video conferencing facility for inmates||The Haryana prison department has started a video conferencing facility for Bhondsi jail inmates to help connect with their family members, said officials. The initiative, which was introduced last week, was taken after physical meetings were discontinued since March for the 2,500 inmates of the jail due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. Since then only calls were allowed from two landline numbers. K Selvaraj, director-general (prisons), said that the inmates were missing their family members. “Therefore, we decided to launch video conferencing to ensure they can see each other virtually. It is important to keep their morale high. In this way, they can feel connected with their family members,” he said. Harinder Singh, jail superintendent of Bhondsi jail, said that this unique initiative was launched with India Vision Foundation. “The inmates were depressed since they were not able to meet and see their family members. We had restricted the meetings due to the Covid-19 pandemic so that we could protect inmates from SARS-CoV-2 virus that was rapidly spreading. Through the service, inmates can also talk to their relatives online through video conferencing, while staying at jail,” he said. Singh said first three video calls for 10 minutes each will be free of cost. After that, they will be charged ₹2.50 per minute. “An inmate can make a 10-minute call everyday to registered mobile numbers and those who wish to make normal calls can do so for 50 paisa per minute. There is a PCO inside the jail used by inmates. However, the video call will add another value to the services provided to inmates,” he said. Officers said, initially they have set up 15 video conferencing sets for the inmates and will add more depending on the demand. Singh said the inmates can use the facility between 7am and 6pm and the sets have been donated by India Vision Foundation. An in-house software developed by the inmates called ‘Phoenix’ has been connected to the set up for the video conferencing. Monica Dhawan, director of India Vision Foundation, said that the new project will help the mental well-being of the inmates . “During Covid-19, meetings were restricted due to which inmates were depressed. This video calling facility will help them to connect with their families and will also save the travel time and the expense of their family members,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bhondsi-jail-starts-video-conferencing-facility-for-inmates-101612115905263.html

In a directive shared with colleges earlier last week, the higher education department said that colleges were trying to engage with students using various digital tools. However, it has come to the notice of the department that many students did not have access to electronic tools for e-content. To bridge the gap, the department plans to initiate a helpline for college students as part of its project called “Gyan Ganga: Samvaad.” The helpline will allow students to connect with teachers for clarifying doubts and other subject queries. The directive, undersigned by Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, stated that the helpline will provide students with an opportunity to interact with experts of their respective subjects in arts, sciences, and commerce streams. Verma said that the service will be available from 9am till 6pm in English and Hindi, and calls will be recorded for monitoring and evaluation. Ramesh Garg, the principal of Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that a meeting was conducted on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of the initiative. “We will have to fix the timings for interactions with different teachers on different days in accordance with their teaching schedule. The schedule for these sessions will be prepared after discussion with faculty members. A plan will be chalked out before the helpline is made functional,” said Garg. Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the project was aimed at reaching out to students who did not have adequate digital devices needed for online learning. Yadav said that deliberations would take place before the helpline is made functional. “Even today, there are some students who are facing challenges in accessing online learning. The helpline seeks to bridge the gap with faculty and these students. Currently, various issues are being discussed. Once finalised, we will be able to start work,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/education-department-to-start-helpline-for-students-101612115844673.html
31-01-2021||Noida||Over 500 trees felled, stolen from Gram Sabha land in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department, with the help of police, has launched an investigation after receiving complaints that more than 500 well grown trees were felled and smuggled from the Gram Sabha land in Uncha Ameerpur village. The forest department had planted these trees in 2012 and handed over them to the Gram Sabha in 2015, officials said. Avnish Singh, a local resident who informed the forest department about the incident recently, said that the trees had grown well in the past nine years. “Three days ago some local people visited the spot and found that a number of trees have been felled and smuggled. It appears that some smugglers stole these trees at night,” he said.On Saturday, a team of forest department and Jarcha police conducted an inspection of the spot after getting the information. According to the forest department, a total of 534 trees of different species were illegally felled and timber stolen. “The species included arjun, neem, kanji, and babul to count a few. We have lodged a complaint at Jarcha police station. The plantation was carried out by the forest department on the Gram Sabha’s land and maintained it till 2015,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar.The area of land on which the illegal felling took place is around 10 bigha, Srivastava said, adding that a playground was already proposed on the land for which permission was sought from the forest department to fell the plantation. “However, the incident happened before the forest department could act,” he said. Shripal Singh, station house officer, Jarcha police station, said that around 10,000 trees were planted in the area nine years ago. “It appears that some wood gatherers used to roam around in the area and pick dry wood. Gradually, they started cutting branches of the trees and then felling them. We have registered a case under sections 4 and 10 of the Forest Act. We are investigating the case and will arrest the people involved in the crime,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-500-trees-felled-stolen-from-gram-sabha-land-in-greater-noida-101612115784723.html
31-01-2021||Noida||Tikait’s call for water draws people to UP Gate protest site||Ghaziabad: Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait’s emotional appeal last week has been doing wonders for the farmers’ agitation at the UP Gate protest site as the gathering swelled further on Sunday, with several people bringing food and water for him. The office bearers of the BKU said that ever since his appeal, the only water Tikait has been consuming is that which has been brought to him by the people coming to support the protest.It was on the evening of January 28 that Tikait, while he was approached by the Ghaziabad police and administration officials with a notice to vacate the UP Gate site, broke down in tears in front of supporters and media persons, appealing that he wants people to come and offer him water and food.Following this, he said he won’t vacate the protest site and had also alleged that the Ghaziabad administration had stopped the water supply and snapped the electricity supply.Ever since, thousands of people from different areas in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and even Karnataka have arrived with water. “I had come to UP Gate with my two children and have been here for the past two days. I was touched by his appeal and have come to support him. The agitation is gaining strength and the government will have to consider the demands of farmers,” said Rajeshwari Meena, a resident of Dausa in Rajasthan.“We are protesting that crops should not be locked in lockers (referred to as godowns of corporate). We will not allow the pagdi (turban) of farmers and ‘roti’ (food) of the poor to be locked up. Roti cannot be allowed to be a part of business. If this happens, the common man will suffer. Camera aur kalam pe bandook ka pehra hai (guns are curbing the pen and the camera), and this is why the message is still not going to the common man,” Tikait, the national spokesperson of the BKU, said. Since January 28, people have brought water for Tikait from their homes and even from the Golden Temple at Amritsar in Punjab. Some came from as far as Karnataka on Sunday, bringing in water from river Kaveri.He said this water will be sent to be flowed in river Ganga.“The water coming in from other rivers, homes and water bodies will be collected and sent to Ganga. This water will be flowed in the river which will eventually flow out into the sea. It will help farmers during the rains and will help him irrigate his fields. This will also cement our bond with the almighty,” Tikait added. On January 26, the UP Gate protest site had an estimated crowd of 800-1,000 at the site, even as many left in apprehension of police action, after the incidents of violence on Republic Day in the national Capital. “On Sunday, there was an estimated gathering of more than 15,000-20,000 at the site and more people will arrive soon. His appeal for water and food to be brought from homes touched hearts and people are turning out in large numbers at UP Gate. More prominently, the appeal has gone down well with women who are also coming and even urging their family members to reach UP Gate,” said Rajbir Singh, Uttar Pradesh vice-president of the BKU.He said Tikait was pained when the Ghaziabad administration had allegedly stopped the water- being supplied through tankers, in order to pressurise farmers to vacate the site.Earlier, Ajay Shankar Pandey, the Ghaziabad district magistrate, had said that the water supply was not stopped but some water tankers were deployed elsewhere after the gathering at UP Gate decreased. He had further added that electricity was not snapped but there was some fault which had led to a power outage. The electricity and water supply was restored later. Pandey did not respond to calls on Sunday. “Since that day, Tikait is only consuming water given to him by the people and hasn’t had bottled-water or water brought in by tankers,” Singh added. Farmers at the UP Gate site have been camping there since November 28, 2020 demanding repeal of three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/tikaits-call-for-water-draws-people-to-up-gate-protest-site-101612115724665.html
31-01-2021||Noida||Noida authority clears sector 123 plot of 100 tonnes garbage||The Noida Authority has removed over 100 tonne waste illegally dumped in a 25-acre plot near sector 123.About 25 trucks transported the waste to the authority’s two remediation centres for segregation and disposal, officials informed.The officials stated that they will repair the boundary wall around the plot, which belongs to it, to prevent further dumping. The area is home to residential colonies and high rises. Residents, many of who had been raising the issue with the authority since the last two months, however, are apprehensive on whether the authority can ensure that the area remains waste-free.“Even earlier the plot had been cleaned but rag pickers and neighbouring industries would dump waste there, including chemicals. Some people would also set it afire,” said Dinesh Singh, resident of Home-121, a high rise in sector 121 that is adjacent to the said plot.According to the residents, the plot was gated last year but the walls were partially brought down and the gate removed to pave way for heavy vehicles.“The electricity department had some work there, but was never rebuilt after it was done,” said Singh,Adwitiya Sharma, an employee works with the water department, cycles in this area daily. “The stench is almost unbearable and I often change my routes to avoid this place,” he said The Noida Authority said it will do all it can to prevent a repeat.“We have already started cleaning the plot and will begin constructing the boundary wall from Monday. We will keep an eye on illegal dumping here ensure that the issue doesn’t persist,” said Avinash Tripathi, Officer on special duty (health) Noida authority.He added that there was only one designated waste dumping yard at sector 145 that the authority manages as per norms.“About 22 to 25 truckloads of garbage was recovered from the site and the plot is being soiled using three earthmoving machines. The issue is that neighbouring Ghaziabad doesn’t have an authorised dumping ground and so people from there dump it here,” said SC Mishra, project engineer (Health), Noida authority.Noida generates about 550 to 600 tonnes of garbage every day, that goes to two different material recovery plants and finally to its dumping yard in sector 145, about 20 km from the sector 123 plot.“We have a successful waste management system, but due to the diversity in the city many are still unaware of proper waste management rules. We still are getting around 80 per cent waste as segregated. But such illegal dumping parallel continues that we are working on to act against,” said Tripathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-clears-sector-123-plot-of-100-tonnes-garbage-101612115725244.html
31-01-2021||Noida||Release those arrested after Republic Day violence in Delhi: Tikait||Ghaziabad: Leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) at the UP Gate protest site said Sunday that the government should consider the release of the 84 persons arrested in connection with incidents of violence that unfolded on Republic Day in Delhi, and that this will pave the way for a “good environment” for talks with the government.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 30, during an all-party meeting ahead of the budget session on February 1, has said that the government stands by the offer to the farmers by agriculture minister Naresh Tomar, made during the last meeting between the government and farmer representatives.Rakesh Tikait, who has emerged as the face of the farmers’ agitation at the UP Gate protest site, on January 30 had appealed to the government to hold talks. “If the government comes to us with a clean heart then talks will proceed smoothly. We wish that the prime minister raises the ‘jai Jawan, jai kisan’ slogan and releases the 84 arrested persons. This will create a good environment for talks. We do not wish to proceed to Delhi and will continue with our peaceful protest here,” Rakesh told media persons at UP Gate.A day after THE tractor rally called by farmers on Republic Day spiralled out of control the farmer leaders had decided to postpone their proposed February 1 march to the Parliament.In connection with the incidents on Republic Day, the Delhi Police have filed various FIRs, some of them against farmers’ leaders. In the evening on Republic Day, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmer groups, had said that the protest was hijacked by people not connected to them. They had dissociated themselves from the protesters who had attacked the police and indulged in violence during the day.SUKHBIR SINGH BADAL MEETS TIKAITEver since the emotional appeal made by Rakesh on January 28 at UP Gate, leaders from various opposition parties have been flocking to UP Gate to meet him and extend support.On Sunday, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party pulled out of the ruling National Democratic Alliance in September last year over the issue of farm laws, visited UP Gate and extended support to the farmers. Badal also met Rakesh and hailed his efforts in taking up the fight of farmers.“I have come to congratulate Chaudhary Rakesh Tikait who is fighting for the farmers. My father, Prakash Singh Badal, and Tikait’s father, Chaudhary Mahendra Singh Tikait, had fought together for the cause of farmers. I and my party extend our support to him (Rakesh) and all farmers. The prime minister should listen to the demands of the farmers,” Badal told reporters. “Farmers of the entire country are fighting collectively, and I request all parties to keep aside their political differences and fight for farmers till the farm laws are taken back,” he added. Earlier, Delhi’s deputy chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, UP Congress committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda had met Rakesh Tikait at UP Gate, while many others have spoken to him over the phone and extended help and support. On January 30, Rakesh was joined by Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala. ROADS BLOCKEDThe officials of the Ghaziabad traffic police on Sunday said that traffic on the Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) was stopped after multi-layered barricades were put up by the Delhi Police. “The Delhi Police have closed the DME by putting up barricades and commuters in Ghaziabad can move to Delhi through the Kaushambi-Anand Vihar border or from Sector 62 in Noida. Since the DME is shut, there is hardly any movement inside the jurisdiction of Ghaziabad district,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, superintendent of police (traffic). It is for the first time at the UP Gate border that the barricades have barbed fencing; concrete-mix has also poured between the cement slab barriers to fortify the barricading. The Ghazipur to Vaishali road has also been blocked similarly, with no commuter movement. When approached, there was no official response but a Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “Security has been tightened in view of violence on Republic Day.” The Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway is also heavily barricaded and has been occupied by protesting farmers since December 3, 2020. The protesters have complained that the internet connectivity at the UP Gate has been affected. “Barricading and stoppage of internet connectivity are pressure tactics, but farmers’ position is now gaining strength after the emotional appeal by Rakesh Tikait. It is due to this resurgence that the prime minister on Saturday spoke on the issue of talks (during the all-party meeting),” said Anil Tyagi, a farmer from Muradnagar’s Asalat Nagar village in Ghaziabad. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/release-those-arrested-after-republic-day-violence-in-delhi-tikait-101612115664724.html
31-01-2021||Other||Noida: JAL allowed to finish stuck housing project in Sector 128||NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera) has allowed the Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) to finish a stuck housing project in Noida Sector 128 as a contractor, following demands from the homebuyers. UP-Rera officials said that JAL will complete the Jaypee Greens Night Court project and deliver the flats in the next 15 months. The real estate regulator took the decision in its meeting held on January 27.This is the second such case where the regulator made the promoter a contractor to seek a solution to the plight of apartment owners. On September 19 last year, following orders of UP-Rera, JAL started construction at its stuck Kalypso Court project in Sector 128. “The authority is very serious to make sure that the projects are delivered and the homebuyers get benefited,” said Rajive Kumar, chairman of UP-Rera.Jaypee Greens Night Court has eight towers having 310 units. The work on the project is stalled since 2014, the officials said, adding that only 60% work was done by the promoter.According to the Rera officials, a fund of ₹145.5 crore is required to finish the remaining construction work of this project. While ₹103.35 crore has to be contributed by the homebuyers, the promoter will pay ₹40.85 crore to finish the project.As per the terms, the promoter will pay ₹10 crore upfront and start the work at the site in the next two weeks, the officials said.“This is a good move that the apartment buyers and the promoter have agreed to complete the remaining work mutually,” said Balvinder Kumar, member of UP-Rera. Many homebuyers want that the promoter completes the remaining work because a new developer may further delay the project. “If a new developer steps in, then it may take long time to finish the already delayed realty project. Also, the quality of the construction may be an issue,” said Sachin Kumar, a homebuyer of Jaypee Greens Night Court. JAL said that it would finish and deliver the project in stipulated time. “We will follow the instructions of Rera and deliver as per the schedule,” said a JAL spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-jal-allowed-to-finish-stuck-housing-project-in-sector-128-101612115604680.html

Now, people will not leave the non-milking cows abandoned. This will improve the condition of cows in Madhya Pradesh,” he added.However, Congress leaders blamed the state government for promoting the phenyl manufactured by private companies.Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary said, “The government comes up with this decision without setting up any infrastructure. If the state government really wants to promote by-products of cows to improve the condition of stray cows, they should have at least started some factories in the state. Now, the demand will be fulfilled by a private company of Uttarakhand.”BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari said, “This is a vague thinking of Congress leaders. Why would anyone set up a factory without any demand? The state government has taken a good decision and other states will follow suit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-govt-offices-to-be-cleaned-with-cow-urine-phenyl-only-states-an-order-101612114744417.html

31-01-2021||Jaipur||Congress wins Rajasthan municipal polls in neck-to-neck fight with BJP||Continuing its winning spree in municipal polls in Rajasthan, Congress on Sunday won the municipal polls in a neck-to-neck fight with the BJP and independents in formation of municipal boards in several municipal bodies. The Congress has won 1,197 municipal wards, BJP has bagged 1,140 municipal wards while independents/others have secured 634 wards out of total 3,034 municipal wards.While the NCP has won 46 wards, the RLP has 13 wards, CPM has won 3 and the BSP has won 1.While the BJP has a majority/lead of wards in 24 municipal bodies, the Congress has a majority/lead of wards in 23 municipal bodies. There are 41 municipal boards in which independents hold key.However, the BJP has won a majority in the Ajmer Municipal Corporation which was the only municipal corporation where municipal polls were held in the current polls.The Congress has maintained its winning spree in the current municipal polls after ensuring lead over the BJP in municipal polls in November and December 2020. However, the party had lagged in the recent panchayat polls but is maintaining a lead over the BJP in municipal polls.Meanwhile, the NCP surprised everyone by winning an absolute majority in Nokha municipality of Bikaner and being the biggest party in Tonk's Niwai municipality.Also read: GST revenue collection for January almost touched ₹1.20 lakh crore - GovtFor the first time, the NCP will form its municipal boards in Rajasthan.Elections were held for 3,035 municipal wards of the 90 municipal bodies, including one municipal corporation, nine municipal councils and 80 municipalities.The BJP won in the Ajmer Municipal Corporation (AMC) polls whereby it won 48 wards. The Congress won 18 wards, the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) won one ward and the independents won 13. The Congress failed to dethrone the BJP from the AMC. BJP and Congress workers also locked horns during the results in AMC polls where mild stone-pelting was also reported in a municipal ward.The BJP has regained its hold over Jhalawar municipal council and Jhalarapatan municipality of former chief minister Vasundhra Raje's constituency Jhalarapatan which was earlier won by the Congress in the last municipal polls five years ago. The BJP won 25, the Congress 17 and the independents won 3 out of 45 wards in Jhalawar while the BJP won 20, the Congress won 14 and the independent bagged one out of 35 wards in Jhalarapatan municipality.The Congress and the BJP have already started herding their winning corporators for the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the municipal boards.The performance of Gehlot's cabinet ministers remained a mixed bag. There was a tie between the Congress and the BJP with victory on 14 wards each in Lakshmangarh municipality of PCC chief and education minister Govind Singh Dotasara's home constituency. The board formation would depend on 12 independents in 40 ward municipal board.However, Congress's defeat in Ajmer municipal corporation was a setback for state health minister, Dr Raghu Sharma, is an MLA from Ajmer's Kektri assembly constituency, however, Congress' triumph in his home assembly constituency Kekri ensured his dominance. Congress won 21 wards out of 40 wards of Kekri municipality to bring a respite to Dr Raghu Sharma. Here, the BJP won 17 wards and the independents bagged two.While in Bikaner's Deshnok municipality, the Congress won 11 wards and BJP won 10 wards out of total 25 wards.However, the Congress has won a majority with victory on 15 wards out of 25 wards in Nainwa municipality of Bundi district from where the minister of state for youth affairs and sports, Ashok Chandana, is an MLA. Although the Congress has won 28 wards out of total 60 in Bundi municipal council, the BJP has won 24 here and 8 independents are holding key.The Congress lagged in Nawa municipality of Nagaur district from where party's deputy whip Mahendra Chaudhary is MLA. Here, the Congress could win just 10 wards while the BJP won 13 wards and independents two of total 25 wards.The Congress is behind the BJP in minority affairs minister Saleh Mohammad's Pokran municipality where the party could only win nine wards whereas the BJP won 10 and the independent candidate bagged 6 wards.The NCP remained a surprise winner in the municipal boards in the state where the party won in Nokha municipality of Bikaner district. Here, the NCP won in 28 wards and the BJP in 15 wards while independents won two out of total 45 wards. Here, Narayan Jhanwar, son of ex-Congress candidate from Nokha assembly constituency Kanhaiyyalal Jhanwar in last polls, contested on NCP symbol.The result was similar in Niwai municipality of Tonk district where the NCP won 17 wards, the BJP won 9 wards, the Congress won 8 and independents bagged one out of the total 35 wards. Here, Congress MLA from Niwai, Prashant Bairwa from Sachin Pilot camp, could not ensure victory to the ruling party.Commenting on NCP's municipal feat, senior political analyst and veteran journalist, Prakash Bhandari said that "the NCP managed its win but this is certainly not a vote to the NCP as it won on the shoulders of Congress supporters who either did not get a Congress ticket or strategically fielded themselves from the NCP to prevent defeat".Meanwhile, the Congress and the BJP have claimed their triumph in the municipal polls.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted on municipal polls results, "The municipal results of 90 municipal bodies are pleasant. Congratulations to all the winning Congress candidates and Congress leaders for ensuring victory of the party. I also express gratitude to the voters. The voting percentage and number of wards won by Congress is more and Congress will be able to form its municipal boards in most places".PCC chief Dotasara on municipal polls results said, "the BJP and its leaders always say that the Congress government will not be able to complete its term in Rajasthan but the party should do self-evaluation after municipal polls results today"."The BJP had formed its municipal boards in 60 municipal bodies in 2015 and the Congress in 25 but now the BJP is likely to form just 30 boards in current polls which is half from 2015. The Congress will form its boards in 50 bodies which will be double from 2015," said Dotasara.Also read: Delhi Police tracking owners of tractors that took wrong route on R-DayThe BJP contradicted ruling party's claim as state president Satish Punia alleged that CM Gehlot and the party are misleading people by making false claims of their victory in the municipal polls."The Congress has lost the poll in Ajmer Municipal corporation and 8 out of 9 municipal councils while it has got a majority in only 19 municipal boards out of 90 municipal boards whose results were declared today," he said.Punia also asserted that the Congress state government has employed all means of conspiracy, including delimitation and bogus voting, to win the elections.As per the state election commission of Rajasthan, nearly 22.84 lakh voters cast their votes for municipal bodies on 28 January in which voter turnout was 76.52 per cent.The 20 districts where municipal polls were held are Ajmer, Banswara, Bikaner, Bhilwara, Bundi, Pratapgarh, Jhalawar, Chittorgarh, Churu, Dungarpur, Hanumangarh, Jaisalmer, Jalore, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur, Pali, Rajsamad, Sikar, Tonk and Udaipur.As per the municipal poll results in these 90 municipal bodies five years ago, 60 were won by the BJP, 25 by the Congress and 5 by independent candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/congress-wins-rajasthan-municipal-polls-in-neck-to-neck-fight-with-bjp-101612110608750.html
31-01-2021||Other||Pune records warmest January in a decade||PUNE Last month was the warmest January in the city in a decade as per the weather department. The city recorded 12.3 degrees Celsius as the lowest minimum temperature reported in the month of January.Usually, January is expected to report the lowest night temperature during the winter season. But this season due to various weather systems over Maharashtra and central India, Pune city has experienced less cool days.DS Pai, head, Long Range Forecast (LRF) and Climate Services and Research, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said that there are several factors for the rise in temperature.“We have seen cloudy weather in Pune city in January. With cloudy weather, there is an increase in night temperature. Also, there were many weather systems that resulted in an increase in night temperature. Fringe areas of the city have reported normal temperature, but in the city, night temperature observed was above normal. So due to urbanisation also, we have seen a rise in temperature,” said Pai.January 2021 has also unexpectedly reported record break rainfall in Pune. As per the weather department, the city reported 32.5-millimetre rainfall which was the highest reported rainfall since 1948. Rainfall and the cloudy weather, Pai added, were another reason that maintained that rise in night temperature.“Due to cloudy weather, the heat is trapped which results in an increase in minimum temperature. We observed cloudy skies all throughout the month along with other weather systems. All of these were contributing factors to the rise in minimum temperature,” he said.Anupam Kashyapi, head, weather forecasting department, IMD, Pune, said that though the northern parts experienced a good winter, the same was not the case over central India which includes Maharashtra.“Winter in Maharashtra is caused due to the cooler winds that come to the state from the northern side, but Maharashtra this season was dominated by westerly, southwesterly, southerly wind pattern which prevented northerly wind to penetrate in the state keeping the temperature warmer,” said Kashyapi.He also added that this season, Pune city did not experience any cold waves and the night temperature was warmer than normal.“There have been no instances of cold waves in Pune city this season. Only isolated parts of Vidarbha in Maharashtra have reported cold waves, but overall, January was warmer,” added Kashyapi.Speaking about the summer season, DS Pai said that the weather department will issue a forecast by the end of February. “Right now it is too early to predict the summer season, but by the end of February, IMD will publish its overall forecast for March, April and May,” he said.Year--Lowest minimum temperature in Jan in Pune*2021--12.3°C*2020-8.2°C*2019--7.6°C*2018--9.6°C*2017-7.4°C*2016--7.3°C*2015--7°C*2014--7.1°C*2013--7.5°C*2012--6.6°C*2011--5.3°C*1935 (all time record)--1.7°C||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-records-warmest-january-in-a-decade-101612110745028.html

On January 29, a joint inspection of the route was carried out by PMC and PMPML officials. PMC’s executive engineer Amar Shinde said, “Yesterday, we visited the site with PMPML officials and gave them a demo of the facilities they had asked for. The major work has been completed. The minor work which is in the process will be over in a day or two. There is no problem to open the corridor.” Shriniwas Kandul, chief engineer from PMC’s electrical department said, “Doors of the bus stops have been put in place. Signal synchronization has been done and barricades have been closed. Major work has been completed.” From the last two months, the issue of starting the BRT route was in discussion. In 2020, Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol announced to start the bus service by January 1, 2021, whereas due to the lack of necessary safety arrangements and infrastructure PMPML had denied starting the bus service. “We had conducted an inspection of the BRT corridor as per basic safety arrangements and we asked the PMC to start the bus service. Now, in the next couple of days, we are going to have trial runs on this route so that our buses will run and know exactly how it works. After the trial runs and checking all the safety arrangements as per our demands we will immediately start the bus service for the public,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director. In the past, PMC has missed several deadlines on 5.5 km BRT corridor on Satara road which has seen a revamp.

31-01-2021||Pune||Barricaded entrance ramp road gate causing inconvenience to passengers at railway station||The main entrance gate through the ramp at the Pune railway station has been closed causing inconvenience to passengers to board trains. As the entrance has been closed by barricades, a huge traffic congestion builds outside the Pune railway station main chowk. Demand has been made to the railway authorities to open the main entrance with the rising passengers in the facility. Due to the countrywide lockdown, passenger train operations were stopped last year, however at least half of the trains have begun normal functioning in the unlock process. “Last week, when I had gone to drop my parents off to board the Goa express in the evening it was like a massive traffic jam outside the Pune railway station entrance gate. Long queues of PMPML buses, private cabs, auto-rickshaws standing in the chowk, and huge congestion. For some time, we feared that the train will be missed, but luckily, we somehow managed to enter the station premises just 10 minutes before the train arrival. I think the main reason behind these traffic jams is the closed entrance through the ramp road of the station. If it is opened then passengers will get a big relief,” said Vinay Puranik, a citizen. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, around 200 train operations were undertaken daily at the Pune railway station with more than two lakh passengers using the facility. After the unlock process started, train operations resumed back from May 2020, and slowly the number of train operations started increasing. Currently, a total of 80 train operations are carried out from the Pune station daily, with roughly 30,000 passengers using the facility. The Pune railway administration has made an entrance for the boarding passengers from the front side of the station, where the main entrance gate with a ramp road is currently closed. So, passengers are required to enter the station premises from two small entry gates for vehicles. The arriving passengers need to leave the station from the second exit gate which is on the other side of the station towards the Raja Bahadur Mill Road. “From the last couple of months, the number of train operations has increased and with it the traffic jam outside and passengers struggling to get an entry inside. The entrance gate of the ramp road which is currently barricaded and closed by the railways needs to be opened so that passengers coming to board the trains will easily get inside. I have seen several passengers who have missed the train due to this mismanagement and traffic jam.” said Suresh Jagtap, president of Pune station’s auto-rickshaw union. Pune divisional railway manager (DRM) Renu Sharma said, “The ramp road entry gate is currently closed as the number of train operations are less as of now. We will take a review of train operations and passenger entry points and if required the entrance gate from the ramp road will be opened up for passenger entry.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/barricaded-entrance-ramp-road-gate-causing-inconvenience-to-passengers-at-railway-station-101612107984303.html

The nearby residents said that the water pollution issue keeps cropping up every few months.Sanjay Kulkarni, executive engineer, environment from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “We were not aware about the current problem till now and I will send officials to check the status after you have provided us information.”“There are a few commercial laundries in that area who have in the past also been served notices by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). These laundries tend to discharge waste water in the river due to which various issues of water pollution keep on occurring at this place,” added Kulkarni.The Pavana river water after passing from Keju Devi temple goes to Chinchwad at Morya Gosavi temple, Chinchwad Phata, Dapodi and then meets Mula river at Sangvi. The river covers a distance of 60km.Along with water use for drinking purposes, the water has been also used by citizens for bathing or washing clothes who stay near the river banks.“So far we have not heard any cases where human beings suffered health issues after drinking the water, but PCMC cannot ignore marine biodiversity which is getting damaged. Also, animals who drink water directly from the water are harmed,” said Piyush Patil, a resident of the area near Keju Devi Temple.Social activist Madhav Patil of the organisation Angolichi Goli, said, “The water pollution issues have been raised in front of PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar and mayor Usha Dhore, but problems of water pollution go unheard every time. No concrete steps are being taken by the PCMC to stop water pollution.”In 2018, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) listed it among the five most heavily polluted rivers of Maharashtra.Untreated sewage, garbage, accumulation of silt and discharge of untreated waste were listed as the major causes of pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/residents-concerned-about-water-pollution-in-pavana-river-officials-promise-action-101612107925902.html

Rubal Agrawal, additional municipal commissioner, PMC, said, “We are working on the project. It will be finalized in the coming 15 days.” Dr Prakash Wagh, veterinary superintendent, PMC, said, “At present, we don’t have a clinic in city limits to treat stray dogs. So, we have decided to start one. We will finalize the plan soon, but we will not reveal any information such as place and other details right now. In the past, we faced opposition from residents while setting up such projects in their areas.” Earlier, the civic body had proposed the idea to set up a dog park and reserved a place in Mundhwa area. The first proposal came before standing committee in 2008 when it was headed by Shiv Sena member Shyam Deshpande. He had allocated ₹1 crore for a dog park. However, the project wasn’t taken up due to opposition from local residents. After four years, two corporators Kishor Vitkar and Sheetal Sawant had put a proposal before the standing committee to make provision for special space to keep all stray dogs under one roof which was sanctioned in December 2012. While the administration had finalized land in Mundhwa, local corporators from the area had taken objection and the proposal could not see the light of the day. Shivaji Lanke, superintendent engineer, construction department, said, “The clinic will be ground plus three-storied building structure along with parking facility for ambulance and OPD. We will require around ₹5 crore for the clinic.”“We don’t know the location right now. The plan is ready, but the place is yet to be finalized. Earlier, it was near to Naidu Hospital. However, it did not work out as the area has been finalized to set up late Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College,” he said. Besides the pet clinic, the civic body had faced problems while setting up garbage processing plants and biogas plants as local people and corporators had raised objections. In Ambegaon Budruk and Sus area, local residents had conducted agitation and demanded to close down such plants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-to-set-up-pet-clinic-in-city-but-unwilling-to-disclose-location-101612107924356.html

Around 36 per cent of schools in PMC limits have now reopened as per officials. Schools in Pune rural and in most parts of Maharashtra reopened on January 27 for classes five to eight. There are a total of 786 schools in PMC limits including private as well as PMC run schools. Suresh Jagtap, additional commissioner with the PMC said that schools will reopen with all precautionary measures in place and with only 50 per cent attendance for the safety of the children. “Of the 786 schools, we have inspected 348 schools and we have given permission to 283 schools to reopen from Monday. The inspection of these schools was done by PMC officials and all schools were checked for safety measures and sanitization. The teaching and non-teaching staff has also undergone Covid tests to ensure that the students are safe,” said Jagtap. He added that for students to attend school, consent from parents is a must. “For classes nine to 12, we have seen that parents were initially reluctant. However, as schools reopened, parents’ consent increased. We are hoping to see a similar trend,” said Jagtap. Officials noted that during the course of the coming week, more schools will be granted permission to reopen. In January, Pune district reported a 10.1 per cent turnout of students which was the lowest in the state and only 68.4 per cent of schools were reopened in the district as opposed to 95.9 per cent across Maharashtra. Anupama More, a parent from Pune city said that though she is a little fearful, she will send her child to the school. “My son is a student of class six and last year he spent it indoors. He is very happy that schools are reopening. Though there are precautions that are to be taken, I am looking forward to sending him back to school for offline education,” said More||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-schools-reopen-today-as-classes-5-8-resume-offline-lectures-101612107924950.html

During World War II she and 40 other orphan girls studied at the St Joseph’s Convent School, Panchgani.The plaque that hangs out in the verandah of the school reads, “This plate is given by the grateful Poles whose children, being exiled from their country, were given education in this convent in an atmosphere of friendliness and cordiality: Panchgani 11th November 1945.” The plaque itself, sadly, was in need of repairs.“We were around 40 girls who studied here and when we completed our education, we put up a plaque in the school to express our gratitude,” says Ludmila via social media.On Sunday, the Consul General of the Republic of Poland in Mumbai, Damian Irzyk, was on a special mission to Panchgani, where he visited the St Joseph’s Convent School and restored the plaque, which is of historic value for Poland and India.“I am in touch with Jakutowicz and she expressed sadness of not being able to visit her alma mater during her trip to Kolhapur in 2019. She also told me about the sorry state of the plaque over the years, and so I thought of visiting the convent to see what could be done,” said Irzyk.“This plaque is of extreme importance and carries a lot of sentiments for Poles who were in India during their exile in 1945. We could not restore it earlier due to the Covid pandemic,” said Irzyk“Many poles living in East Poland were imprisoned and had to leave their homes when the Red Army (Soviet Union) attacked Poland. It was during the during World War II when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, that many of the war prisoners were released and they travelled overland to Persia (Iran), while around 5,000 made their way to India, where the Mumbai Consulate which was set up in 1939, was organising humanitarian aid and had a convoy of 15 to 20 lorries going to Gujarat and beyond as far a Turkmenistan with basic amenities,” recalls Ludmila.“It was decided by the then Consul General Eugeniusz Banasinski and his wife Kira Banasinska, that instead of getting empty trucks, children be brought back, mostly orphans to camps set up in Balachadi. Of these 500 to 600 children were transferred to Pune and Kolhapur where a small town by the name of Valivade was set up near Kolhapur,” she said.“It was for secondary education, that many of us were transferred to Kolhapur at Valivade camp and sent to St. Joseph’s Convent School, the only Catholic school in Panchgani then.

However, his parents had approached the police as the child failed to reach home even after late hours of the night.Additional commissioner of police Ashok Morale along with deputy commissioner of police Pournima Gaikwad were questioning multiple people to identify suspects in the case.“We had deployed the dog squad and made teams that were tracking him. We went through the forest area, chambers, and all possible spots to find him once we suspected foul play,” said senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange of Kothrud police station.The boy’s body was found with injuries on his back and back of the head that were visibly caused by a blunt object, according to the officials who found him.“We were following leads since that night. We were searching near his house when we realised that a small lane connected the slum area with an open ground near Garware college. The open ground has a compound that is almost seven feet high and is partially concrete and partially made of tin sheets. There was a gaping hole in the tin sheet which was used to throw garbage towards the other side. We forced open a nearby gate and searched inside the compound to find colours matching the description of his clothes provided by his parents,” said police sub-inspector Bhairavnath Shelke of Kothrud police station, who found the body.The police suspect that the boy was coaxed into going to the spot and then killed there with a blunt object. The body was sent to Sassoon General Hospital for post-mortem after which it was handed over to his parents.The child lived with his parents and an elder brother and a sister. The mother worked as a cleaning supervisor while the father did odd jobs at construction sites whenever available, according to their neighbours.“The family had moved here at the beginning of 2020. Then, the lockdown happened. In September, they had moved to a room adjacent to the one they had moved into initially. The child had gotten along well with the children in the colony. We barely saw him get in an argument. His parents used to have occasional fights,” said a woman who lives in the house next to the boy’s family, but did not wish to be named.A case under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered at Kothrud police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/body-of-missing-11-year-old-found-in-kothrud-101612107864346.html

The action had led to an altercation between the two and Karvande, according to the police. The two had come back around 2:30pm on a two-wheeler to where Karvande was deployed and hit him in the head with an iron rod before fleeing.The police tracked their move using CCTV cameras from the chowk to Mahalunge and arrested them.A case under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to public servant), and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Chakan police station on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-arrested-for-assaulting-pimpri-chinchwad-traffic-cop-101612107864997.html

Currently, flight movement is restricted between 8 am and 8 pm. This will now be increased to a total lockdown for these 14 days. This has affected passengers who have already booked tickets for the said period in view of the summer vacation, but is also likely to affect the dispatch of the Covid-19 vaccine from the city, even as the country is currently undergoing India’s biggest vaccination drive. The Pune airport’s official Twitter handle tweeted on Sunday, “As per information received from IAF, due to runway resurfacing works, Pune Airport will have no flight operations for 14 days from 26th April 2021 till 09 May 2021”. Confirming the news, airport director Kuldeep Singh said, “We have got this communication from the Indian Air Force and there will be no flights operating at night-time as well, as the runway is not available. If the Air Force changes its decision, this could be changed as well, as the runway belongs to the Air Force.” This has also raised questions on the dispatch of the Covishield vaccines which is being mass produced by Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune. Singh added, “At this time I cannot comment if this would affect the vaccine dispatch as we do not book the slots so many days in advance. The runway repair work was being planned almost a year ago, but for the vaccine dispatch we get the orders only a few hours or a day before the vaccine has to be dispatched; after which the cargo flight is booked.” SII’s executive director Suresh Jadhav said, “We were informed about this development, but mostly the vaccine goes from Mumbai international airport for transportation to various countries. With regards to the vaccine being transported within the country, we will have to send the vaccines to Mumbai airport or use our vans via roadways. As of now the government of India has not placed the purchase orders for the second lot, so whenever the order comes, if the dispatch has to happen before April 26, then it (transportation) would be taken care of from Pune itself, otherwise Mumbai airport. Sending it by road will be a huge task and add a minimum of five hours more.” Passengers not impressedWhile the runway repair work was being considered for over a year before it started, passengers and airlines were informed about the renewed schedule only a day before it began. The repair work started in October last year and will now go on for almost a year. During a media interaction earlier, the airport director had said that the repair work would not affect the daily passenger movement as all flights would be accommodated during the day timings, between 8 am and 8 pm. Angry passengers stormed the airport Twitter handle questioning why airlines continued to book tickets for the same period, if no flight operations were going to happen. One user tweeted, “If pune airport ll close in this period so why airlines are booking tickets in this period from pune or for pune...” Another user wrote, “@CMOMaharashtra what are you doing. when new airport will start in pune. such trouble causing people inconvenience.” Air India’s Bhopal-Pune flight from Mar 28Air India will soon start its Bhopal-Pune flight from March 28, which was earlier called off due to the pandemic last year. Currently, it will operate four days a week - Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday - and booking for the same has resumed. This flight will be a Delhi-Pune flight via Bhopal, which would facilitate travellers who earlier had the option of connecting flights. The Air India flight will save time for those willing to travel to Bhopal directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-flights-in-or-out-of-lohegaon-airport-between-april-26-and-may-9-might-affect-vaccine-dispatch-101612107804371.html

Representatives of seven villages have constituted an anti-airport coordination committee to continue planned and organised opposition against the international airport on their lands. The members of the coordination committee have begun meeting various political leaders to gather support for their cause. The land owners have also decided meet legal experts to explore the option of approaching the courts. Representatives from the coordination committee on Friday met Supriya Sule, member of Parliament from Baramati constituency, to request the cancelling of the new proposed site for the airport. When contacted, Sule said, she cannot comment at the moment. Landowners from Rajouri, Naygaon, Pandeshwar, Rise, Pise, Rajuri, and Pimpri in Purandar taluka held a meeting on January 26 to discuss the strategy to oppose the airport project on their lands. Jagtap had attended the meeting and had tried to reassure the villagers that no land will be acquired without the consent of the villagers. “He said that we would see when the centre approves the new site. There is no talk of withdrawal of the proposal. We want to be ready for what comes next,” said Santosh Kolte, a resident of Rajouri village and a member of the coordination committee. “In his speech Sanjay Jagtap mostly spoke about how the airport will be beneficial for the villages. He said the lands will not be taken without our consent, but we are not satisfied with what he said. So through the coordination committee we are meeting political leaders to make them aware of our cause and also legal experts to be prepared for the fight in court,” said Kiran Salunkhe, a resident of Pimpri. Despite repeated attempts, the Maharashtra Airport Development Company and district administration did not respond to questions on the future of the project in light of the opposition from villagers to the newly proposed site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/purandar-farmers-start-meeting-politicos-to-explain-opposition-to-new-airport-site-101612105044187.html
31-01-2021||Other||Pune educational sector has a close eye on budget allocations||PUNE The Union budget for the year 2021-22 will be announced on Monday, February 1. In earlier budgets, 2020 and 2019, fund allocations found its way to various institutions in the city, largely for research works. The recipients have been the several city-based national institutions, like the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER). In the 2020 union budget, ₹8,000 crore was allocated to a national mission on quantum technologies and applications (QTA) for a period of five years. However, in the last one year, largely due the Covid-19 pandemic, this project has not moved forward and currently is with the centre’s Department of Science and Technology (DST). According to a source in the DST, on condition of anonymity, “The project is nearly ready for its implementation. In the last one year due to the Covid-19 pandemic the process was a bit delayed. Now the detailed project report is ready. The five-year plan of expenditure is worked on and will be sent to the cabinet for approval.”This QTA mission is one of India’s biggest projects in the field of science and technology. It will develop quantum computers, quantum encryption, make communications more secure and also enable new associated technologies to come to the country. When contacted, C-DAC director general Hemant Darbari refused to comment on budget allocations – received and expected. “We hope, this year, the budget allocation will be much higher due to the roll out of the national education policy and the re-vamp of the whole education sector. The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) is the only public university which gets its funding from the state government. The other higher education institutions in Pune are all self-financed,” said Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor, Symbiosis International (deemed university) and principal, Symbiosis. Real estate mattersTalking about expectations from this year’s union budget, Suhas Merchant, president of Credai Pune said, “Amendment to section 80IBA is needed to revise the affordable housing definition to allow upto 90 sqm in metros and 120 sqm elsewhere. Waving of the minimum alternate tax (MAT) an give extension of the time limit to March 31, 2023 is needed. Also, amendment to Section 80C, to increase the limit for repayment of a housing loan principal amount, or alternatively, introducing another section for deduction with respect to principal repayment is needed.”Adding to a long list of real estate expectations, Merchant said, “Changes needs to be done in Section 24 (B) for increasing interest deduction for home buyers. Increase of the safe harbour limit by 20 per cent under section 43 CA may be extended till the effect of the pandemic on the economy is withdrawn.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-educational-sector-has-a-close-eye-on-budget-allocations-101612104384173.html
31-01-2021||Patna||Passport applicants in Bihar drop by half as Covid-19 hits movement abroad||While there were fewer people seeking mobility using rails and roads during Covid-19 period and subsequent lockdowns, those aspiring to migrate outside the country from Bihar also felt the impact of the pandemic. This is reflected in fewer numbers of passports applicants issued from the Regional Passport Office (RPO) in Patna, as compared to last year.The numbers also point towards the reluctance in people of Bihar to migrate outside the country during the pandemic. The applications from Gopalganj and Siwan, which account for the maximum number of people migrating from Bihar to Gulf countries for work, fell drastically during the Covid period.According to the figures procured from the RPO, Patna, three districts — Patna, Gopalganj and Siwan — that topped the chart with respect to the number of applications among the 39 districts for the past few years, witnessed almost half the number of passport seekers. The RPO figures have counted Bagaha and Bettiah in West Champaran as two separate districts, taking the count to 39, though the administrative districts are 38.“While the highest number of applicants, 20,448, was from Siwan district, 19,423 applications were received from Patna, while 16,831 from Gopalganj,” said regional passport officer, PM Sahai.Also read: Budget 2021 - What can the railway sector expect?He said while 19,536 passports were issued from Patna district, 19,057 from Siwan and third highest of 15,716 from Gopalganj. The total number of passports issued in 2020 was 1,67,722.The least number of passports (460) was issued from Sheikhpura, followed by 559 in Sheohar and 588 in Lakhisarai. While there were passport seekers in March when the lockdown was imposed, in April, across Bihar, just one person had applied for the passport from Patna. However, from May people started applying for the passport. All through 2020, barring April, May and July, the number of applicants from January to December in Patna was in four digits. While in Siwan and Gopalganj, except April to August, the applicants were in four digits.An official in the RPO said the situation had normalised around the New Year and people were applying large numbers.According to Bihar Economic Survey 2019-20, “on an average, the number of passports issued from RPO, Patna, is more than 3 lakh per year,” indicating that during 2020, about half the numbers were applied by the applicants and issued by the RPO.The survey further stated that during 2018-19, the highest number of passports (41,700) were issued from Siwan, followed by 34,200 from Gopalganj and 34,000 from Patna.The survey indicated that Bihar accounted for 15 per cent of emigration clearance, which is second highest after Andhra Pradesh (31 per cent) from 2011-16, adding that another indicator of international migration is the number of passport application received and issued by the RPO.“The highest number of applications for the passport (3,48,300) was received in 2018-19, while the highest number of passports (3,57,600) were issued in 2015-16, followed by 2017-18 (3,39,100),” said the survey.Labour resource minister Jibesh Kumar could not be contacted despite several attempts, he was busy attending BJP’s training camp at Madhubani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/passport-applicants-in-bihar-drop-by-half-as-covid-19-hits-movement-abroad-101612100856823.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||DU set to reopen: Students get ready for a ‘safe welcome’||It’s finally time to believe the good news that Delhi University students had been eagerly waiting for! DU colleges have conducted mock drills to make students comfortable, and get into the groove of reopening the campus — on February 1 — albeit in a regulated and phased manner. As part of phase one of reopening, only final year students with lab work have been allowed to enter the college premises. “During the recently conducted mock drill at my college, it was so reassuring to see the arrangements that were made,” says Ashu Chaurasia, a final year student of Hindi (Hons) at PGDAV (Evening) College. She recently visited the college and library, and shares her first-hand experience: “There was thermal checking before we entered the college, and sanitisers were placed everywhere in the college premises. Social distancing was maintained among the students, at least till the time I saw. But the best feel was to be back in the college and see a few of our teachers in front of us and not virtually! My friends and I exchanged pleasantries, while maintaining distance, with even the guard bhaiya, librarian and other familiar faces on college campus. The good part is that every student present was masked up, and that made me confident about going back to attending college in offline mode!”Students of other colleges, which are yet to announce the dates of their reopening or even mock drill, are battling #FOMO as they hear from their friends about mock drills and become further restless to return to the campus. “It’ll be very exciting to work in the lab after a whole year, and that’s why I’m looking forward to my college’s mock drill,” says Akshay Panwar, a final year student of Chemistry (Hons) at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, adding, “Online classes are good in Covid times, but they can’t replace physical classes. It’ll be so good if I get to visit the lab once again, and will surely help us in academics. And finally we’ll get a chance to enjoy college life once again, for whatever time is left for us before we say our goodbyes to college. And there is no fear to be back on campus, but we should remember that corona has not gone completely so everything needs to be done under Covid-19 guidelines.” Carefully measuring the pros and cons of switching from online campus life to offline campus life, Pooja Santosh, a final year Chemistry (Hons) student at Hindu College, says, “I’m quite excited that labs will be reopening after almost a whole year! But there are a lot of safety issues with the same. I’m from Kerala, and it’s not going to be easy for me to reach Delhi and arrange an accommodation to stay for only a few months that are left for my graduation to complete. Moreover, due to pandemic, most hostels aren’t reopening. So I haven’t been able to decide yet how to choose an offline mode to attend college yet. And the truth is that campus is never going to be the same again. That is the saddest fact for final years students like me!” There’s also a worry that once all colleges reopen, Covid guidelines might not be adhered completely. A few PhD students at DU, who have been using labs for last couple of months, say following protocols is the responsibility of students. “PhD students have been going to the lab even before December, and all this while we have been following all the protocols including attending the lab in batches in order to maintain social distancing. Moreover, we always have our face masks on, and there are never more than three people in one lab at any given point. All students use sanitisers and take all necessary precautions as prescribed by the university. If we’ve had a successful run so far, everything will be smooth henceforth as well provided each one behaves responsibly,” says Hitesh Sehrawat, a PhD student of Department of Chemistry, DU.There are also students who feel mock drills were a perfectly safe excuse to meet classmates while following social distancing rules! “The mock drills that the colleges are arranging seem to give us a basic idea about how the labs will work keeping in mind social distancing and other precautions. I just hope it doesn’t get too humid wearing a mask in the Chemistry lab, although I must admit the idea of being back on campus is too exciting to think about any of that! It’ll be great to catch up with a few of my classmates after such a long time. All of last year just zoomed past so I feel it’s better to have something than nothing,” says Amrutha Devan, a second year student of Physics (Hons) from Hindu College.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-set-to-reopen-students-get-ready-for-a-safe-welcome-101612099122548.html

31-01-2021||Dehradun||Senior Cong leaders push for Harish Rawat's name for CM, infighting intensifies||Weeks after Congress national general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat urged the party's central leadership to declare the chief ministerial candidate for the upcoming state assembly elections in 2022, the issue has intensified with some senior party leaders pushing for his name for the top post.The debate on declaring the CM face of the party for the upcoming assembly elections started after Rawat, a few weeks ago, asked the central leadership to do so to "bring clarity and end confusion among the party workers in the state."The state leadership, including state unit head Pritam Singh and leader of Opposition Indira Hridayesh, who were clearly rattled by the move, tried to play it down in the public and said that the party would fight the elections under a "collective leadership." However, many senior party leaders who are believed to be from Rawat's camp, including Rajya Sabha member from Almora, Pradeep Tamta and senior MLA Govind Singh Kunjwal, have been pushing for his name for the CM face in an attempt to keep the issue burning.Kunjwal, a senior MLA from Jageshwar constituency in Almora, said, "The only candidate for the CM in Congress for 2022 is Harish Rawat as he is the widely accepted leader in the state with no other leader close to his public outreach."Also read: Why is India called the world’s pharmacy? Here are 160 million reasonsSimilarly, Rajya Sabha MP Tamta on Saturday, while speaking to some local media persons, too insisted on declaring Rawat as the CM candidate and said, "Rawat is the only national leader from Uttarakhand Congress. No other leader comes close to his stature in the state.""There is an anti-BJP sentiment in the public and to capitalise on that and defeat the BJP, it is important to declare the party's CM face for 2022," he said.With Rawat's name is being pushed by his close aides in the party, political experts say that as a very well-seasoned politician, Rawat is cleverly playing his cards before the elections.SMA Kazmi, who has been keeping an eye on the state politics for last two decades, said, "This whole game started about three months ago when party leaders and MLAs close to Rawat held a press conference in Haldwani declaring him as the only face for the CM post if the party wins 2022 elections.""Also, the ground reality is that he is the only leader in the party who has a statewide public outreach. He also knows that if the party wins, the only name that would come forward for the CM will be his. But he wants to make that clear well before the polls are held," said Kazmi.He also claimed that by pushing his name for the CM candidate, Rawat is trying to play two cards at once."First, by doing so he wants to steer the elections by himself which would give him an upper hand in giving tickets to the candidates of his choice. Secondly, he would be able to clear the tussle for the CM post if the party wins, saying, as the elections were fought under him, he would be the CM," he said.Also read: Budget 2021 - What can the railway sector expect?Another political expert and professor of police science in Garhwal Central University, MM Semwal, said, "Rawat is a very seasoned politician. He knows when and how to play his cards to maintain his upper hand in the party.""Despite losing the 2017 assembly elections and the 2019 general elections badly, his popularity in the state has not decreased. In fact, he has become more active in state politics and often holds various political events or keeps making statements to be in the limelight. This CM face tactic is also the same and he knows that he will be becoming the CM if the party wins," said Semwal.Party state in-charge Devendra Yadav couldn't be contacted despite several attempts.State unit head Pritam Singh, however, tried to play it down by saying that, "As the party's central leadership had said, the elections would be fought under a collective leadership to overthrow the BJP government in 2022."Leader of Opposition, Hridayesh, said, "Congress had never declared the CM candidate before the elections. It did once in 2017, in the case of Rawat, when the party lost badly and confined to just 11 seats."The state BJP leadership, however, took a jibe on the infighting in Congress.Bansidhar Bhagat, party state president, said, "The Congress is not able to put its house in order and dreaming of winning the elections which is just laughable. The public of the state has seen the works done under both PM Modi and CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and are happy with it.

Now, the corporation has set a target of ₹2,356 crore in property tax collection for 2021, with its total outstanding in arrears at ₹5,000 crore.Agsint the Covid-19 background, the PMC announced the tax amnesty scheme in December 2020. The PMC extended the scheme twice after that. The corporation also announced that it would provide a loan facility, from cooperative banks, to aid defaulters in paying the outstanding dues.However, so far, only one defaulter from Hadapsar availed of the loan facility and cleared his outstanding tax dues of ₹12 lakh.During the amnesty scheme, the PMC was expecting ₹700 crore tax from 2,43,814 defaulters. However, the PMC collected ₹487.92 crore from 1,49,771 property tax defaulters. This has been the third amnesty scheme last the 10 years. Vilas Kanade, joint municipal commissioner, property tax department, said, “In the amnesty scheme, the corporation visited 2,43,814 properties. The corporation sealed 458 properties, which have ₹37.63 crore in outstanding taxes. Given the Covid-19 scenario, we can say that we got satisfactory responses.”On Friday, the municipal commissioner tabled a draft budget-2021-22 of ₹7,650 crore, in which corporation has set a target of ₹2,356 crore for the property tax department.On the new property tax target Kanade said, “We are positive. We will use all the possible ways which have been mentioned in corporation law.”On the amnesty schemes, Qaneez Sukhrani, secretary, Nagrik Chetna Manch, said, “Currently, PMC charges for services it is not rendering which are in direct contravention of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Right to Life Article-21 of the Constitution of India. Services related to basic amenities such as distribution of water, scientific disposal of municipal waste, good quality roads, footpaths, cycle tracks, street lights for visibility, quality public transport, are plainly lacking. PMC should have to roll out amnesty and waiver of property tax in comparison to budget income target figures. One side, regular taxpayers are paying taxes to the PMC, other side, PMC is waiving taxes of defaulters. It should be stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-211-87-crore-waived-during-property-tax-amnesty-scheme-rs-1-370-crore-tax-collected-101612092443729.html
31-01-2021||Bhopal||MP plans to rent out vacant mandi space for subsidised retail shops for farmers||The Madhya Pradesh government plans to enlist the private sector to develop shopping complexes, medical clinics, petrol pumps, and fertilizer and seed centers in the government-run markets where farmers used to sell their produce, a senior official said.The Madhya Pradesh state agricultural marketing board suffered a dip in revenue to ₹132 crore in the three months ended December 2020 from ₹256 crore, earned in the same period the previous year, after the Centre, in September, passed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020, that allowed the sale of agricultural produce outside government-run mandis (markets).The mandis record highest revenue during harvest months of April to June and from October to December. There are 259 such mandis and 298 sub-mandis in Madhya Pradesh.“The tax on sale of produce in agriculture markets has been reduced and, according to the new farm law, farmers are free to sell their crop outside the government-run markets, so, there is no chance of revival of 259 mandis in the future,” said a board official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity .He said the state government planned to enlist private entities and offer them land in the markets to develop retail shopping complexes, petrol pumps, fertilizer and seed centers and so on. “Similarly, the government will give some area to NGOs (non-government organizations) to run medical clinics for farmers,” he said.Another official, who also requested anonymity, said the objective is to motivate farmers to keep coming to the mandis. “Services to farmers such as seed centres will be provided at subsidised rates through a smart card, to be issued to the farmers by the welfare and agriculture development department,” the second official said.On the proposal to allow petrol pumps inside mandis, the officials said it would be a viable option because most agricultural markets are either located on the highways or are close by and with licenses to new petrol pumps, they would help the government earn revenue.Reacting to the proposal, MP Mandi Board Association president BB Faujdar said: “The government is heading towards the privatisation of Mandis. This plan might be feasible for category A mandis, which are bigger in size, but what about small grain mandis which are running on government land on lease or on rent? This means the government will close small mandis in the state.”Farmers are not enthused by the plan. “It is a good thing that the government is thinking about revamping the mandis but this is foolish to assume that farmers will go to the mandis for shopping. Farmers have no problem in selling their crops in mandis, but it’s the traders who don’t want to come to the mandis to purchase crops. I don’t think this plan will work,” said Bhagwan Meena, a farmers’ leader from Sehore.Madhya Pradesh Congress committee spokesperson Ajay Singh Yadav said the government was trying to privatise the mandis.“This model is not to revive the mandis, but this is the first step towards their privatization. We will oppose this move,” said Yadav.Farmers’ welfare and agricultural development minister Kamal Patel said: “If farmers are getting benefit from the new farm law, we have made a plan of inviting businessmen to revive mandis in MP. We are renting space, not whole mandis. Retail shops will be opened in the mandis and farmers will get everything from a needle to a tractor at subsidized rates like the army men, who purchase things from the army canteens at much lower rates,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-plans-to-rent-out-vacant-mandi-space-for-subsidised-retail-shops-for-farmers-101612090853235.html
31-01-2021||Pune||YourSpace: Residents list out ways to control fuel price rise||The prices of petrol and diesel for January 29 in the city were 92.52 and 81.72 per litre respectively. The rise in fuel prices has started to spark discontent in the city. Here are the reactions of persons from various fields. They have also expressed their point of view on what should be done to control the prices. Politicians are mum over the issueAs a dealer we don’t have to face the burn if prices of petrol and diesel soar, but consumers have to think about it. They need to analyse how much they have been paying for fuel and the reasons behind it. Our observation is that no political party is willing to speak about it. For consumers, it is an essential commodity and they have to buy it at the present cost. There is no alternative. With about 70% businesses resuming under the Covid unlock process, the usage of fuel is going to increase, and so is the expenditure.Sagar RukariFocus on fuel alternativesThe prices of fuel have been fluctuating. The market rates will remain stable till transportation cost does not change. Rise in transportation rates will see charges of essential items going north. Presently, traders don’t have to bear the cost as it passes on to farmers and consumers. The present situation of overdependence on fuel should make us focus more on alternatives, such as CNG and e-vehicles. Rohan UrsalBring fuel under GST When crude oil prices were low a few years back, the government did not pass on the relief to consumers. Instead, they hiked excise duty. Now the excise duty is about ₹32 per litre and the state government is 24% VAT. Many transporters are running business by sustaining losses. It has been our long- standing demand that the government should bring petrol and diesel under GST. By doing this, there will be regularised prices of these commodities and a uniform rate throughout the nation. The authorities should take immediate steps to provide GST cover to fuel.Baba Shinde Transporters have to bear lossesBecause of the price rise of petrol and diesel, goods transporters have to sustain losses. Tempo and truck transporters are facing financial burden. Central government should bring petrol and diesel under GST. It is a good solution for such price fluctuations.Ram KadamGovernment should waive off taxesWe are facing a difficult situation in terms of business. We can’t dare to increase fares out of fear of losing customers. The rise in diesel prices is hurting business which has slowly started to stabilise after the lockdown. We do not have any idea to which level these prices will reach. Union and state governments should waive off taxes to provide relief to operators and consumers. It will become difficult for bus and car operators to pay loans to banks if the situation continues. Either banks should give relief or governments should waive off taxes.Prasanna Patwardhan India collects huge tax on fuelIn 2013, excise duty on petrol was ₹9. Now, it is ₹32.98 per litre on petrol and ₹31.83 for diesel. In May 2020, the Centre increased these charges almost by ₹13 per litre. The state government collects 24% tax on diesel and 26% on petrol. The state is also collecting cess under various heads. If the central and state governments really want to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel, they should bring these products under GST. Yet, no effort is made by both governments to do that. After adding refinement charges, freight cost and dealer commission, ideally the price of petrol and diesel should be around ₹36-39 per litre. Why then are we paying so much? Remaining are all taxes imposed by the Union and state governments. In India, we have the highest taxation of 69% on petrol and diesel. Vivek Velankar Fuel price rise affects everythingProfit margin has reduced because of the rise in petrol and diesel prices. I cannot increase rates as it will have an adverse effect on number of customers. After lockdown my business had just begun to normalise, but price hike is making it difficult to break even. The price of petrol and diesel affects everything. If fuel costs continue to rise, eventually prices of everything will increase. How the common people are supposed to survive? We are already facing financial issues because of the lockdown. Government should take necessary steps to control fuel prices.Deepak KhamkarState government should provide tax reliefWe have started to face the burns of the fuel price hike. Transport and manufacturing costs have increased by about 10%. As a trader, I cannot increase prices of goods as it will disappoint customers. So, we are bearing the additional cost from our profit margins. We are currently on wait and watch situation. If fuel prices continue to soar, then we will have no option but to increase prices. As the Centre levies uniform excise duty across states, the state government should give tax relief.

31-01-2021||Pune||Jayant Narlikar: The art of intertwining science into the literature||Around 30 years ago, Dr Jayant Narlikar wrote a science fiction story Athenscha Plague (The plague in Athens) to which many have related now in the ongoing pandemic era. The story included in his book ‘Antaralatale Bhasmasur’ (Demons in the Space) highlighted the threat of a deadly virus posing an existential crisis before the human race. The virus, as the story explains, originated from an asteroid and wreaked havoc in Athens in ancient times. In another novel ‘Vaman Parat Na Aala’ (Vaman did not return) Narlikar has tried to portray the aftermaths of the rise of a super-intelligent robot. As the world tends to rely more upon artificial intelligence, this fictional story by Narlikar in the ‘80s shows how he always thought ahead of time. Many say the selection of Narlikar as president of the 94th Marathi Sahitya Sammelan (All India Marathi literary meet) to be held in Nashik from 26th to 28th March was an idea whose time had come. “We are living in the Covid-19 era and it is the need of the hour to have a scientific approach. Dr Narlikar has propagated scientific temper and made science writing popular amongst readers through simple but accurate science writing,” said Milind Joshi chief secretary, Maharashtra Sahitya Parishad, Pune. “This is why we proposed his name as the president of the literary meet. He is the first science writer who will be presiding over the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, his selection was unopposed,” Joshi added. Narlikar, a well-known astrophysicist and emeritus professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Iucaa) has received many national and international awards and honorary doctorates. Narlikar is internationally known for his work in cosmology, for championing models alternative to the popularly believed big bang model. Apart from his scientific research, Narlikar has been well-known as a science communicator through his books, articles, and radio/TV programmes. He is also known for his science fiction stories in Marathi. In 2014, the Sahitya Akademi, the premier literary body in India selected his autobiography ‘Chaar Nagaratle Majhe Vishwa’ for its highest prize in regional language (Marathi) writing. Narlikar has written exponentially in Marathi. “I want to spread different forms of science through various tools, and literature is an important one,” said Dr Narlikar when he was announced as the president. Pune based publishing house Rajhans publication has published most of his science literary work and is planning to publish few more science fiction books before the meet. Sadanand Borse, editor, Rajhans publication credited Dr Narlikar in making science literature popular. “It wasn’t the case that there were no science fiction writers before him but through his simple yet engaging writing style, he built the foundation of this literature. Even his nonfiction books like Akashashi Jadale Nate, Ganit ani Vidyan are in a unique style. In the literary meet we will have a special stall for his books only,” said Borse. Srushtividynayn Gatha, Akashashi Jadale Nate, Ganit Aani Vidnayn – Yugayuganchi Jugalbandi are some of the famous science books authored by Narlikar. Preshit, Vaman Parat na Ala, Antaralatil Sfot, Virus, Abhyaranya are his popular science fiction novels. “He has introduced advanced technology through writing and most importantly a humanitarian approach. On the international level, he has promoted the disarmaments of the nation. His vision about advancement in science and technology is clear and it reflects through his writings. I grew up reading his books and articles and it has shaped my point of view. I remember I had just cleared the 12th exam and written to him in Iucaa about a meteor shower and he sent me a written reply. I was really thrilled as a boy,” said Raj Kulkarni, poet, and writer. “Aakashashi Jadale Nate” is one of his important books. Through this book, he emphasized on astronomy rather than astrology. He has tried to give scientific vision through his writings. He has questioned the traditional beliefs and pride in our society. He has done an ideal job as a scientist that is to raise questions and to take follow-up of those questions. Apart from his writing, his work in IUCAA is important. He has built a fine institution and has reached lakhs of students through the organisation,” said Atul Deulgaonkar, journalist and writer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jayant-narlikar-the-art-of-intertwining-science-into-the-literature-101612089623662.html
31-01-2021||Pune||Parents’ association: Education department “wilfully” siding with private schools||The parents’ association of Pune has alleged that the education minister and the Maharashtra education department are intentionally safeguarding the interest of private schools under the ambit of judicial processes. In a press conference held on Saturday, the association has demanded that private schools overcharging fees and denying online education should have strict consequences. Imran Khan, secretary of the parents’ association of Pune said the stay granted by the high court is against the government resolution. “The HC decision of no coercive steps is not directed to schools who are inflicting punishments of harassment and expulsion of students for the fees which is mentioned in the GR of the education department dated November 26. In most of the cases it has been confirmed by the reports of the education department itself that the schools have violated the existing norms from the previous academic years of procedure and the department is falsely and wilfully helping them by misinterpreting the HC’s stay order,” said Khan. In another notification by the education department, a crucial part was omitted which stated that action will be taken against schools, which are overcharging fees and pressuring parents to pay the fee. “That is why we feel that the education department has been misleading and misinforming parents and working for the interest of private schools,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-association-education-department-wilfully-siding-with-private-schools-101612089566600.html

31-01-2021||Pune||Govt trying to defame farmers’ movement: Arundhati Roy||Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy said on Saturday that the central government was trying to defame the farmers’ protests in the national capital and demanded that the three farm laws passed by the government be withdrawn with immediate effect. Roy was addressing a gathering of 500 persons at the second edition of Elgar Parishad conclave held at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch. The conclave was organised by Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella organisation of 250 Dalit organisations. “Lakhs of farmers are suffering due to the unjust laws and it has been their demand that the three new laws be withdrawn by the government immediately. The farmers have been peacefully protesting for the past two months, but concerted efforts are being taken by the Centre to defame their agitation,” she said. Roy said, “Though Peshwai has gone, Brahmanwad (privileged section of society controlling all resources) still exists and the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruling the country with the Vaishyas (business class) is a part of that strategy. In the coming days, this structure has to be replaced with a democracy where all communities have to be brought on one platform. Fissiparous tendencies are trying to divide the society into casteist lines, and we need to overcome such assaults by unifying all the castes under one umbrella,” she said. Taking a dig at the Centre, Roy said “At a time when the country is going through a crisis during Covid-19 where lakhs of jobs have been lost a few industrialists like Adani and Ambani have become filthy rich at the expense of the central government. The industrialists and the media are functioning according to the directions of PM Modi and nobody dares to speak against the prime minister. On the other hand, PM himself has not gone before the media during the last seven years.” Condemning the action against intellectuals in Bhima Koregaon case, she said, “Today, one has to be careful about every comma and word you speak or write as police cases are lodged at the slightest of pretext.” According to Roy, the corporate media has defamed Elgar Parishad as a hidden hub of terrorists, jihadists and urban Naxals. “Bhima Koregaon is a prime example of colonialism still in progress. Peshwai has gone but Brahmanwad is still there. The Dalit Bahujan political set up faces an existential challenge like never before. Currently, the corporate and political elite control over India is strengthening its hold in the name of Hindu Rashtra. Holding Elgar is the need of the hour for the fight against capitalism, casteist patriarchy,” she said. Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan said, “The central government which is trying to become fascist is bewakoof (foolish) as it is branding dissenting intellectuals as urban Naxals, addressing JNU students as “Tukde Tukde” gang, Sikhs as Khalistanis and Muslim as jihadis. It is branding them in its narrative in the same vein. Today we have not become citizens. We are still a praja and afraid of the king. We should reject Chanakyan brand of politics. The situation in India today is that the executive is not afraid of the judiciary anymore. No government wants to give its power to the people. They have made citizens as praja and in turn beneficiaries of the government.” He cautioned the activists and said, “We started with Islamic terrorism and later every Muslim became a suspect as a terrorist in the public eye. Similarly, the fight against Brahmanwad must not turn into hatred against Brahmins.” Amongst the others who addressed the gathering were Dr Payal Tadvi’s mother Parveen, journalist Prashant Kanojia, student leader Sharjeel Usmani, former IG SM Mushrif, former high court judge BG Kolse Patil and activist Bunt Singh. The event saw revolutionary songs performed by Samta Kala Manch and other Ambedkarite organisations. Elgar Parishad was held for the first time to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima Koregaon of 1818. The very next day, violent clashes took place in Bhima Koregaon village which is located 35 km from Pune city. According to the Dalit narrative, the 1818 battle is the victory over casteism as the British army comprising a large contingent of Dalit Mahar soldiers defeated the forces of Peshwas at Bhima Koregaon. Later, “Vijaystambh”, an obelisk structure, was erected by the British at Perne village as a memorial for soldiers killed in the Bhima Koregaon battle on January 1, 1818. The violence during the bi-centenary celebrations of Koregaon Bhima battle, on January 1, 2018, claimed two lives and left several injured when lakhs of Ambedkarites had gathered to pay their tributes in memory of the soldiers who died during the battle. On January 2, 2018, Anita Sawale, a Dalit political worker lodged an FIR against Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote at Pimpri police station accusing them of instigating violence at Koregaon Bhima. The case was later transferred to Shikrapur police station which comes under the jurisdiction of Pune rural police. Bhide was not arrested by the police for lack of evidence while Ekbote was arrested on March 14 after his anticipatory bail was rejected by the Supreme Court. He was later released on April 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/govt-trying-to-defame-farmers-movement-arundhati-roy-101612089504219.html

31-01-2021||Delhi||DU’s young guns give gift of knowledge to the needy||Walking through a maze of written word and sniffing the smell of old paper is an experience that one can only get in a library! To ensure no one misses out on this, a group of Delhi University (DU) students are striving to set up libraries for the underprivileged, across the city. Along with the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Library Committee, these youngsters have been raising funds for the project for a few years. “The first few libraries were set in two slum clusters of Delhi, namely Baljeet Nagar and Sangam Park in 2005-06. Both the localities have a majority of migrant workers, who are unable to provide their children with a space that’s peaceful and conducive to study,” says Harish Kumar, a student of DU’s Faculty of Law. What motivated the youngsters to take up this heart-warming gesture is the presence of “youth in these areas” and the consciousness that “they, too, deserve a chance at education”. Sarvesh Rai, a student of BA (Prog) at School of Open Learning, DU, says, “These libraries were established to provide an alternative environment to the youth in particular, and people in general... Through these libraries, we’re also promoting the ideals of forgotten heroes of our freedom movement as well as progressive understanding of social issues such as inequality and female oppression. The idea is to not only to make a library for visitors to be able to read books, but to enrich their lives by exposing them to literature and the wonderful history of our nation!” Students from Ambedkar University Delhi, and Jamia Millia Islamia have also contributed for this initiative. “The success and support we’ve received has motivated us to expand in other areas of Delhi such as Badarpur, Jahangirpuri, and Okhla Industrial Area, jahan aisi libraries ki sakht zarurat hai,” says Prithvi Raj, a student of MA (Hons) Hindi, adding, “Hum toh in fact chahte hain ki puri Delhi me aisi libraries khulein. But hope we get people to contribute generously for this cause.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-young-guns-give-gift-of-knowledge-to-the-needy-101612086930745.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 effect! Hindu College to miss Damdami Mai puja?||The most famous tree in Delhi University aka Virgin Tree at Hindu College is the site for the annual Damdami Mai puja every Valentine’s Day (February 14). Students from the boys’ hostels on campus flock around it, believing the popular myth that worshipping the tree on V-Day will help them fall in love within six months and lose their virginity in one year. Some students raised objections to this “misogynistic” practice, and even tried to halt it. But what the protestors couldn’t do, apparently Covid-19 has done! Since DU hasn’t reopened completely and the hostel at Hindu College remains closed the event, which is organised by the boys’ hostel core committee, is likely to get skipped this year. “Since the hostel is closed, elections to the hostel core committee positions could not be held. And without a committee, organising an event on campus seems impossible, especially when the college isn’t opening for everyone at the moment. Plus, it’ll be hard for the outstation hostellers to return and organise the event,” says Ajay Deswal, a B Com (Hons) student at Hindu College. Many are dejected at just the thought of missing out on this much awaited ritual. “Hindu College is known for this puja! There have been many concerns raised about the event being misogynistic and the objectification attached to this tradition has also been a heated topic of discussion. Last year, a poster of actors Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh was put up and worshipped as Damdami Mai and Love Guru, after much chaos. As a hosteller, it’s fun to see all these preparations when on campus,” says Iba, a second-year student at Hindu College. Even freshers were pumped to attend this tradition as part of the annual Valentine’s Day celebrations on campus. “February is the most happening month for DU students. There is so much our seniors have told us about Damdami Mai-Love Guru puja, and how couples propose in Valentine’s week. I was looking forward to experiencing it myself; a more inclusive version of it. Par kismat mein hi nahi hai shayad... I really hope the seniors come up with a digital alternative to celebrate the event,” says a first-year student on condition of anonymity. Away from the controversy associated with this tradition, the final year students were looking forward to mark their last V-day celebrations on campus. “When we had joined, humne kaafi kuchh suna tha about this puja and aarti that happens. People say you will get a girlfriend within months, or will lose your virginity! But all this doesn’t matter. It’s more about simply keeping with our legacy, albeit modified. I unfortunately missed the previous year celebrations, and was hoping to see them in person at least this one time. Plus, I’m in Vivre (film and photography society) so I could have taken some photos just for memory. But that doesn’t seem possible now,” says Dhruv Barak, a student of Philosophy (Hons) at the college.But some students feel that the celebrations might still happen, except on a smaller scale. “You never know, some hostellers might still try to assemble in small numbers to celebrate it, in order to not break the tradition...,” says Pooja Santosh, a second-year student of the college.

Not only the BJP, PM Modi's credibility has been dented due to lies over farm laws," Sisodia said while addressing a press conference.The press conference was about a video showing Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal speaking in favour of the farm laws. The video, which was posted by the BJP, was doctored, claimed Sisodia."Yesterday BJP and its spokesperson posted a doctored video of Arvind Kejriwal ji stating benefits of farm laws. I was furious over it but also felt sad for BJP that it had to post distorted video clip of Arvind ji to establish credibility of the laws," Sisodia added.He said that not only the BJP, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's credibility has been dented due to lies over the farm laws.The video of Kejriwal’s interview with a news channel on farm laws has been widely shared on social media.In the video, Kejriwal can be heard saying that this is the best reform in agriculture in the last 70 years, which will give the farmers the best price for their produce as they will be able to sell their crops anywhere.Kejriwal can also be heard saying that farmers will not lose their land, MSP or their mandis (marketplace).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jan-26-violence-was-conspiracy-by-bjp-tricolour-was-insulted-that-day-sisodia-101612075421106.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi records maximum cold wave days in January in 13 years: IMD||Delhi recorded seven "cold wave" days in January, the maximum in the month since 2008, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to four degrees Celsius. A severe cold wave is when the minimum temperature is two degrees Celsius or less."The number of cold wave days in January this year was the maximum since 2008, when 12 such days were recorded," Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre here, said.Only one "cold wave" day each was recorded in 2020 and 2019.The city had recorded six "cold wave" days in January 2013.Srivastava said only one western disturbance affected the plains of northwest India this January, leading to more cloudless nights and therefore, more "cold wave" days.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, warming the ground. The minimum temperature falls in the absence of a cloud cover.A cold wave swept the national capital on Sunday morning, with the minimum temperature dipping to 3.1 degrees Celsius. This is the fourth "cold wave" day in Delhi in a week.The minimum temperature settled at 2.1 degrees Celsius and 3.8 degrees Celsius in the national capital on Tuesday and Thursday respectively due to the cold and dry northwesterly winds barreling through the plains, the IMD said.Cold wave conditions prevailed in Delhi on Friday too with the minimum temperature settling at four degrees Celsius, five notches below normal. On New Year's Day, the city had recorded a minimum temperature of 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest for the month in 15 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-maximum-cold-wave-days-in-january-in-13-years-imd-101612075233238.html
31-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farm union leaders backtracked under pressure of radicals: Central minister||Faced with one of the most tenacious farmers’ agitations in decades, the Narendra Modi government is not inclined to repeal the contentious agri reform laws at the centre of raging protests that have lately spilled beyond Punjab and Haryana to the Jatland of Uttar Pradesh. This intent was underlined on Saturday by Union minister of state for commerce Som Parkash, the sole representative of Punjab in the central cabinet who was part of three-member ministerial team that held 11 rounds of negotiations with farmers in the past two months without any breakthrough. In an exclusive interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak, the first-time Hoshiarpur MP spoke about the government’s approach to stem the farmers’ ire and blunt the opposition’s attack, and the political repercussion of the agitation for the BJP in Punjab and beyond. Excerpts: After the breakdown of their negotiations with the Centre, farmer unions remain unrelenting in their protests against the three farm laws. What is the way forward on the logjam? At the eleventh and last rounds of talks, the Centre offered to suspend the laws for one-and-a-half years and constitute a committee with representatives of farmers to deliberate on the laws before their implementation. That is the best offer the government could make. These laws were enacted because it is in the interest of farmers and best for them. But the message that the farm unions conveyed was that these are against the farmers. Unfortunately, they succeeded in that and it became a movement. Their propaganda is that the farmers’ land will be snatched by corporates. The laws have nothing like that. It is all for the farmers’ welfare by opening additional mandis and modernising cultivation techniques. The government agreed to amend the provisions about which the unions voiced their concerns. Also, the bills on electricity and pollution were taken off. All this was put on the table after talks with them (unions). In the meetings, they agreed to certain proposals and promised to revert the next day. But when they went back, they came under pressure from people with radical views. They scared the union leaders and forced them to backtrack and demand the repeal of laws. They (radical elements) are now being identified. Short of repeal and other than putting the laws on hold, what are the other options before the government? What can be a better option when the government has offered to suspend the laws itself for 18 months? But the unions want nothing but repeal? They should not be so obstinate. They will have to find a way out of what has been offered in the last round of negotiations and come forward to talk to the government. If they are sticking to this (demand for repeal), they may have a different agenda on their mind. What is that agenda? They can tell that. I don’t know. We are willing to amend and suspend, what else do they want? So, you are ruling out the repeal? This is what was conveyed in the last talks by agriculture minister (Narendra) Tomar sahib. Why are we stuck on the repeal? Whatever is there in it (laws) against the kisan, we are ready to change that. Demanding this (repeal) is rubbish. This law is for the entire country, and not only some farmers of two or three states. If someone gets violent or gathers crowds by telling lies, how can the government yield to such antics and repeal Acts passed by an elected Parliament? There are a lot of people who appreciate these laws. But now that protests are swelling beyond Punjab and Haryana, is the Centre open to reconsidering its position and calling farmer leaders for talks? Only the agriculture minister can tell that. But it was made clear to the unions in the last round of talks that this (suspension of laws) is the maximum we can give… nothing beyond that. That was the best the Centre could offer. They should have responded to it. Almost the entire opposition has rallied behind the unions’ demand for repeal. It was a considered opinion of the government that we are ready to amend or delete any clause/provision in the farm laws that is seen against the interest of farmers. But why are they insisting for repeal of entire laws? These were enacted in keeping with interests of the whole country, not Punjab and Haryana alone. The opposition (to the laws) is in these two states, not in the whole country. Why can’t these laws be repealed? Then we should shut down Parliament and ask farmers, with raising of hands, what to do and what not to do. It is a prerogative of Parliament. Nobody can dictate. Whatever is against the interest of farmers in the Act, we are ready to delete that. But they are interested in repeal of the Act. This is not just for Punjab and Haryana farmers; it is for entire country. It is in the interest of the other farmers. Is there is a likelihood of talks again? Right now, talks are deadlocked. If the unions come forward with any proposal based on our last offer, the government can discuss that. Political parties which have been supporting these reforms want to derive political benefit out of this situation. Several union leaders have been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) after the Republic Day violence. Hasn’t that complicated the way to any future talks? The storming of Red Fort by unruly farmers has been roundly condemned by all. Farm unions violated their pact with Delhi Police. Ultimately, they will have to see what is right and what is wrong. We can’t compromise with the country’s interests and that of the state. They have to understand their responsibility. Agitation doesn’t mean gathering crowds by raising emotional slogans and falsehoods. Handling them is also their responsibility. The union leaders brought lakhs of tractors to Delhi and created chaos. They should have taken the moral responsibility for whatever happened and suspended their agitation. Itna bada gunah kiya hai unho ne (They have committed a big crime). In Punjab, there is a groundswell of support for the farmers’ agitation. Since you represent the state in the Union cabinet, what role do you see for yourself to resolve the issue?I have been espousing Punjab’s interests in the Centre. The package the government offered was the result of a lot of discussions and requests. The farmers’ sentiments are on the top of my mind. The opposition has closed its ranks in mounting pressure on the government to repeal the laws. All these parties were votaries of these farm reforms in the past. They were part of the Congress manifesto. Manmohan Singh, as Prime Minister of the UPA government, had supported these reforms in Parliament. The Shiromani Akali Dal spoke in favour of the reforms for two or three months after our government brought an ordinance last year. Even Parkash Singh Badal publicly endorsed it. Where are the moral values of these political parties? BJP leaders in Punjab are facing an intense and sustained backlash from farmers. Has that hurt the party politically? In politics, there are gheraoes and protests. That doesn’t mean we stop doing the right things. Our party will reach out to people and share its views. Everything can’t be linked with votes. Vote dalenge ya nahin… party ka ya hoga….We have to see the interest of farmers, the country and the state. There are dogged protests even in your home turf of Hoshiarpur. Hoten hain protest. Kya kar sakte hain. I can only place my views before the government and people. Aur kya kar sakte hain (What else can I do?). There are apprehensions that the protests may spiral into a law and order problem. What is your sense of what lies ahead? A lot of people are trying to vitiate the atmosphere. Some are projecting it as a Sikh versus Hindu issue, others as a Delhi versus Punjab face-off. That is unfortunate. The governments are worried whenever there is a serious agitation. That is why we are offering to amend and suspend the laws despite there being no flaws in it. What worries you about the agitation? My worry is that this will impede Punjab’s development. No outside corporate will come and invest in the state if you boycott and raise a bogey against them. Is the Centre open to farmers’ demand for a legal guarantee for minimum support price? The MSP has been going on since 1965. It is 100% procurement in Punjab and Haryana. The PDS Act clearly says that the government shall procure at MSP. Then why do they want a legislation? There is no logic or rationale. The opposition parties allege that the Narendra Modi government is being arrogant and insensitive in dealing with the farmers’ demands? They are lying. These reforms have been the agenda of the Congress for 20 years. Listen to their speeches in Parliament and read their manifestoes. We held 11 long rounds of talks with the unions. Is this arrogance? All their suggestions were considered for possible solutions. But, when they went back to the protest sites, they changed their mind because they are being dictated by other forces they are scared of. Now, they are disowning them. But, one of them is Deep Sidhu, who is said to be affiliated with the BJP? He may have been with the BJP at some point of time, but he was disowned many months ago by our Gurdaspur MP. The opposition alleges the Modi government’s complicity in the Republic Day violence to discredit the farmers’ stir.That is an irresponsible charge. Ask anyone lodged in jail for a criminal case, he will blame someone else for implicating him. What is your sense on the political fallout of the farmers’ agitation for the Modi government? The BJP is the world’s largest party and knows how to manage things. When following the right path, we need not bother whether this will get us less votes or more votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-union-leaders-backtracked-under-pressure-of-radicals-central-minister-101612074083786.html

They also vandalised property and even entered the Red Fort, where they hoisted their flags.Over 25 FIRs have been registered in connection with the January 26 violence under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and sections of IPC dealing with sedition.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 last year against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-slams-centre-for-imposing-bjp-s-democrazy-101612069163078.html

The countrywide drive will be supported by about 24 lakh volunteers, 1.5 lakh supervisors and many Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), WHO, UNICEF, Rotary etc.,” the Union ministry of health and family welfare said in a statement.Healthcare workers will be visiting as many as two crore households across the nation to ensure that no child is left without the protection of the polio vaccine, the ministry said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan was also present at the event. Recalling how the vaccination plan came into force, he said. “The strategy of Pulse Polio Immunization Programme was conceived in December 1993 and it was rolled out from 2nd October, 1994 when the first child was immunized against Polio as part of this programme. Almost 12 lakh children were immunized in a single day at around 4000 centres. In 1995 seeing the visible impact of the Pulse Polio Programme in Delhi, this was replicated at the national level. A year later, several countries of South East Asia region of WHO emulated the strategy and implemented similar programs. Even in Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela launched ‘Kick Polio out of Africa’ campaign”“Before the start of the program, India had 60% caseload of Polio worldwide. With the last case of Polio reported in Howrah on 13th January, 2011, the country has been free of Polio for a decade now,” Vardhan added.The Union minister stressed on the need to ensure that all vaccines under the programme reach every last child of our country. “In order to close gaps that might have emerged during the Covid-19 pandemic, another phase of Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI 3.0) has been planned in 250 high risk districts of the country during February and March 2021. In addition to this, guidance for conduction of Sub-National Immunization days for polio and sensitive surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases during pandemic has also been issued to States,” he said.Uttar Pradesh chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will also start the polio immunisation campaign 2021 on Sunday from Lucknow's Dufferin hospital, according to an official statement. "Children up to 5 years of age will be administered the polio drops. Around 3.40 crore children will be administered polio drops across Uttar Pradesh tomorrow," according to the statement cited by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/target-to-administer-polio-drops-to-1-crore-and-11-lakh-children-mp-cm-101612067807436.html

31-01-2021||Delhi||‘Man tried to set fire to my office in Inderpuri’, says Raghav Chadha; cops start probe||Delhi legislator and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson Raghav Chadha on Saturday said that an unidentified person allegedly tried to set fire to his office in Inderpuri on the evening of January 26, an incident which he said was captured on CCTV cameras.The police said they have received a complaint into the matter, and have started an investigation.On December 24, a group of men had attacked the Jhandewalan office of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), of which Chadha is the vice-chairperson.The January 26 incident allegedly took place around 11.30pm. Chadha said the CCTV camera footage shows the person setting fire to the wall of his office building, pouring kerosene on it and then walking away.The AAP’s Rajendra Nagar MLA said that he had filed a police complaint.“The earlier brazen attack at Delhi Jal Board and more particularly the present incident of attempting to set ablaze his party office, begs a serious question that if the life, liberty and offices/property of legislators/ are attacked and threatened in this fashion and are put in constant fear harm then what would be the plight of a common man,” said Chadha in a statement.The statement also read, “There have been earlier instances wherein almost similar modus operandi was adopted by the assailants which raises a doubt whether there is any correlation with the present incident. Hence the present incident cannot be viewed in isolation, and this too appears to be a well-designed conspiracy of his political opponents to execute their political designs in order to obliterate him from discharging his public duties.Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west) said: “We have received a complaint and we are taking legal action. We are investigating the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-tried-to-set-fire-to-my-office-in-inderpuri-says-raghav-chadha-101612052861767.html

31-01-2021||Delhi||Leopard sighting triggers panic in Delhi locality, wildlife teams rush in||Delhi’s forest department has issued an alert after a CCTV camera captured a leopard in outer Delhi’s Najafgarh on January 27, officials said on Saturday.Deputy conservator of forests (north division) Navneet Srivastava said that after first being spotted on January 27, the leopard was again seen on January 28 and January 29 near the Najafgarh drain.Kamal Preet, Delhi’s chief wildlife warden, confirmed that the leopard was spotted on a CCTV camera. “Teams from the west and the north division are jointly handling the operation. We also have former wildlife inspectors, who have been appointed as consultants, who are also helping the teams from the headquarters. Coordinated efforts are being made to capture the animal at the earliest,” she said.Uncontrolled urbanisation near forest areas is intensifying conflict between humans and animals.Srivastava said: “The last spotting was on January 29 near the Najafgarh drain. This means that the animal has moved away from the main Najafgarh city. We have issued alerts around Ghummanhera and Jharod Kalan and other nearby villages asking people not to step out after dark and also to keep their pets inside.”He said that cages have been placed and round-the-clock patrolling is being conducted by the forest department teams to capture the animal. “Once the animal has been captured, we will discuss the possibility of moving it either to the Delhi Zoo or to the Asola Wildlife Sanctuary. In case we don’t have space or facility to move the leopard within the city, we will look at options in other cities. However, that decision will need to be taken by higher authorities,” Srivastava said.Delhi cabinet minister and Najafgarh legislator Kailash Gahlot wrote a letter to the forest department, urging teams to ensure the quick capture of the animal for the safety of the residents of the area.“On the matter of a leopard sighting at Najafgarh, the forest department officials have been asked to capture the animal as soon as possible. People are requested to not panic and alert the authorities if they spot the leopard. Leopard is a protected wildlife animal so residents are requested to refrain from attacking it,” Gahlot said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/leopard-sighting-triggers-panic-in-delhi-locality-wildlife-teams-rush-in-101612043164401.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Border internet cut, more arrests made||Authorities on Saturday arrested over 20 people in connection with the violence that broke out in the national capital during a farmers’ rally on Republic Day, while mobile internet services were suspended for two days at key border points near Delhi where thousands of protesters have been camping since November-end as a part of their ongoing movement against three agricultural laws.It was for the second time in a week that internet services were suspended at Singhu and Tikri borders connecting Delhi to Haryana and the Ghazipur border connecting Delhi to Uttar Pradesh. The fresh decision to snap the services between 11pm on January 29 and 11pm on January 31 came after the Delhi Police’s request to the Union home ministry.As investigation into the violent protests gathered pace, Delhi Police officials raided several locations in Punjab and identified a person suspected to have hoisted a farmers’ union flag and a religious flag at Red Fort on Tuesday, people aware of the developments said.Police say the farmers deviated from the routes agreed upon, entered parts of central and New Delhi areas, resorted to vandalism and attacked police personnel. At least 38 first information reports (FIRs) have been registered and 84 people arrested --- 22 of them on Saturday --- in connection with the violence.On Tuesday too, internet services were suspended, albeit temporarily, when violence broke out during a tractor rally by farmers who want the government to repeal the laws that they say will hurt their livelihood. At least 394 police personnel and 10 farmers were injured in the clashes that broke out in several places, including the historic Red Fort and the ITO intersection.This was also the third time that mobile internet services were suspended in Delhi in the past 14 months. On December 19, 2019, the government snapped the internet connections during protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, or CAA.Kultar Singh, a farmer at Tikri, said the government was attempting to “derail” the movement and “break” the farmers’ communication channels by suspending internet services. “Our brothers are coming to join us from parts of Haryana and Punjab. To ensure that we are not able to communicate with them, the government blocked internet services. But they will not succeed. This government is terrified. So they are resorting to these tactics,” Singh said.The move came in the backdrop of a group of people, who said they were local residents, entering the protest site at Singhu, triggering clashes with the demonstrators on Friday. On the same day, tension spiralled at Tikri after farmers and locals almost came to blows even as the number of protesters swelled in Ghazipur.Meanwhile, Delhi Police teams conducted raids across Punjab to arrest those involved in the Republic Day violence.A Delhi Police officer, who did not want to be named, said a police team was in Jalandhar to trace a man named Jugraj Singh. The officer identified Singh as the person who hoisted two flags at the Red Fort – a flag of a farmers’ union and a religious flag -- on Tuesday. “He is a farmer and also a school dropout. He is currently on the run. We have met his family and the local police there. He hasn’t returned home,” the officer said.Officials who requested anonymity said police teams were also conducting raids in Ludhiana, Moga and Tarn Taran.A second officer said police were also looking at those caught on tape during the protests. “We have taken the assistance of Punjab police while conducting raids and arresting such suspects,” the second official said. He added that the special cell (police’s anti-terror unit) was separately probing the role of prominent faces of the protest because they believe the violence was planned.“Our first task is to arrest those who indulged in violence on the road. The second will be to probe how the ring leaders had got them to indulge the violence on Republic Day. Look out circulars (LOC) have already been issued against farm leaders to ensure that they do not flee. The investigation has just started,” the second officer added.A forensic team also visited Red Fort to collect samples of the alleged damage to the Archaeological Survey of India-protected structure and evidence related to the protesters assaulting police personnel inside the monument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/border-internet-cut-more-arrests-made-101612042437803.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||No more institutional quarantine for UK returnees to Delhi||Passengers flying in to Delhi from the United Kingdom (UK) will no longer have to complete a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine if they test negative for Covid-19 on arrival, an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – the nodal body that decides on implementation of Covid-19 guidelines in the Capital — said.The seven-day institutional quarantine rule for UK fliers, even if they tested negative for Covid-19 on arrival, was introduced on January 8, when the Central government resumed flight operations between India and the UK after a temporary suspension since December 22 in the light of a new strain of Covid-19 which had emerged there.The new DDMA order, which was issued on Friday, cites “low positivity rate” among UK returnees as the reason for the relaxation. Fliers, however, will have to continue adhering to a seven-day home quarantine rule, government officials said.“As a matter of abundant precaution in view of the increased transmissibility of the new variant, DDMA orders dated January 8 and (another on) January 12 mandated compulsory institutional quarantine for a period of seven days, followed by seven days of home quarantine for those travellers who are found negative in RT-PCR test at airport,” said the DDMA order, which HT has seen.The order was signed by Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev, who also heads the executive committee of the DDMA. The DDMA is chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. Its vice-chairperson is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.The order further said, “The situation has now been reviewed and considering the low positivity rate of UK returnees it has been decided that the aforesaid additional measure of compulsory institutional quarantine of travellers tested negative may not be required furthermore… Strict surveillance (has) to be kept on persons who test negative in the airport and (are) kept in home quarantine.”Two senior DDMA officials, who did not wish to be identified, however, clarified that the seven-day home quarantine rule for those who tested negative on arrival would still continue and they will be monitored by district surveillance teams.Travellers who test Covid-19 positive on arriving from the UK are isolated in special wards set up at the government’s Lok Nayak hospital and four other private hospitals. Their contacts are further traced and isolated in similar wards on testing positive for Covid-19. Their swab samples (both UK returnees and their contacts who test positive) are sent for further examination to determine the strain of the virus with which they were infected.In Delhi, so far 13 Covid-19 patients were found infected with the UK strain. All of them had returned from the UK and none of them were cases of local transmission, said a senior official in the government’s health department.“Surveillance of people who have returned from the UK should be scaled up,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). He further said, “The UK variant is spreading fast across several countries. It is replacing the old variant. Initially, it was found to be more transmissible. Now, several research groups based in the UK have said that it is likely to cause more deaths too. Fortunately, vaccines have been found to be effective against it. But we cannot let our guards down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-more-institutional-quarantine-for-uk-returnees-to-delhi-101612041982047.html
31-01-2021||Other||Day after Mumbai woke up to season’s coldest morning, mercury rises||The temperatures in Mumbai soared on Saturday after almost a week of cold conditions.The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), which is indicative of the temperature in suburbs and Mumbai, recorded a minimum temperature of 16 degrees Celsius, which was 1.5 degrees below normal. On Friday, Mumbai recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 14.8 degrees Celsius.The Colaba weather station, which is indicative of the temperature in south Mumbai, recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, up from Friday’s 17.5 degree Celsius but 0.5 degrees Celsius below normal.KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), IMD, had anticipated rise in temperature after Friday. “Mumbai Santacruz recorded lowest min temperature of this season today morning from Dec 2020. No large change expected in next 24 hrs. Thereafter gradual rise (of temperature is expected),” he had tweeted on Friday.Meanwhile, the maximum temperatures, too, increased slightly on Saturday. At Santacruz, the maximum temperature was 32.9 degrees Celsius, 1.3 degrees above normal and up from Friday’s 30.5 degrees Celsius. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 31.4 degrees Celsius, which was 1.1 degrees above normal and up from Friday’s 29.5 degrees Celsius.On Saturday, the air quality improved marginally from Friday’s 290, but continued to remain in the poor category. An overall air quality index (AQI) — an air quality indicator— of 286 was measured.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.Of the 10 locations, Malad had the worst it quality with an AQI of 329, followed by Andheri with AQI of 323 and Mazagaon with an AQI of 311, all in the very poor category.“Air quality of Mumbai is in the poor category due to the presence of calm wind conditions prevailing in the city and the surrounding regions. Local pollution is not getting dispersed and leading to poor AQI in Mumbai. With current calm weather condition, local emission with continental pollution to keep the AQI from poor to very poor for Mumbai in the next two days,” according to a short range forecast by SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-mumbai-woke-up-to-season-s-coldest-morning-mercury-rises-101612038922407.html
31-01-2021||Other||Mumbai reported an average of 22 divorce petitions daily||The city reported an average of 22 divorce petitions a day over the past decade (2011-2020), data revealed. Last year, despite the family court at Bandra remaining closed for about six months owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, a daily average of 19 divorce petitions was recorded. According to the statistics compiled from the family court, in the year 2011, the total number of divorce petitions filed stood at 7,515. The figure has to an extent remained constant in the next nine years. In 2019, 7,727 divorce petitions were filed before the family court. Between 2011 and 2019, the numbers fluctuated between 7,500 and 8,300. Last year, the figure, however, dwindled to 5,059 petitions, as the family court remained closed from March to August owing to the Covid-19 lockdown.Though there is no official data available, lawyers and marriage counsellors said the court grants decree of divorce in around 85℅ of petitions.Experts said divorce petitions are being filed more by men than women and the core issues between spouses are the rising standards of expectations from each other, lack of time for the partner and lack of communication between the couple. According to experts, this is because both the husband and wife are busy with their respective professional and career commitments, and lack of communication leading to conflicts between them.“In the current scenario, the key reasons for breaking of marriages are increased expectations from each other. The expectations of women are to a large extent centred around companionship, helping with household or domestic chores, greater degree of freedom and understanding, because women are now stepping out of their houses frequently. However, men do not seem to have not moved on with women. They continue to expect women to fulfil the traditional goals,” said Shubhada Maitra, dean, school of social work at Tata Institute of Social Sciences.Maitra said women are now getting more career-oriented and have professional commitments, and at the same time they also have to look at their domestic chores.“So, women bear double brunt, by working as an earning member of the family and at the same time also taking care of the household chores,” Maitra said, adding that, this is one of the major reasons of conflict between couples.She also said that the dynamics of marriage has changed.“Women are educated and also prefer either not to marry or they marry late –most often after the age of 25 -26 – as compared to earlier times, when they used to get married at the age of 20-22 years. If one gets married early, the young mind can be moulded. Women have their own personalities and expectations and when they are not fulfilled, they want to end the marriage,” Maitra added.Marriage counsellor Ajitkumar Bidwe, who worked with the family court in Mumbai for about 25 years, said earlier marriages used to break more because of excessive interference by parents from either side.“Now, mostly couples are independent and there is hardly any parental interference in their decision making. But that also means that there is no one else in their daily lives to sort out their issues.”He cited an example of a two doctors who got married in 2012.“The couple approached me for counselling. The woman was from Punjab and the man was born and brought up in Mumbai. It was an arranged marriage. The couple had issues because the woman’s mother would decide minutest of things, such as the colour of the bed sheet in the couple’s bedroom. These issues escalated to a level where the couple decided to file for divorce by mutual consent,” said Bidwe.The situation has now changed with women getting more and more independent and joint families becoming nuclear ones. The society has undergone changes as people are now more career-oriented than family oriented, he added.“Recently, I came across a case where both husband and wife held MBA degrees and earned about Rs2.5 lakh a month. After their marriage in 2017, they also booked a flat. Two years later, they came to me for counselling. After listening to them I realised that the two did not have time for each other. They didn’t even speak properly for about a year and mostly, they used to exchange messages through chits stuck on the refrigerator. Eventually, they drifted apart and then started living separately,” Bidwe added.According to him, Spouses must spare at least an hour of quality time for each other everyday and in between keep the line of communication between them alive, no matter how busy they are.“The couples should at least have the dinner together,” said Bidwe.Dr Madhuri Singh, consulting psychiatrist associated with Nanavati Hospital, feels that the prime reason for marriages breaking is the rising expectation.“The expectations have changed over a period of time. For instance, the space that the couples give each other today has increased today. The problem starts brewing when this freedom is misused by one of them,” said Dr Singh, adding that today people are spending more time on their own.“They spend more time with their friends and are engaged in their respective digital worlds. Further, their professional commitments compelled them to spend more time outside and in this process they don’t even miss the other spouse. Thus, they are habituated to live without the other partner and are too busy in their own professional circles. Here, cracks start developing in their relationships,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-reported-an-average-of-22-divorce-petitions-daily-101612038442268.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to vaccinate frontline workers from February first week||Following instructions from the Centre, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will start vaccinating frontline workers from the first week of February, along with healthcare workers (HCWs). This is in line with the Maharashtra government’s decision on Saturday to begin vaccination of frontline workers from February 1. The state has 580,000 frontline workers, including police personnel and sanitation workers, who have enrolled on the centralised CoWIN app. District administrations have been directed to increase the number of vaccination centres from 239 on Friday, as per the requirement. The state government has been assured by the Centre of an adequate supply of doses. To facilitate the entire process, BMC will start more vaccination centres at peripheral hospitals and other Covid-19 jumbo centres to attain its daily target of 10,000 inoculations. In Mumbai, around 200,000 frontline workers have registered on CoWIN.Initially, BMC had decided to begin the second phase after February 14. Now, BMC will conduct a dry run for the second phase on February 1. “The central government has instructed us to start inoculating frontline workers along with HCWs for to complete the mass immunisation programme in the city faster,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. “We had a meeting on Saturday where the decision to start the second phase from the first week [of February] has been taken.” In the city, 125,000 HCWs have registered on the CoWIN app. Over the past 10 days of the vaccination drive, which started on January 16, the BMC had set a target to vaccinate 48,791 HCWs, of which 39,690 or 81% HCWs have taken the first jab. “We have received instructions from the central government to initiate the second phase at the earliest. But as we have a large number, we wanted to finish the first phase before starting with the second phase,” said a senior health officer from BMC. ‘Daily target will be increased to 10K’ To facilitate the immunisation process for both categories, BMC has decided to increase their daily target to 10,000 vaccinations. To meet the new target, BMC will include four peripheral hospitals of the 16 hospitals in the initial phase and two more jumbo centres will be added. “We have plans to start vaccination centres at Bhabha (Kurla), MW Desai (Malad), Bhagwati (Borivli) and VD Savarkar (Mulund) peripheral hospitals. Initially, we will start two vaccination units at each of these centres, which can be increased further. At present, we have finalised Bhabha hospital,” said Dr Sheela Jagtap, city immunisation officer, BMC. When the immunisation programme started, the city had 10 vaccination centres, including the state-run JJ hospital. This week, the civic body added two more centres—-SevenHills hospital and NESCO jumbo centre at Goregaon. Kakani held an inspection at the two facilities to evaluate the infrastructure, following which a decision has been taken to add 13 more vaccination units at the two places. “At present, there are five vaccination units at SevenHills, which will be increased to 15 units by next week. Also, the NESCO jumbo centre, which has two units, will be increased to 5 units. Then later, we will increase it to 10 units,” said Kakani. The BMC will start two more vaccination centres at the two Covid-19 jumbo centres situated at Dahisar and Mulund. “Jumbo centres have good infrastructure and get a large number of patients. Also, they are more localised, which can attract more beneficiaries,” said Dr Jagtap. ‘Don’t get over dependent on technology’ The technical glitch in the CoWIN app at the beginning of the mass inoculation programme led to the civic body struggling to meet half of its target. As a result, doctors have cautioned the civic body to not be totally reliant on the app, but instead also focus on walk-ins to vaccination centres, which will boost the overall turnout. “If the app shortlists 500 HCWs and sends out messages, only 50% actually turn up for vaccination. As the pressure on the civic body will only further increase (inoculation FWs and HCWs), they need to be more open and approachable to techniques like walk-ins,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president, Association of Medical Consultants (AMC). Doctors have also suggested that private hospitals be included in the mass vaccination programme. “To vaccinate 200 million people in the city, only government infrastructure won’t suffice. They need to include private hospitals , which will bring vaccination to the door steps of the public,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-vaccinate-frontline-workers-from-february-first-week-101612037723440.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||39,690 health workers got Covid-19 vaccine shots in first 10 days in Mumbai||After 10 days of the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has vaccinated 39,690 healthcare workers (HCW)s. On Saturday, a record number of HCWs — 6,351— were vaccinated in Mumbai and the turnout was 80% of the projected target of 7,923. BMC officials expect the turnout to remain high over the weekend since HCWs prefer to be vaccinated on weekends, making use of their weekly off days, which are usually either Saturday or Sunday. According to its calculations, BMC has vaccinated an average of 3,969 HCWs daily. At present, there are 12 vaccination centres in the city. The highest number of beneficiaries have been vaccinated at Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, which has handled 6,210 beneficiaries. The second-highest numbers are at KEM Hospital in Parel, where 5,865 beneficiaries have been vaccinated. Sir JJ Hospital has seen the fewest beneficiaries followed by the NESCO Covid-19 Jumbo centre, which became operational as a vaccination centre two days ago. Sir JJ Hospital is the only centre administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Other centres in the city are administering Covishield, which has been developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said on Friday, “At the current pace, we can vaccinate daily between 15,000-25,000 beneficiaries. This can be augmented to 50,000 in the coming days. In the third phase, when general public will be vaccinated, our capacity might have to go up further.” To that end, BMC plans to enrol private hospitals for the vaccination drive and is awaiting guidelines from the Centre and state government on this issue. Meanwhile, BMC has started the process of shortlisting private medical institutions in the city that would be interested in acquiring the permissions necessary for the vaccination process. Civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had on January 16 said, “We can vaccinate even up to 1 lakh beneficiaries once private institutions are allowed to vaccinate citizens.” In the first phase of the vaccination drive, BMC aims to vaccinate 130,000 HCWs .

31-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM help sought over Kalyan park project affecting Waldhuni river||The city park project in Kalyan has hit a roadblock with an environmental activist from Ambernath writing to the Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to cancel the project as it encroaches on the Waldhuni river.The project, which is inching ahead, has been opposed by the greens for a long time to conserve the Waldhuni river that falls along this project at Gauripada, Kalyan (W).Sudhakar Jhore, 54, activist has raised concerns over the adverse effect of the project on the river. He said, “We want a proper survey to be conducted on how the project is affecting the river. The project has led to shrinking of the river banks and this will further lead to flooding in several parts as the water won’t have enough space to seep in. The government should stop this project.“Instead of undertaking such projects, the civic bodies should first look into the conservation of the water body, which they have failed to do. The river is already subjected to rampant pollution from industries and it has turned into a nullah. There is no plan to clean it by the stakeholders.”The Waldhuni river flows from the hills of Kashivli village of Ambernath taluka, further to Bohonali village, Kakole village and to the historic Lord Shiv temple in Ambernath. It also crosses different parts of the Ulhasnagar and Kalyan cities.“In June 2015, the urban development department of Maharashtra government, in a notification, asked the local civic bodies to look after the Waldhuni river. However, the civic bodies did not take up any conservation of the river,” added Jhore.Earlier, during the 2019 floods that hit several parts of Kalyan city, the entire city park project land was submerged under water. This led to concerns among the residents and activists about the sustainability of the project.Shashikant Dayma, founder of Waldhuni Biradari NGO, said, “The construction of the park is on the river bed, which will definitely affect the water body. When there is high tide, the water won’t be able to flow with speed and this will lead to flooding in the nearby areas. We are not against the development but it should not be at the stake of killing our rivers.”The idea of having a park in the city came in 2010, though the construction began in early 2019 when the fund of ₹114Cr was available under Smart City Scheme of the central government.Balchandra Nemade, deputy engineer of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation, said, “Following the floods in 2005, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) had appointed the Maharashtra Engineering Research Institute (MERI) to conduct a study. The institute conducted the survey of 11.80m-long Waldhuni river and its premises and submitted a report to the authority in 2007. Based on that survey, we have initiated the works as per the permissible limits. The civic body has made sure that all the environmental norms are followed while carrying out the project.”Meanwhile, the 40 per cent of the work on retaining wall on banks of Waldhuri river has been completed while 20 per cent of the work on the compound wall is complete. Land filling across the plot is on the verge of completion.The city park is slated to have landscapes, garden, water plant and auditoriums, botanical garden, drive-in cinema, light and sound show, wind and water cafe, jogging track, playground, cultural gallery, exhibition court, green corridor, children’s play garden, toy train, shopping street, eatery lane, tennis court, swimming pool, basketball court, skating ring and farm land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-help-sought-over-kalyan-park-project-affecting-waldhuni-river-101612036522679.html

Owners said that since almost everything else has started in the unlock phase, schools can be allowed to open too. “We have been urging the government to allow reopening of schools like it was allowed in other parts of the state. If schools do not start, the government should give us a monthly allowance of ₹35,000 to maintain buses,” said Anil Garg, president of SBOA. There are nearly 50,000 school buses and around 150,000 bus staffers in the city. While schools in several parts of the state have reopened on for Class 9 to 12 on November 23 and for Class 5 to 8 from January 27, those in cities like Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane are yet to reopen as local authorities have still not permitted the reopening. Bus owners said with business remaining shut for 10 months, they were facing a tough time in retaining their staff and maintaining buses. “Rallies, political meetings and elections are allowed, but schools are still asked to remain shut which is unfair,” said Garg. Officials from the state education department said the decision pertaining to reopening of schools will have to be taken by the civic body and the state government. “Once permissions are granted, buses can ply with the standard operating procedures set by the department from time to time,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/out-of-biz-for-10-months-mumbai-school-bus-owners-demand-monthly-allowance-101612035621983.html

The gang that we busted recently stole 62 Bullets across the state and Goa in a matter of four months just by using an ignition switch,” Singh said.Read more: Navi Mumbai crime branch recovers 44 stolen bikes; catch 3The wire that connects the engine to the starter of the bike has a jointer in between which hangs outside from the left side. The accused used to remove the jointer and plug the ignition switch.“Ideally, the wire that has a jointer should stay hidden or should be locked inside a separate box to avoid such thefts. We will bring this to their notice,” Singh said.Besides, police also plan to look for institutes that research on automation and write about this flaw to them as well. Once the bike is started, the accused replaces the ignition switch of the bike from the original one to the one he used to steal and then sells it further with forged papers and fake number plate.Royal Enfield was contacted via email but no response has been received yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-cops-to-write-to-bike-makers-about-flaw-that-is-leading-to-thefts-101612035562198.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Vice-chancellors seek Governor’s nod to start physical classes||Vice-chancellors of all the universities in Maharashtra want to start physical classes without any delay. The demand was made in a meeting called by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is also the chancellor of all the universities in the state. The governor also voiced the same opinion and said that allowing physical classes for schools and not allowing college and universities is contradictory.Koshyari had called a video conference meeting of all the vice-chancellors to review annual audit, filling up vacant posts and preparations of the universities for starting physical classes.As all the universities and higher education institutions are ready to start physical classes, but they are unable to do so without permission from the state government, all the vice-chancellors demanded permission from the governor to start physical classes at colleges, stated a release issued by Raj Bhavan on Friday. Even students are demanding resumption of physical classes. “I came to know through newspapers about reopening of Class 5 to 8 in schools across the state; hence not allowing physical classes at colleges and universities looks contradictory. Universities have already started their academic year and their online lectures are also going on. Since the Covid-19 pandemic has come under control, universities should consider resuming physical classes. They can conduct classes in shifts,” the governor said in the meeting.He said the universities should take initiative about resuming classes in view of the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for restarting colleges.The state government is yet to decide on reopening colleges in the state that are shut for over 10 months. Following the Covid-19 outbreak, all the educational institutions were shut in March last year. The state government has recently allowed Class 5 to 12 in schools to reopen.Minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant was not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vice-chancellors-seek-governor-s-nod-to-start-physical-classes-101612035442057.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra distance education universities see drop in admissions||A staggered admission process that has lasted over six months and unemployment due to the economic slowdown over the past 11 months has led to a significant impact on those who want to continue their studies through distance education. The Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), the distance learning wing of University of Mumbai (MU), recently recorded a drop in admissions for the July session of the 2020-21 academic year. IDOL’s admission process has been delayed, and the University Grants Commission (UGC) finally allowed IDOL to begin the process in October 2020. One reason for the delay was that the summer 2020 exams could only be held in September and October, when they were conducted online across state public universities. From 67,000 students enrolled in the 2019-20 academic year, the number has come down to 58,500 admissions for the 2020-2021 academic year. “Confusion over the status of summer 2020 examinations followed by delay in conducting admissions for the new academic year together seemed to have discouraged some students from opting for distance education this year,” said an IDOL official. Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) received more pre-admission registrations for their July session compared to last year. However, the eventual confirmed admissions were lower — from 543,000 students for the July 2019-20 session, IGNOU has 508,000 students for the July 2020-21 session. Admissions for the January session is currently in process across distance learning universities. “There has been a slight dip in admissions for the July session this year compared to the July session in the last academic year. While there can’t be one specific reason for this drop, we have received inquiries and emails from interested candidates who have shared that their current financial status is discouraging them from opting for a degree this year,” said a senior official from IGNOU. “We hope the situation changes for good soon,” he added. Several sectors have been hit by the economic slowdown, leading to job losses as well as loss of regular income. Several education institutes had to introduce the option of fee payment in instalments to their students in order to ensure that students don’t drop out of completing their education due to lack of funds. “With no job in hand, most youngsters are currently focussed on finding a job first, and not thinking about pursuing education. This could be one reason for the drop in admissions in distance education universities,” said the official from IDOL. As per information shared by the admissions department of Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU), 620,000 and 627,000 students enrolled in 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years, respectively. However, for the 2020-21 academic year, the enrolment stands at 572,000. “Distance education is mostly opted for by those who have a job and wish to continue their undergraduate or postgraduate degree in a way that does not hamper their work schedule. However, the fact that classes across colleges and universities have been online since last year, there’s a good chance that students opted for regular colleges over distance education this time round,” said Prof Ashoke Vibhakar, a faculty member of YCMOU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-distance-education-universities-see-drop-in-admissions-101612035202181.html
31-01-2021||Other||Boards round the corner, mobile internet ban leaves Haryana students high and dry||With the Haryana government banning mobile internet in 17 districts of the state in view of the farmers’ agitation, students are on the receiving end as the move has disrupted their online classes.While initially, the government had suspended mobile internet in Sonepat, Jhajjar and Palwal, it further extended the ban to 14 other districts on Friday. A government release on late Saturday evening conveyed that the ban will be in place till the evening of January 31. Apart from the three districts mentioned earlier, the ban has been imposed in Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal, Panipat, Hisar, Jind, Rohtak, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Fatehabad, Rewari and Sirsa.Nikita Dhaka, a Class 12 (commerce) student from Rohtak, said, “Our final exams are just over a month away. We have already lost precious time due to the pandemic outbreak and now this mobile internet ban has further added to our woes. The government has no concern for us, it seems.” She says that she used to take online tests every evening to evaluate her progress, but now her study plans have gone awry.Ankit Takshak, a Class 12 (non-medical) student from Bhiwani, said his school teachers had been sending assignments and question banks to the class through Whatsapp but now they are unable to do so. “I am neither able to attend online classes nor get assignments from my teachers. Does the government not have a better plan to tackle the agitation? Do they have to make us suffer after forcing our parents to protest on the state border in the biting cold? It seems they have made up their minds to destroy the future of farmers as well as schoolchildren,” said Takshak.He added that the government’s decision of banning mobile internet will only affect children coming from economically weaker sections as parents of such children won’t be able to afford WiFi connections. Yachika Sihag, an IAS aspirant from Hisar, said she paid ₹2 lakh for year-long online coaching for UPSC exams but is now unable to attend those due to the ban. “The government has been asking people to go digital but with frequent bans, how is one supposed to do that. The government has IT cells, administration, police and other agencies to maintain law and order. Why do they have to ban the internet and create hurdles for people? I hope the internet services are restored soon,” she said.Pawan Kumar, a parent from Rohtak, said there is no facility of WiFi connection in their village and so his daughter, who studies in Class 10, has been unable to take classes since Friday. “Board exams are around the corner and the government is creating trouble for students by banning internet services. Instead of hearing farmers’ problems, the government has created problems for our children too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/boards-round-the-corner-mobile-internet-ban-leaves-haryana-students-high-and-dry-101612035081984.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants probate of unattested will||The Bombay high court (HC) has recently granted probate of an un-attested will, observing that the testamentary court cannot allow the wishes of a deceased to be defeated or thwarted due to some technicality.The single judge bench of justice BP Colabawalla was hearing a testamentary petition filed by a city resident seeking probate of a will left behind by his deceased relative.Probate is a court process by which a will is proved valid or invalid.On October 14 last year, the HC had struck down a caveat filed with respect to the will, and directed its testamentary department to grant for probate of the will if it was otherwise found in order.However, on December 20, HC’s testamentary registrar raised an objection as to the validity of the will on the grounds that it was signed only by the testator — the deceased woman, and not by two attesting witnesses, as required by section 63(c) of the Indian Succession Act, 1925.The matter was then referred back to the testamentary court where advocate Shyam Kapadia, who represented the petitioner, submitted that the objection raised by the testamentary registrar was a highly technical one and urged the court to not allow the will and last wishes of the deceased to be defeated on a hyper technical ground. Kapadia pointed out that the will was executed on November 11, 2008 and was registered with the joint sub-registrar, Mumbai City Division 1, on the same day in the presence of both the attesting witnesses. He further pointed out that both the witnesses had filed affidavits stating that they were present in the office of the joint sub-registrar and witnessed the testator signing the will and that both of them have signed registration page of the will.Justice Colabawalla accepted the contention and said the law on the subject is quite clear that when a court deals with a will, the court must approach it as a court of conscience. “It is for the court to be satisfied that the document put forward is the last will and testament of the deceased, and if the court finds that the wishes of the deceased are likely to be defeated or thwarted merely by reason of some technicality, the court, as a court of conscience, would not permit such things to happen.” The bench further said the objection raised by the testamentary registrar was a technical one, considering that the attesting witnesses had filed affidavits stating that they were very much present at the time when the deceased executed the will.“I therefore find that the objection taken by the testamentary department that the signatures of the attesting witnesses do not appear on the will and hence (the will) is invalid, is a hyper technical one,” the judge added and directed the department to grant probate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-probate-of-unattested-will-101612034901955.html
31-01-2021||Mumbai||List steps to identify Group-A, B posts for those with disability, Bombay HC asks state||Rejecting the state government’s plea for vacating stay on filling some promotional posts in Maharashtra, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the chief secretary to file an affidavit setting out steps taken and proposed to be taken to identify promotional posts in various state departments which can be held by persons with benchmark disabilities.The division bench of justice Amjad Sayed and justice Madhav Jamdar further directed that the affidavit shall set out what exercise has been carried out and proposed to be carried out, including the data and statistics that has been collated so far to identify the posts and the outer limit within which the exercise would be completed.The court was hearing a bunch of petitions filed through advocates Vinod Sangvikar, Sugandh Deshmukh and Mahendra Shingade, by persons with disabilities complaining about denial of reservation-in-promotion to Group-A and Group-B posts.Acting on their petitions, HC has in November 2020 stayed the process for finalising promotions to Group-A and Group-B posts in some departments after noticing that the right to reservation in promotion of the physically challenged persons was recognised by the Supreme Court, and a proposal for working out modalities for providing such reservation was already placed before the state cabinet for approval.Though HC has earlier refused to vacate the stay on January 15 this year by observing that the promotion process cannot be allowed without securing the rights of the petitioners, the general administration department had renewed the plea claiming that the Apex court had subsequently thought it fit to place the matter of reservation-in-promotion for persons with benchmark disabilities for review before a larger bench.The argument, however, failed to impress upon the court. On Thursday, the division bench again refused to vacate the stay on finalising promotions saying that the state government had not set out any positive steps taken so far to secure the rights of persons with disabilities.But, HC allowed the state to grant promotions to officers who are due to retire on or before February 28 this year and whose promotions got stuck due to HC’s interim orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/list-steps-to-identify-group-a-b-posts-for-those-with-disability-bombay-hc-asks-state-101612034661922.html

According to the act the Govt will intervene for price control only if rates of horticultural produce are increased by 100% and that of non-perishable items increase by 50%. Stock piling limits have been removed on food grain, pulses, onion, potato, oilseeds etc. It may lead to apprehensions that Corporates may purchase commodities at lower rates and stock pile and sell at higher prices to consumers,” he wrote in a series of tweets on Saturday.He further said, “Reform is a continuous process and no one would argue against the reforms in the APMCs or Mandi System, a positive argument on the same does not mean that it is done to weaken or demolish the system.”In Saturday’s meeting, issues related to the Budget session, farmers’ agitation, women’s bill were discussed among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-farm-laws-will-affect-msp-apmc-system-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-101612034242008.html

31-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena asks Anna Hazare to clear his stance on farm laws||The Shiv Sena has taunted noted social activist Anna Hazare’s decision to cancel his proposed fast over farm reforms due to the intervention of top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and asked him to make public his views on the three farm laws which the farmers are currently agitating against. “Anna first announced his intention to fast and then cancelled it due to assurances from BJP leaders. That is ok. But what are his views on the farm laws? Does he support the farmers at Singhu border who are protesting against these farm laws? We want to know on whose side Anna is? Anna should at least clarify his stance to Maharashtra,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.Hazare had announced his intent to hold an indefinite fast at his hometown Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar to press demands for implementation of the Swaminathan commission recommendations regarding agriculture pricing, statutory status and autonomy for the central agriculture price commission. However, he called off his fast after former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister for agriculture Kailash Choudhary assured him of forming a high-level committee to consider his demands. The editorial claimed that Hazare was selective in his agitation. It claimed that he had protested in Delhi against the then Manmohan Singh-led Congress Government, which was fully exploited by the BJP. In contrast, he was not agitating against the seven-year-old Narendra Modi government. “Can agitations only be done against Congress government? Is there a Ram Rajya now?” the editorial stated.It further called upon Hazare to join the farmers’ agitation as it would strengthen their movement, instead of negotiating with BJP leaders in his village. It said the movement needs a veteran soldier like Hazare who has fought wars and undertaken various such agitations.In response, Hazare took potshots at Sena, saying that the party forgot that its own minister had to quit due to corruption. “Your minister indulged in corruption and you backed him. We had to agitate and he was removed. For us, BJP, Shiv Sena and Congress do not matter; what matter are the country and society,” he said. He further said he had launched six agitations after the BJP government took over which included two in Delhi itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-asks-anna-hazare-to-clear-his-stance-on-farm-laws-101612033701987.html

Then how come our national flag was insulted,” questioned Ambedkar.He said if the President still feels it was an insult, he should also condemn the RSS for observing August 15 1947 as black day.Kovind in his address at the Budget session of the Parliament had condemned the manner in which the farmers ran amok at the Red Fort on the Republic Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rss-insulted-tricolour-in-past-says-prakash-ambedkar-asks-president-to-condemn-them-101612033221867.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Day after clashes at Delhi borders, farmers, police step up vigil||New Delhi: As the number of protesters at three of Delhi borders continued to surge on Saturday, the police worked through the day to seal and isolate the agitation spots, even as farmer leader Rakesh Tikait warned of a response if “even one more” stone was pelt at any of the farmers.“I want to tell the government that the stone-pelting must stop now. From Sunday, the khap panchayats of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will be here. If there is even a single stone pelted after this, volunteers of the khap panchayats will catch them and treat them appropriately,” Tikait said on Saturday, as the crowd at Ghazipur border cheered on.Tikait’s was seemingly referring to stones pelt at farmers at Singhu border on Friday afternoon, allegedly by “local residents”. The incident led to clashes in which 15 farmers and six police personnel were injured and ended in the arrest of 44 people.In a similar incident at the Tikri agitation on Friday, a group claiming to be locals protested against the blockade, which they said was affecting their businesses and daily lives. Farmer bodies have dismissed these groups as people “propped up by the Centre”.But these clashes have led to the police sealing the borders in a way that has disrupted the farmers’ regular movement, and restricted their access to food, water, and toilets.At Singhu, the police on Saturday broke up the road behind the main protest site, a day after they had razed inner lanes that farmers and residents used for their commutes.But the worst affected at Singhu was the first stage, where Friday’s clashes broke out.The primary protest site at Singhu border, which stretches for over 10km, is divided into two parts, the first of which is occupied by the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC). The second, larger, stage around 500 metres away houses protesters of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), and is behind the police barricades.“We cannot walk to the Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial a few hundred metres away, or use the toilets in that area. We are forced to relieve ourselves in the fields. Now, we have to make multiple trips to a spot about two kilometres away to bring water, whereas earlier we just used pipes to get water from Delhi Jal Board (DJB) tankers. The barricades have been placed only to cut off our supplies,” said Gursahib Singh, 25, a farmer from Theh Naushera village in Tarn Taran district in Punjab.Hussandeep Singh, 23, a farmer from Amritsar who has been serving as a volunteer at the KMSC stage, said, “Except for a narrow lane, our stage has been cut off from the main protest site. We worry that the single lane too will be cut off soon. If that happens, we will be completely isolated and vulnerable to attacks like the one on Friday,” he said.The barricades have also made it difficult for farmers reach the main stage to access vital supplies.On Saturday, the area remained tense. Around 3.40 pm, volunteers said they spotted a group of people attempting to march towards the stage area again. “As soon as our volunteers alerted us, we ran towards the spot to see. The group had dispersed by then,” said Major Singh, 65, a farmer from Kasel in Tarn Taran district, who is also a member of KSMC.A senior police officer, refusing to be named, said, “A group had arrived but we made them go back from the first barricade nearly 1.5km away.”Responding to complaints raised by farmers on multiple barricades, the officer said, “We have kept one side open for them and all sympathisers or protesters can travel from that road. That stretch is around 3km long.”Ghazipur cut offThe Ghazipur protest site too has been cut off from the Delhi side, making it difficult members of the public to access the farmers. But the mood here was relatively upbeat, a day after the gathering increased exponentially, after a video of Tikait in tears went viral online. In fact, the crowd, farmers said, had doubled on Saturday.A majority of the protesters gathered in front of the stage from which Tikait spoke, visibly more composed than a couple of days earlier.“People say Rakesh cried. Rakesh Tikait doesn’t cry. What you saw were not tears, they could be the water we use to irrigate fields,” he said.Tikait also used the stage to extend displays of inclusivity. “When I thought of quitting the protests, I remembered my Sikh brothers who fed me here for the last two months. I realised that this was a conspiracy to topple the turbans of Sikh farmers,” he said.While farmers were supposed to observe a day’s fast to mark Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, this was limited to a few protesters and leaders, while langar continued uninterrupted.“If we don’t eat, how will we be able to fight this government?” said Manjeet Singh, a farmer from Pilibhit, who had organised a langar at Ghazipur border.Tikait, in his speeches, didn’t focus on the fasts either. Instead, he said rations and other necessities were in sufficient supply.“Some BJP office bearers have sent us 2,000 blankets, sugar and potatoes. They requested me not to identify them, so I won’t,” Tikait said, drawing laughs from the gathering.Ghazipur was transformed on Saturday, with several more tents being set up overnight, and the road packed with vehicles for almost a kilometre.Like Friday, political leaders continued to swarm the stage. On Saturday, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala arrived, accompanied by supporters in a large fleet of cars. Chautala resigned from the Haryana Assembly on Wednesday against the farm laws.Singhu and Tikri borders too saw the crowd swell.“More farmers from Haryana and Punjab will reach by Sunday. Khap panchayats are being held in villages across Haryana, and people from every household are arriving at the protest site. Around 2,000 tractors packed with farmers are on their way to Tikri border as well,” said Deepak Deswal, a farmer leader and a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, said.Kulwinder Singh, a farmer leader who reached Tikri border from Sirsa on Saturday afternoon, said the police were stopping farmers at many locations in Haryana to discourage them from reaching the protest site. “Many tractors of farmers have been either stopped or diverted by the police at different locations such as Rohtak, Jind, Bahadurgarh in Haryana in order to suppress our movement. But we will not relent as more will join us in the next 24 hours. They cannot stop farmers to reach the protest site,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/day-after-clashes-at-delhi-borders-farmers-police-step-up-vigil-101612031721241.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Hours after blast near Israel embassy, bomb threat call for Tehran flight||Hours after a low-intensity IED blast outside the Israeli embassy in the national capital, a Mahan Air flight to Tehran, scheduled to depart the New Delhi international airport at 12.55 am on Saturday, was delayed by more than eight hours following what officials said was an intelligence alert over a bomb threat.The boarding for the flight was put on hold and all 94 passengers were subjected to security checks again, and their luggage was re-scanned.An officer with knowledge of the developments said that details of all passengers going to Iran and Iraq from India are being verified in detail. Instructions have also been given to obtain details of passengers who recently arrived in India from the two countries and run a detailed background check on them, the officer said.An airport official, who wished not to be named, said an intelligence input was received around 11pm on Friday following which the boarding process for Flight W5 070 was immediately put on hold.Also read: Israel embassy blast probe focuses on 182 who walked blast area“A bomb threat assessment committee was formed and the alert was declared as specific. Bomb detection and disposal squad of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) then scanned the luggage and the aircraft thoroughly. The passengers were again subjected to security check and the flight was declared safe. It finally took off at 8.22am,” an officer said, asking not to be named.Mahan Air did not respond to HT’s request for a comment.Another officer said instructions have been given to minutely scan details of all passengers landing in India from Iran or Iraq. The flight manifests of passengers coming in from these countries are being closely monitored.“After yesterday’s (Friday’s) incident in New Delhi, scrutiny on passengers coming in from selective countries has been increased. In addition to this, details of passengers who had landed in India in the past few weeks are also being obtained to re-verify their credentials,” the officer said.During the initial probe into Friday’s blast that took place outside the Israeli embassy in Lutyens’ Delhi, the police found an envelope that purportedly had names of two recently assassinated Iranian nationals.The low-intensity blast damaged at least three vehicles parked close by. Even though no person was injured, the incident triggered an alert among the security agencies because of the sensitive location. The security of important installations in the national capital was increased immediately after the blast, including Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport.Commenting on the increased security, deputy commissioner of police (IGIA) Rajeev Ranjan said that along with additional deployment, more pickets to check the incoming vehicles and spotters on watchtowers, they have also armed plainclothesmen deployed at the airport to secure the perimeter.The CISF has also increased its presence on the airside of the airport and airlines have also been directed to remain vigilant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hours-after-blast-near-israel-embassy-bomb-threat-call-for-tehran-flight-101612031541155.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Final-year DU students can return to campus in ‘small batches’ from Feb 1||Following directives from the Union ministry of home affairs, which allowed final-year college students to return to campuses in small groups, Delhi University on Saturday announced it would reopen the university on February 1.The decision was taken after a meeting with principals of DU colleges and heads of departments. The University has also made it compulsory for teaching staff to attend in-person classes.“Only final-year students in small batches are allowed to visit their respective colleges/centres/departments for their laboratory/practical/skills library and other related activities as per discretion of the respective principal/director/ head in line with University Grants Commission guidelines and SOPs dated November 5, 2020, and MHA order dated January 27, 2021,” Registrar Vikas Gupta said in a notice on January 29.After research and final-year postgraduate students of Science courses were allowed to return to laboratories in small numbers in November, final-year UG students had been demanding a phased re-entry of Science students because they were losing their credit points due to no practical lessons. Following this, the university had announced earlier this month that it would allow final-year students to return to campus in small batches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/finalyear-du-students-can-return-to-campus-in-small-batches-from-feb-1-101612031361237.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Record 82.7% health workers get Covid-19 jabs in Delhi||Delhi saw the highest number of health care workers receiving the Covid-19 vaccine jabs on Saturday — at 8,774, which is 530 beneficiaries more than the previous high of 8,244 inoculations achieved on Thursday.The number, though a record so far, still only translates to just 82.7% inoculation of the 10,600 people targeted, with the government having increased the number of vaccination centres.The 25 additional vaccination centres started during the last round of immunisation on Thursday are likely to cater to front line workers, according to officials from Delhi’s health department. The Centre had earlier this week said that all states should start vaccinating front line workers from first week of February to drive up vaccination coverage and reduce wastage of doses.“The order from the Centre has come in. However, the protocols are not yet in place. We might no be able to start vaccinating front line workers from Monday onwards, but everyone is working on getting everything ready. It will happen soon,” said another official from Delhi’s health department.According to the data shared by the Delhi government, 43 sites across Delhi were able to complete their target of vaccinating 100 people a day. This included 13 Delhi government hospitals as well.So far, Delhi has vaccinated 56,733 healthcare workers, which is just about one-sixth of the total estimated 300,000 healthcare workers and medical staff in the city. This number translates to almost 73% of the health care workers who have been targeted so far.There are an estimated 600,000 front line workers in Delhi and the government is still completing collection of their data. “Most agencies have already submitted their list of employees, we are about to finalise the list,” said the first health official.The third priority group identified by the centre for receiving the vaccination are those above the age of 50 or those with severe comorbidities. As per the government’s data, there are about 4.2 million people over the age of 50 in the city as per the latest electoral rolls. A list of those who are under the age of 50 but have comorbidities is yet to be finalised, with the Centre still deciding a criteria on who should get the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/record-82-7-health-workers-get-covid-19-jabs-in-delhi-101612031302755.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||AAP says R-Day violence ‘scripted’, BJP hits back||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as the Central government imposed a mobile internet shutdown in and around Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, where large groups of farmers have been protesting against three contentious farm laws passed in September last year.The AAP also claimed that the BJP “scripted” the January 26 tractor rally violence and the clash that happened at the Singhu protest site on Friday, while demanding an investigation by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The BJP was quick to dismiss the allegations as “baseless” and hit back at the AAP calling the party “anarchist”.“The BJP scripted the violence that happened during the tractor rally on January 26 to malign the peaceful protest of farmers. Yesterday, BJP goons attacked the farmers at Singhu and Tikri borders; they were not local residents. Today, they shut down the internet at all the protest sites. They have been calling the protesting farmers anti-national since the Day One of the protest. The NIA should probe the role of BJP leaders involved in the violence,” said the AAP’s spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.AAP’s spokesperson Raghav Chadha added, “The BJP is trying to crush the farmer’s agitation and their role in the January 26 violence stands exposed. Safety and security of the protesting farmers have become a major issue now. It is more concerning because the police in Delhi is also under the BJP government.”Delhi-BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra, however, countered the claims by saying, “The AAP has proved that they are a party of anarchists. The farmers’ protest has been disturbing normal lives and livelihood of people living in the vicinity not for a few days but for around 70 days. It is sad that the AAP leaders can’t see their pain. They are also questioning the police, despite many police officers being injured after violence linked to the farmer protests. Their allegations are baseless. No BJP supporter or worker was involved in any violence or any protest against the farmer groups. It is the supporters of the AAP who are instigating violence and there is ample evidence on public domain that exposes them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-says-r-day-violence-scripted-bjp-hits-back-101612031302090.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||44 held for violence at Singhu, none of them are counter protesters||All 44 people arrested for the violence at Singhu border on Friday are farmers who had been protesting at the site, police said.None of the arrested suspects are from a mob of 200 , who claimed to be locals of the area and who indulged in a clash with protesting farmers on Friday, police officers, who did not wish to be named, claimed.Despite multiple barricades and at least 1,000 personnel of Delhi Police and paramilitary forces at the Singhu border, a mob of 200 people managed to reach near the main stage of the protest on Friday and attacked the farmers with sticks, besides pelting them with stones, leading to Friday afternoon’s clash. There were videos on social media — none of which could be verified independently — that showed a group of men pelting stones while police personnel stood next to them and watched. One video showed a masked man throwing stones. Another showed some police personnel in anti-riot gear standing and watching during the stone-pelting.Despite repeated phone calls and text messages, the special commissioner of police (west zone) Sanjay Singh or additional DCP (outer), Ghanshayam Bansal did not respond to a comment on why no locals were arrested for their involvement in violence.Delhi police had on Friday night released a statement saying they had arrested 44 persons for Friday’s violence, including a 22-year-old protesting farmer, who had allegedly stabbed a police inspector with a sword on his left palm. Police in their statement did not specify how many of the 44 people were farmers or locals.But Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee, said that on Saturday he met all the 44 farmers lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail, including Ranjit Singh — who was arrested for attacking the police inspector.“All the 44 people arrested for yesterday’s violence at Singhu border are farmers. We will be fighting the case of all farmers who have been arrested during the agitation. We have formed a special panel of lawyers to look into the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/44-held-for-violence-at-singhu-none-of-them-are-counter-protesters-101612031241764.html
31-01-2021||Delhi||Israel embassy blast: Probe focuses on 182 who walked blast area in two hours||Between 3.10pm and 5.10pm on Friday, a total of 61 people had walked on one carriageway of the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road (from the Israel Embassy towards south Delhi).On the other carriageway (from south Delhi towards the embassy), 121 people had trudged during the same time. Police suspect any one of these 182 people may have dropped an explosive device below a tree on the APJ Abdul Kalam Road outside the Israeli embassy.A “low intensity” blast was reported outside the embassy at 5.10pm, which damaged windowpanes of at least three vehicles parked nearby. There were no causalities.As part of their investigations into the “low-intensity explosion” outside the embassy on Friday evening, the Delhi police’s special cell has started tracing all the people who crossed the spot on the road where the explosive was placed. A government official, who did not wish to be named, said that police have narrowed down their search on all 182 people, whose images were acquired from CCTV cameras placed on the road by Delhi police and government. Police have also taken footage from bungalows near the Israel embassy. “We have already identified many of them. We will question everyone in the case,” said an officer.Watch: Elite NSG team at site near Israel embassy in Delhi amid 'terror' suspicionInvestigating officers believe that one of these pedestrians may have kept the explosive device under the tree, as no suspicious vehicle stopped at the spot or near it about an hour before the explosion happened at 5.10 pm.Meanwhile, a cab driver on Friday night approached police claiming that he had dropped two passengers near the embassy before the explosion. Police have said that they verified the cab driver’s claims but found it to be a hoax. The cab driver had reportedly told police that the two passengers had taken multiple rounds of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road before getting down near the embassy. “ It was a false alarm,” one police officer said.On Saturday afternoon, different teams of the crime branch and the NSG visited the spot to trace forensic samples of the explosive device used in the blast. Police have said that the blast was a low-intensity explosion and said that “initial impression suggested a mischievous attempt to create a sensation.”Police have found a cold drink can along with an envelope addressed to the ambassador. Investigating officers have found parts of a detonator that was attached to the can. Meanwhile, police are also collecting the dump cell phone data of people who were close to the crime spot at the time of the attack.“We are collecting dump data of active cell phones from the spot. We have already found more than 7000 cell phone actives near the spot. We are looking at SIM cards that were issued recently or those that are not from India and are registered in other countries,” one police officer said.Delhi police officers said that ammonium nitrate may have been used to trigger the blast. Police teams have collected steel ball bearing from the site.Forensic experts are yet to confirm the nature of the explosive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/israel-embassy-blast-probe-focuses-on-182-who-walked-blast-area-in-two-hours-101612031241168.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers start regrouping at Haryana-Rajasthan border||Farmers protesting at Shahjahanpur near Jaisinghpur Khera at the Haryana-Rajasthan border said that their counterparts from both the states are mobilising once again at the protest site, after many left for their home towns following the violence in Delhi.Farmers from Bhiwani, Jhajjar, Hanumangarh and Ganganagar are expected to reach the protest site at the border by Monday, protesters said. Protesting leaders said that Tikait’s speech had given a fresh lease of life to the movement that seemed to be flagging temporarily.Naveen Sohlot, a farmer from Bawal, who is camping at Shahjahanpur, said that around 200 farmers from Jaipur had reached the protest site on Saturday. “Protesters are joining the agitation once again. Today, around 200 people from Jaipur arrived here and took out a Tiranga yatra. The numbers of protesters here is steadily increasing,” said Sohlot.He said that Tikait’s emotional speech gave a fresh impetus to the ongoing agitation, especially among the Jat farmers of the state. “Protesters from Jaipur from the Jat community have also joined us. To a certain extent, the community is now against the government on this issue, following Tikait’s speech,” said Sohlot. He said that support from different places in Haryana was increasing and farmers on around 50 tractors from Bawal are set to join the agitation on Sunday.Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said, “Farmers have defeated the government’s plans of crushing the agitation taking place at Ghazipur under the leadership of Rakesh Tikait. They have decided that they will not give up or get up from the highway till the three laws are rolled back.”Harvinder Singh Gill, a farmer from Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan, said, “Farmers from Hanumangarh and Ganganagar have left their villages and should reach in a day or two,” said Gill.He said that while the situation was tense till January 27, things are improving for the better. “Post Republic Day, some people had raised slogans here. But everything is peaceful now. The movement will only gain strength now,” said Gill.Bharatiya Janata Party’s spokesperson for Haryana, Jawahar Yadav, said that if the numbers of protesters are increasing, it is likely due to the support of opposition parties. “Politicians from opposition parties are sharing the stage with Rakesh Tikait. It is becoming evident that these parties are backing the protests,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-start-regrouping-at-haryana-rajasthan-border-101612030762945.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP carries out demolition drive against illegal vends in Sushant Lok||Department of town and country planning(DTCP) has started demolition drives against illegal encroachments inside commercial markets in private colonies of the city. The department on Friday carried out a large-scale demolition drive in Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1 in which several vends, illegal boards and extensions were removed. The department said another such market on the western side of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway (old Gurgaon) will be chosen randomly for carrying out the next round of demolition drive.RS Bhath, district town planner, said several complaints were received from the residents of the area and shopkeepers, who said that large parts of the parking area and corridors in the Vyapar Kendra were encroached upon. This was not only blocking access but was also posing emergency hazard. “Based on the complaints, an inspection was conducted last week, during which it was observed that a number of illegal vends were operating and the walking area was blocked. As such, the enforcement team of DTCP cleared the encroachments,” he said.Bhath further said that commercial areas in private colonies are under the radar of the department and next on the agenda would be a market in Old Gurgaon. Markets in Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok, Sun City, DLF, Nirvana Country and all other private colonies would also be inspected and action would be taken. “We have also received complaints that several open spaces in Vyapar Kendra in Palam Vihar are encroached upon and vends are operating illegally. Also green belts have been usurped. Action would be initiated there as well,” he said.DTCP officials said that, apart from lodging complaints on the CM Window, the city residents can also approach them directly in case of such violations. “Action against illegal constructions has been taken regularly but the markets have recently come under scanner after multiple complaints have been received,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-carries-out-demolition-drive-against-illegal-vends-in-sushant-lok-101612030762350.html
31-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccination for front-line workers likely to start from February 4||Covid-19 vaccination for front-line workers, including police personnel and the workers of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), is likely to start from February 4 in the district, according to health department officials. It will be held simultaneously with the ongoing inoculation of healthcare workers. Officials said that for front-line workers, vaccination sessions will be set up at their offices or nearby sites for easy access.Front-line workers have been prioritised for Covid-19 vaccination as they are involved in providing essential services or are engaged in public health, sanitation and waste management services. The details of nearly 16,000 of such front-line workers have been uploaded on the Co-WIN platform by Saturday and their number is likely to increase.It comprises nearly 9,000 police staff, over 6,500 municipal workers and at least 450 employees of the revenue department from different blocks, according to official data. Among the municipal workers, there are sanitation staff members, waste collectors, operators, engineers of waste processing plants, vehicle drivers, water tanker operators and cremation ground staffers.“Covid-19 vaccination for front-line workers can start from February 4 in the state,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department. “The Central government on Friday also included employees of Panchayati Raj institutions in the front-line category. It includes gram sachivs and patwaris, among others, who have been directly involved in providing Covid-19 services. Their data collection has already started in the state.”On Friday, the Union ministry of health and family welfare wrote to all states, asking them to initiate simultaneous vaccination of front-line workers and healthcare workers from the first week of February.“The inoculation for these front-line workers will start either from February 4 (Thursday) or February 6 (Saturday),” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.As reported earlier, from Sunday till February 3, the health department has put Covid-19 vaccination on halt for holding the pulse polio drive. However, in the last 15 days, almost 60% (22,372) of the registered 37,000 healthcare workers have been covered through vaccination drives.On Saturday, Covid-19 vaccination took place at 28 sites with a target of inoculating at least 650 healthcare workers. Of these only 581 took the Covid-19 jab. The target included inoculation of 600 workers with Covishield, out of which at least 551 turned up for the vaccination, while for Covaxin, only 30 people took the jab out of the 50.In case of health workers, a majority of vaccination sessions have been conducted at private hospitals considering their high numbers. For front-line workers, the strategy is likely to be revised with more dependency on public sites.“For front-line workers, vaccination drive in government facilities will be conducted on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, as during the other days of the week, healthcare workers are involved in routine immunisation programme,” said Yadav, adding that vaccination sites can be set up within the premises of the government offices where the employees are currently working.“To achieve higher footfall, session sites have to be planned within the office premises or near to it. Even community centres, panchayat bhawans at the block level and urban primary health centres will be used as session sites. The strategy has to be finalised” said Yadav. Arora also said that just like polling booths vaccination sites can be set up at multiple locations to facilitate vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccination-for-front-line-workers-likely-to-start-from-february-4-101612030702830.html
31-01-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: To succeed one has to continue investing in oneself||I got a call from an acquaintance more than a year back. This was before Covid changed our lives. He said he had quit his job and was now going to pursue his passion, acting, full time. I was very happy for him! I believe that the artist community must support each other in whatever way possible and not pull each down. Even lending an ear goes a long way! He asked if I could help him out in anyway. Since I was not actively working on anything, I told him that I would direct all such work his way, which I felt was right for him. Just as luck would have it, I received a call from a friend who was working on something new and wanted fresh faces. I thought this was serendipity and immediately connected the two of them. Apart from that I had received some generic messages for auditions. I shared all of those too. A few days later I received a call from the friend again, asking for newer actors. I was suddenly reminded of that acquaintance and that I had connected the two of them. I enquired about him and was told that he was supposed to get back, but never did! Surprised, I called him up and asked him point-blank. His tone changed a little and he told me that he didn’t pursue it as the audition was in Mumbai! Now, don’t get me wrong. I fully understand that Mumbai can be daunting. I have been through it and so have lakhs of others. So, without passing any judgement, I simply asked him what his expectations from me were. He said he wanted something right here, in Pune! I was amused because I knew that he did not have any familial or financial obligations in Pune. To understand him and his thought process more, I enquired about all the things he was doing to make himself a better actor. It seems he didn’t understand that question. That is when I realized that I had wasted my time! I do not consider myself successful, but I do humbly accept that I have been offered work in the past few years. But that was after I generated work for myself which required a good many years! I had to generate work because I was aiming to be a director. Actors have to take a different approach. There will be a day when they will be noticed. For some it comes early. But till then one has to continue in investing in oneself! Reading, watching, networking, practising theatre exercises, keeping oneself healthy – physically and mentally. This person only wanted the results that followed after being a successful actor. He did not want to go through the process. I am not even sure if he wanted to act! He just wanted the money, fame and the perks that followed. He was no less than those people who go and stand behind a reporter just so they can be on TV! Well at least most of them don’t leave their jobs to do this. I told him all these things. I thought I was helping him by giving him a reality check. I guess he didn’t need it as he disconnected the call abruptly. I ran into him while grocery shopping a few days back. We exchanged hellos and spoke for a minute. While leaving he asked if I had any work for him. I just smiled and left.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-to-succeed-one-has-to-continue-investing-in-oneself-101612005020199.html

The police said the complainant has accused Tharoor, Sardesai and five other journalists of spreading “false and misleading information”.Earlier on Thursday, another case was registered against the same set of people in Noida. The allegations levelled were also identical, said the police.Karan Goel, assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that the police would probe the complaint that the suspects had spread fake news accusing the Delhi police of the murder of a person who was driving tractor during the riot in the Capital on Republic Day. “Gurugram Police has begun an investigation into the matter,” said Goel.On Tuesday, thousands of protesting farmers had clashed with the police during the tractor rally called by farmer unions to highlight their demand for repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws.A case under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (sedition), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505(2) (statements creating or promoting enmity) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the Cyber police station of Gurugram.“I filed a complaint with the Gururgam Police on Thursday and attached the social media posts from the suspects Twitter handles. I was deeply aggrieved by widespread riots on Republic Day in the national Capital,” said Singh. “I am a middle-class person with no political affiliation,” he further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fir-filed-against-shashi-tharoor-and-six-others-for-tweet-on-farmer-s-death-101611945557513.html

Instead of the 1,000 pounds ($1,370) aspiration, he raised around 33 million pounds ($45 million).Moore, who rose to the rank of captain while serving in India and Burma during the war, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July for his fundraising efforts.Best wishes came in from far and wide, including from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said in a tweet that Moore had "inspired the whole nation, and I know we are all wishing you a full recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/captain-tom-moore-hospitalized-after-testsitive-for-covid19-101612117179076.html

These actions serve no purpose besides hurting the Afghan people who - largely due to decades of conflict -suffer from food insecurity and significant economic and development challenges, further exacerbated by the ongoing pandemic."The intra-Afghan peace talks between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban had resumed earlier this month but no progress till now has been made.Instead, the Taliban's Doha-based leader embarked on a trip to Iran on Sunday for talks with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on the implementation of the Doha deal with the US, according to a report by Sputnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-nato-allies-slam-taliban-for-destroying-vital-infrastructure-in-afghanistan-101612116475236.html
31-01-2021||World||Biden asked to address human rights abuses in Pakistan's Sindh province||A Sindhi-American organisation has urged US President Joe Biden to address the human rights abuses of religious minorities and state-sponsored environmental disasters occurring in Pakistan's Sindh province.Munawar Laghari, executive director of Sindhi Foundation, in a letter to Biden, said instances of enforced disappearance, extrajudicial killing, and the forced conversion of religious minorities continue to rise each day.“We Sindhis want to bring in your attention to the serious human rights violations and state-sponsored environmental disasters taking place right now in Sindh at the cost of lives and livelihood of Sindhi people," he said in the letter.“To illustrate a recent retaliatory strike against those who dare to speak out, protestors participating in a long march for the recovery of missing persons were beaten upon their arrival at the Sindh-Punjab border.

31-01-2021||World||Washington DC statehood: US Democrats renew effort but how likely is it?||The movement for Washington DC’s statehood has gathered momentum after the January 6 Capitol riots when the White House took hours to mobilise National Guard. Earlier this week, a bill, with significant support from Democrats, was introduced in Senate to make District of Columbia the 51st state of the US.Delaware Senator Tom Carper, who introduced the bill with a record number of cosponsors, said in a statement that the lack of fair representation for DC residents is “inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded.” “It is therefore incumbent upon all of us who enjoy the right and the privilege of full voting rights and representation to take up the cause of our fellow citizens in the District of Columbia,” Carper added.Why residents want statehood?The supporters argue that DC has more residents than Vermont and Wyoming and comparable with several other states like Delaware and Alaska. DC residents pay more in total federal income tax than residents of 22 other states but have no say over how the tax amount is spent.While DC residents pay the highest per-capita federal income taxes in the United States, they elect a non-voting delegate to the US House of Representatives who can draft legislation but cannot vote. They also don’t have a voice in Senate committees or on the Senate floor, which means they have no say in the determination of federal agencies’ leadership.Of all the National Guard units, only DC doesn’t have control over its unit and is dependent on the White House. During the Capitol violence episode, police from neighbouring counties in Maryland and Virginia arrived even before the National Guard to take control of the situation. The statehood would give control to the local government.Read | Capitol Police tighten Congress security in era of rising threatsHow likely is the statehood?Most Republicans oppose statehood for DC since the district is heavily Democratic and admitting Washington as a state would automatically give two Senate seats to Democrats. Although the Democrats control the Senate with 50 seats, the legislation for DC’s statehood, like most legislation, requires 60 votes to end the debate and go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote. In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators need to be on board with the plan but at least two Democrats - Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema - have opposed the idea of ending the procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-statehood-us-democrats-renew-effort-but-how-likely-is-it-101612109821952.html

31-01-2021||World||Deal or no deal: Virus aid tests Biden 'work together' plea||He was an arm-draping pol as a senator. He hung out in the Senate cloakroom chatting up legislators as vice president. He pitched himself during the presidential campaign as someone who could “get people working together” and lower the temperature in a Washington overheated by Donald Trump.Now, after his first full week as president, Joe Biden is coming face to face with the potential limitations of his ability to work across the aisle as he pushes for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that is the first big test of his tenure.Republicans are balking at the price tag and Democrats are sending signals that they’re willing to push the bill through without GOP help as Biden’s campaign pitch to be a deal-maker appears to be giving way to the reality of a Senate that does not resemble the one he once inhabited.In a nod to reality, Biden told reporters on Friday: “I support passing Covid relief with support from Republicans if we can get it. But the Covid relief has to pass -- no ifs, ands or buts.”The White House has not given up hope of landing some GOP support for the package, and Biden’s call list bears that out. But some of Biden’s courtship is also directed at members of his own party to make sure a deal gets done.He has called Sen. Susan Collins of Maine several times since his inauguration, and the moderate Republican says she has a “closer relationship” with Biden than she did with Trump.Biden has made repeated calls to senators in his own party, including two centrists -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona -- who have expressed some concerns about the package, according to three people familiar with the calls who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private conversations.A retail politician who never misses a chance for small talk or schmooze, Biden has been penned in somewhat by the pandemic, which limits the face-to-face interactions on which he thrives. But there’s still his peerless phone book, built over four decades of dealing with senators on both sides of the political divide.“When he decides to make one of those calls, he doesn’t really require a call sheet, a sheet that tells him exactly what to say to a member of Congress and how to outline the bill,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in an interview on MSNBC. “He knows. He’s known a lot of these people for decades.”Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator from Missouri, says Biden is “workman-like in terms of his outreach and it was not unusual for me to run into Joe Biden in the Senate cloakroom when he was vice president” to Barack Obama.“He burned up the phone lines,” McCaskill said. “Obama was terrible at that part of the job, while Biden was good at it, to both parties.”Having spent 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president, Biden made bipartisan outreach a central promise, even when many in his party argued that Republicans no longer were interested in working across the aisle.Biden’s most notable deal-making success came in the Obama-era fiscal showdowns during the rise of the tea party Republicans. The landmark agreements locked in tax and spending cuts for a decade -- and soured some progressive Democrats on Biden’s brand of compromise.As vice president, Biden was a trusted emissary to Capitol Hill for Obama, who had served just four years in the Senate.Biden arrived as a presence in the halls of Congress at several critical junctures. He helped cut a 2010 deal to prevent the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts, then negotiated on the landmark Budget Control Act of 2011 that slashed spending and walked the country back from the 2012 “fiscal cliff” of looming tax increases and budget reductions.“Biden’s chief virtue as a negotiator is the understanding that ‘Look, you have politics on your side, I have politics on my side, we both have to live within our political constraints,’” said Rohit Kumar, former deputy chief of staff to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “His pitch: ‘I know there are certain things you can’t do and I am not going to make them deal breakers. We have to get a deal I can sell, a deal you can sell.’”As senator, Biden also prized his relationships with colleagues, even though his nightly commute home to Delaware cut into his ability to socialize with other lawmakers.“Well, I don’t want to ruin him, but he did work with us on occasion,” said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.Lott said Biden was not someone he recalls as often being in the room when Senate leadership was trying to work out a deal on major bills. But Lott pointed to two major instances when he was: the 1994 crime bill and the 2002 Iraq War resolution, a pair of measures for which Biden has since expressed regret.Still, Lott said Biden’s relationship with McConnell was real and could pay dividends again.“They worked out an agreement that basically is what they’ve been working off ever since,” Lott said. “Somebody in the media referred to Biden then as the McConnell whisperer.”Still, the Senate has changed markedly since Biden first joined decades ago, with different skills now in currency as senators gain status on social media, raise money beyond their home states and spend less time socializing with one another in Washington.Biden’s style of old-school, one-on-one cajoling may be less persuasive for senators from either party who cultivate their own brands and don’t necessarily rely on proximity to presidential power to raise their profiles.And, of course, policy matters. The parties are more split than ever over the legislative remedies for the nation, a partisan divide that political scientists see as on par with the rifts of the Civil War era.Biden aides worry that Republicans will continue to balk no matter how many personal phone calls they get from the president or post-pandemic invitations they receive to high-profile events at the White House.Their boss may be the last one to buy in to that.“There’s people who say you can’t work with the other side,” Biden said a year ago. “And if that’s the case, prepare your children for a totally different U.S., a totally different world. I don’t believe it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deal-or-no-deal-virus-aid-tests-biden-work-together-plea-101612097462987.html

31-01-2021||World||Moderate US Republican senators urge Biden to compromise on Covid-19 plan||A group of 10 moderate Republican US senators urged Democratic President Joe Biden on Sunday to reconsider his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, saying they wanted a meeting to discuss a compromise that they said could win swift bipartisan support.In a letter to Biden, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and seven other senators said they would unveil on Monday their proposed legislation to address the coronavirus crisis.The progress of Biden's package to support individuals and businesses will be an early test of the new US president's promise to work across the political divide.Some Republicans, who have lost control of the Senate, have questioned the cost, while others urged more targeted measures."Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support," the group wrote in the letter, whose signatories also included Bill Cassidy, Shelley Moore Capito, Todd Young, Jerry Moran, Michal Rounds.Rob Portman, who has announced he will not seek re-election in 2022, also signed the letter, which said the group wished to "work in good faith" with the new administration.While offering few specifics, they said their plan echoed Biden's call for more funding to boost vaccines and testing as well as support for schools and child care centers, but said their plan would include more targeted assistance for families in need and additional funds for small businesses.They did not give an overall cost for compromised bill, but said money from previous Covid-19 relief bill passed last year remained unspent.Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, told CNN's State of the Union programme that the White House had seen the letter and would review it.Congress, controlled by Democrats, is set to move this week on Biden's plan to deliver a fresh infusion of Covid-19 relief to Americans and businesses reeling from the pandemic, which has killed more than 430,000 people in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-us-republican-senators-urge-biden-to-compromise-on-covid-19-plan-101612103184393.html
31-01-2021||World||Foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond May deadline: NATO officials||International troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline envisaged by the insurgent Taliban's deal with the United States, four senior NATO officials said, a move that could escalate tensions with the Taliban demanding full withdrawal."There will be no full withdrawal by allies by April-end," one of the officials told Reuters."Conditions have not been met," he said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. "And with the new US administration, there will be tweaks in the policy, the sense of hasty withdrawal which was prevalent will be addressed and we could see a much more calculated exit strategy."The administration of then-President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban early last year calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops by May in return for the insurgents fulfilling certain security guarantees.Trump hailed the accord - which did not include the Afghan government - as the end of two decades of war. He reduced U.S. troops to 2,500 by this month, the fewest since 2001.Plans on what will happen after April are now being considered and likely to be a top issue at a key NATO meeting in February, the NATO sources said.The positions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are becoming increasingly important after the alliance was sidelined by Trump, diplomats and experts say.Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in September in Doha, but violence has remained high."No NATO ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary, but we have been clear that our presence remains conditions-based," said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu.No NATO decision has been made, she said, adding that a February meeting NATO defence ministers meeting could not be preempted. "Allies continue to assess the overall situation and to consult on the way forward."NATO continues to call on all sides to "seize this historic opportunity for peace," Lungescu said."NATO fully supports the Afghanistan peace process in order to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists that would attack our homelands," she said.Around 10,000 troops, including Americans, are in Afghanistan, Lungescu said.The NATO source said troop levels are expected to stay roughly the same until after May, but the plan beyond that is not clear.Kabul and some foreign governments and agencies say the Taliban has failed to meet conditions due to escalated violence and a failure to cut ties with militant groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Taliban denies.The administration of Joe Biden, who replaced Trump on Jan. 20, has launched a review of his predecessor's peace agreement.A Pentagon spokesman said the Taliban have not met their commitments but Washington remained committed to the process and had not decided on future troop levels.A State Department representative said Biden was committed to bringing a "responsible end to the 'forever wars'... while also protecting Americans from terrorist and other threats."Afghanistan's presidential palace did not respond to a request for comment.Rising concernThe Taliban have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility that Washington might change aspects of the agreement and keep troops in the country beyond May, two Taliban sources told Reuters."We conveyed our apprehensions, but they assured us of honouring and acting on the Doha accord. What's going on, on the ground in Afghanistan, is showing something else. And that's why we decided to send our delegations to take our allies into confidence," said a Taliban leader in Doha.A Taliban delegation this week visited Iran and Russia, and the leader said they were contacting China.Although informal meetings have been taking place between negotiators in Doha, progress has stalled in recent weeks after an almost one-month break, according to negotiators and diplomats.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters the insurgents remained committed to the peace process."No doubt that if the Doha deal is not implemented there will be consequences, and the blame will be upon that side which does not honour the deal," he said. "Our expectations are also that NATO will think to end this war and avoid more excuses for prolonging the war in Afghanistan."NATO and Washington will have a challenge getting the Taliban to agree to an extension beyond May.If the situation remains unclear, the Taliban may increase attacks, possibly once again on international forces, said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the British think tank ODI.The lack of a resolution "gives voice to spoilers inside the Taliban who never believed the US would leave willingly, and who have pushed for a ratcheting up of attacks even after the US-Taliban deal was agreed," she said.A Feb. 17-18 meeting of NATO defence ministers will be a chance for a newly empowered NATO to determine how the process would be shaped, said one source, a senior European diplomat."With the new administration coming in there will be a more cooperative result, NATO countries will have a say."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-troops-to-stay-in-afghanistan-beyond-may-deadline-nato-officials-101612100124055.html

He has been at the forefront of the anti-corruption struggle in Russia and has organised several demonstrations in the past against President Vladimir Putin and his political allies.During a phone call earlier this week, US President Joe Biden called on his Russian counterpart to release Navalny.

31-01-2021||World||Afghan negotiating team warns Taliban to resume talks||A member of the Afghan government's peace negotiating team on Sunday warned the Taliban that if they don't resume peace talks in Qatar soon, the government could recall the team before a deal is reached.Government negotiator Rasul Talib said in a news conference the team is waiting for the return of the Taliban leadership to Doha, where a second round of peace talks began this month but have made little progress.He asked the Taliban to "stop spreading baseless remarks" and return to the negotiating table, adding "The Taliban does not have the guts for peace, they are spreading nonsense around."There was no immediate response from the Taliban.Talib's comments came as the Taliban leadership has recently been in Iran and Russia for discussions on the negotiations, and as President Joe Biden's new administration has said it plans to review the peace agreement signed last February between the US and the Taliban.The Pentagon said last week that the Taliban's refusal to meet commitments to reduce violence in Afghanistan is raising questions about whether all US troops will be able to leave by May as required under the peace deal.Following discussions in Moscow on Friday, the head of the Taliban delegation, Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanikzai, said the group expects the US to fulfill its pledge to withdraw all of its troops from Afghanistan by May.The US Pentagon announced in mid-January that the US military has met its goal of reducing the number of troops in Afghanistan to about 2,500.Stanikzai has also demanded the resignation of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, calling his administration an obstacle to peace, and a spike in violence has decreased optimism among Afghans the peace process will work.Meanwhile, the Afghan peace negotiating team praised President Biden's administration for its decision to review the US-Taliban peace deal, saying the deal favours the Taliban.Talib asked the new US administration to withdraw its forces in a way that will prevent a security vacuum in the country and prevent the possibility of more militant attacks in Afghanistan and against the US and other countries.The Taliban on Sunday mistakenly fired two mortars in northern Faryab province killing two civilians and wounding 14 others, said the provincial police spokesman, Karim Yuresh. He said Afghan security checkpoints were targeted but the shells missed the checkpoints and hit the civilians.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the group fired mortars toward civilians and accused Afghan forces of firing the mortars and causing the casualties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-negotiating-team-warns-taliban-to-resume-talks-101612097333706.html

Israel says that under interim peace agreements reached in the 1990s it is not responsible for the Palestinians and in any case has not received requests for help.Gantz's office said early Sunday the transfer had been approved. It had no further details on when that would happen. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials.Also read| Why is India called the world’s pharmacy?

31-01-2021||World||WHO team visits Wuhan's Huanan food market, likely origin of Covid-19||WHO experts on Sunday visited the market in central China linked to the first known Covid-19 cluster, seeking clues about the beginning of the pandemic as a number of nations further tightened restrictions to stop the coronavirus.France on Sunday closed its borders to non-European countries except for essential travel, a day after Germany imposed a ban on most travellers from nations hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants.And authorities in Australia imposed a snap five-day lockdown in Perth after the detection of a single case in the city of roughly two million people.The emergence of the new variants has further complicated the fight against the coronavirus, which first emerged in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan before unleashing death and economic devastation around the world.A World Health Organization team visited the Huanan food market in Wuhan on Sunday as part of its fieldwork in a politically sensitive mission to investigate the origins of the pandemic.Their visit is being tightly controlled, and the WHO has already downplayed expectations of finding the source of the virus, which is known to have infected more than 102 million people so far with over 2.2 million deaths.The experts did not take any questions from journalists as they visited the market.In recent days, Chinese authorities have relentlessly pushed a positive narrative of heroism and decisive, swift action against the virus.But it has faced criticism at home and abroad for how it handled the initial Wuhan outbreak and its lack of transparency.- More restrictions -With mass vaccination programmes still in their infancy and struggling with supply, unpopular restrictions on business, movement and travel remain among the few options available to governments in their fight against the virus.On Sunday, France closed its borders to all non-EU travellers except those on essential trips, and closed big shopping centres, except those selling food; whilst Portuguese citizens will not be able to travel abroad except in "special cases" for two weeks.The day before, Germany barred most travellers from countries battling the new virus variants that are believed to be more contagious. The decision impacts people from Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini.Even nations that have largely brought their outbreaks under control are wary of a resurgence. The lockdown in Perth, Australia, was ordered after a security guard at a quarantine hotel tested positive."Our model is to deal with it very, very quickly and harshly," said Western Australia premier Mark McGowan.Canada announced that arriving passengers will have to quarantine in hotels at their own expense, with airlines suspending flights to southern destinations.And in the United States, the hardest-hit nation in the world, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a sweeping order requiring people to wear masks on virtually every form of public transportation.Despite the number of infections and deaths remaining high, the outbreak in the United States appears to be easing, with new cases and hospitalisations down two weeks in a row.Experts say that is down to better adherence to mask wearing and social distancing, as well as the end of the holiday season.But another factor identified by some experts is that -- at least in some areas of the country -- the virus has already burned through much of the population and is running out of targets.- 'If we don't have oxygen, our family dies' -The recently launched vaccination drives in many countries are stumbling because of supply shortages, which have also sparked a bitter diplomatic row between the EU and Britain.Both are tussling over the AstraZeneca-Oxford shots, with the firm saying there are not enough to go around because of production issues. Germany has threatened legal action against companies that do not deliver the doses they promised.In less privileged parts of the world that have yet to launch vaccinations at that scale, people are struggling to find resources that could mean life or death for them or their loved ones.In Peru, where health services are on the edge of collapse and short on resources, some have been forced to sleep on the streets of the capital Lima as they wait to refill oxygen tanks for their loved ones fighting Covid-19 in the hospital."We need (oxygen) for our family to live," said 46-year-old Yulitza Torres, a transport worker."If we don't have oxygen, our family dies."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-china-who-team-visits-wuhan-s-huanan-food-market-likely-origin-of-covid19-101612088553339.html
31-01-2021||World||Russia arrests over 1,000 people demanding Navalny's release||Thousands of people took to the streets Sunday across Russia's vast expanse to demand the release of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, keeping up a wave of nationwide protests that have rattled the Kremlin. Over 1,000 were detained by police, according to a monitoring group.Russian authorities have mounted a massive effort to stem the tide of demonstrations after tens of thousands of people rallied across the country last weekend in the largest and most widespread show of discontent Russia has seen in years.The 44-year-old Navalny, an anti-corruption investigator who is the best-known critic of President Vladimir Putin, was arrested on Jan. 17 upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusations.On Sunday, police detained more than 1,000 people in protests held in cities across Russia's 11 time zones, according to the OVD-Info, a group that monitors arrests.In Moscow, authorities introduced unprecedented security measures in the city center, closing subway stations near the Kremlin, cutting bus traffic and ordering restaurants and stores to stay closed.Navalny's team initially called for Sunday's protest to be held on Moscow's Lubyanka Square, home to the main headquarters of the Federal Security Service, which Navalny claims was responsible for his poisoning. After police cordoned off the area around the square, the protest shifted to another central square a mile away. Police deployed in force at that location too, randomly picking up people and putting them into police buses. At least 100 were detained.But hundreds of others marched across the city center, chanting “Putin, resign!” and Putin, thief!" a reference to an opulent Black Sea estate reportedly built for the Russian leader that was featured in a widely popular video released by Navalny's team.The city of Novosibirsk in eastern Siberia saw one of the biggest rallies, with thousands marching across the city. About 90 protesters were detained.In the far eastern port of Vladivostok, more than 100 people were detained after protesters danced on the ice and rallied in the city center.As part of a multipronged effort by authorities to block the protests, courts have jailed Navalny's associates and activists across the country over the past week. His brother Oleg, top aide Lyubov Sobol and three other people were put Friday under a two-month house arrest on charges of allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions during last weekend's protests.Prosecutors also demanded that social media platforms block calls to join the protests.The Interior Ministry has issued stern warnings to the public not to join the protests, saying participants could be charged with taking part in mass riots, which carries a prison sentence of up to eight years. Those engaging in violence against police could face up to 15 years.Nearly 4,000 people were reportedly detained at demonstrations on Jan. 23 calling for Navalny's release took place in more than 100 Russian cities, and some were given fines and jail terms. About 20 were accused of assaulting police and faced criminal charges.Just after Navalny's arrest, his team released a two-hour video on his YouTube channel about the Black Sea residence purportedly built for Putin. The video has been viewed over 100 million times, helping fuel discontent and inspiring a stream of sarcastic jokes on the internet amid an economic downturn.Demonstrators in Moscow chanted “Aqua discotheque!,” a reference to one of the fancy amenities at the residence that also features a casino and a hookah lounge equipped for watching pole dances.Putin says that neither he nor any of his close relatives own the property. On Saturday, construction magnate Arkady Rotenberg, a longtime Putin confidant and his occasional judo sparring partner, claimed that he himself owned the property.Russia has seen extensive corruption during Putin's time in office even as many ordinary citizens struggle financially.Navalny fell into a coma on Aug. 20 while on a domestic flight from Siberia to Moscow. He was transferred to a Berlin hospital two days later. Labs in Germany, France and Sweden, and tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, established that he was exposed to the Novichok nerve agent. Russian authorities have refused to open a full-fledged criminal inquiry, claiming a lack of evidence that he was poisoned.When he returned to Russia in January, Navalny was jailed for 30 days after Russia's prison service alleged he had violated the probation terms of his suspended sentence from a 2014 money-laundering conviction that he has rejected as political revenge.On Thursday, a Moscow court rejected Navalny's appeal to be released, and another hearing next week could turn his 3 1/2-year suspended sentence into one he must serve in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-arrests-over-1-000-people-demanding-navalny-s-release-101612091545015.html

However, that is a complicated story. He (Osama) used to extend financial assistance [to Nawaz Sharif]," Express Tribune quoted her as saying.Abida, also an ex-cabinet member of Nawaz Sharif's government, recalled that at one-time bin Laden was popular and liked by everyone including the Americans but at a later stage, he was treated as a 'stranger'.Her remarks come days after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's Member of National Assembly Farrukh Habib alleged that Nawaz Sharif had laid the foundation of foreign funding in the country and took USD 10 million from Osama bin Laden to bring a no-confidence motion for overthrowing Benazir Bhutto's government.Nawaz Sharif, who has been the prime minister of Pakistan for three non-consecutive terms, has been accused, time and again, of taking money from slain terrorist Osama bin Laden in order to promote and fund jihad in Kashmir. He served as prime minister from 1990-93, 1997-98, and 2013-17.Sharif, the 70-year-old supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) who was ousted from power in 2017 by the Supreme Court on corruption charges, is in London for medical treatment.Osama was killed in a midnight raid by the US Navy SEALs in Pakistan's garrison town of Abbottabad in 2011.Pakistan had officially denied having any knowledge of the terror chief until he was shot dead in a raid by US forces. Pakistan has been accused of using its soil to perpetrate terror in neighbouring countries.In 2016, a book was released accusing Nawaz Sharif of taking money from former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden.The book, Khalid Khawaja: Shaheed-i-Aman, is authored by Shamama Khalid, the wife of former ISI operative Khalid Khawaja."Chief of PML-N Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif received funding from Osama Bin Laden, founder of Al-Qaeda, to contest elections against Benazir Bhutto-led Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after the end of Zia regime," the book states.But even though Osama funded Sharif heavily, the latter backtracked from all his promises after coming into power, the Dawn had reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/osama-bin-laden-supported-funded-nawaz-sharif-ex-pak-envoy-abida-hussain-101612091891895.html
31-01-2021||World||Trump left with no legal representation ahead of impeachment trial. Here’s why||Former US president Donald Trump is left with no legal representation ahead of his second impeachment trial in Senate after five defence attorneys reportedly parted ways with the Republican leader. Butch Bowers and Deborah Barberi, the two lead attorneys working on Trump’s defence, abruptly left due to differences over strategy, reported news agency Reuters.Johnny Gasser and Greg Harris from South Carolina are no longer part of the defence team and Josh Howard, who was recently added to the team, has also left. The Senate trial is scheduled to begin on February 9 and no attorneys have announced that they are working on the case. According to a CNN report, the attorneys were neither paid any fees in advance nor a letter of intent was ever signed.Why the lead lawyers left?Reports quoting people familiar with the situation claim that the South Carolina attorneys and Trump mutually decided to part ways after their differences over defence strategy ahead of the trial. Trump was reportedly still contending that he was a victim of massive electoral fraud. He wanted the lawyers to argue that the election was stolen from him and not on the legality of convicting a president after he has left the office, an argument several Republican lawmakers have made in defence of Trump.Read | Explained: How Trump’s 2nd impeachment trial could be different from 1stPat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, Trump’s White House lawyers at the first impeachment trial, are not expected to take part in the proceedings. It is unclear who would represent the former president at the Senate trial even though a majority of Republican leaders have argued against the impeachment, making Trump’s conviction unlikely. The Senate will also enter into uncharted constitutional waters when the trial begins since no president in the history of the United States have faced trial after leaving the office.In the aftermath of Capitol riots, Democrats-controlled House of Representatives, with support of 10 Republicans, impeached Trump on the charge of “Incitement of Insurrection”. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has argued that this impeachment trial will be different from last time since the whole world witnessed “president's incitement and the violence that was used”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-left-with-no-legal-representation-ahead-of-impeachment-trial-here-s-why-101612089481753.html
31-01-2021||World||Perth in lockdown, ending Australia's two-week run without Covid-19||The Australian city of Perth was ordered into lockdown on Sunday after a security guard working in hotel quarantine tested positive for Covid-19, ending the country's longest coronavirus-free run.From Sunday evening until Friday, people in the city of 2 million must stay home, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise, with visits to hospitals and nursing homes banned, said Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan.Australia's fourth-most populous city had recorded no cases of the virus for 10 months, and Australia just hours earlier had announced 14 days without a locally acquired infection.Restaurants, cafes and cinemas were ordered shut in Perth and surrounding areas were ordered shut, while a scheduled return from summer school holidays was extended by a week, after the security guard returned a positive test late on Saturday, McGowan said.The vast, largely isolated state has been known in Australia for a hardline Covid-19 response that included keeping its border closed to the rest of the country until recently when it reopened to some regions."I know for many Western Australians this is going to come as a shock," McGowan told a hastily scheduled news conference. "We cannot forget how quickly this virus can spread, nor the devastation it can cause."The security guard, aged in his 20s, was working at a hotel where four people in quarantine had active cases of the virus, including with highly contagious strains that have been linked to Britain and South Africa, the health authorities said.The man had a second job with an unspecified ride-sharing company but had not worked his driving job since reporting symptoms on Thursday. Other people in the man's household had tested negative but were put in isolation and were expected to test positive in the coming days, they said.The lockdown affected four-fifths of the population of Australia's geographically biggest state, and the rest were asked not to travel. People from other states, only some of whom were recently allowed back into the state, were again asked to stay away.The police would set up road checkpoints to question people's movements, Police Commissioner Chris Dawson told reporters, adding that the police would also enforce a new rule requiring people to wear masks in public indoor spaces and on public transport.Australia has had its borders closed since March to slow the spread of the illness that has infected 29,000 in the country and killed 909.State governments have closed internal borders for the first time in a century, an effort to keep the virus out that has at times resulted in terse exchanges between state leaders over disagreements about people's ability to move around the country.Earlier on Sunday, Australia reopened its "travel bubble" with New Zealand, meaning travellers from New Zealand are exempt from 14-day hotel quarantine, after the neighbouring country reported no new locally acquired Covid-19 cases.New Zealand has, however, kept its border closed to Australia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perth-in-lockdown-ending-australia-s-two-week-run-without-covid19-101612083660854.html

There were no incidents of violence.___SANTA FE, N.M. — New Mexico reported 752 additional known Covid-19 cases and 17 deaths on Saturday, increasing the state’s pandemic totals to 173,539 cases and 3,265 deaths.The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.The counties with the most additional cases were Bernalillo (255), Sandoval (70), Dona Ana (70), McKinley (54), San Juan (41) and Santa Fe (32).The number of infections is thought to be far higher than reported because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.New Mexico’s seven-day rolling average of daily new cases dropped in the past two weeks while the rolling average of daily deaths was nearly flat.Santa Fe’s school superintendent announced Saturday that schools will reopen in a voluntary hybrid model on Feb. 22, two weeks after when state officials have said New Mexico school districts and charter schools can reopen.The Feb. 22 date provides time to inspect schools and for teachers to set up their classrooms while giving families and staff at least two weeks notice Superintendent Veronica García said.___HAVANA -- Cuban authorities say they will tighten measures against the spread of COVID-19 to require tourists and other visitors to isolate at their own expense for several days until tests for the new coronavirus come out negative.The announcement Saturday by Dr. Francisco Durán, Cuba’s director of epidemiology, came as the country announced 910 new infections of the new virus detected Friday, as well as three additional deaths.Duran said that as of Feb. 6, arriving tourists and Cubans who live abroad will be sent to hotels at their own expense to wait for the results of a PCR test for the new coronavirus, which will be given on their fifth day in the country. A similar measure was imposed in the spring, and apparently helped stem the spread of the virus.Cubans returning home from abroad will be housed in other centers at government expense to await test results.Diplomats and some categories of foreign businesspeople will be allowed to isolate at home.Cube has recorded 25,674 infections with the new coronavirus and 213 deaths since March.Cuba had eased restrictions in November, opening airports to tourists and others, but the number of infections detected has risen sharply this month.___BALTIMORE — Baltimore public health officials are canceling some COVID-19 vaccination appointments scheduled for next week after overbooking hundreds of first-dose appointments.The city health department did not specify how many appointments would be canceled, or why the overbooking happened, The Baltimore Sun reported.The department issued a statement saying it was working to identify potential issues in the state’s scheduling system, and the possibility that links to second-dose appointments were shared via email or social media.“We are working to confirm that this situation will not occur moving forward,” the statement read.Officials said they are prioritizing giving second doses to people who have already gotten their first shot because of limited inventory.Meanwhile, Maryland Gov.

Blinken, on Friday spoke with Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, pressing his "concern about the potential release of these prisoners", a spokesman for the US Department of State said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-s-family-to-challenge-pakistan-murder-acquittals-101612081353207.html
31-01-2021||World||Pfizer or Sputnik? Race to inject against Covid prompts calls for choice||Few people care who made their flu shot or their childhood immunizations against a range of deadly diseases. Covid changed that, turning vaccine makers into household names and prompting calls for choice.Doses remain scarce for now, amid a global scramble inflamed by a dispute between the European Union and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc. Most of the more than 90 million people who’ve gotten a shot consider themselves lucky for any protection against the pandemic. But vaccines are proliferating, with positive trial data from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc. placing their candidates next in line for approval.Health officials will have to figure out how to allocate all these different vaccines. Many people who’ve been boning up on efficacy rates, dosing schedules or side effects want to decide for themselves. If the options are a shot from a Western drugmaker that’s been vetted by an independent regulator or one from a Russian or Chinese lab with lesser transparency, that desire is even greater.“We demand the government to provide people the freedom of choice,” said Gergely Arato, a member of the opposition Democratic Coalition party in Hungary.Hungary broke ranks with other EU members to approve Russia’s Sputnik V and a vaccine from China’s Sinopharm Group Ltd. alongside the three shots cleared by Europe’s drug regulator -- from Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca. While Prime Minister Viktor Orban is technically offering choice, his promotion of the Chinese and Russian shots is endangering people’s “willingness to get vaccinated,” Arato said at a press conference this month.In the U.S., where the only two shots authorized so far -- from Pfizer and Moderna -- use similar technology and demonstrated virtually identical test results, choice may matter less for now. Elsewhere, however, some health authorities have begun catering to people’s concerns about vaccine differences.Dubai, Hong KongIn Dubai, residents older than 60 or with pre-existing conditions can access the shot Pfizer developed with BioNTech SE, or the one from Sinopharm.In Hong Kong, officials ordered enough doses of vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and AstraZeneca -- along with plans to secure a fourth option -- to cover the 7.5 million residents.The Pfizer shot will be available at community vaccination centers, with the Sinovac and Astra options offered at private hospitals and clinics, and people will be given the choice of which they want to receive. That’s important in Hong Kong, where some people are wary of taking a Chinese-made vaccine.“If residents don’t want to take a certain vaccine, they can choose to get the shots at another time and another location,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in December.Supplies are so tight in most of the world that choice remains impossible. Those getting shots often have no idea which one they’ll receive until they walk through the door of a vaccination center or doctor’s office. But that could change if vaccines from the likes of J&J, Novavax and CureVac NV come on stream in the coming weeks, and as pharma giants like Sanofi and Novartis AG lend their heft to the production effort.EU ApprovalEven if they don’t offer choice, health officials have to decide who gets what. At the Cleveland Clinic, Cassandra Calabrese has been telling patients to take whatever vaccine they get offered, even though some have been asking her which one she’d recommend. “Things may be different as more are approved,” she said in an email.The European Union, criticized for its slow rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, expanded its offerings Friday by approving AstraZeneca’s shot. In a sign of the growing tide of people wanting to choose, the approval came after days of pitched debate about the shot’s efficacy, with Germany’s immunization commission recommending against its use in seniors.In the U.K., where infections and fatalities are much higher than in Hong Kong, health authorities are prioritizing the quick inoculation of as many people as possible. The second dose of two-shot vaccines is being delayed in an effort to get first injections into as many arms as possible. Other countries are considering similar steps.Distribution is based on “supply and logistics, such as availability of very cold freezers,” a U.K. Department of Health spokesman said by email. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots must be kept frozen for long-term storage, while refrigeration suffices for the AstraZeneca vaccine.Efficacy RatesAlthough the U.K. has set a priority list for vaccine recipients -- starting with the oldest, most vulnerable people -- it doesn’t allocate the different shots based on a person’s profile, the agency added. So one 80-year-old patient might receive the AstraZeneca shot while someone else with the same age and health conditions might get the Pfizer one. Some Britons are expressing a preference on the grounds of patriotism rather than what they might have read about different efficacy rates or side effects. Never mind that the U.S. company’s vaccine was 95% effective in large trials, compared with an average of 70% for AstraZeneca’s shot. “They’re saying they want to wait for the British one,” Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said in a phone interview. “I think that it’s purely a nationalistic viewpoint.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-or-sputnik-race-to-inject-against-covid-prompts-calls-for-choice-101612080992711.html
31-01-2021||World||Navalny, WHO and Thunberg among nominees for Nobel Peace Prize||Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the World Health Organization and climate campaigner Greta Thunberg are among those nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, all backed by Norwegian lawmakers who have a track record of picking the winner.Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, are eligible to propose candidates. Nominations, which close on Sunday, do not imply an endorsement from the Nobel committee.Norwegian lawmakers have nominated the eventual laureate every year since 2014, with the exception of 2019, said Henrik Urdal, Director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo. "The pattern from recent years is quite stunning."The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.But nominators can choose to reveal their picks.According to a Reuters survey of Norwegian lawmakers, nominees include Thunberg, Navalny, the WHO and its COVAX programme to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poor countries.Thunberg was named as one of "the foremost spokespeople in the fight against the climate crisis", with the campaigning group she co-founded, Fridays for Future, also receiving a nod.Navalny, nominated by Russian academics, was named for his "efforts for a peaceful democratisation of Russia" by Norwegian former minister Ola Elvestuen.The battle against Covid-19 is front and centre, including a nomination for the GAVI vaccine alliance.Other names are Belarusian activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo for their "fight for a fair election and inspiration for peaceful resistance", one nominator, Geir Sigbjoern Toskedal, said.Another, Jette Christensen, also named the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, and IUSTITIA, a group of Polish judges defending civil rights."My nomination this year is ... for the fight to preserve democracy as a form of government in Europe," Christensen said.Freedom of information is a recurring theme with nominees including the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists; former Charlie Hebdo journalist Zineb el Rhazoui; news website Hong Kong Free Press, the U.S.-based International Fact-Checking Network and Paris-based Reporters without Borders (RSF).Other nominees include former U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO and the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).Also on the list is Aminatou Haidar, for her peaceful campaigning towards an independent Western Sahara, the International Space Station and the International Scout Movement.The 2021 laureate will be announced in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalny-who-and-thunberg-among-nominees-for-nobel-peace-prize-101612080429299.html
31-01-2021||World||Russians join protests against jailing of Kremlin critic Navalny despite crackdown||Supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny took to the streets in Siberia and the Russian Far East on Sunday for a second straight weekend despite a sweeping crackdown on his allies and warnings from the police.Rallies are also planned in Moscow later on Sunday, part of a campaign to win the release of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent. He was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer.Police have said the protests have not been authorised and will be broken up as they were last weekend. OVD-Info, a protest monitoring group, said that more than 4,000 people were detained at the rallies last week.In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, where a rally began at 0200 GMT, police prevented protesters from accessing the centre, forcing them to relocate to the waterfront and the frozen waters of the Amur Bay.Video footage showed protesters chanting "Putin is a thief" as they linked hands and marched on the ice in temperatures of around -13 degrees Celsius (8.6 degrees Fahrenheit).In Tomsk, the Siberian city that Navalny visited before suddenly collapsing on a domestic flight last August, demonstrators gathered in front of a concert hall and chanted "Let him go!" and held up Russian flags.OVD-Info said police had detained 145 people, including 76 in Vladivostok, since the rallies began.Navalny's supporters in Moscow plan to gather at 0900 GMT near the Kremlin administration and the headquarters of the FSB, the KGB's successor, where protesters in 1991 famously pulled down a statue of the secret police's founder during the Soviet breakup.Authorities have closed seven metro stations in the Russian capital and have said they will restrict pedestrian movement in the area due to the protest plans. There was a heavy police presence in central Moscow early on Sunday.Navalny, a 44-year-old opposition politician, accuses Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.He is accused of parole violations which he says are trumped up. A court is due to meet next week to consider handing him a jail term of up to three and a half years.The protests following Navalny's dramatic return to Moscow despite the threat of arrest put Putin in a quandary over how to respond. Polls show pent-up frustrations among Russians over years of falling wages and fallout from the pandemic.The West has told Moscow to let Navalny go and his allies have appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to sanction 35 people who they say are Putin's close allies.To galvanise support at home in an online video viewed over 100 million times, Navalny has accused Putin of being the ultimate owner of a sumptuous Black Sea palace, something the Kremlin leader has denied.On the eve of the protests, Arkady Rotenberg, a businessman and Putin's former judo sparring partner, said he owns the property.Many of Navalny's prominent allies were targeted in a crackdown this week. Several, including his brother Oleg, are under house arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-join-protests-against-jailing-of-kremlin-critic-navalny-despite-crackdown-101612079625598.html

Meanwhile, it has substantially increased the wealth of billionaires."- Lots to celebrate -Philanthropy activists say Scott's actions are likely to make other billionaires -- including her ex-husband -- take notice."There is a ton to celebrate about her philanthropy," said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which provides research data to foundations and other charitable donors."I would hope that the sheer amount of money she is getting out the door and her intention to continue to do so is a kick in the pants to all those sitting on tremendous wealth at time of unbelievable challenge and need."Scott, whose Amazon stake acquired in her divorce settlement is estimated at some $58 billion, pledged to give away the majority of her wealth to fight social inequity.She announced grants of some $1.7 billion last July and another $4.2 billion in December.She enlisted a team of advisors to help identify organizations to aid those suffering from the economic toll of the pandemic, focusing on those working to combat hunger, poverty and racial inequity.While her ex-husband Bezos has donated $10 billion to fight climate change -- the largest charitable gift of 2020 -- and additional amounts to other causes, his giving has been slower and proportionately smaller, given that his fortune is worth more than three times hers.The former couple could offer a major boost to philanthropy in the US, which represented some $450 billion in donations from Americans in 2019.- Speed and scale -Benjamin Soskis, senior research associate at the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, said Scott's actions are remarkable not only for their scale but the speed in delivering the funds."The pandemic has amplified an imperative in getting money out the door as fast as possible," Soskis said.Additionally, Scott has broken with much of philanthropic tradition by eliminating onerous restrictions and limits, which can complicate matters for organizations scrambling to cope with the pandemic."She has emphasized giving money and getting out of the way," Soskis said."Philanthropists often see themselves as part of the process, with multiple checks and evaluations and metrics which can be really burdensome."One potential critique of Scott's approach is her "opaque" process in which she has selected grant recipients, Soskis said."She is operating in a realm of absolute discretion that is not accountable to anyone," he said.Still, Soskis said her actions set an important precedent which could be a positive force for philanthropy."We shouldn't underestimate the role MacKenzie Scott plays in establishing a new norm for philanthropic giving," Soskis said."Any major philanthropist has to confront the example that she has set."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mackenzie-scott-shakes-up-philanthropy-with-amazon-billions-101612077931697.html
31-01-2021||World||WHO probe team visits Wuhan market at heart of first virus outbreak||A team of WHO experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 visited a market in Wuhan on Sunday where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged over a year ago.Members of the group arrived at Huanan seafood market -- which has been sealed since January last year -- driving into its barricaded premises as guards quickly blocked others from entering, according to AFP journalists at the scene.The mission, delayed by China and weighed down by political baggage, has a remit to explore how the virus jumped from animal to human.But with the fieldwork element of a trip in its early stages, World Health Organization officials have already downplayed expectations of finding the source of a virus which has killed more than two million people and devastated the global economy.On Sunday, the WHO team arrived at the Huanan market as part of a long-planned trip now closely monitored by the Chinese authorities.The experts did not take any questions and the sprawling market remains boarded up.Security staff told reporters outside to leave and shook a tall ladder on which a photographer was sitting for a better view.Earlier this week, state media outlet Global Times published a report downplaying the importance of Huanan as an early epicenter of the virus, claiming "subsequent investigations" have suggested the market was not the source of the outbreak.Chinese authorities have relentlessly pushed a positive narrative of heroism and decisive, swift action in their fight against the coronavirus that has spurred an economic recovery and kept deaths down to 4,636.burs-bys/oho||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-probe-team-visits-wuhan-market-at-heart-of-first-virus-outbreak-101612077268255.html
31-01-2021||World||Canada oppn MPs put pressure on PM to condemn ‘police brutality’ on Indian farmers||Some Canadian opposition MPs are putting pressure to get Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government to address their “concerns” over the alleged “violence” and “police brutality” against protesting farmers in India.Leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh has started a petition campaign on his party’s official website, which reads: “The Indian government’s use of violence on farmers protesting mass privatisation of the agricultural sector is appalling.”“Instead of using water cannons, tear gas and violence, the Indian government needs to engage in open dialogue with farmers,” it adds. Singh also tweeted, “I am deeply concerned about the violence against farmers in India Those calling to harm farmers must be held accountable and the right to peaceful protest must be protected. I am calling on Justin Trudeau to condemn the violence, immediately.”Indian officials pointed out that neither Singh nor groups like the World Sikh Organization (WSO) have raised the issue of attacks on police personnel on Republic Day or take into account that several rounds of talks between farmers’ group and the government have already taken place.Former minister and Conservative Party MP Tim Uppal also joined the chorus, tweeting, “Shocking & disturbing images of police brutality out of Delhi towards farmers protesting.” He added, “I raise my voice with all those around the world calling for this brutality to end.”With Canada’s parliament in session, there is concern among Indian diplomats that the government will be forced to respond, even as Trudeau and recently appointed foreign minister Marc Garneau have avoided the issue, after New Delhi reacted sharply to the Canadian PM’s earlier comments on the protests. Trudeau had said in December during the course of a Facebook live event that “Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.”The Canadian government thereafter has maintained silence on the matter. But Indian officials believe a coordinated campaign has started with “propaganda” by groups like the separatist outfit Sikhs for Justice, to have the issue raised in the House of Commons and elicit a response from the Canadian government.Singh and Uppal’s remarks came soon after the WSO started a campaign to get “Sikh Canadians” to “express concern, ranging from attacks on Sikhs to the threatening of gurdwaras in Delhi.”Other Indo-Canadian groups, though, responded to the charges. The Ottawa-based Overseas Friends of India Canada, replied to Uppal’s tweet, “What are you advocating - violence against the police? You are MP of Canada and should know better than to advocate violence against the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-oppn-mps-put-pressure-on-pm-to-condemn-police-brutality-on-indian-farmers-101612075103919.html
31-01-2021||World||US must 'impose cost' on China for threat towards Taiwan, Hong Kong: Sullivan||The United States must be prepared to "impose cost" on China for its threats toward Taiwan, as well for its actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said.In an online discussion with his predecessor from the Trump administration, Robert O'Brien' on Friday, Sullivan called China as the top foreign policy challenge that was handed over to President Joe Biden, citing Beijing increasingly "assertive" approach to Taiwan, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, reported Focus Taiwan.In response, Sullivan listed out four steps that the US can take to contend with the threat that China poses.First, he said, US must recognise that China is making the case that Chinese model is better than the American model and is pointing to the recent dysfunction and division in the US as evidence of this claim.To effectively combat this argument, the US must "refurbish the foundations of (its) democracy" by tackling social problems such as racial and economic inequality, Sullivan said.Secondly, he said, the US will be most effective in advancing its vision for a free, prosperous and equitable society if it does so "in lockstep with its democratic allies and partners."With its allies in Europe and Asia, the US can lead "a chorus of voices" who collectively represent more than one half of the world's economy, which would give it "leverage" to stand up to Chinese pressure, he said.Third, Sullivan said, the U.S. must increase public investment in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology and clean energy, as a great deal of the competition between the U.S. and China will be decided by which country enjoys a technological advantage.The last step, according to Sullivan, is for the US to speak with clarity and consistency in regards to China and other foreign policy issues.Specifically, this includes "being prepared to act as well as to impose costs for what China is doing in Xinjiang, what it's doing in Hong Kong, and for the bellicosity and threats that it is projecting towards Taiwan," he said.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing.China had passed the Hong Kong Security Law last year to curtail the autonomy of the city, which drew international condemnation.In the aftermath of the law, Beijing launched a crackdown against its critics in Hong Kong. Several lawmakers and pro-democracy activists have been detained.Another aspect of Chinese policy that has been questioned by leaders around the world is the treatment meted out against Uyghurs Muslims in Xinjiang province.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-must-impose-cost-on-china-for-threat-towards-taiwan-hong-kong-sullivan-101612069848010.html
31-01-2021||World||Explained: Why UAE is witnessing a surge in number of Covid-19 cases||The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is seeing a hue surge in number of Covid-19 cases. In the past one month, the number of cases in the UAE have nearly tripled.This led to the ruler of Dubai to replace the head of the emirate's health authority.The surge came after the country largely removed coronavirus restrictions with the exception of face masks in public and social distancing. Dubai, the region's business and tourism hub, has seen an influx of visitors during its peak winter season.The doctors in the UAE say that cold weather could be a potential reason for a spike in the cases of Covid-19. Explaining the behaviour of the virus, the doctors said that it typically survive and reproduce more effectively in colder climatic conditions.Doctors said that dipping mercury levels may also reduce the immune response and make it harder for the body to fight off harmful microorganisms.Part of its potency comes from the fact that the viruses change so quickly that the human body is rarely prepared for the next season’s strain, said the doctors.Healthcare professionals also pointed out that the antibodies no longer recognise the virus, leading to a loss in immunity.The number of daily coronavirus cases in the UAE averaged about 1,200 a day over the past couple of months, but infections started to spike at the end of December and the country reported a record 2,998 cases on January 9.Last week, Dubai suspended non-essential surgeries in hospitals for a month and live music at restaurants indefinitely after daily infections of the coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates rose to their highest levels in January.On Saturday, authorities reported 3,647 new cases and 12 deaths bringing the total number of cases and deaths from Covid-19 to 300,661 and 674 respectively.In contrast with the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi, which has rolled out Sinopharm vaccine to the general public since December, Dubai began the first phase of its vaccination campaign with vaccines produced by Pfizer and BioNTech.The gulf state of about 9 million people hopes massive vaccination will curb infections while keeping its economy open for business.On Saturday, the government said 107,561 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine were given in the past 24 hours, taking the total of doses distributed so far to 3,114,162, with a rate of of 31.49 doses per 100 people.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-uae-is-witnessing-a-surge-in-number-of-covid-19-cases-101612066414167.html

They also listed the Wuhan Institute of Virology and laboratories at facilities including the Wuhan Center for Disease Control.The mission has become politically charged, as China seeks to avoid blame for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.A single visit by scientists is unlikely to confirm the virus’s origins. Pinning down an outbreak’s animal reservoir is typically an exhaustive endeavor that takes years of research including taking animal samples, genetic analysis and epidemiological studies.One possibility is that a wildlife poacher might have passed the virus to traders who carried it to Wuhan. The Chinese government has promoted theories, with little evidence, that the outbreak might have started with imports of frozen seafood tainted with the virus, a notion roundly rejected by international scientists and agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-teams-visits-wuhan-food-market-in-search-of-coronavirus-clues-101612067515295.html

Yarmysh was arrested for nine days for urging Russian citizens to join the unauthorized rally in support of Navalny on January 23.On Friday, a Moscow court placed several of Navalny's close allies, including his top associate Lyubov Sobol, coordinator of his team in Moscow Oleg Stepanov, Alexey's brother Oleg Navalny and Pussy Riot member Maria Alyokhina, under house arrest for violating sanitary rules by calling for protests during the COVID-19 pandemic.On January 23, many Russian cities were hit by protests in support of Alexey Navalny, who was detained in Moscow earlier this month upon his arrival at Sheremetyevo International Airport. Prior to Navalny's return to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for his alleged poisoning, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service warned it would arrest him for probation violations as he was previously found guilty of committing two administrative offenses.Following the unauthorized pro-Navalny rallies, more than 1,000 people were detained in Moscow, where about 4,000 protesters took to the streets on January 23.Commenting on the West's repeated calls for Navalny's release, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said it is an attempt to shift attention from the crisis of the liberal model of development.Russian President Vladimir Putin said that everyone has a right to express their opinion but "anything that goes beyond the law is not just counterproductive but dangerous." The president's spokesman Dmitry Peskov called organizers of such unauthorized protests provocateurs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-s-spokeswoman-detained-for-violating-sanitary-rules-at-protests-101612061795353.html

Why is he bankrupting our country?"Yet after Trump took office in 2017 with a Republican-controlled Congress, that party's lawmakers seemed to forget those concerns.Government spending increased, and Congress enacted a $2 trillion tax cut -- the most significant tax reform in 30 years and one voted for by every Republican senator, including the "budget hawks" known for decrying such spending."Republican concerns about the deficit, they are kind of tough to take seriously right now, given their support for tax cuts and spending increases during the Trump years," said Tori Gorman, policy director of the nonpartisan Concord Coalition, which advocates for fiscal responsibility."And a lot of that took place even before the pandemic," she told AFP.The tax reform boosted growth in 2018 but also increased the budget deficit and inflated the debt, which rose from $19.5 trillion four years earlier to nearly $27 trillion at the end of September 2020.- 'Hypocrisy' on both sides -At the beginning of 2020, before the pandemic battered the economy, Trump signaled that debt was no longer a concern, saying money was better spent on the country's armed forces.He also pushed back the target date for achieving a balanced federal budget to 2035 from 2030, even as the Congressional Budget Office warned of a spiraling deficit.Then Covid-19 broke out, and Democrats and Republicans agreed to pass the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, the country's largest-ever stimulus package. It helped keep the economy from an even worse downturn.But in the months to follow, Republicans who controlled the Senate objected to Democrats' attempt to pass an even larger follow-up measure, arguing for smaller individual bills before the parties, at the last minute, signed off on a $900 billion law in December.With Democrats now fully in control of the levers of power in Washington, Gorman said, both sides have lost credibility over the deficit."I think both sides are guilty of hypocrisy when it comes to fiscal responsibility," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-free-spending-trump-years-republicans-rediscover-us-debt-101612058134110.html
31-01-2021||World||Joe Biden calls for Democrats to keep Trump impeachment trial short||US President Joe Biden urged his fellow members of the Democratic Party in the Senate to keep former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the upper chamber short and not to let it "derail the agenda".According to The Hill, Biden has never embraced Trump's second impeachment though he hasn't sought to stand in its way either amid outrage in his party over the former president's involvement in the January 6 riots at the Capitol.Biden administration officials and allies close to the White House say the president will distance himself from Trump's trial as it begins in the second week of February."He's going to let the Senate do what it needs to do," said one Biden ally close to the White House as quoted by The Hill and added, "We always knew this was going to happen. We always knew this would be the position we're in now with Republicans. And now he's going to respect the process and let it play out."It is reported that the impeachment trial poses some risks to Biden, and some Democrats had warned it could ruin his early agenda."He's come to the White House with a strong unity message and the last thing he wants is for the impeachment trial to define the early days of his presidency," one ally said.Citing sources, it was reported that Biden and his advisers have been in frequent touch with Democratic leaders in Congress, and some members of Biden's inner circle threw their support behind impeachment.After the January 6 attack on the Capitol, Cedric Richmond, who resigned from Congress to become a senior Biden adviser, expressed immediate support for impeachment, according to a source familiar with the internal conversations on Biden's team.But several prominent Democrats in both chambers voiced concern early in the process about a Senate impeachment trial delaying Biden's agenda. "We already know the outcome before it starts and that's frustrating to everybody," said a Senate Democratic aide after this week's vote on the motion sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (Republican-Kentucky.).The Hill further reported that House Majority Whip James Clyburn advocated for waiting after Biden's first 100 days in office before sending an article of impeachment to the Senate.Across the Capitol, in the upper chamber, Senators Tim Kaine and Chris Murphy privately expressed concerns that confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees and moving a Covid-19 relief package should be the top priorities.Murphy said, "my point privately was not necessarily that we shouldn't hold a trial but we needed a couple of weeks to get the Cabinet in place and to get Covid [relief] moving."Kaine said Friday he raised early concerns about "the likely outcome" of a trial."I just felt as outrageous as the behavior was and as much as accountability is needed, I just didn't see a way that Republicans would get to 17 votes to convict," he said.In fact, earlier this week he told CNN he thought "it (the impeachment trial) has to happen."Immediately after the riot, Biden signaled the decision was for lawmakers.The US Senate signalled on Tuesday that there are not nearly enough votes to convict ex-President Donald Trump in an impeachment trial when five Republican senators rejected an effort by Senator Rand Paul to declare the looming trial as unconstitutional.The US Senate formally opened the second impeachment trial for former President Donald Trump on Tuesday with the swearing-in of Senate President Pro-Tempore Patrick Leahy to preside over the process and the swearing-in of the senators to serve as jurors.On Monday, the House of Representatives delivered the article of impeachment against Trump, accusing him of inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol building on January 6 to stop Congress from verifying President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.The impeachment trial arguments will begin on February 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-for-democrats-to-keep-trump-impeachment-trial-short-101612057805142.html
31-01-2021||World||Anti-science movement set up US for worse pandemic: Expert||US infectious disease expert Dr. Peter Hotez has said that the anti-science movement has set up the United States and the world up for a worse Covid-19 pandemic than otherwise would have been."An anti-science disinformation campaign of unprecedented magnitude and led by both multinational corporations and some governments, especially the Russian and US Governments, fuels the pandemic," Hotez, dean for the National School for Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, wrote in the journal Plos Biology as quoted by CNN.He added, "Although President Trump did not win reelection and the new Biden administration has vowed to mount an evidence-based pandemic strategy, the anti-science pursuits of the Trump White House and Coronavirus Task Force have caused serious harm."According to CNN, the essay comes as the US races to try to get a majority of Americans vaccinated by the end of the summer. The Covid-19 pandemic arrived as the anti-vaccination movement had been amplified and politicized on the internet, Hotez said and pointed to vaccine disinformation efforts both in Russia and the US that appeared to accelerate in 2014 ahead of the 2016 US presidential election that led to Trump's presidency."During this time, the anti-vaccine movement began rallying behind medical freedom to counter the introduction of bills in the California legislature designed to close nonmedical exemptions for vaccines," wrote Hotez.He stated that the anti-vaccination movement gained traction during the pandemic. Added to that were protests citing "independent choice" and" freedom" against face masks, social distancing, and contact tracing. "Fueling these sentiments was an active and unabashed anti-science disinformation initiative by the White House," Hotez said.He further said that the US leading the world in coronavirus cases and deaths can be attributed to a lack of a national coordinated effort to utilize face masks, social distancing, school closures, testing, and contact tracing."Thus, anti-science disinformation that advocates shunning masks could inflict a mass casualty event in the US," Hotez wrote.CNN reported further that Hotez suggested that the US may have to remove anti-science content and organizations from social media and e-commerce sites. He added that the US should form an interagency government task force to handle such matters, including representatives from all parts of government, including the departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Homeland security.According to Johns Hopkins University, the US has reported over 26 million Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antiscience-movement-set-up-us-for-worse-pandemic-expert-101612056851760.html
31-01-2021||World||Thousands flee Hong Kong for UK, fearing China crackdown||Cindy had a comfortable lifestyle in Hong Kong: she owned several properties with her husband, they had a good business going. But last year she made up her mind to leave it all behind and move her family to Britain, and not even a global pandemic was going to sway her decision.“To uproot ourselves like this is definitely not easy. But things got uglier last year, the government was really driving us away,” said the businesswoman and mother of two young children who didn't give her family name because she feared repercussions for speaking out against the Chinese government. “Everything we value - freedom of speech, fair elections, liberties - has been eroded. It’s no longer the Hong Kong we knew, it’s no longer somewhere we can call home.”Cindy, who landed in London last week, is one of thousands of Hong Kongers fleeing their hometown since Beijing imposed a draconian national security law on the territory last summer.Some are leaving because they fear punishment for supporting pro-democracy protests. But many others, like her, say China’s encroachment on their way of life and civil liberties has become unbearable, and they want to seek a better future for their children abroad. Most say they don’t plan to ever go back.Many firmed up their exit plans after Britain announced in July that it would open a special immigration pathway for up to 5 million eligible Hong Kongers to live, work and eventually settle in the U.K.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week the offer shows Britain is honoring its “profound ties of history” with Hong Kong, a former colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 on the understanding that it would retain its Western-style freedoms and much of its political autonomy not seen on mainland China.Applications for the British National Overseas visa officially open Sunday, though many like Wong have already arrived on British soil to get a head start. Eligible Hong Kongers can currently come to the U.K. for six months, but from Sunday they can apply for the right to live and work in the country for five years. After that, they can apply for settled status and then British citizenship.Britain’s government said some 7,000 people with British National Overseas (BNO) status have arrived since July. It estimates that over 300,000 people will take up the offer of extended residency rights in the next five years.Wong said she wanted to leave as soon as possible because she feared Beijing would soon move to halt the exodus.“The Chinese government said it hasn’t ruled out harsher tactics,” she said. “I think they could lash out if tens of thousands of young professionals start leaving, because that would surely upset Hong Kong’s economy and they wouldn’t like that at all.”Beijing said Friday it will no longer recognize the BNO passport as a travel document or form of identification, and criticized Britain’s citizenship offer as a move that “seriously infringed” on China’s sovereignty. It was unclear what effect the announcement would have because many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports.Beijing drastically hardened its stance on Hong Kong after massive anti-government protests in 2019 turned violent and plunged the city into a months-long crisis. Since the security law’s enactment, dozens of pro-democracy activists have been arrested, and the movement’s young leaders have either been jailed or fled abroad.Because the new law broadly defined acts of subversion, secession, foreign collusion and terrorism, many in Hong Kong fear that expressing any form of political opposition - even posting messages on social media - could land them in trouble.“I think if you knew when to shut up, you’ll be OK staying in Hong Kong,” said 39-year-old Fan, who also recently arrived in London. Like Wong, he didn’t want to provide his full name. “But I don’t want to do that. I can complain about the queen if I wanted to - I can say anything here.”Fan, an animator, had sold his flat in Hong Kong and plans to slowly build a new life in Britain - a country he had never even visited before. He won't be alone in starting from scratch.“This is a really unique emigration wave – some people haven’t had time to actually visit the country they’re relocating to. Many have no experience of living abroad,” said Miriam Lo, who runs Excelsior UK, a relocation agency. “And because of the pandemic, they couldn’t even come over to view a home before deciding to buy.”The British government estimates there are 2.9 million BNO status holders eligible to move to the U.K., with a further 2.3 million eligible dependants. The U.K. introduced BNO passports in the 1980s for people who were a “British dependent territories citizen by connection with Hong Kong.” Until recently, the passports had limited benefits because they did not confer nationality or the right to live and work in Britain.Cindy, the businesswoman, was still recovering from jetlag, but she's upbeat about her future.“We want to bring Hong Kong’s energy, our resources and our finances here,” she said. “The move is for our kids, sure. But we want to build a whole new life here for ourselves too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-hong-kong-for-uk-fearing-china-crackdown-101612056931265.html
31-01-2021||World||Royal family documentary banned by Queen leaked on YouTube 50 yrs later: Report||An infamous documentary on the royal family that was said to have been banned by Queen Elizabeth decades ago was mysteriously leaked onto YouTube this week.People Magazine reported that the fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary, titled 'Royal Family', aired in 1969 and offered an unprecedented look inside the life of Queen Elizabeth and her family. Prince Philip thought it would open the doors to what being a member of the royal family was all about, but the Queen was said to have regretted the decision to film the documentary and it has largely been locked away ever since.That is until this week when someone uploaded the film onto YouTube. It was swiftly taken down on Thursday before appearing again briefly on Friday morning.The often-charming video charts Queen Elizabeth's working life and her home life over the course of a year and could be a real-life version of 'Netflix's The Crown'.For millions of her subjects, 'Royal Family' was a unique insight into Her Majesty's life and work - from diplomatic functions to greeting ambassadors to travel to places like Chile and rides on the Royal Train. Viewers got to see her awakened every morning by the sound of bagpipes -- something that continues to this day at Windsor, or wherever she is staying.An intimate family moment around the barbecue on the grounds of Balmoral Castle in Scotland is also shown. And the Queen is seen alongside her daughter Princess Anne as they watch some of her racehorses being put through their paces in the midst of the Berkshire Downs. Anne famously disapproved of the documentary."I never liked the idea of the Royal Family film. I always thought it was a rotten idea. The attention that had been brought on one ever since one was a child, you just didn't want anymore. The last thing you needed was greater access," she previously said.The Queen, who has often been perceived as a distant mother, is also seen as being very hands-on, excitedly driving through the snow to take her sons Prince Edward -- who is about 5 years old -- and Prince Andrew to see the Labradors during their winter break in Sandringham. Edward is even seen learning to read alongside cousin Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones and some friends.As reported by People Magazine, the film also shows the visit of President Richard Nixon, who tells Charles and Anne that his daughters follow their progress avidly via news reports.There is a lot of introduction to Charles as heir. At the time, he was studying at Cambridge University and is seen being told about his Duchy of Cornwall. He is still heir, 52 years later.At the end of the film is a moment that some have pondered may be the reason the show has been kept under wraps. As the family gathers around the table over tea, Queen Elizabeth recounts a tale of when the (unnamed) British Home Secretary - a UK Government minister - tells her, "There's a gorilla coming in" for a meeting.The Queen says she turned to the politician and said, "What an extraordinary remark to make about someone - very unkind about anybody.'" She goes on to explain, "I stood in the middle of the room and pressed the bell and the doors opened and there was a gorilla. I had the most terrible trouble. He had a short body and long arms."Around the table, Charles and Philip join in the lively conversation. "If that happened to me, I would dissolve," says Charles.The remark would be rightly seen as wildly inappropriate today, but apparently was barely commented upon at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-family-documentary-banned-by-queen-leaked-on-youtube-50-yrs-later-report-101612055757516.html

The protesters have been gathering every week near Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem for over seven months, but the use of water cannons is rare.In a statement, police said hundreds of protesters took part in the demonstration. They accused some protesters of unruly behavior, including throwing objects and trying to break through a police barricade. It said one officer was lightly hurt, and several protesters were arrested.The protesters say Netanyahu cannot serve as prime minister when he is on trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.They also accuse him of mismanaging the coronavirus crisis, with unemployment in double digits after a series of nationwide lockdowns. The country is in the midst of its third lockdown, despite one of the world's most successful vaccination campaigns.Israel is preparing to hold new elections March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-police-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-anti-pm-netanyahu-protesters-101612054206952.html
31-01-2021||World||Britain opens visa scheme for millions of Hong Kong citizens||A new visa scheme offering millions of Hong Kongers a pathway to British citizenship will go live later on Sunday as the city's former colonial master opens its doors to those wanting to escape China's crackdown on dissent.From Sunday afternoon, anyone with a British National (Overseas) passport and their dependents will be able to apply online for a visa allowing them to live and work in the United Kingdom. After five years they can then apply for citizenship.The immigration scheme is a response to Beijing's decision last year to impose a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong to snuff out huge and often violent democracy protests.Britain has accused China of tearing up its promise ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover that the financial hub would maintain key liberties and autonomy for 50 years. London argued it has a moral duty to protect its former colonial subjects."We have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of the scheme this week.China has reacted with fury to the visa offer.On Friday it announced BN(O) passports would no longer be recognised as a legitimate travel or ID document.The move was largely symbolic as Hong Kongers tend to use their own passports or ID cards to leave the city.But Beijing said it was prepared to take "further measures", raising fears authorities might try to stop Hong Kongers from leaving for Britain.Applications soarIt is not clear how many Hong Kongers will take up the offer, especially as the coronavirus restricts global flights and mires much of the world, including Britain, in a painful economic malaise.But a BN(O) passport is available to a huge number of people -- about 70 percent of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population.Applications for BN(O) passports have skyrocketed more than 300 percent since the national security law was imposed last July, with 733,000 registered holders as of mid-January.Britain predicts up to 154,000 Hong Kongers could arrive over the next year and as many as 322,000 over five years, bringing an estimated "net benefit" of up to £2.9 billion ($4 billion).The BN(O) passport is a legacy of Hong Kong's return to authoritarian China.Many Hong Kongers at the time wanted Britain to grant them full citizenship but China was opposed to the move.The BN(O) was a compromise, allowing Hong Kongers born before 1997 the right to stay in Britain for six months at a time, but with no working or settling rights.Now it has become one of the few ways out for Hong Kongers hoping to start a new life overseas as authorities conduct mass arrests against democracy supporters and move to purge the restless city of dissenting views.'A lifeboat'Stella, a former marketing professional, plans to move to Britain imminently with her husband and three-year-old son."The national security law in 2020 gave us one last kick because the provisions are basically criminalising free speech," she told AFP, asking to use just her first name.Under the visa scheme, those hoping to move have to show they have enough funds to sustain both themselves and their dependents for at least six months.Hong Kongers already in Britain who are involved in helping others relocate say many of the early applicants tend to be educated middle-class people, often with young families, who have enough liquidity to finance their move."Most people we spoke with are families with primary school or nursery age kids," Nic, an activist with a group called Lion Rock Hill UK, told AFP, asking for anonymity.Some Hong Kongers began leaving the city even before the new scheme went live.Earlier this week Britain said around 7,000 people moved over the last six months under a separate Leave Outside the Rules (LOTR) system. They will also be able to apply for the pathway-to-citizenship visas."The BNO is definitely a lifeboat for Hong Kongers," Mike, a medical scientist who recently relocated with his family to the city of Manchester, told AFP.He said many Hong Kongers feared China might stop residents leaving the territory."So it is better to leave as soon as possible," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-opens-visa-scheme-for-millions-of-hong-kong-citizens-101612054020706.html

The billionaire “reached out to talk about the code and the impact on Facebook” in what the treasurer called “a very constructive discussion.”Tech giants from Facebook to Alphabet Inc.’s Google have been battling Australian lawmakers on the proposed legislation requiring them to pay for using media content. The new laws are designed to support the local media industry, including Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., that has struggled to adapt to the digital economy.Facebook has threatened to block Australians from sharing news on its platform if the law is pushed through, while Google said it could remove its search engine entirely from the Australian market.Frydenberg said Sunday that while he doesn’t dismiss Google’s threats, he’s not “intimidated” by them either.Australia Says ‘Inevitable’ Google Will Have to Pay for News“We’re in detailed discussions with Google, with Facebook, with the other players across the industry, because this has not been a short conversation that we’ve had with these companies,” he said.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also spoken with Microsoft Corp.’s CEO Satya Nadella about the proposed changes, Frydenberg said.“At every step of the way, these businesses have been consulted,” the treasurer said. “What I do know is media businesses should be paid for content.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-hasn-t-convinced-australia-to-back-down-from-new-law-101612052742913.html
31-01-2021||World||Macron defends decision not to order third lockdown as third Covid wave spreads||President Emmanuel Macron defended his decision to hold off on a third lockdown on Saturday, telling the public he had faith in their ability to rein in Covid-19 with less severe curbs even as a third wave spreads and the vaccine rollout falters.From Sunday, France will close it borders to all but essential travel to and from countries outside the European Union, while people arriving from within the bloc will have to show a negative test. Large shopping malls will be shut and police patrols increased to enforce a 6 pm curfew.But Macron has stopped short of ordering a new daytime lockdown, saying he wants to see first if other measures will be enough to slow the spread of the coronavirus.With 10% of cases now attributable to the more contagious variant first found in Britain, senior medics have recommended a new lockdown, and one opinion poll showed more than three-quarters of French people think one is now inevitable. The poll also showed falling public confidence in the government's handling of the crisis."I have trust in us. These hours that we are living through are crucial. Let's do all we can to slow the epidemic together," Macron tweeted.Government advisers judged that the slower-than-expected spread of a contagious variant first detected in Britain meant there was no risk in delaying the decision on a lockdown by a week, Health Minister Olivier Veran told the Journal du Dimanche.But he added action would be swift if the virus started spreading faster: "We never said we would not impose a lockdown in the next two weeks if necessary."THIRD VACCINE?Macron has also been under fire for rolling out vaccines at a slower pace than other big EU countries, and far more slowly than Britain or the United States. France's latest figures showed it had given just 1.45 million vaccine doses so far. Britain, by comparison, has recorded 8.4 million.Veran said France's medical regulator was due to give its assessment on AstraZenaca's vaccine on Tuesday. France has so far approved vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.France reported 24,393 new Covid-19 infections on Saturday while the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital stayed above 27,000 for a fifth straight day.The rate of new infections is still lower than it was when the last lockdown was ordered in October, but hospitalisation rates are already comparable.Paris resident Sami Terki said it was "a good thing for now - even mentally - to not have to go through a new lockdown." But he added: "My only concern is that we then take the decision to lockdown too late."The public health authority said the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care dipped slightly to 3,113.Professor Dominique Rossi, who heads the Marseille Hospitals’ Medical Commission, said the local heath authority had asked hospitals in the Bouche-du-Rhone area to cancel 40% of all non-urgent medical interventions.Managing the flow of Covid and non-Covid patients was "a real ethical headache", he told Reuters. "The (COVID-19) projections are really worrying."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-defends-decision-not-to-order-third-lockdown-as-third-covid-wave-spreads-101612052402820.html

The plan drew some criticism after The New York Times reported that the vaccination of prisoners would start in the coming days.“We’re pausing the plan to move forward, as we review force protection protocols,” Kirby said. “We remain committed to our obligations to keep our troops safe.”The US military announced earlier this month that it planned to offer the vaccine to prisoners as it vaccinated all personnel at the detention center.At the time, US Southern Command said it expected to have enough vaccine for all of the approximately 1,500 personnel assigned to the detention center. It said that the vaccine would be offered to prisoners but did not plan to reveal how many actually received it because of medical privacy regulations.The US opened the detention center in January 2002 to hold detainees suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban. Those who remain include five men facing a trial by military commission for their alleged roles planning and aiding the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pauses-plan-to-give-covid-19-vaccine-to-guantanamo-prisoners-101612047489168.html

She plans to speak to Japan’s economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura and Damien O’Connor, New Zealand’s minister for trade and economic growth, by video call Monday.The international trade department said it would publish an assessment of the economic benefits of CPTPP membership this spring, despite an earlier promise to release it before the application to allow more time for parliamentary scrutiny.The 11 current members of CPTPP account for about 13% of global gross domestic product, worth $10.6 trillion, according to New Zealand’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-launch-formal-bid-to-join-transpacific-trading-bloc-101612047004486.html
31-01-2021||World||Daniel Pearl case: US presses Pakistan for ‘accountability’||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday pressed his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi to ensure “accountability” for Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been convicted over the killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl.The United Nations has also called for the convicted terrorist to be held accountable.Omar Sheikh is set to be released after Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Thursday upheld his acquittal by a lower court in a verdict that sparked outrage in the United States.A three-judge court, which ruled 2-1 to clear the way for Omar Sheikh’s release, has said it will explain its order at a later date.Blinken and Qureshi spoke for the first time on Friday after the Biden administration took office. They “discussed how to ensure accountability for convicted terrorist Omar Sheikh and others responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl”, the state department said in a readout of their call. “The secretary (of state) reinforced US concern about the Pakistani Supreme Court ruling and potential release of these prisoners,” it added.Blinken reinforced this message in a post on Twitter.At the United Nations in New York, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary general, had a similar message for Pakistan. “I don’t have a comment on the specific case. What is important is that there be accountability for those crimes committed,” he told reporters in response to a question about Omar Sheikh’s acquittal.Daniel Pearl, who was South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was kidnapped and murdered in Karachi in 2002. A video of his beheading was posted online.Omar Sheikh, who is British-born, was arrested and convicted for Pearl’s kidnapping and murder, and was eventually sentenced to death, which was commuted by the Sindh high court in April 2020 to seven years.He had already been in prison for 18 years by that time.His release was delayed as the Sindh state government and Pearl’s family appealed to the Supreme Court.White House press secretary Jen Psaki had earlier expressed “outrage” at the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order on Thursday, and Blinken had separately said the acquittal was an “affront to terrorism victims everywhere”.They had both reaffirmed US preparedness to prosecute Omar Sheikh in America, renewing an offer first made by the Trump administration in December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daniel-pearl-case-us-presses-pakistan-for-accountability-101612039854628.html
31-01-2021||World||UK sees smooth Covid-19 vaccine supplies after EU addresses 'mistake'||The British government said Saturday that it does not expect any disruptions to its orders for coronavirus vaccines after the European Union emphasized it would not trigger an emergency provision of the Brexit deal as part of its strategy to monitor export of doses produced in the EU.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove said the government expects the vaccines to be supplied as planned after the EU addressed the "mistake" in its proposal to tighten export rules for Covid-19 vaccines produced in the 27 member nations.The UK government complained late Friday that the bloc had invoked an emergency clause in its divorce deal with Britain to introduce controls on exports from EU member Ireland into Northern Ireland, which is part of the UKAfter a call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU’s executive commission, the EU said it was not invoking the article of the Brexit agreement allowing either side to override parts of the deal.Gove said Johnson was “very clear” in the call to stress that the UK has contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Pfizer.“President von der Leyen was clear that she understood exactly the UK government’s position, so we expect that those contracts will be honored, we expect that vaccines will continue to be supplied,” he added.While the UK has made progress in its campaign to vaccinate the population against the coronavirus, the EU has faced complaints and criticism for its slow start.Concerns over the pace of the rollout across the EU's 27 member nations grew over the last week after British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said it could not supply EU members with as many doses as originally anticipated because of production capacity limits.AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has said that vaccine delivery figures in the contract with the EU were targets, not firm commitments, and the company was unable to meet them because plants in Europe had lower than expected yields from the biological process used to produce the vaccine.However, the European Commission suspected that doses meant for Europe might have been diverted from an AstraZeneca plant on the continent to the UK, where two other company sites are located. The EU also wants doses at two sites in Britain to be made available to European citizens.That was the backdrop to the EU's decision to trigger the Northern Ireland provision on Friday, when EU regulators authorized the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. As part of the Brexit agreement, goods are supposed to flow freely between the EU and Northern Ireland under special arrangements for the UK region designed to protect the peace process on the island of Ireland.Though it reversed course on that, the EU is pushing ahead with a plan to oversee vaccines manufactured in its member states, a move that could hinder the U.K.’s access to supplies, particularly to the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine made in Belgium.Germany’s health minister called Saturday for the European Union to get its “fair share” of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.In an interview with German weekly newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, Health Minister Jens Spahn said he wanted transparency from the drugmaker. ,“It’s not about Europe first, but about Europe’s fair share,” Spahn was quoted as saying.According to the newspaper, Spahn said he wanted to be sure that all of AstraZeneca’s customers were “affected in the same way” by the production problems the company blamed for the reduction in shipments over the coming months.The European Union expressed anger this week at AstraZeneca’s announcement that it would initially only supply 31 million doses of vaccine to the 27-nation bloc, instead of the 80 million doses it had hoped to deliver. The EU said it provided 336 million ($408 million) to help finance the production of AstraZeneca’s vaccine at four factories months before it was approved by medical regulators.The row reached a new pitch late Friday when the EU introduced a “vaccine export transparency mechanism″ to put tighter rules on exports of Covid-19 vaccines.The EU insists the mechanism is not an export ban and said it would be in place at least until the end of March to ensure member nations get the shots they bought from producers. The World Health Organization has criticized the new EU export rules as “not helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-smooth-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-after-eu-addresses-mistake-101612034312790.html
31-01-2021||World||Covid-19: US CDC requires face masks on airlines, public transportation||Travellers on airplanes and public transportation like buses and subways will be required to wear face masks starting next week to curb the spread of Covid-19.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued a mask-wearing rule late Friday that builds on an order announced January 21 by President Joe Biden.The rule "will protect Americans and provide confidence that we can once again travel safely even during this pandemic," said Dr Marty Cetron, director of CDC's division of migration and quarantine, who signed the order.The 11-page CDC order takes effect just before midnight on Monday night. It makes refusal to wear a mask a violation of federal law, enforced by the Transportation Security Administration and other federal, state and local authorities.The rule applies to passengers on airplanes, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares. It says travellers must wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth while riding and while getting on and off rides. The order extends to waiting areas such as airports, train platforms and subway stations.Airlines already require masks and have banned more than 2,000 passengers for refusing to wear one. Flight attendant unions have said a federal rule will make it easier for crews to enforce the requirement.The order exempts children under 2 years of age and people with a disability that makes it unsafe to wear a mask. Airlines struggled with an exemption for safety and stopped allowing it. The CDC said transportation operators can require medical documentation.Travellers will be allowed to remove masks while eating or drinking.The CDC said some face coverings aren't good enough to comply with the rule. The don't-travel list includes face shields, bandanas, masks with exhalation valves and masks that are too big or otherwise don't fit properly.The CDC said transportation operators may require a negative Covid-19 test from passengers. Cetron said this week that the health agency is considering requiring testing of passengers on flights within the United States, but the airline industry is fighting a testing requirement out of fear that fewer people will fly.US air travel is already down more than 60% from a year ago.The CDC rule came just over a week after Biden's executive order, which already mandated masks on certain modes of public transportation including planes and trains, and it mandated masks on federal property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-requires-face-masks-on-airlines-public-transportation-101612033990641.html
31-01-2021||World||Italy: Medicines agency cautious on AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jab for people over 55 years of age||Italy's medicines agency on Saturday approved the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for all adults but recommended alternatives be given to people aged over 55.AIFA's decision comes a day after the European Union gave the green light for the jab, but Germany's vaccine commission recommended against using it on older people amid questions over its effectiveness that have been rejected by the company."AIFA authorises the AstraZeneca vaccine for the prevention of Covid-19 disease in individuals over the age of 18, as per European Medicines Agency guidance," it said.But it noted "a level of uncertainty" about claims of the jab's effectiveness in people over the age of 55, because the age group was "poorly represented" in trials.To help with the best use of the vaccine, it recommended "preferential use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, pending further data, in subjects between 18 and 55 years old, for whom more solid evidence is available".It urged the "preferential use of messenger RNA vaccines in older and/or more frail subjects".So-called mRNA vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs, and are based on a new technology previously untested in a real-world situation.They use an inert snippet of genetic code from the coronavirus to trigger an immune response in the body that can repel the active virus.Many of the other vaccines -- including Oxford/AstraZeneca -- are variants of the method used for flu jabs, based on a virus that has been killed and rendered harmless.AstraZeneca earlier rejected German media questioning the vaccine's effectiveness in over 65s."Reports that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as eight percent in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect," the firm said in a statement last Monday."In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100 percent of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-medicines-agency-cautious-on-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-jab-for-over-55s-101612033293427.html
31-01-2021||World||Federal conspiracy charges for two Proud Boys members in US Capitol riot case||Two men identified as members of the Proud Boys have been indicted on federal conspiracy and other charges in the Capitol riot as prosecutors raise the stakes in some of the slew of cases stemming from the Jan. 6 insurrection.Dominic Pezzola, a former Marine who authorities say was seen on video smashing a Capitol window with a stolen Capitol Police riot shield, and William Pepe, who authorities said was photographed inside the building, were arrested earlier in the month on federal charges that included illegally entering a restricted building. The two, both from New York state, have now been indicted in Washington on charges that newly include conspiracy.“The object of the conspiracy was to obstruct, influence, impede and interfere with law enforcement officers engaged in their official duties in protecting the US Capitol and its grounds,” the indictment says, accusing Pezzola, Pepe and unnamed others of leading a group of Proud Boys and others to the Capitol and moving police barricades there.Pezzola went on to snatch an officer's shield and use it to break the window, according to the indictment, which was filed in court Friday.Pezzola's lawyer Michael Scibetta said Saturday he was researching the charges but hadn’t been able yet to discuss the indictment with his client, who is being held without bail. A lawyer for Pepe, Shelli Peterson, declined to comment.Three self-described members of a paramilitary group were charged with conspiracy this month and accused of plotting the attack on the Capitol. But the new charges against Pezzola and Pepe appear to be the first conspiracy cases involving alleged members of the Proud Boys, a far-right group of self-described “Western chauvinists.”Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, said in a court filing Friday that Pezzola “showed perseverance, determination, and coordination in being at the front lines every step along the way before breaking into the Capitol,” and that his actions in shattering the window and allowing an initial group of rioters to stream through "cannot be overstated.”Pezzola was later seen on video inside the Capitol with a cigar, having what he called a “victory smoke," and boasting that he “knew we could take this” over, Sherwin wrote. He argued the remarks showed Pezzola “invested a significant personal effort to take over the Capitol and that he did so in coordination with others.”An unidentified witness told the FBI that Pezzola was with a group at the Capitol whose members said they would have killed anyone they got hold of, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence, according to prosecutors. The witness added that people in the group said they'd return on the “20th” and kill everyone they could. The presidential inauguration was Jan. 20.In a search of Pezzola's home in Rochester, New York, FBI agents found a computer thumb drive with hundreds of files detailing how to make firearms, poisons or explosives, Sherwin wrote in arguing that Pezzola should continue to be held without bail.Pezzola, 43, served six years stateside in the Marines as an infantryman and was discharged in 2005 at the rank of corporal, service records show. His lawyer has said his client is self-employed and a family man.Pepe, 31, was photographed inside the Capitol and later identified as a Metro-North Railroad train yard laborer who had called in sick to go to Washington for a Jan. 6 protest by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, according to a Jan. 11 criminal court complaint. Pepe, who lives in Beacon in New York’s Hudson Valley, has since been suspended without pay from his job at the New York City-area commuter railroad.At Trump's urging, thousands of the protesters streamed to the Capitol. Some then stormed it, temporarily disrupting Congress' certification of Democratic President Joe Biden’s victory over the Republican Trump in the November election.Overall, federal authorities have charged more than 150 people in the Capitol siege.The Justice Department said both Pepe and Pezzola have gone to Proud Boys gatherings and have tactical vests emblazoned with the group's logo.The group is known for violent confrontations with antifascists and other ideological opponents at protests. In a notable moment on the campaign trail last year, Trump told the group to "stand back and stand by” when asked at a September debate whether he would condemn white supremacist and militia groups that showed up at some protests last summer.Shortly before the Capitol riot, the Proud Boys' leader, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, was arrested in Washington and ordered to stay out of the city after being accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-conspiracy-charges-for-two-proud-boys-members-in-us-capitol-riot-case-101612031364538.html

The opposition leaders must be coming out of empathy but there's no point for them to look for votes at the protest sites. It is not their protest.""Opposition may raise the issue in parliament," he added.The farmer leader said that the farm issue can only be settled through dialogue. "We will talk to the government as we believe that the issue can only be settled with dialogue," he added.Tikait had earlier said there will not be any agreement "under pressure". They will hold discussions on the farm law issue only after their people are released from jail, he said.The farmer leader had earlier stated that they will honour the dignity of the Prime Minister but also ensure that the self-respect of farmers is protected.So far, several rounds of talks have remained inconclusive between farmer leaders and government representatives on the farm issues.Days after the violent incidents during farmers tractor rally on January 26, PM Modi had on Saturday said that the government's proposal to farmers on suspending the three farm laws for 18 months still stands.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-point-in-opposition-leaders-seeking-votes-at-protest-sites-rakesh-tikait-101612115763613.html

Through the no-confidence motion, the public will know which MLA stands with the government and which MLA is with the farmers," he said.Hooda said the CLP meeting will consider the demands of the farmers and draw out a strategy to take forward their issues.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhupinder-hooda-convenes-congress-meeting-to-discuss-farmers-issues-101612114911969.html

No need to visit RTO office any more||People trying to get a learner's license or seeking temporary registration number for their vehicles will no longer have to visit the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for verification. In view of the social distancing norms due to Covid-19, the central government will launch 16 facilities that would allow you to do all that from online portals. The Union transport ministry has stated that Aadhaar will be adopted as an alternative document for authentication and no other paper will be needed.This will allow people to apply for new learners' license, renewal, duplicate driving license and temporary vehicle registration. They will also be able to change the address in their driver’s licence and get an international driving permit, NOC for registration, duplicate registration certificate, vehicle transfer etc. The new rule is scheduled to be implemented by February first week.In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the functioning of the transport sector is being made contactless, HT's sister publication LiveHindustan reported citing a senior official. This will bring transparency in the functioning of RTOs in states, he also said.On January 29, the ministry of road transport and highways also sought suggestions and objections from all states regarding the same notification. The states have 15 days to respond to the notification.The new online system will also restrict people from obtaining multiple driving licenses from different states. The government is also hoping that through this the racket of registration of stolen vehicles in another state will also be closed.The government in recent months have brought several changes to the motor vehicles rules. In October last year, the government mandated that people will no longer need to carry physical copies of their vehicle-related documents including their driving license. It allowed people to save copies of their documents on government portals, MParivahan or Digilocker. They can then show the required documents to the traffic police if needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/applying-for-learner-s-license-no-need-to-visit-rto-office-any-more-101612114418783.html

"I bow down to Bihars first Chief Minister Dr Sri Krishna Singh on his death anniversary," Tejashwi tweeted while paying tribute to Bihars first CM. He, however, committed goof-up by posting photograph of Anugrah Narayan Sinha in place of "Shri Babu." Anugraha Narayan Sinha known as 'Bihar Vibhuti' had served as a prominent minister in Dr Sri Krishna Singh's first cabinet after Independence. NDA constituents-JD(U), BJP and HAM(S) latched on the issue to attack Lalu Prasad's younger son. RJD sought to downplay the matter, saying it was a "technical error" which the opponent should not make an issue and go by the spirit of the tweet. Hindustani Awam Morcha(HAM) national president and former Bihar CM Jitan Ram Manjhi took a jibe at Tejashwis knowledge about leaders of Bihar, saying "those who do not recognise as who the late Sri Krishna Singh was, now reckons himself as a leader of Bihar. " "@yadavtejashwi babu, if you dont know (recognize) Bihar Vibhutis (legends), then I would send pictures of all these personalities. See photos before making any comments from now onwards. This boy has made a fun of himself," Manjhi said in his tweet. JD(U) spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar questioned Tejashwis knowledge asking, "whether it reflects his hate for knowledge or societal hate as he has posted picture of late Anugrah Babu on the death anniversary of Dr Sri Krishna Singh." "How political tourists will know the great leaders of Bihar. You are corrupt and only know the criminals lodged in jail," JD(U) leader wryly said. BJP too derided Tejashwi, the leader of opposition in Bihar assembly, for his goof-up. "The leader of opposition should exhibit his political- social hatred after first getting himself acquainted with the pictures of Bihar Kesri late Sri Krishna Singh and Bihar Vibhuti late Anugrah Narayan Singh," state BJP spokesman Arvind Kumar Singh said. Downplaying the issue, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary told PTI that "Tejashwi Yadav jee does not himself put up tweets. Its a technical error. The opponents should not make it an issue, rather they should try to understand the spirit behind the tweet."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-goofs-up-by-putting-wrong-picture-while-paying-tribute-to-shri-babu-101612113331013.html

The first shipment also included two telescopic spreaders with adjustable arms to handle shipping containers of up to 40 tonnes.Behrouz Aghaei, director-general of Iran’s ports and maritime department in Sistan-Baluchestan province, told the media the next consignment of heavy equipment, including two mobile coastal cranes, is expected to be shipped from Italy to Iran in the near future.Singh said Chabahar port had handled 75,000 tonnes of wheat donated by India to Afghanistan last year, and adequate measures had been taken to upgrade the port.

But the picture he posted was not of Singh. It was of another eminent leader of the state and former deputy chief minister Anugrah Singh, popularly called Bihar Vibhuti.The JD(U) was quick to flay Tejaswhi for the slip, and called him a “political tourist”. “You are a political tourist and how will you know about the luminaries of Bihar. You only know corrupt and those lodged in jails,” said Neeraj Kumar, former minister and JD (U) MLCDeputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad of the BJP said the opposition leader’s faux pas reflected how he was only engrossed in the thought of coming to power. “He (Tejashwi) probably keeps thinking of other things and applies less attention on these things,” Prasad said.However, RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary played down his leader’s mistake.“The photograph mismatch on Tejashwi’s Twitter post was a technical error. The JD(U) and BJP are in the habit of making a mountain out of a molehill,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-tourist-jd-u-taunts-tejashwi-yadav-after-twitter-gaffe-101612112353344.html

She has no basic rights whatsoever in the party. This is illegal,” said AIADMK spokesperson D Jayakumar.Since her release from prison, the AIADMK has expelled two of its functionaries for putting up posters welcoming Sasikala as the ‘general secretary’.Senior AIADMK leader KP Munusamy, however, indicated a possible reconciliation.Calling Sasikala’s nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief, TTV Dhinakaran an opportunist who tried to break the AIADMK, he said “If he (Dhinakaran) wants, he can submit a written apology seeking forgiveness for all his mistakes and to be accepted as a cadre, the leadership can take a call on his letter,” said Munusamy.Dinakaran, on Sunday, shrugged off the use of the flag, stating that Sasikala is still "the general secretary of the AIADMK."Just two months after Jayalaithaa's death in December 2016, the Sasikala faction of the party got into a bitter power struggle to oust O.Panneerselvam as chief minister.Sasikala's bid for chief ministership was cut short after the Supreme Court convicted her and two others - Ilavarasi and V.K.Sudhakaran in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case on February 14, 2017.Her release from prison after serving a jail term has added to the intensity of the upcoming polls in which the AIADMK is consolidating its resources to take on its main rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).Sasikala had handpicked Edapaddi Palaniswami for the CM’s role, over current deputy CM Paneerselvam, who had officiated in that role through all of Jayalalithaa’s illness.Following Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016, Paneerselvam was swiftly sworn in as CM. Sasikala was elected as general secretary -- the highest post in the AIADMK-- previously held by MGR and Jayalalithaa. After Paneerselvam resigned to make way for Sasikala to be chief minister, in a dramatic turn of events, he rebelled against her.But Pannerselvam and Edapaddi Palaniswami eventually merged their factions and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran. The party abated the general secretary’s post.Sasikala had filed a petition in the Madras high court that the general council meeting held to expel her and appoint new positions were invalid The case is not yet listed, said her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian.“The case is pending in court so she’s put the flag in her car. Chinamma will continue her legal battle. I floated AMMK democratically to reclaim the AIADMK,” Dhinakaran told reporters in Bengaluru.“By using the flag, she is sending a message to the cadre that she belongs to the AIADMK but when the election commission has recognised the Palaniswami-Paneerselavm’s government and party as the true AIADMK, it’s a weak case in a civil court,” Ravindran Duraisamy, a Chennai-based political analyst said.The election commission in 2017 allotted the party name and its symbol of two leaves to the present regime. “The status-quo of the AIADMK will continue. It’s a settled matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-signals-intent-to-fight-back-uses-aiadmk-flag-as-she-exits-hospital-101612109169595.html

31-01-2021||India||Kerala: Hitting out at 'misrule' of LDF govt, UDF launches state-wide rally||Attacking the CPI(M)-led LDF government over its five year 'misrule' and promising a clean and good governance, the Opposition Congress led UDF on Sunday launched a 22-day state-wide yatra wooing the people ahead of the assembly polls, likely to be held in April-May this year. 'Flagging off the 'Aiswarya Kerala' yatra, led by leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, Ramesh Chennithala, at Kumbala in northernmost Kasaragod district, former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said the LDF government had made a lot of claims on its 'achievements' during its tenure. "That is not the truth. The last five years was a waste as neither the people nor the state gained anything during the Left rule. What is the development they are claiming?" Chandy asked. He pointed out that the Kannur airport, Vizhinjam port and Kochi metro projects were started by the previous UDF government. The medical college alloted to Kasaragod did not become a reality due to which people had to suffer during the pandemic, he said. Unemployment was on the rise, he said and alleged that there were efforts to make 'back door appointments'. Chandy also used the platformto slam the Left government on the Sabarimala women entry issue, days after he shot of a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, seeking legal remedies to "heal the wounds" created in society due to its alleged hasty decision to implement the Supreme Court verdict. Addressing the gathering, Chennithala said people are fed up with the five year "misrule" of the LDF government and would not give it a second term. "This scam ridden government has cheated the people", he alleged, alluding to the Gold smuggling, dollar smuggling cases and various other corruption cases. He assured that if the UDF government was voted to power, it would bring in legislation to protect the faith of Sabarimala devotees. Kerala had witnessed massive protests by right-wing outfits and the BJP after the LDF government decided to implement the apex court's September 28 verdict in 2018, lifting the restriction on entry of women of menstruating age into the hill shrine to offer prayers. KPCC President Mullappally Ramachandran said the LDF government has"cheated" the people and was a failure on all fronts and expressed confidence that the UDF would win 100 of the 140 seats and ride to power. AICC General Secretary Tariq Anwar, IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty, UDF convenor M M Hassan and Kerala Congress leader P J Joseph were among those who spoke. 'Clean and good governance' is the slogan of the rally, which will also present the alternate development and welfare model proposed by the UDF to the people. The rally, after passing through the 140 constituencies spread over 14 districts, will reach the state capital on February 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hitting-out-at-misrule-of-ldf-govt-udf-launches-state-wide-rally-101612103005072.html

The BJP has enacted demonetisation, GST, labour laws and farm laws to give benefits only to the billionaires. The BJP has tortured the common people," the Samajwadi Party chief said in a tweet in Hindi.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protest took a violent turn during the farmers' tractor rally on January 26.Enacted in September 2020, the central government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers' income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and "mandi" (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and ruled out a repeal of the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-deeply-hurt-by-bjp-s-moves-to-defame-them-akhilesh-yadav-101612086693429.html

A letter by the principal of the school named Jamia Sirajul Uloom, that was submitted along with the army’s complaint also stated that there was ‘no pressure’ by the army to organize Republic Day celebrations.Police officials said that they have filed the FIR on Saturday under sections 153 and 505 after receiving a complaint from the Company commander of the army’s 44 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) at Imam Sahib in Shopian against online news portals The Kashmir Walla and Kashmiriyat.“Army has said it is fake news and the school authorities have also denied any force by the army. We have filed an FIR against the two portals after the complaint by the army,” Shopian’s superintendent of police (SP), Amritpal Singh said.The Kashmir Walla and Kashmiriyat had carried byline stories on January 27 quoting the chairman of Jamia Sirajul Uloom, a private school in Shopian, that they were allegedly pressured to celebrate the Republic Day event by the army. Attempts to contact the chairman M Yousuf Mantoo on his phone did not succeed.Editor of The Kashmir Walla, Fahad Shah said that they stood by their story. “We stand by our reporting and we have ample evidence to prove that when the time will come. We spoke to the senior most official of the school who said everything on record. Now after three days they have remembered that it was ‘fake news’. The school authorities have also become unreachable,” Shah said.He said that after they broke the story, the other news portal also talked to the school authorities and reported it. He said that they are used to getting calls and summons from the authorities for the work they are doing.News editor of Kashmiriyat, Qazi Shibli said that they were honest in their reporting.

Our leaders at protest sites and our panch (leaders of the panchayat) will make decisions and we all will follow them,” he added.The two-month-long protest against the farm laws appeared to be losing steam after widespread violence during a tractor parade by farmers on the Republic Day, but an emotional appeal by BKU leader Rakesh Tikait gave it a fresh lease of life with thousands of farmers gathering at the Gazipur protest site and the 'mahapanchayats' from western UP extending support to the stir.The farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP, have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-stir-thousands-converge-for-third-mahapanchayat-in-western-up-101612100175125.html

31-01-2021||India||Delhi Congress passes resolution to make Rahul Gandhi party president||Congress’ Delhi unit on Sunday passed a resolution asking party leader and Wayanad lawmaker Rahul Gandhi to once again take over as the president with immediate effect, days after the organisation announced that a new chief would be elected in June. Delhi unit chief Anil Kumar said in the resolution that the Congress party needs a dynamic and powerful leader like Gandhi at the helm considering the disturbed and dangerous political situation in the country.Congress needs Gandhi to lead the party forcefully, to counter the communal, authoritarian and undemocratic forces, trying to take the country on the path of destruction, the resolution stated. Gandhi had resigned as the Congress president in 2019 after the party suffered a humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha elections and despite several similar calls to return as the chief he has not come back."Rahulji has been waging a determined battle to expose the misdeeds of the Modi Government, and his leading from the front as the Congress President was an urgent need to boost the confidence and morale of the Congress workers," Kumar said.The unit also passed two more resolutions seeking the resignations of Union home minister Amit Shah and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for their failures. Echoing the views of opposition parties on the Republic Day violence, the Delhi unit said that the furore during the farmers' tractor rally was because of infiltration by some anti-social elements.The resolution also alleged that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government passed the three contentious farm laws with ulterior motives and without any discussion with stakeholders — the farmers’ unions and the opposition. Attacking the government at city-state level, the resolution said that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led government has ruined Delhi in every possible manner, as time and again. "It has proved that it was incompetent to steer Delhi clear of the difficult situations, like addressing the Covid crisis, pollution, unemployment and general economic distress among the people," the resolution stated.The Delhi unit also observed a two-minute silence to pay homage to the Congress workers and leaders, farmers and frontline workers who died because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the last few months. The homage was paid to former president Pranab Mukherjee, Ahmed Patel, Motilal Vohra, Tarun Gogoi and Shaukat Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-congress-passes-resolution-to-make-rahul-gandhi-party-president-101612099191956.html

Tomar hoped that Pawar "will change his stand" and "explain the benefits of the laws to farmers." He also said Pawar is such a veteran leader, "I would like to believe that he was genuinely misinformed of the facts.""Pawar is considered well-versed with the issues and solutions relating to agriculture. He has himself tried hard to bring the same agriculture reforms earlier," the agriculture minister said.Tomar was referring to Pawar’s position as the Union agriculture minister for 10 years in prime minister Manmohan Singh-led government.On Saturday, Pawar had posted six tweets in he said that the new central laws will adversely affect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and it will also weaken the mandi system. Pawar also said that he is concerned about the amended Essential Commodities Act. "According to the act the Govt will intervene for price control only if rates of horticultural produce are increased by 100% and that of non-perishable items increase by 50%. Stock piling limits have been removed on food grain, pulses, onion, potato, oilseeds etc. It may lead to apprehensions that Corporates may purchase commodities at lower rates and stock pile and sell at higher prices to consumers,” he wrote on Twitter.Also Read | You have a responsibility: AAP’s Raghav Chadha writes to Punjab CM, demands security for protestersHe further said, “Reform is a continuous process and no one would argue against the reforms in the APMCs or Mandi System, a positive argument on the same does not mean that it is done to weaken or demolish the system.” "During my tenure, the draft APMC Rules - 2007 were framed for the setting up of special markets thereby providing alternate platforms for farmers to market their commodities and utmost care was also taken to strengthen the existing Mandi system," Pawar also said.Tends of thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders for more than two months now against the new farm laws. They are demanding a repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for the procurement of their crops. Agitating farmers claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system, despite the Centre seeking to assure them in vain that the MSP system was here to stay and the new laws would only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce.The government has held several rounds of talks with the leaders of the farmers but has failed to bring any resolution to the matter so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-he-will-change-stand-on-farm-laws-agriculture-minister-responds-to-sharad-pawar-s-criticism-101612095292283.html

While the government's proactive measures and the frontline workers' tireless efforts have helped tide the way, the pandemic has also brought forth the fragility of the healthcare system," the survey stated. Also read| Why is India called the world’s pharmacy? Here are 160 million reasonsOn measures which can strengthen the healthcare and pharma sector, 67.3 per cent respondents expect the allocation of a fund to modernise existing primary healthcare infrastructure. This was followed by an expectation (by 62.9 per cent) that the government should increase investments in creating new primary healthcare infrastructure.With regard to aspirations of individual taxpayers, 79.3 per cent respondents said they would like to see a cut in personal income tax rates, especially in the wake of pressure on their earnings in the pandemic-hit economy.While corporate tax rates have been reduced, individuals pay taxes at higher rates. Rationalising taxes for the individuals is critical as reducing the tax burden on individuals would enable further spending. According to the survey, this much-needed push to demand would help in creating a multiplier effect in the economy. Also read| What the Union Budget needs to get right"A significant increase in the public expenditure is inevitable. The pandemic has taught us there are no choices other than large scale public investment in building primary health centres, hospitals at the district, state capital level," Assocham Secretary General Deepak Sood said.As has been stated in the Economic Survey, there is a strong feeling within the government to raise public expenditure on healthcare three-fold from 1 per cent of GDP to 3 per cent of GDP, he added. Moreover, Sood said, at the same time, to support the economic health of the nation, amidst the rising green shoots of recovery, the upcoming Budget must frontload infrastructure investments. "The Budget's allocation towards infrastructure and housing development will create a much-needed multiplier impact in the economy," he observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/healthcare-likely-to-get-top-priority-in-budget-2021-survey-101612090394007.html

With the Shivalik Arboretum, we have tried to conserve these species while spreading awareness about them,” said Chaturvedi.The arboretum was inaugurated by Ajay Singh Rawat, a noted environmentalist from Uttarakhand.The Shivalik Arboretum has over 210 tree and shrub species, making it one of the biggest arboretum in the state, officials said. Some of the trees preserved include, Kafal (Myrica esculenta), Buransh, (Rhododendron arboretum), Tejpat (Cinnamomum tamala) and Sanjeevani (Sellaginella bryopteris).“Our aim is to ensure proper nature education among people and that they should be able to feel an emotional connect with the trees, making them more active towards conservation. For this, we have tried to place story telling placards, where every tree tells its own stories of origin, importance and significance,” added Chaturvedi.The placards showcase information like scientific information about particular species, cultural significance, medicinal use, country of origin, type of habitat in which it is found and all possible uses including as timber, dyes or any other peculiar use.The forest department has also tried to link poems and other literary pieces written about trees found in the Shivalik ranges.“There are famous poems or couplets written by lyricists like Gulzar or famous poets like Sumitranandan Pant about trees found in the Shivalik ranges. We have put up posters of these literary pieces along with the trees, to make it more engaging for people. This will help people remember about the trees and they can further spread awareness among their peers,” he added.Last year under its biggest conservation initiative to protect Himalayan flora, the forest department’s research wing, following three-year-long fieldwork, had created a repository of 1145 plant species, including 68 threatened, rare and vulnerable species, aimed at their germplasm conservation so that these species remain conserved in case they disappear from the wild due to any reason.Apart from trees, the arboretum also conserves species of cane, moss, lichen and ferns found in the Shivalik range.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-sets-up-first-arboretum-for-shivalik-range-with-210-species-of-trees-101612094988675.html

It should solve this issue by showing greatness, and the interest of the farmer should be solved keeping the interest of farming in mind," he stated.Meanwhile, Malik took a strong exception to the violence that happened on January 26 in Delhi during farmers' tractor rally and said he is confident that those who violated law and order during tractor rally were not farmers."On January 26, there were miscreants involved in violence. By and large farmers protest has been quiet that day. Farmers endured everything, they suffered, and they are not furious. I do not want to put them in that category. I will ask them to negotiate with intelligence with the government," he added.When asked if he can act as a mediator between Centre and protesting farmers, Governor categorically denied it, saying the government would solve it by itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-governor-satya-pal-malik-warns-centre-not-to-suppress-farmers-movement-101612091230969.html
31-01-2021||India||Day after joining BJP, former TMC minister lashes out at Mamata govt||Former West Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday, came down heavily on his previous party --- the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) --- at his first BJP rally in Howrah on Sunday.“The end of TMC has begun. We (BJP) would reach the target of winning more than 200 assembly seats set by Shah (home minister Amit Shah) in the coming elections. Today, people of Bengal are frustrated. There is no employment, no industry...law and order has reached the rock-bottom. The government has done nothing for the minority and has just used them as a vote bank,” former TMC heavyweight Banerjee, while floating the slogan “Cholun Paltai (let’s change)”.Six TMC leaders, including a former minister, joined the BJP at Shah’s residence in New Delhi on Saturday evening. They were flown to Delhi in a chartered plane after Shah’s two-day trip to West Bengal had to be cancelled because of a minor blast in the national capital. Smriti Irani began her speech in Bengali. “You (Mamata Banerjee) have deprived the farmers of Bengal for two years from central benefits. It is because in TMC no work is done unless you get cut money. Where there is theft there is TMC. So people of Bengal have decided that this time TMC will go out and BJP will come in,” she added. Top BJP leaders hinted that more TMC leaders from Kolkata and South 24 Parganas, two bastions of the state’s ruling party, could join the BJP over the next three weeks. Several district level leaders of the TMC and Congress joined the BJP in Sunday’s programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-joining-bjp-former-tmc-minister-lashes-out-at-mamata-govt-101612091368138.html
31-01-2021||India||Mamata govt has given free access to infiltrators: Amit Shah||The Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal has given free access to infiltrators, Union home minister Amit Shah said on Sunday. Addressing a rally online at Howrah in south Bengal, Shah said: “I want to ask this rally whether the Mamata Banerjee-government would be able to stop this infiltration. Only the Narendra Modi government can stop this.” Shah was scheduled to visit West Bengal on a two-day visit, but had to cancel the trip after a blast outside the Israeli mission in New Delhi on Friday. “The Trinamool Congress has taken Bengal further down from where the Left had left the state ten years ago. Didi had raised slogans of change. One of the slogans was “Ma, Mati, Manush” (mother, soil and people). But later it vanished and was replaced by dictatorship, nepotism and extortion,” he added. He said the Bharatiya Janata Party will bring about the promised change. Shah assured that he would soon come to Bengal. “The way people are joining the BJP from TMC by the time elections come Mamata Banerjee will be left alone,” he added. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls where the party won 18 of the 42 seats, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-seat legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-govt-has-given-free-access-to-infiltrators-amit-shah-101612089024341.html
31-01-2021||India||Sonu Sood moves SC against HC order on illegal construction notice||Actor Sonu Sood has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court order which dismissed his appeal against a BMC notice over alleged illegal construction at his residential building in Mumbai's Juhu area.Sood's petition stated that his application for conversion has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) permission.It said the high court order dated January 13, 2021 has been passed without considering the provisions of Section 43 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and his application for conversion of residential premises into a residential hotel was submitted in 2018 before the department concerned.The plea contended that their application for conversion, which has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to MCZMA, be directed to be decided by authorities concerned.“The petitioners have already stopped the work of internal renovation which require no permission as per the provisions of Section 43 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, therefore, the respondents may kindly be restrained from demolition of the renovation work already done in the building,” the plea filed by Sood and his wife said.Also read| Janhvi Kapoor returns to Mumbai after farmers stall film shoot for 3rd timeSood further stated that if the application of the petitioners for conversion is approved, the financial loss due to demolition will not be recovered in any manner and would cause miscarriage of justice to the petitioners.The HC, while dismissing the actor's appeal and application, said, "Law helps only those who are diligent."Sood's lawyer had sought a time of 10 weeks to comply with the notice issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in October last year, and requested the HC to direct the civic body to not initiate demolition action.The high court, however, refused and said the actor had ample opportunity in the past and if required, he could approach the civic body.Sood had approached the high court earlier this month challenging an order of a city civil court at Dindoshi that had dismissed his suit against the BMC's notice issued over the alleged illegal construction carried out by him.The actor, in the interim application in HC, had sought an order from the high court restraining the BMC from taking any coercive action against his residential property in Juhu area.Also read| Kiara arrives to meet Sidharth, is surprised to see paparazzi outside his home“The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Sood's advocate had argued in HC.As per the BMC, the Bollywood actor had carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building ''Shakti Sagar'', and allegedly converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions.The BMC earlier this month also filed a complaint at the Juhu police station, seeking an FIR to be lodged against Sood for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without permission.The complaint letter was sent to the police after the BMC inspected the building and found that Sood had allegedly not complied with the requisitions and was continuing unauthorised construction even after the notice was served to him in October last year. The police is yet to register FIR in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonu-sood-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-illegal-construction-notice-101612086659162.html

Here are 160 million reasons||India’s foreign ministry is working on a plan to supply over 160 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 60 countries and Unicef by the end of March, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The vaccine supplies include about 10 million doses in gifts, which in the first round, focused on India’s extended neighbourhood.India has received formal and informal requests for the vaccine from 60 countries that are home to more than one-fifth of humanity, an external affairs ministry official said.According to available figures, India’s Serum Institute has already dispatched 14.5 million doses of the vaccine to 11 countries. Apart from countries in the neighbourhood, the recipients for the shot developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University include Brazil and Morocco, who were supplied on a commercial basis. The external affairs ministry targets dispatching a total of 33 million doses this month."There are as many as 30 countries who have written to India formally and an equal number who have asked for the vaccine informally. Then there are countries like Afghanistan who have done neither but India is committed to supplying. We are planning to send 10 million doses to Africa alone. The 30 countries that have formally asked India for vaccine include Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Serbia, Guyana (CARICOM), Egypt, Morocco, Maldives, Mauritius, Bahrain, Oman, UAE, Iran, Brazil, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, St Kitts and Nevis, Mongolia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Philippines, Algeria, Tunisia, South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini and Kenya," a top government official said.Also read | Now, SII seeks trial approval for Novavax Covid vaccineIn February, according to documents seen by HT, India intends to fly 60 million doses to friendly countries across the world, right from Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, Papua New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific Ocean to Nauru, the world’s smallest island nation near Australia. In March, HT learned that India hopes to fly out nearly 80 million doses. Nearly half of the 160 million doses would be routed through Unicef.An official said the numbers are tentative and could change once the final regulatory approvals come.In addition to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is marketed as Covishield in India by the Pune-headquartered Serum Institute, India is using Covaxin developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech. This vaccine has not yet reached the trial endpoint to determine efficacy rate.India rolled out its domestic Covid-19 vaccination programme on January 16 and almost simultaneously, started sending supplies to neighbouring countries and others, both as gifts and on a commercial basis. Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week promised to keep the vaccines flowing.

31-01-2021||India||Uncertainty over Bombay HC judge behind controversial POCSO rulings||Uncertainty looms over the future of justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court after the Supreme Court collegium, in an unprecedented step, withdrew its proposal to make her a permanent judge in the high court in view of her controversial rulings on sexual assault on children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).Justice Ganediwala’s fate hangs in the balance since her tenure as an additional judge ends on February 12 and if the SC collegium, headed by the Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, decides not to extend her term as an additional judge, she will cease to be a judge.Under the constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum period of two years unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium to the Central government, or the tenure can be extended for up to two years, pending review of the judge’s performance.Justice Ganediwala has courted controversies after a series of her judgments on the interpretation of the POCSO Act came under severe criticism. In January 19 ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not a case of sexual assault but only of molestation, since there was no ‘skin to skin’ contact. This judgment was stayed by a Supreme Court bench, led by the CJI, on Wednesday. In another judgment on January 15, the woman judge had ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault.”On Saturday, officials in the law ministry and the Supreme Court confirmed to HT that the collegium has recalled its recommendation to make justice Ganediwala a permanent judge in the Bombay HC. On January 20, the SC collegium had passed a resolution, and the file had reached the law ministry a day later.However, the officials added, on January 25, a missive was sent by the SC collegium requesting for a withdrawal of the proposal to make justice Ganediwala a permanent judge. The note by the SC collegium stated that the proposal regarding the woman judge was to be reviewed again.The law ministry then sent the file back with a short note that the proposal was being returned on a request by the collegium and that if a fresh proposal with respect to justice Ganediwala was to be sent again, the ministry will need around a week to process it.“This is unprecedented. There has been no such instance when after sending a proposal to the government for appointing an additional judge as a permanent judge, the collegium has, in less than a week’s time, withdrawn its recommendation,” said a law ministry official, who didn’t wish to be named.Meanwhile, officials in the top court have said that the CJI, who has Bombay HC as his parent high court, consulted the two other most senior judges in the collegium, justices NV Ramana and Rohinton F Nariman, before taking this unparalleled step.Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, who also hail from Bombay HC as their parent high court, had also drawn the CJI’s attention to the contentious judgments by the woman judge, imploring the CJI to withdraw the proposal.After this move by the collegium, a state of doubt prevails over justice Ganediwala’s continuance as a high court judge. According to the high court rules and the pertinent norms, justice Ganediwala, 42, cannot be sent back to the subordinate judiciary either as a sessions judge or a district judge.There are some other options also available with the SC collegium. It can extend justice Ganediwala’s term for any term between six months and two years for reviewing her performance.Alternatively, the collegium may also choose to send a proposal to the government after February 12 to appoint her as an additional judge, but that would make her appointment as good as a fresh one, and a break in her service will adversely impact justice Ganediwala’s seniority.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan told HT: “It is not a wrong step taken by the chief justice. It is not a simple decision but if there is a judgment which is in flagrant violation of the law, a chief justice is entitled to not make an additional judge a permanent judge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uncertainty-over-bombay-hc-judge-behind-controversial-pocso-rulings-101612087417805.html

The focus would now be on the 114 fighter jets project," government sources told ANI.The IAF has already issued the Request for Information for the tender and would be soon moving a proposal for getting the Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) before the Defence Ministry for the multi-billion dollar project which would enable it to acquire 4.5 plus generation aircraft in large numbers to match the capabilities of the omni role Rafale fighters 36 of which have started getting inducted from last year.Also read| What to expect from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget 2021-22The Request for Information (RFI) has been responded to by several global players including fighter jet manufacturers from the US, France, Russia and Sweden.While the Americans are offering from the F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Super Hornet and an F-16 variant by the name of F-21, the Russians are likely to offer the MiG-35 and a Sukhoi fighter. Sweden's Saab is looking to pitch in with its Gripen fighter aircraft which it says is far more advanced than the one which was offered in 2007 to the Indian Air Force. France would be participating in the tender with the Rafale fighter jets.Recently, Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria had termed the Rafale as one of the strong contenders for the 114 fighter acquisition project.Sources said that for selection in the project, the main aspects would be the capabilities of the aircraft on offer along with the price at which it is offered.

The government is not only suffering revenue loss due to illegal mining but also unnecessarily, the department’s image is tarnished,” the official mentioned above, said.The standing committee has recommended de-notifying the sanctuary area to SBWL. Once the SBWL approves, it will be further recommended to the National Board of Wildlife, said the official.Bharatpur district collector Nathmal Didel said the mining, forest and revenue departments have studied the area of Banshi Pahadpur and found that there was no forest cover or animals for the last three decades. “We are trying to de-notify the area of sanctuary to permit mining. If the mining is legalised, it would not only generate revenue but also create employment,” he said.A recommendation has been made to de-notify around 643ha of 2000-hectare land of Banshi Pahadpur wildlife sanctuary for mining, he said.A retired IFS official, on condition of anonymity, said this would be the second such instance, when a forest land would be de-notified in the state. Earlier in 2017, the Rajasthan government had de-notified 357.23 hectares of Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, falling in Bundi town and adjoining villages, paving the way for the residents of these areas to avail benefits of various development schemes.He said the first instance was for housing, “but today it’s for mining - what precedent are we setting,” he asked.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which has been sourcing stones from the Banshi Pahadpur hills for the construction of the Ram Temple for the past five years, had approached the Bharatpur district administration over a delay in supply of stones in September-October 2020.Also Read: Rajasthan launches health insurance scheme, 1.10 crore families to benefitThe district administration had then said that the stones were being illegally mined after three trucks, loaded with the pink sandstones, were seized on September 27 in a joint operation of the police, forest and revenue departments.An official of the district administration said, “The pink and yellow sandstone is in high demand. Illegal mining activity in the area feeds processing units in the district. The district administration takes action against illegal mining randomly.”According to the state mines department officials, until December 1996, around 42 legal mines of pink, red and yellow sandstone operated in the Banshi Pahadpur forest area. However, the Supreme Court prohibited non-forest activities in forest areas without diversion under the Forest Act through its order dated December 12, 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-panel-wants-forest-area-supplying-stones-for-ram-temple-denotified-101612086699361.html

Raut, in his weekly column, said the politics is driving the country towards instability.The Sena leader in his column RokhThok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, said that the ill-treatment of the farmers’ from Punjab, by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, would spark unrest in the country.On January 26, during the farmers’ tractor rally, groups of farmers deviated from the assigned routes, broke through security barriers and clashed with security personnel in several parts of Delhi. They also vandalised property and entered the Red Fort, where they hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag.Raut said that the events of January 26 could have been avoided by the Centre. He alleged that the ‘infiltration’ at Red Fort was engineered to cause a split among the protesting farmers.Raut also questioned the silence of PM Modi and Amit Shah over the entire issue. “Neither the Prime Minister has spoken, nor has our home minister. Modi and Shah are leading the country by occupying constitutional posts. Such a treatment of Punjab’s farmers is sparking unrest in the country,” the Sena leader wrote.He further added, “The country has once experienced what happens when a spark of revolt is lit in the Sikhs. Therefore, linking the farmer’s stir to Punjab’s issues and causing unrest in Punjab should not happen. The government has engineered a split in the farmers’ protest. The infiltration at Red Fort was done to cause a split. Politics is driving the country toward instability.

31-01-2021||India||India monsoon season likely to be ‘normal’ in 2021: Report||India should experience a “normal” June-September monsoon season as the effects of the La Nina weather pattern ease, according to a report by Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd.“There is sufficient cooling in the Pacific Ocean now and La Nina conditions are at the peak,” the private forecaster said on its website on Sunday, adding that initial readings indicate that there are still risks in some areas.The monsoon season is considered normal when total rains are recorded between 96% and 104% of the national average of just over 88 centimeters (45 inches), according to the weather office.The monsoon season is critical for Indian agriculture as it not only irrigates fields directly, but also fills reservoirs for crops sown in the winter. The season shapes the livelihood of millions and influences food prices. Insufficient rain in the country, the world’s second-largest producer of rice and wheat, often leads to drinking-water shortages, lower crop output and higher imports of commodities such as edible oils.About 60% to 90% of the country’s total annual rainfall occurs during the four-month monsoon season across different states, except the southern state of Tamil Nadu, which gets only about 35% of its annual rainfall during the period, according to the India Meteorological Department.Last year, the monsoon was driven by the La Nina phenomenon -- when the equatorial Pacific cools - which is peaking at present. La Nina will decline during the spring and turn neutral later through the monsoon season, Skymet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-monsoon-season-likely-to-be-normal-in-2021-report-101612083837077.html
31-01-2021||India||In Rajya Sabha, first part of budget session will adjourn on Feb 13||The first part of the budget session will adjourn in the Upper House on February 13, two days ahead of the original schedule, an all-party meeting chaired by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu decided on Sunday. The decision has been arrived at to give more time to the standing committees of the House to examine the demand for grants—or individual budget—of different ministries. Before the Union budget is passed by the Lok Sabha, both Houses of Parliament examine the annual budget of select ministries for a better review of the overall budgetary procedure by the lawmakers. “It was decided that instead of the scheduled sitting on the 15th of this month as the last of the first part of the Budget session, the House will sit on the 13th before adjourning to enable the Department Related Parliamentary Committees to examine Demands for Grants of various departments and ministries,” according to a press release issued after the all-party meeting. In the meeting, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu issued an appeal to leaders of various parties and groups in the House for effective functioning during the ongoing Budget session. Despite some major disruptions, the Rajya Sabha has been able to utilize nearly 100% of its time in the last four sessions. According to the officials, various parties have assured there will be full participation in all the debates and discussions in the House. The meeting was attended by at least six ministers and 25 leaders of various parties. As the schedule in the Rajya Sabha will undergo a change, Naidu asked the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Prahlad Joshi, to rework the time schedule for debates on President’s address and the general budget. Naidu observed that these two discussions offer ample opportunities to the members to reflect on a wide range of issues for which more time may be allocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rajya-sabha-first-part-of-budget-session-will-adjourn-on-feb-13-101612084709572.html

Her father married again and relocated to Surat, leaving her at the mercy of her uncle and aunt.On Friday morning, a video of the child being stripped and tortured surfaced on the social media.After that, a team of Child Line, an NGO working for children, reached her village. Locals told the team that the child was regularly tortured by her relatives. “…the police was informed…after which victim’s medical examination was conducted around 6.30 pm on the same day and a FIR was registered under relevant sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. After the reports came, both the accused were arrested. While the uncle is around 40 years old, her aunt is in her thirties,” said Bhushan Bhuvan Yadav, superintendent of police (SP), Rajsamand. A member of the Rajsamand Child Welfare Committee (CWC) said the girl was now staying with the NGO that first came to her rescue. “The relatives used to beat her mercilessly on small mistakes.

Sometimes, the couple would also forcefully insert chilli powder inside the private parts of the victim…her nails of hands and legs were uprooted multiple times,” the CWC member said. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson of the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Right, too took cognisance of the matter.

We will never agree to anything under pressure,” he said at the Ghazipur border between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.Follow latest updates on farmers protest hereA day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Centre’s proposal to keep the contentious three agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months still stands and that agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar is just a phone call away for taking forward the talks, Tikait said that protesting farmers will honour the dignity of prime minister, but are also committed to protect their own self-respect.“We will honor and respect the dignity of the prime minister. Farmers don't want that the government or Parliament bows down to them," he told PTI, adding “A middle way should be found.

31-01-2021||India||Assam, Arunachal CMs will be responsible if abducted oil company employees die:ULFA-I||The banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) has warned that the chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be responsible if two abducted employees of a private oil drilling company die in an “undesired incident”. In a release issued on Saturday, the banned outfit accused CMs of the two states of using “delaying tactics” instead of trying to secure release of the employees of Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company. “Instead of finding ways to end the prisoner exchange conflict between ULFA-I and Quippo, the Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs are using delaying tactics and launched a weeklong effort to secure the release of the two officials through military operation,” the ULFA-I release said. “The nod to initiate the operation was given by Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs. Chiefs of the Unified Command have been entrusted the task of making the operation successful along with defence, military, civil and Assam Police intelligence establishments,” it added. Pranab Kumar Gogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, were abducted by a group of miscreants on December 21 from the company’s drilling location in Diyun in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district. Gogoi is a resident of Sivasagar district in Assam while Kumar hails from Khagaria district in Bihar. The company operates oil and gas drilling sites in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. “In these circumstances, we are sure that instead of getting the officials released alive, the Indian establishment wants to end their operation by killing the two and putting the entire blame on ULFA-I,” the ULFA-I release said. “Therefore, it is certain that in the coming days during the operation launched by Unified Command, the two Quippo employees could die in an undesired incident. If that happens, the entire blame of it would have to be borne by the Assam and Arunachal Pradesh CMs and the Indian forces,” it added. On January 28, ULFA-I had issued a statement giving a February 16 deadline to Quippo to secure the release of its employees. If the deadline is not met, the outfit warned it would take action against Kumar, who hails from Bihar. On January 20, ULFA-I had released a video of the two abducted employees where they appealed to the chief ministers of Assam and Bihar to secure their release. On January 12, ULFA-I commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told local TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a “victim” if the company didn’t pay the outfit it’s “due share” for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region. Baruah added that Gogoi, who’s an Assamese, won’t be harmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-arunachal-cms-will-be-responsible-if-abducted-oil-company-employees-dieulfai-101612081284033.html

31-01-2021||India||Made in India Covid-19 vaccines a symbol of nation’s self-pride: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lauded the scientists of the country for indigenously developing two jabs against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in such a short span of time. Addressing the nation on his monthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', the Prime Minister said that Made-in-India vaccines were not only a symbol of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) but also a symbol of the country's self-pride.He reiterated that the world’s largest immunisation drive is underway in India and added, “We are vaccinating our citizens faster than anywhere in the world. In just 15 days, India has vaccinated over 30 lakh corona warriors, whereas an advanced country such as America took 18 days to get the same done; Britain took 36 days.”PM Modi asserted that India is serving the world in times of crisis. “India is capable, self-reliant in the field of medicines, vaccines. The same thought underpins the Atmanirbhar Bharat Campaign. The more India is capable, the more will it serve humanity; correspondingly the world will benefit more,” he said.Also Read: 'India was shocked to see insult of Tricolour on Republic Day', says PM ModiThe Prime Minister also spoke about one of the messages he received through the NamoApp from one Kirti in Madurai, who told Modi that many of her foreign friends have been messaging her thanking India for the way India helped the world in the fight against Covid-19. The PM told the Tamil Nadu resident, “These days, I too receive similar messages for India from Presidents and Prime Ministers of different countries of the world." He referred to President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro’s tweet thanking India for helping with export of vaccines. Bolsonaro also tweeted a picture of Lord Hanuman carrying a mountain with vaccines from India to Brazil. The illustration is inspired by the tale in the Ramayana where Lord Hanuman carries an entire mountain to deliver the Sanjeevani herb to Sri Lanka, to save the life of Lakshmana, the brother of Lord Rama, when he was injured in a battle."People residing thousands of kilometres away in remote corners of the world are deeply aware of that context in Ramayan; they are intensely influenced by it.

The immediate trigger was a video shared by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders which shows Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal speaking in favour of the three laws.The video is doctored, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Sisodia said.Addressing a press conference on the issue, Sisodia said that he felt sad that the BJP had to post an edited version of the Delhi CM’s video in order to establish credibility for the laws.The 18-second clip showed that Kejriwal was listing out the benefits of the new farm laws such as MSP would remain, farmers would be able to sell their produce across India and added that this was a revolutionary step in the agriculture sector in the last 70 years.Y'day BJP & its spokesperson posted a doctored video of Arvind Kejriwal ji stating benefits of farm laws. I was furious over it but also felt sad for BJP that it had to post distorted video clip of Arvind ji to establish credibility of the laws: Delhi Dy CM & AAP's Manish Sisodia pic.twitter.com/Ix86EUKzYs"Yesterday, BJP and its spokesperson posted a doctored video of Arvind Kejriwal ji stating the benefits of farm laws. I was furious over it but also felt sad for BJP that it had to post distorted video clip of Arvind ji to establish credibility of the laws," Sisodia said at the press conference.Furthering his attack on the Centre during the briefing, Sisodia said that the general public had lost trust over the leaders and chief ministers of the BJP and despite PM Modi explaining the benefits of these laws, neither the people nor the farmers were ready to believe."Today, not only BJP, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also lost credibility. BJP understands this very well, that is why they posted a doctored video of Arvind Kejriwal ji," said the Delhi deputy chief minister.Also Read| 'India was shocked to see insult of Tricolour on Republic Day': PM ModiCiting the violence which erupted during the Republic Day tractor rally, Sisodia said that it was orchestrated by the BJP and it further tried to put the blame on the protesting farmers.Meanwhile, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday accused the BJP of orchestrating the clashes at the Singhu border in the national capital on Friday.Amid reports that clashes broke out between the farmers and the local residents at the protest site, the AAP shared two photos of the attackers with Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP MP Manoj Tiwari on Twitter and said that they were BJP leaders and not locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-only-bjp-pm-s-credibility-has-been-dented-due-to-lies-over-laws-sisodia-101612075753519.html

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the sect’s young face, Shantanu Thakur, contested on a BJP ticket and defeated his aunt, TMC’s Mamata Bala Thakur.“The dais is not being dismantled. Shah would come to Thakurnagar any day soon with a few hours’ notice,” said Roy.A few hundred Matuas from across Bengal had gathered at Thakurnagar to listen to Shah’s speech. The Matuas were expecting some statement from the Union home minister over the CAA and the NRC during his now-cancelled rally in Thakurnagar. A sizable chunk of the Hindu refugees belong to backward communities and that adds a caste factor to the political tussle over the amended citizenship law.Also Read: Irani to address Howrah rally in place of Shah, more TMC leader may join BJPThe TMC said that the BJP had insulted the Matua community.“The BJP has nothing to give and has insulted the Matuas. They (the BJP) won’t be able to make any announcement on citizenship and hence cancelled the meeting. The Matua community needs to understand that the BJP is misleading them,” said Mamata Bala Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-virtually-address-bengal-rally-while-bjp-placates-matuas-101612073150866.html

31-01-2021||India||Tamil Nadu assembly election: BJP focuses on central schemes to make a mark||BJP president JP Nadda’s formal announcement of fighting the Tamil Nadu assembly elections, expected in April-May this year, in alliance with the state’s ruling AIADMK, has put the focus back on the saffron party’s bid to gain a foothold in a state it has found difficult to penetrate. Nadda, and the party he leads, are hoping to cash in on the Centre’s social welfare and other centrally-sponsored schemes to earn an edge over the opposition in Tamil Nadu, where its presence is nascent.The benefits that it accrued in state elections held recently in Bihar, where the delivery of central schemes, especially those targeted at women, were credited for helping script the National Democratic Alliance’s victory, have raised the party’s hopes of benefitting from the delivery of funds for programmes such as housing in rural and urban areas; PM Kisan Nidhi and urban infrastructure.This is in addition to the women specific schemes that the AIADMK leader J Jayalalithaa had introduced in her six terms as chief minister. Tamil Nadu has a history of schemes such as free medicines, health insurance and pension to the needy, which were later replicated nationally. However, the AIADMK has been facing allegations of corruption in implementation of these schemes.A senior BJP functionary, speaking on condition of anonymity, said though the party has opted to contest the 2021 assembly election as an ally of the ruling AIADMK; it will focus on the impact of centrally sponsored schemes on providing livelihood, housing, and improving urban infrastructure.“The opposition created falsehoods about the state being neglected. Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi himself set the record straight (in 2018), when he said that there has been an increase of about 120% in the allocation for the state. When the Congress-led UPA was in power at the centre, Tamil Nadu got just ₹81,000 crore under the 13th Finance Commission, but under the BJP-led NDA regime, it increased to ₹180,000 crore under the 14th Finance Commission,” the functionary said.The assertion that the state has been better-off under the NDA rule was made again in November this year by Union home minister Amit Shah during his visit to Chennai. Shah, who laid foundation stones for various infrastructure projects worth about Rs. 70,000 crore said, “The schemes and funds provided to Tamil Nadu by the Central government are not meant for help, but it is the right of Tamil Nadu that was not being given to it. Modi ji ensured that now Tamil Nadu gets its rights."He cited numbers to buttress the claims. 15% of Tamil Nadu's 1.42 crore rural households had drinking water connections thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheme for piped water in every household, he said, adding that by 2024 drinking water will be provided to 1.20 crore families.He also stated that while the previous government had waived off loans of only 60,000 crore in 10 years, the Modi government has transferred ₹95,000 crore directly into the bank account of farmers in three years, of which, about ₹4,404 crore has been directly transferred to 45 lakh farmers of Tamil Nadu.During the party’s month-long Vetrivel Yatra (victorious spear march), the leaders made an effort to highlight several central programmes, including the Ujjwala Yojana and the Individual Household Latrine scheme. However, response to the yatra was tepid.Both the BJP and the AIADMK may have to navigate through the allegations of corruption and leaks in the implementation of some of these schemes.For instance, in September, the Centre was quick to nudge the state government to undertake an enquiry after a scam in the allocation of monies under the PM Kisan scheme was unearthed. This came after the state government said approximately ₹110 crore had been credited to the bank accounts of about 5.5 lakh ineligible people, who had fraudulently registered under the PM Kisan scheme in 13 districts of the state.To counter any negative narrative against the party, the BJP Tamil Nadu president L Murugan launched ‘Farmers’ friend Modi’ campaign in Madurai to explain the three new farm laws across districts alleging the DMK and Congress were misleading the farmers.In the ruling All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s last full-fledged budget, deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam, who handles the finance portfolio, set apart ₹6,500 crore for food subsidy and announced a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to manage the Amma Canteens. “While there are several central schemes spread across all departments which are implemented by the state, most people seem to have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM- KISAN) and Awas Yojana,” said an AIADMK leader on condition of anonymity.But, the focus on the centrally-sponsored schemes is also expected to shield the BJP from any possible anti-incumbency against the AIADMK; to make up for the lack of a structured party cadre on the ground; to alter its image of a Hindi-speaking, upper-caste party.Opposition DMK, however, dismissed notions that there was any traction for BJP government’s schemes on the ground. “There was massive fraud in the PM Kisan scheme. If it is BJP’s pet scheme, serious investigations should have followed, but we don’t know what is happening,” said DMK spokesperson A Saravanan.Saravanan pointed out that there was no toilet in the Kancheepuram agriculture department’s office, where a government employee with disability, S Saranya died after she fell into an open septic tank in December last, as a case of failure of the central government schemes.Also Read: 'BJP, AIADMK will contest together in Tamil Nadu': NaddaPolitical commentator Sumanth C Raman, however, said that banking on the centrally-sponsored schemes for the state elections is unlikely to be rewarding for the BJP, as there is little resonance of their benefits on the ground. “The benefits of these schemes are not talked about. The local media is very hostile to the BJP and they don’t document the schemes or the benefits they have offered to the people in the state,” he said.Raman also said the state leadership has begun to focus on the rural areas, where the party’s presence was weak.In Tamil Nadu, BJP continues to attack the DMK on religious grounds, dynasty politics and the 2G spectrum scam. The party has limited issues to take up since it is in alliance with the ruling AIADMK. In the 2016 assembly elections, BJP was a no-show with a vote share of 2.8%. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP managed one seat but failed to retain it in 2019 but increased its vote share to 3.6%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-assembly-election-bjp-focuses-on-central-schemes-to-make-a-mark-101612069551913.html

Apart from ensuring physical distancing to avoid overcrowding, the theatres and multiplexes have been asked to stagger show timings and digital booking of tickets available, according to a circular by the ministry of information and broadcasting on Sunday.Earlier this week, the ministry of home affairs had issued new Covid-19 guidelines allowing swimming pools to be opened for all and cinema halls to have greater seating capacity than 50 per cent being allowed till now and had said that the SOPs would be shared by the respective ministries.The I&B ministry has asked cinemas to ensure proper crowd management in the parking lots and outside the premises and has also restricted the number of people in elevators. The multiplexes have been suggested to keep longer intermissions to avoid overcrowding in the common areas, lobbies and washrooms during the period.“Audiences may be encouraged to avoid movement during the intermission. Longer intermissions may be used to allow the audience seated in different rows of the auditorium to move in a staggered manner,” the ministry’s statement said.Also, the show commencement time, intermission period and finish time of a show at any screen shall not overlap with the commencement time, intermission period or finish time of a show at any other screen in a multiplex, the government has said.Cinemas have also been asked to control the temperature inside halls and keep it between 24°C and 30°C. Listing further details, the statement said, relative humidity should be in the range of 40-70%, re-circulation of air must be avoided to the extent possible, intake of fresh air should be ensured as much as possible and cross ventilation should be adequate.To be sure, no exhibition of films will be allowed in Covid-19 containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allows-cinema-halls-theatres-to-operate-on-100-capacity-digital-booking-of-tickets-staggered-show-timings-among-new-sops-101612068981979.html

They say that they will monitor me for life. Good, give two security guards who will keep an eye on me for 24 hours. At least, I will be able to save myself from fake cases.""In Uttar Pradesh, the situation is such that the criminals are not monitored, but the history-sheet of innocent persons is opened," he charged.Khan was arrested in January 2020 after a speech he had delivered at the Aligarh Muslim University on December 10, 2019 during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests. He was subsequently booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).On September 1, 2020, the Allahabad High Court had quashed Khan's detention under the NSA and ordered his immediate release, saying his speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) didn't promote hatred or violence.In his video message, Khan also said he had written to the state government requesting it to reinstate him at his post in Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College.Khan hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at the BRD Medical College, in which several children died due to lack of oxygen cylinders. Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for the children for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders but later, faced action, along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kafeel-khan-80-others-included-in-list-of-history-sheeters-in-up-s-gorakhpur-101612065193172.html

The team spent a few hours at the site, which had seen widespread violence, and even collected blood sampled and finger prints, Livehindustan further reported.The Crime Branch has also received 1,700 mobile clips and CCTV footage from the public in connection with the January 26 violence during farmers' tractor rally, according to news agency ANI.As investigation gathered pace, police teams raided various locations in Punjab. They have also identified a person suspected to have hoisted a religious flag at Red fort on Tuesday, people aware of the developments said.Addressing a press conference after the violence, Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava had said that 394 cops and 10 farmers were injured in the clashes that broke out in several places in Delhi. He had said that investigation has been launched and guilty won't be spared.The clashes took place after the farmers deviated from the pre-arranged route and took their tractors towards central Delhi. Thousands of tractors were seen on the roads of Delhi, and the farmers accompanying them attacked the policemen on duty.The protesters also destroyed the buses placed by the police in some areas to stop them.A group of protesters entered the Red Fort where artefacts of historical importance were damaged and a religious flag was hoisted from its ramparts.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rday-violence-84-arrested-forensics-team-collects-samples-from-red-fort-101612059393036.html

This year’s first 'Mann Ki Baat’ address comes a day before finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the budget for the year 2021-22 in Parliament on Monday.In the last episode of Mann Ki Baat, the Prime Minister had reiterated the significance of making the nation self-reliant, urging manufacturers to boost domestic production and make products that have a “zero defect.” “Vocal for local is reverberating in each and every household,” he said, adding, “in such a scenario, it is time to ensure that our products meet global standards. Whatever is the global best; we should make it in India and prove it. For that, our entrepreneur friends have to come forward. Startups too have to come forth.”Modi also reached out to the Sikh community amid the stir over agricultural laws enacted by the government in September last year. The demonstration led by farmers mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have been camping at the borders of the national capital, has been going on for over two months.However, during the address protesters at Delhi’s Singhu and Tikri borders picked up and banged steel plates, used tin cans and canisters and even metal pots used for cooking, in the manner the Prime Minister had asked people to show their gratitude to frontline workers of the Covid-19 battle on March 22 last year, the day of the Janata curfew. “We did not want to hear the prime minister’s Mann ki Baat’. By beating plates, we ensured no one would hear his talk,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Dakonda (Punjab) unit of the Bharatiya Kisan Union.On the Republic Day on Tuesday, farmers’ tractor parade took a violent turn with clashes erupting between them and the Delhi Police as they defied the re-decided routes and entered central Delhi despite cops’ warning. A farmer died and several policemen were injured in the clashes in the Capital.The violence during the rally was condemned, the Prime Minister on Saturday said that the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands.”The Mann Ki Baat programme will air live on All India Radio, Doordarshan and Narendra Modi mobile app at 11am. Akashvani will broadcast it in regional languages immediately after the Hindi broadcast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-nation-on-2021-s-first-mann-ki-baat-programme-today-101612059077143.html
31-01-2021||India||Iran link emerges in Israel embassy attack probe despite false flags: Cops||Investigations by Indian security agencies into the improvised explosive device (IED) blast outside the Israeli Embassy on Friday evening are still not conclusive but the needle of suspicion is pointing towards Iran with local involvement.According to counter-terrorism officials in New Delhi, there is enough to suggest the involvement of Tehran in the blast, although investigators are still looking for the people who actually planted the bomb.“Deliberate efforts have been made to firewall the real prepetrators behind the terror incident with false flags and deniability built into the attack that obviously was carried out at the behest of Iran,” said a senior official who asked not to be named.Queries to the Iranian officials went unanswered at the time of going to press.New Delhi has taken the heinous attack against Israel very seriously and its position is that India cannot be used by any other country to target its perceived enemies. India has close ties with both Israel and Iran, although the two countries, in turn, are enemies. “ Once we have concrete evidence we will take up the matter in very serious terms with the country behind the attack,” said a second official in know of the entire investigation who too asked not to be named.The current investigations, counter-terror officials said, are focused on Indian students who have returned after studying at Qom, one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam, in Iran. The focus is on a particular city in south India and a Shia dominated city in Afghanistan, the officials added.Also read: After blast near Israel embassy, bomb threat call for Tehran flightAccording to available evidence, at 3.27 pm, much before the blast at the Israeli embassy, a Telegram (messaging app) entity, VikarUdDeen@Vikar45 claimed responsibility for the blast near the Israeli Embassy on behalf of an unknown group called “ Jaish ul Hind.” This message was posted by Vikar on a Telegram group in the ISIS linked group Qayam Forum (Telegram ID @brownisbest_88). The Jaish ul Hind has a Facebook account (jaish.ulhind), which is currently locked, a private group with 56 members. The message posted by Vikar was forwarded and posted in several other ISIS linked Telegram groups such as Jaag Muslman Jaag, Muslim Groups and Azaadi ki Awaaz Channel of which Vikar is also a member. ISIS is a hard line Sunni organisation, which considers Shias as non-believers. Investigations have shown that the internet protocol address of Vikar is shown to be Herat in Afghanistan, which has considerable Shia Iran influence. But this appears to be a false flag, the officials said.After the IED exploded around 5.11pm, the investigators recovered a letter addressed to Israeli Ambassador to India, Ron Malka.The letter was addressed to “ The Terrorist, Devil of Terrorist Nation Dr Ron Malka” and was written by someone who identified himself as Sarallah India Hezbollah. While Ya Sarallah means one who is dead but has not yet been avenged, Hezbollah is the Shia Islamist political party in Lebanon with a sword arm — a sworn enemy of Israel. The letter swears revenge for the killing of Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, who were killed in a US drone attack in January 2020, and Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020. The contradiction is that Al Muhandis was very close to Soleimani and fought against ISIS.The letter reads : “ This is just a trailer presented to you, that we can observe you, from eating to …..Mind it, all the participants and partners of Israelian terrorist ideology will be no more in existence. Now get ready for a big and better revenge of our heros (Soleimani, Muhandis and Fakhrizadeh).”The letter claimed that the group has the capacity to “end your life” anytime and that Israeli terror shelters would be destroyed. It ended by saying : “ All you have to do (is) just count your days now.”Malka said he would not like to comment on the letter and would leave the investigation to India.Despite the letter making such tall claims, the IED itself was very basic in nature with ammonium nitrate-fuel oil as main charge, a non-electrical detonator and bicycle ball bearings as shrapnel. According to the counter-terror officials, it did not appear to be the creation of an expert bomb maker but that of some one who was guided to make a device through a cyber handler.Given that an Iran link was being established through the recovered letter, external affairs minister S Jaishankar talked to his Israeli counterpart, as did the National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. Doval made a call and briefed the Israelis despite being abroad on a visit.The matter could take a serious diplomatic turn, South Block officials said. This is not the first time Iran has been involved in an attack of this kind in India. Three Quds agents through an Indian conduit targeted the wife of the Israeli Defence Attache on February 13, 2012 with a magnetic bomb. While the agents managed to escape, the then UPA-regime discreetly rapped Iran on its knuckles and told it not to repeat this again in New Delhi.Once it finds concrete evidence, the Narendra Modi government will send a strong message to Tehran, the South Block officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iran-angle-with-local-connivance-key-line-of-embassy-blast-probe-101612058202614.html

31-01-2021||India||Let govt tell farmers why can’t it repeal farm laws: Rakesh Tikait||BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday asked the Centre to explain to farmers why it does not want to repeal the three farm laws, while promising it that they “will not let the government bow its head” before the world. TIkait appeared to make the conciliatory offer to the government from a position of strength amid swelling support for farmers' stir with hundreds of villagers pouring in at the key protest site, Gazipur’s UP Gate on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. Also Read | ‘Not going to war’: Farmers’ leader calls for peaceful protest“What is the compulsion of the government that it is adamant on not repealing the new farm laws?,” asked Tikait, who has emerged virtually overnight as a potent face of farmers’ stir following his emotional appeal to the farming community against leaving the protest site. “The government can tell its reasons to farmers and we (farmers) are the kind of people who believe in the panchayat system. We will never let the government bow its head in shame in front of the world,” Tikait said, apparently striking a conciliatory note. “We have an ideological fight with the government, something which can neither be fought with sticks and guns nor suppressed by them. The farmers will return home only when the new laws are repealed,” the BKU national spokesperson asserted. The younger son of Bharatiya Kisan Union’s late president Mahendra Singh Tikait, made the assertion with hundreds of villagers, including women and children reaching the protest site at Delhi eastern border, during the day – some with water and homemade food and others with buttermilk -- in a symbolic show of support for protestors. Also Read | ‘Repeal of laws must to resolve impasse’: SAD president Sukbir Singh BadalThe day also saw more politicians throwing in their weight behind the Tikait’s growing strength and meeting him at the protest site. The BKU-led protest against the Centre's new farm laws appeared to be fizzling out following the Republic Day violence in Delhi during the tractor rally, but more protestors joined the stir after a 'mahapanchayat' of farmers on Saturday in Muzaffarnagar. Addressing the protesting farmers, Tkait said farmers believe in the Gandhian principle of non-violence and have full faith in the Constitution and appealed to everyone for maintaining peace. “The farmers won't mind if the police even baton-charged them but if goons of political parties dare touch them, neither the farmers nor their tractors would leave the site,” he asserted. “The tears that I shed the other day were not mine but of all farmers,” he added, imparting an emotional edge to his address. Politicians continued to reach the protest site at UP Gate for a second day, even as Tikait insisted that no political leader would be allowed on the central platform and meetings with them would happen only off stage. The political leaders who met Tkait on Saturday and extended his support to him included Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Chautala and Gujjar leader and former MLA Madan Bbhaiyya. Tikait's spiritual guru and founder of Neelkanth Ashram Amit Maharaj also reached the protest site, carrying Gangajal for him. He gave the holy water to Tikait to consume and blessed him, paying God to give him the strength to transform the stir into a “mega movement” of farmers."The movement was and is strong," BKU's Meerut Zone president Pawan Khatana told PTI. Khatana said there has been continuous support for the "peaceful protest" against the farmers' demand for removal of the new farm laws. Asked about the estimated crowd size at the site, he said, "Farmers are coming in to show the solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd." The Delhi Traffic Police said to-and-fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed. “Three super zonal magistrates, 14 zonal magistrate and 34 sector magistrates from the administration besides senior police officers are on the ground where law and order is under control,” Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told PTI. “Mobile toilets have been stationed at the protest site and water facilities have been restored,” he said, adding the situation was being monitored at the border. Internet services, however, will remain suspended till Sunday night in view of the Centre's order to “maintain public safety and averting public emergency”, the administration said. Around 3,000 security personnel including those from the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, were deployed at the protest site, according to officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-govt-tell-farmers-why-can-t-it-repeal-farm-laws-rakesh-tikait-101612055024581.html
31-01-2021||India||Amid tight security, Elgar Parishad 2nd edition held in Pune||Three years after violence broke out in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village, the second edition of the Elgar Parishad was held in Pune on Saturday with roughly 500 people in attendance and heavy security arrangements.Academic, activists and writers from Dalit, Left, Muslim and other social organisations addressed the event, held at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch in Pune.The first edition of the Elgar Parishad was held on December 31, 2017 in Pune’s historic Shaniwar Wada, and attended by thousands. A day later, caste clashes broke out in Bhima Koregaon, roughly 30km away from Pune, during the bicentennial celebration of a British-era war. Tens of thousands of Dalit people from across the country congregate at Bhima Koregaon annually for the event.Saturday’s event was organised by the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyan, an umbrella body of 250 Dalit, Left and other social organisations. It was addressed by Booker Prize winning author Arundhati Roy, former bureaucrat Kannan Gopinathan, former Bombay HC judge BG Kolse Patil, journalist Prashant Kanojia and others.The speakers attacked the central government for arresting prominent activists and lawyers in connection with the 2018 violence. The authorities allege that the Elgar Parishad event was part of a broader Maoist conspiracy to foment violence in Bhima Koregaon.Roy also opposed three recently passed farm laws, which thousands of farmers are opposing despite government assuranes on minimum support prices. “ Lakhs of farmers are suffering due to the unjust laws and it has been their demand that the three laws be withdrawn by the government immediately. The farmers have been peacefully protesting for past two months but concerted efforts are being taken by the Centre to defame the farmers agitation ,” she said.Condemning the action against academics, activists and others in the Bhima Koregaon case, she said “Today one has to be careful about every comma and word you speak or write as police cases are lodged at slightest pretext…holding Elgar is the need of the hour for the fight against capitalism, and casteist patriarchy.”Gopinathan said “The central government is foolish as it is branding dissenting intellectuals as urban naxals, addressing Jawaharlal Nehru University students as tukde tukde gang, Sikhs as khalistanis and Muslims as jihadis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-tight-security-elgar-parishad-2nd-edition-held-in-pune-101612051188753.html
31-01-2021||India||India protests as vandals target Gandhi statue in US||India on Saturday condemned the vandalising of Mahatma Gandhi statue in California by unidentified persons, the second such incident in the US in little more than a month, and sought a thorough investigation into the matter.The statue in the city of Davis in California, which was gifted by the Indian government in 2016, was vandalised by “unknown persons” on January 28, the external affairs ministry said.The six-foot bronze statue was broken and ripped from its base within a park, outraging Indian-Americans across the US. “The government of India strongly condemns this malicious and despicable act against a universally respected icon of peace and justice,” the ministry said in a statement.The Indian embassy in Washington took up the issue with the US state department and called for a “thorough investigation into the incident and appropriate action against those responsible for this act”. India’s consulate in San Francisco in California state separately took up the matter with the city of Davis and local law enforcement authorities, who initiated an investigation. The mayor of Davis “deeply regretted the incident” and said authorities had initiated a probe, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-protests-as-vandals-target-gandhi-statue-in-us-101612052200488.html
31-01-2021||India||‘Bare necessities delivered in 2018 significantly better than 2012 level’: CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian||A day after he presented the Economic Survey, chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian spoke at length about the finer points of his assessment of the economy, India’s response to the Covid pandemic, the farm protests and more with Sunetra Choudhury. Edited excerpts:Did your office work closely in deciding the government response to the pandemic?As part of government process, it is expected that inputs are taken from all of us. The role that my office plays is that we look at research. Early on in the pandemic, we read a lot about the Spanish Flu. The other key part was a Hansen and Sargeant paper which said that when you are faced with an environment of enormous uncertainty, the right policy response is to minimise losses. The Mahabharata says “Saving a life that’s in jeopardy is the origin of dharma”. So we combined elements from economics, epidemiology and scriptures.What do you make of the Opposition’s criticism of your projection of 11% GDP growth?When the estimates of the first quarter were released, we mentioned that there will be a V-shaped recovery. None of us is an astrologer. We track 58 indicators to make our estimation. The 11% projection is certainly achievable. When people say that a decline has happened for the first time in 40 years, we must keep in mind that we have encountered a pandemic. Even if there was no lockdown, we would not have travelled or visited restaurants, and the uncertainty would have impacted discretionary spending, consumption and investment.Much of the government’s response came in the form of easier loans and credit. Many have argued that direct cash transfers would be better. What is your response to that?I think the Indian response was based on foundational economic principles, which is that when there is uncertainty, households do not spend on discretionary items. For instance, there is evidence in the economic survey that the balance of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana increased by 500 rupees. It is in the 400 million households at the bottom of the pyramid that the savings increased, which means that there was no consumption. During the lockdown, people would not have indulged in discretionary spending, it would have wasted fiscal space. Once the unlock was initiated, discretionary spending was focused on.What do you make of Dr Manmohan Singh’s statements that the pandemic has increased inequality?I think we have to look at the strength of the economic argument rather than the person making it. The chapter on inequality and growth in the Economic Survey has a resounding answer to such arguments. I think their commentaries are based on conversations in advanced economies, where there is a conflict between inequality and growth. In India, this kind of tension doesn’t manifest. The stage of India’s development is different. Our potential growth rate is much higher and the opportunity to lift people out of poverty is also different. So, we should be focusing on growth. We have stated in the Economic Survey that about 85% of the reduction in poverty has come from economic growth. Those resources can be used for redistribution.Are you saying that the trickle-down effect will lift the poor out of poverty?No, when you expand the pie, the resources that you get can be used for redistribution. The trickle-down effect does not involve redistribution. Dr Manmohan Singh should note that there has been significant improvement in the bare necessities delivered in 2018 vis-a-vis 2012.Would you look at redistribution of wealth taxes?Given our state of development, we have to be careful. We don’t just want to read the Thomas Pikettys of the world who make good arguments for advanced economies because we can’t cut, paste and implement them here. We should continue to focus on growth so that the pie expands.You praised the new farm laws but the IMF has said that they need safety nets. What kind of safety nets would you propose?I think the PM-Kisan [Yojana] has provided a safety net. It is important the small farmer is provided options. At present, the small farmer is beholden to APMC [system] and the middleman.Why aren’t the farmers accepting the laws?That is the political economy. If you go by the income of farmers in Punjab and Haryana, they are far richer than farmers in other states. There are other dimensions here that are beyond economics which I am not going to comment on. We must also note the number of surveys and the committees that have recommended these reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bare-necessities-delivered-in-2018-significantly-better-than-2012-level-cea-101612050432824.html
31-01-2021||India||‘Not going to war’: Farmers’ leader calls for peaceful protest||Farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal on Saturday alleged that there was a “conspiracy” to provoke the farmers protesting at the Singhu border, adding that they would not indulge in any violence.“We have been holding a peaceful agitation at Delhi’s borders. The agitation is peaceful today as well,” Rajewal, the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), told reporters here.Stressing on the need to protest peacefully, Rajewal said, “I appeal to people to join the peaceful protest (in Delhi) but don’t do anything even under the sway of emotions if someone tries to instigate you. We should keep in mind that we are not going to war. This is our country and our government.”Rajewal’s comments come against the backdrop of the police and protesters clashing at the Singhu border after a group, claiming to be locals, pelted the protesters with stones.Also read: PM Modi at all-party meeting says offer to farmers standsAsserting that “local people” were with the farmers, Rajewal alleged those behind the Singhu border incident were “BJP and RSS people”. “The government is trying to provoke us for violence. We will not indulge in any violence. We are alert to prevent any violence,” he said.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders for the last 65 days in protest against Centre’s three new farm laws, which, they say, will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri-businesses.The government has maintained that the laws aim to ease restrictions on farm trade by setting up free markets, allow traders to stockpile food for future sales and lay down a framework for contract farming.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-going-to-war-farmers-leader-calls-for-peaceful-protest-101612050181285.html
31-01-2021||India||‘Repeal of laws must to resolve impasse’: SAD president Sukbir Singh Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal has called for peace and calm after violence during the farmers’ protest on January 26. He asked the Centre to revoke three farm laws that have prompted widespread protests. Excerpts from an interview with Gurpreet Singh Nibber:After what happened on January 26, what do you think is the way forward for the farmers’ agitation?Peace should be maintained at all costs. I think the Centre, rather than resolving the issue, is creating problems and instigating the farmers for violence.Can anything less than repeal of the farm laws work as a solution?For whom are these laws? It is not the first time that a demand is being raised to withdraw a law. In the past, hundreds of laws were repealed and even the Constitution has been amended. It is such a strong movement but, sadly, the government is adamant. A government is for the betterment of the people and the issue here concerns farmers, who exceed any other section of society in numbers.Also read: Rakesh Tikait says 'let govt tell farmers why can’t it repeal farm laws'What role do you see for yourself as president of the Shiromani Akali Dal — ‘the party of the peasants’?I have no role as such at this stage of the protest when farmers are at the centrestage. As president of the SAD, I appeal to people to get united for the sake of farmers, especially when efforts are being made to divide people on communal lines.Your party is in touch with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. Comments?Sixteen parties boycotted Friday’s address by the President on the opening day of Budget Session, which shows the BJP-led government’s popularity among the political parties. We are in touch with the parties and we will hold a meeting and come out with an action plan.How can the ongoing standoff between farmers and government be resolved?It’s very easy. All three farm laws could be repealed in the current Budget Session and for next 18 months, the Centre can hold talks with the stakeholders. What’s the problem in holding discussions? We are a democracy, or the government should say it’s dictatorship. The government has already offered to keep laws on hold for 18 months..What’s your advice to the protesting farmers?They must maintain peace and communal harmony at all costs. The government on its part should also not blame a section for every agitation, as they have labelled the protesters as “Khalistanis”. Farmers are the biggest nationalists and nation’s backbone. If farmers prosper, India, too, prospers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-of-laws-must-to-resolve-impasse-sad-president-sukbir-singh-badal-101612049802855.html

Thousands of farmers participated in the meeting. Besides RLD leaders, Sanjay Lathar of the Samajwadi Party (SP) was present at the mahapanchayat.The leaders asked farmers to strengthen the agitation on Delhi borders and support Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait.Thousands are protesting at key border points near Delhi, demanding repeal of three central agricultural laws that they say will hurt their livelihood. Tikait’s group has stayed put at the Ghazipur border despite an eviction notice by authorities.“We have to stay united in this fight and maintain our cool,” said Chaudhary. He informed the gathering that his father and RLD president Ajit Singh had spoken to Tikait on the phone and assured him all support.“We might have lost elections but would not let farmers be defeated,” he said.He reminded the gathering about his grandfather former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, who took up farmers’ issues with India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He asked farmers to stand by those leaders and parties which backed their cause.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rld-leader-jayant-chaudhary-urges-farmers-to-stay-united-101612049476051.html
31-01-2021||India||Collegium recalls nod for permanent posting||Uncertainty looms over future of Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court after the Supreme Court (SC) collegium, in an unprecedented step, has withdrawn its proposal to make her a permanent judge in the high court in view of her controversial rulings on sexual assault on children under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.Justice Ganediwala’s fate hangs in the balance since her tenure as an additional judge ends on February 12, and if the SC collegium, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, decides not to extend her term as an additional judge, she will cease to be a judge.Under the constitutional provisions, an additional judge can be appointed for a maximum period of two years unlike permanent judges, who are appointed till the age of 62. Further, an additional judge can either be made permanent following a recommendation by the collegium, or the tenure can be extended as an additional judge for up to two years.Justice Ganediwala has courted controversies after her judgments on interpretation of the Pocso Act came under criticism. In a January 19 ruling, she held that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not sexual assault but only molestation under IPC. This judgment was stayed by a Supreme Court bench, led by the CJI. In another judgment on January 15, the judge ruled that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault”.On Saturday, people in the law ministry and the Supreme Court confirmed to HT that the collegium has recalled its recommendation to make Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge. On January 20, the SC collegium passed a resolution, and the file reached law ministry a day later.However, the people added, on January 25, a missive was sent by the SC collegium requesting for a withdrawal of the proposal. The note by the SC collegium stated that the proposal regarding the judge was to be reviewed again.The law ministry then sent back the file with a note that the proposal was being returned on a request by the collegium and if a fresh proposal was to be sent again, the ministry will need around a week to process it.“There has been no such instance when after sending a proposal to the government for appointing an additional judge as a permanent judge, the collegium has withdrawn its recommendation,” said a law ministry official familiar with the matter.Former CJI KG Balakrishnan told HT: “...It is not a simple decision but if there is a judgment which is in flagrant violation of the law, a chief justice is entitled to not make an additional judge a permanent judge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/collegium-recalls-nod-for-permanent-posting-101612049038498.html

31-01-2021||India||LJP skips NDA meet on budget session strategy||Differences between the Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party led to the latter’s absence from a meeting of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners on Saturday, people aware of the developments said.The meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was held to discuss the NDA’s strategy for the Budget Session of Parliament.A person aware of the developement said the JD(U) took umbrage at the invitation sent to LJP chief Chirag Paswan earlier this month to attend the meeting. The two parties have been at loggerheads since the LJP attacked the JD(U) ahead of last year’s assembly election in Bihar and launched a campaign against chief minister Nitish Kumar. The LJP had demanded that the BJP contest the Bihar polls without JD(U) as a partner.“After the JD(U) protested, the BJP leadership conveyed to Paswan that he was not expected at the virtual meeting of the NDA allies,” a functionary aware of the details said on condition of anonymity. Paswan earlier said that while he was invited to attend the meeting, he planned to skip it on health grounds. He also did not attend an all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister earlier in the day.Paswan has been praising PM Modi and even asserted that he would continue to support the BJP at the Centre after pulling out of the coalition in Bihar. A senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity that the LJP cannot be a partner of the NDA at the Centre while it walked out of the alliance in Bihar and targeted the JD(U), with which the BJP runs a coalition government in the state.Paswan could not be reached for a comment. The JD(U)’s KC Tyagi told PTI that his party does not consider the LJP as an NDA ally.At the NDA meeting, PM Modi urged the leaders to use “facts” to counter the “misgivings” created by the Opposition over three farm laws that have triggered farmer protests.According to a person with knowledge of the meeting, the Prime Minister said the opposition parties will try to create misconceptions about the farm laws in the wake of the upcoming assembly elections, but these attempts should be thwarted using facts and data.Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the PM pointed out that this decade was a very important one, just like the decade after the Second World War and unlike earlier, we are not going to be a mute spectator. “We will rise to the occasion based on our traditions and ideals of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the prime minister added,” Joshi said.“Addressing the meeting of NDA leaders, Prime Minister Shri @NarendraModi ji today said that after the pandemic, a new world order is about to take shape & India has a big role to play in the emerging new world order,” Joshi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-skips-nda-meet-on-budget-session-strategy-101612047925927.html
31-01-2021||India||Covid-19: After a year of fear and uncertainty, hope floats||January 30, 2020.The day marked a grim yet important milestone for India.A 21-year-old student who returned from China’s Wuhan tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on that day, marking the beginning of what would turn out to be an unprecedented year presenting never-seen-before challenges.While the pandemic gripped India in the first week of March with infections being reported among those who returned to the national capital region (NCR) and other parts of the country from abroad, it was the case of the Kerala student, and two similar incidents in the state almost at the same time, that announced the arrival of Covid-19 in the country of 1.3 billion people exactly a year ago.“I was speechless when I heard my daughter was positive. When she returned home from Wuhan (the place in China where the outbreak is believe to have begun), where she was pursuing her medical studies, we were really relieved. But when she was tested positive four days later, return we were totally shattered,” said the father of India’s first patient.The young woman was immediately shifted to a treatment facility that the government had built in anticipation of an outbreak. There she stayed for 28 days, till recovery. Two more students who returned from Wuhan tested positive two days later, but they had to spend just 14 days each at designated Covid facilities.The three cases in Kerala marked the beginning of the pandemic in India. And in March, the first wave came. What happened next could be exemplified with many grim firsts.The government imposed stringent curbs on activities and travel on March 25, allowing only essential activities. Before that, it had already announced international travel advisories. With the lockdown in place, businesses downed shutters and streets bustling otherwise fell silent. Flights were grounded and trains were stationed. The lockdown triggered a massive humanitarian crisis with migrant workers, who lost their livelihoods, traversing hundreds of kilometers on foot to reach their villages.After 68 days of hard lockdown, the government began implementing a graded plan to reopen businesses and bring economic activities, hit hard by the restrictions, back on track in June. It also announced a ₹20 lakh crore economic package to negate the effect of the pandemic.“Several measures were taken even before the first case of Covid-19 was reported from India. India’s travel advisories were issued much before WHO (the World Health Organisation) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (in January-end). Several ministries and departments got together in managing the outbreak from the very beginning that saved time between decision taking and execution. Covid-19 testing was ramped up in a short span of time, with the current capacity of performing at least one million tests in a single day in more than 2,000 ICMR -approved labs. All this has been a commendable feat,” said a senior Union health ministry official, requesting anonymity.On January 16, 2021, the world’s largest inoculation drive began in India with Serum Institute of India’s Covishield --- the company is manufacturing the vaccine by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in the country --- and Bharat Biotech’s indigenously produced Covaxin. India is also supplying vaccine to its neighbours.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the national capital witnessed a very effective Covid-19 management strategy due to the “dedication of the Aam Aadmi Party government and our health care workers”.“Our Covid management is being discussed across the world. Delhi’s Covid circumstances were the worst in the world. On November 11, there were 8,500 corona cases in a single day, which were the highest in any city across the world. From that day to today, we are at a point of very low number of cases and a positivity rate of below 0.5%. This is a victory for the people of Delhi and the honest governance they voted for last year,” he said.Also read: US Covid-19 cases surpass 26 million, toll at 438,239As of Friday, India registered 10.73 million cases and about 154,200 fatalities. The country’s seven-day case average stood at 12,485, down from the peak of 93,617 in mid-September. The active case count stood at 172,000 (1.6% of the total cases).In case count, India stood at second place in the world. With 26.5 million cases, the US tops of the list. India’s per million cases were at 7,739, as compared with the US’s 79,832, according to Worldometers.“We have now reached a very low level of transmission of the infection; technically, the epidemic is over and now we are in an endemic phase (where an infection persists at a low level in a population),” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.Kerala, where it all started, still faces several challenges.On Friday, Kerala accounted for 48% of the new 13,064 cases India recorded on the day. The state’s seven-day average of cases is 5,764, 46.2% of the national average.“Kerala is by no means a success story, but I won’t call it a failure too. In the state, the real epidemic started when people started arriving from other states and the Middle East. There were telltale signs to community spread, but many ignored it. The rest of the story is a slow and steady spread of the epidemic,” said G Pramod Kumar, a former senior advisor to the United National Development Programme.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, put up a brave face, saying the state did whatever it could. “Ups and downs are nature of the pandemic. Even some of the developed countries are still struggling with second and third phase of the pandemic,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-after-a-year-of-fear-and-uncertainty-hope-floats-101612043571842.html
31-01-2021||India||Offer to farmers stands: PM at all-party meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday the Centre’s offer to protesting farmers of keeping three agri laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands” as he told an all-party meeting that his government was “committed to reaching a solution through dialogue”, a remark that appeared to reach out to thousands of protesters who have hunkered down at the Capital’s borders.The Prime Minister, however, stood firm against the violence at the Red Fort and other areas of Delhi during a tractor parade by farmers and said the “law will take its own course.”On Republic Day, farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed with the Delhi Police and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.Addressing the all-party meet ahead of the Union Budget, PM Modi said the government was only a “phone call away” for talks with farmers who have been involved in a two-month-long agitation over the three farm laws.Facing 18 opposition parties adamant on the repeal of the farm laws, the Prime Minister reminded them that smaller parties suffer the most if the House doesn’t run and told representatives of the smaller parties that “you must tell all parties, including the BJP and NDA partners, that the House should run so that we get a chance to speak”.Eighteen opposition parties boycotted President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to both houses of Parliament on Friday, the inaugural day of the Budget Session, to protest against the farm laws. The session will run from January 29 to April 8 with a recess from February 15 to March 7. The budget is to be presented in Parliament by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1. Many opposition parties including the Congress are set to continue their protests in Parliament.As one leader after another spoke about the farm issue, the Prime Minister, who chaired the virtual meeting, referred to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s remarks after the 11th meeting between the government and the farm bodies that he was just a phone call away and will come whenever the farmer leaders want to discuss keeping the laws in abeyance.“The same offer of the Indian government still stands. If you know any protester, tell them that the offer is still there and I am sure everyone here wants a solution through dialogue. The government is continuing efforts to find a solution through dialogue,” the PM told the leaders.The PM also condemned the vandalism of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in California, US.“Nearly everyone spoke about the incidents on January 26. The law will take its own course. But on January 30, some people vandalised Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the US. Everyone must think about what are we giving to the country by creating this atmosphere of hatred?” he added.Modi also welcomed any criticism of public policies as they generate fresh ideas, and maintained that in a Post-Covid-19 world, India can’t afford to lose its opportunities.Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that had the three farm bills been sent to a House panel for review, “the protests happening today throughout the country, particularly in northern India and areas surrounding Delhi, would not have happened”. He “strongly condemned” the “unfortunate” and “shameful incident” at the Red Fort and demanded that the culprits be punished.However, he also hit out at the government and said: “It seems that the government, instead of catching the real culprits, is trying to implicate the farmers’ leaders. I don’t think that any sensible farmer leader was party to that incident at the Red fort.”Azad warned that “if innocent farmer leaders are framed, then this agitation will grow exponentially,” asking the government not to “make the mistake of framing the innocent farmer leaders, and it should not be a prestige issue as farmers are our annadaata, our own people”. He also demanded that a discussion be held on the status of the economy, the fall in GDP and growing unemployment. He also said that the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir must be restored as the situation there is was grave.The Centre has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. Farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.All-party meetings such as the one on Saturday are held to discuss legislative agenda for a Parliament session, with leaders of various parties flagging important issues.Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said the opposition parties’ boycott of the President’s address was a “strong message for the Centre to withdraw the farm laws as majoritarianism cannot let farmers suffer”. He demanded an all-party meeting on the farm issue and asked for a threadbare debate on unemployment.The Biju Janata Dal’s Pinaki Misra, who was present at the meeting, said Odisha chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik specifically requested the Union government to have the women’s reservation bill passed in this Budget Session.The Shiv Sena, meanwhile, said it wanted free vaccines for the entire poor population in Maharashtra. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), too, demanded free vaccines, and a debate on Sri Lankan Tamils, while the YSRCP asked for special category status for Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offer-to-farmers-stands-pm-at-all-party-meeting-101612041447381.html
31-01-2021||India||Farm laws like death warrants that must be taken back, says AAP's Sanjay Singh||The newly enacted farm laws like death warrants that must be taken back, said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh on Saturday.While speaking to ANI, Singh said, "Death warrants are taken back, not amended. These new laws are like death-warrant for the farmers."Regarding the suspension of internet services temporarily at the Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri borders and their adjoining areas till January 31, the AAP leader said, "They (government) can suspend the internet...can seize the properties of those protesting...they can do anything but will not be able to make the farmers protest stop as the farmers are determined."Singh further accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of defaming the farmers' protest."There were nine routes pre-decided for the farmer's tractor rally on January 26. There was a peaceful march on the seven routes. BJP was behind the violence at the Red Fort and other areas in Delhi. It was to defame the farmers' protest," he said.There was violence during the tractor march called by farmer unions on January 26 with protestors clashing with police and resorting to vandalism in different parts of Delhi.Farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-like-death-warrants-that-must-be-taken-back-says-aap-s-sanjay-singh-101612033647503.html

The ASI discovered two other structures, believed to be the remains of small shrines, and a portion of the Sari temple. These findings have led ASI experts to believe that the Sari temple complex was built on the Panchayatana model where the main temple is surrounded by four subsidiary shrines.The minister said as the Suka-Sari temple complex and Lingaraj Temple in Bhubaneswar are protected by ASI under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR) Act, there is an urgent need to act quickly in order to salvage and preserve what remains of this priceless ancient Odishan architecture,Pradhan's letter to the culture minister came amid allegations of ASI that the BMC and BDA did not consult it while undertaking demolitions around the heritage structures over the last 3 months in the name of development of the area around Lingaraj Temple. ASI Bhubaneswar circle's superintendent, Arun Mallick said he is clueless about the heritage structures lost during the demolition drives by BMC-BDA on two acre of land surrounding Suka-Sari temple complex for construction of an open arena to accommodate huge number of devotees ahead of Shivaratri this year.“Most of the demolitions were done at night and there is no trace of the debris. During excavations early this week, we found a number of architectural fragments around north-west and north-east corners of Sari temple. There must be more debris that were removed from the site before we stepped in for excavation. I want to check whether the debris contains anything important from the heritage point of view,” Mallick said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-minister-seeks-excavation-of-site-where-temple-ruins-were-found-in-odisha-101612033307930.html

But we can say we're in a safe position. There's a bit of increase in cases in Kerala but the mortality rate is 0.4 per cent. We're still following the strict 'trace, isolate and treat' strategy," she said.Shailaja said Kerala can say it saved more lives at a lesser cost, by following a 'very good' strategy from the starting stage itself."We can say we saved more lives at a lesser cost. When the Covid-19 patients came from other hot spots during the lifting of the lockdown, it was very different to trace the patients, but we continued doing that. I think we have succeeded in limiting the spread of the virus. The peak occurred in Kerala later even though the pandemic occurred in Kerala first. We tried to delay the peak by applying the 'trace, isolate and treat strategy and also break the chain," she added.The Health Minister said that the delayed peak of pandemic gave time to the state to improve the health care system."During that period we were able to strengthen our health care system, and because of that we never saw the full occupancy of our ventilators. Our ICUs were also occupied below 50 per cent during this time. Our hospitals were never flooded with patients because of our planning. We mobilised more human resources to fight against the pandemic," she stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-management-saved-large-number-of-lives-kk-shailaja-101612031780753.html

31-01-2021||Today's||What Union Budget 2021-22 has to tackle||On Monday, the finance minister (FM) will rise to present the budget. By the time she finishes, we should have a clear idea of how she proposes to tackle the problems the economy faces.The only thing is, many of us don’t have a clear idea of what those problems are. A lot has been written by learned authorities, but not being economists, it isn’t easy to follow. So let me attempt a simple account of the state of the economy.Nilesh Shah, a member of the Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council, says, “The worst is firmly behind us.” This is because the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, foreign exchange reserves and power consumption are at an all-time high while passenger vehicle sales, railway freight and the PMI index indicate strong recovery.This also explains why the FM believes the economy is experiencing a V-shaped recovery.Montek Singh Ahluwalia, former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, disagrees. He says the formal sector could be recovering in a V-shape but not the whole economy. The letter K is a better symbol – some sectors are reviving rapidly, others are in dire straits.However, both agree on the areas of concern. The first is employment. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy says, in December, employment was down by 14.7 million and the unemployment rate was 9.1%.Meanwhile, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) shows that 100 million people availed of this scheme up to January 10, an increase of 21% over last year. So, both in urban and rural India, the employment situation, which improved over the summer months, has deteriorated.A second concern is the financial sector. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s latest Financial Stability report says non-performing assets (NPAs) could shoot up to 13.5% by September 2021, compared to 7.5% a year earlier. More worryingly, NPAs of public sector banks could increase to 16.2% from 9.7%. Ahluwalia has congratulated RBI for its honesty. Shah says the NPA resolution won’t be easy.Let’s now come to sectors which bore the brunt of the lockdown and need special attention: Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which constitute 30% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 45% of manufacturing; construction, which is the second biggest employer; and practically everything to do with tourism and hospitality. Together, this is a substantial section of the economy.However, because we have little to do with MSMEs and have stopped visiting hotels and restaurants, we don’t appreciate their suffering. But, say both Ahluwalia and Shah, some MSMEs may not be revivable. Any attempt to do so would amount to throwing good money after bad.So, not surprisingly, consumption and investment are well below pre-Covid-19 levels. The former was the cause of a demand-led crisis. Now Pronab Sen, former chief statistician, fears the latter could create an investment-led crisis next financial year.One other issue as we await the budget. How should the FM raise the money for the measures she announces? Some fear the return of the wealth tax. The super-rich are apprehensive of income tax increases. However, Nilesh Shah has suggested innovative ways of avoiding both that could still raise substantial sums.He has proposed a gold amnesty scheme, monetisation of government-controlled assets such as enemy property and surplus land, strategic disinvestment of public sector units, and legalising betting and gambling. Two of these deserve special attention.Shah says $373 billion of gold has been imported in the last 20 years. If you add what’s come illegally, the total is, perhaps, half a trillion. The World Gold Council estimates household gold could be 25,000 tonnes worth $2 trillion. Much of this is undeclared. So if the government announces a gold amnesty, it could tap hundreds of billions of dollars.Second, as custodian, the government controls ₹1 lakh crore of what’s called enemy property. These are assets of people who’ve migrated to Pakistan. Pakistan sold off its enemy property 49 years ago, India has still to do so. Now is the time, says Shah.I’ll stop here. Of course, you’ll still need experts to determine whether the FM has done the right thing or gone far enough. But that’s another subject.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-union-budget-2021-22-has-to-tackle-101612015521212.html
31-01-2021||Today's||What the Union Budget needs to get right||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s problem is the same as that of the Indian cricket team’s captain — everyone seems to think they know what needs to be done; worse, everyone is convinced they can do a better job than the incumbent. There have been a spate of if-I-were-the-finance-minister pieces published already, and more will follow after Sitharaman presents the Union Budget for 2021-22 on February 1, accompanied by that annual (and juvenile) exercise of a bunch of worthies lining up to rate the budget out of 10.The context of this Union Budget is like no other. Not even 1991 was like this (and India’s macroeconomic vitals are far healthier now than they were back then). The economy was already (and consistently) slowing ahead of the pandemic — for both structural and cyclical reasons. Then came the pandemic, the lockdown (68 days long) enforced to slow its spread, and the gradual (but faster than expected) return to normalcy of most business activities, although the damage on small firms, those employed in the informal sector, and many businesses in the service sector has been severe.The International Monetary Fund expects the Indian economy to grow at 11.5% in 2021-22 and 6.8% the year after, by far the fastest for an economy of this size. The 11.5% growth translates into a 2.9% growth over 2019-20, and while some analysts say this means there’s no reason for cheer, the speed of the Indian economy’s return to normal has been staggering. The Economic Survey’s own estimate is almost the same — 11%. This is a classic V-shaped recovery, but there are issues.Sure, the corporate sector appears to have bounced back (if one were to consider profitability), but this has come on the back of lower costs, usually achieved through layoffs or salary cuts. Sure, the stock markets are booming on the back of excess liquidity in global markets, of a magnitude not seen for at least a decade-and-a-half, but there are few jobs being created. And sure, several high-frequency indicators are in the green, highlighting an ongoing sequential recovery, but there are questions about its sustainability. Just as there are questions about investment and consumption, and credit and demand.Interestingly, there is growing convergence, if not complete agreement, on five things about the Union Budget.The first is that the government should continue with its expansionary fiscal stance in the budget (which the Economic Survey also emphasises). Put otherwise, it should spend, and spend liberally. Sure, some of the spending will have to be on productive assets such as infrastructure, but from the short-term perspective, some of it should also focus on alleviating the significant economic distress in which some people (and companies) find themselves.There is a fiscal responsibility law, which the government is expected to follow, but the circumstances are unique enough for this law to be held in abeyance for, say, two years. Just remember that Indonesia monetised some of its deficit in mid-2020 as part of its effort to manage the economy during the pandemic. The move, had it come a few years back, would have been roundly criticised by everyone. In 2020, it barely caused a ripple in global financial circles — and that, only because of a school of thought that this could be a road other developing economies could take. Chanakya isn’t enough of an economic heretic to suggest India do the same, but the country can definitely go as far as simply not worrying about its mandated deficit targets (which it will anyway miss).The second is that as the economy comes out of the crisis of 2020, the finance minister would do well to ensure the strength and stability of the financial sector. The Economic Survey has called for an asset quality review, especially because of the regulatory forbearance banks were allowed in a pandemic year — something that essentially allowed them to maintain low provisions against what were basically impaired assets. It was similar regulatory forbearance (in the early 2010s) that resulted in ongoing non-performing assets (NPA) or bad loans crisis. India doesn’t just need an asset quality review; it also needs to consider creating a bad bank, an idea it has flirted with in the past, but one whose time has perhaps come.The third is for the budget to make a higher allocation to health in general, and Covid-19 vaccines in particular. The latter is perhaps the best stimulus the government could provide the economy. After all, at least some of the problems that beset the economy currently have nothing to do with the economy (and everything to do with the pandemic). The sudden health crisis India encountered last year showed up the inadequacy of the country’s public health infrastructure. The Economic Survey makes a pitch for taking up India’s health spending from the current 1% to 2.5-3%.The fourth is for the budget to do enough to revive demand — a problem even before the pandemic, and an even more pressing one now. According to the Economic Survey, the sharp recovery in the second half of the year was powered mainly by a rise in government consumption. Private consumption is expected to contract by 0.6% in the second half, although this is an improvement over the almost 19% contraction seen in the first half.And the fifth is for the budget to come up with a growth formula that is built around jobs. There is now enough data to show that a significant number of jobs were lost during the pandemic, and that some of those still in jobs have seen a fall in incomes, with the poor affected disproportionately by both.The important thing to remember as we prepare for Budget 2021-22 is that things could have been worse, much worse. But whether they get even better from here depends on what happens on February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-the-union-budget-needs-to-get-right-101612014861120.html
31-01-2021||Today's||Budget 2021: Overcome poverty, battle inequality||In my last column, I wrote about the possible danger of an economic recovery which enriches the rich and impoverishes the poor. Now, it seems that the Covid-19 pandemic has already created that situation. The international aid agency, Oxfam, has published a report with the telling title The Inequality Virus. According to the global report, during the pandemic, “over two million people have died and hundreds of millions of people are being forced into poverty while many of the richest — individuals and corporations — are flourishing”.The report quotes the telling description of the secretary-general of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, of the global crisis we face. He said, “While we are floating in the same sea it’s clear that some are in super yachts while others are clinging to drifting debris.” In India, while the wealth of billionaires was increasing by 35% during the lockdown, 122 million citizens were losing their jobs.The Oxfam report blames neoliberal economics for inequality, and points out that even Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, whose Davos meeting is the place to be seen for the world’s richest and most influential people, has said: “We must move on from neo-liberalism in the post-Covid era.” The jobs lost in the informal sector amounted to 75%. Handloom weavers and other craftspeople are among the most economically fragile communities in that sector.Five years ago, I visited a weaver centre near Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh. At that time, the weavers, while by no means prosperous, were being helped by a non-governmental organisation to increase their income to establish digital ways of marketing their cloth by cutting out middlemen.Before writing this column, I contacted Utkarsh, the coordinator of the centre, to find out how the weavers had fared during the lockdown. He replied, “They were pushed to extreme distress”. Because lockdown was imposed so suddenly, they had no time to prepare themselves for it. They were waiting for the government to tell them what to do. Even when the government distributed rations, they were only given to migrant workers who had returned home. There were no orders from master weavers, so they had no income and instead had to borrow money from them. The supply line of cotton from Surat was cut. That was not restored for four months. So, now, they are in debt and it will be difficult to pay off those debts because the demand for their cloth has not fully recovered.Despite being a major source of employment, the handloom and handicrafts have been sectors most neglected by the government in the era of neoliberal economists. During this crisis, the textile ministry has also wound up the All India Handloom and Handicrafts Board, though this was done in the name of minimum government, maximum governance.The Oxfam report on inequality included another surprising voice calling for global economics to change. The Financial Times is one of the world’s most influential economic and business newspapers. It is quoted in the report as calling for “radical reforms to reverse the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades”, the period dominated by neoliberal economics.When India became independent, the leaders of the Congress saw overcoming poverty as their top priority and so they turned to socialism. Even now, India is committed constitutionally to socialism, but the commitment was made in 1976 by Indira Gandhi’s Emergency government which was flouting the Constitution. Indira Gandhi’s socialism gave that creed a bad name. It wouldn’t be right to go back to that socialism. Circumstances have changed so much that it wouldn’t be right to go back into Nehruvian socialism either. But it would be right to go back to socialism’s commitment to equality, and to reform India’s economy so that overcoming poverty once again becomes the top priority.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/budget-2021-overcome-poverty-battle-inequality-101612014621187.html
