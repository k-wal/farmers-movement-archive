22-01-2021||News||The secrets of Netaji’s secret service||While the Red Fort Trials of Shah Nawaz Khan, GS Dhillon and Prem Sahgal are widely known, the massive sacrifice of hundreds of Secret Service officers of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army (INA) remains a secret and an enigma.These men were trained under Netaji’s watch at the Tanjong Bungah Centre in Penang. They landed in groups from Japanese submarines or were air-dropped by parachutes into India or Ceylon. Many of them were betrayed, tortured and sentenced to death. But today, they remain in oblivion and forgotten. In fact, little is known on the large organisation of the Secret Service of the INA, centralised and vastly expanded by Netaji, after being set up by General Mohan Singh and then Rash Behari Bose.One British military trial of the INA Secret Service that is known to some is the “Calcutta Conspiracy Case” of four patriots of the INA Secret Service. This secret trial for “waging war against the King Emperor” ended with the death sentence to the four by hanging. This came to the attention of some because Mahatma Gandhi intervened and their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. Writing to Lord Wavell, on September 14, 1945, Gandhi wrote, “It will be a political error of the first magnitude if this sentence of death is carried into effect.”On the 125th Anniversary of Netaji’s birth, I appeal to the nation to document and recognise the sacrifices of hundreds of men of INA’s Secret Service who landed across the country from East Asia and were martyred at the altar of the freedom struggle. Their sacrifice and those of their brave Indian counterparts must now be revered and etched into our memory of the fight for freedom.In March 1944, a fully armed Japanese submarine left the secure base in Penang, carrying four INA Secret Service officers, destined for the Puri beach of the Bay of Bengal. In the submarine were Pabitra Mohan Roy (leader), Sardar Mohinder Singh (bomb expert), Tuhin Mukherjee (coding expert) and Americk Singh Gill (radio expert). Just before departure came Netaji’s message to them directly: “Though few in number, your mission will strike a deadly blow at the entire British secret service. This base in Calcutta must be set up at all cost,” as chronicled by Gill. The submarine reached its destination and put the four on their mechanised dinghy. “Just before day break we could see the huge Konarak Sun Temple…” wrote Gill. Within minutes, Singh buried the bombs and power packs, 25 paces from the south-end wall of the temple. (Are they still there?). They dispersed hurriedly with vital radio parts camouflaged by Roy in a travelling gramophone of yore. They would rendezvous at the Metro Cinema in Calcutta on a Sunday at 10 am.Then came the deadly mistake. Against orders, Mukherjee went to meet his in-laws. His father in-law quickly handed him over to the Calcutta police and collected the considerable bounty on his head of ₹5,000 in 1944. Under torture, the vital radio code for transmissions to Netaji’s headquarters in Rangoon was revealed.Soon after, Roy and Gill came into contact with Haridas Mitra and his wife Bela Bose, the daughter of Netaji’s elder brother Suresh Chandra Bose. Together they met Jyotish Bose, a close friend of Haridas Mitra and the rest of the trusted members of the underground. Luckily, the first trial of radio contact with a new code went through from the home of a dental surgeon, Dr Dutt. Now, they needed a permanent hide-out to set up the powerful transmitters.The radio expert, Americk Gill, wrote, “Haridas Mitra lost no time and soon we were settled at Behala. We were furnished with the best radio receivers, organized and supported by Haridas Mitra, Jyotish Bose, Bela Bose and a valiant group of well concealed and trusted underground workers.” Newly coded messages to the INA headquarters revealed among other information, vital British troop movements to Kohima, the assembling of heavy bombers at Dum Dum airport and as, Gill wrote, “...we made use of our powerful transmitters to jam naval and army signals and causing interference on their known frequencies.” (sic). These hundreds of coded messages were hugely helpful to the INA commanders on the battlefield.Singh set up a strong base in Jalandhar. But alas, he was betrayed while in Phagwara for bounty and tortured to death in Lahore. This ultimate sacrifice of Mohinder Singh remains unrecognised till date.The British intelligence was closing in and very soon Roy was arrested; so was Gill. And then Haridas Mitra and Jyotish Bose were arrested too. The summary military trial began in May 1945 and ended in a month. “King’s Witnesses” included 12 traitors who were trained in the INA Centre in Penang and had landed in Baluchistan and of course, there was Tuhin Mukherjee. The British judge Ormerod condemned to death by hanging Pabitra Mohan Roy, Americk Singh Gill, Haridas Mitra and Jyotish Bose.It is believed that 10 such groups of INA Secret Service men, who had landed earlier in different parts of the country, had been condemned to death too and had been hanged. What a tragedy that this history is not known to our nation. British records must have been kept and lie buried in India or London. It is time that we draw them out to at least consecrate the ultimate sacrifices of these martyrs.Amit Mitra is the finance minister of West Bengal. He is also the founder patron, with Anita Bose, of the INA Trust and the son of Haridas Mitra and Bela Bose, niece of Netaji. This piece is based on the memoirs of Roy, Gill, J Bose and Sumitra Mitra’s book with interviews with H MitraThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-secrets-of-netaji-s-secret-service-101611321585704.html
22-01-2021||News||Imran Khan jumped the gun. This time, over Pakistan’s economic turnaround||Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government often pins the blame for the economic turmoil in Pakistan on his predecessors and coronavirus, in that order, and credits PM Khan for minimising the adverse impact of both. PM Khan and his government’s economists have lately been telling Pakistanis and the world about his government’s success in navigating the economy.In November, Imran Khan told a meeting with political leaders and civil society that the difficult phase in the economic revival is over and the economy has recovered. The next month, PM Khan declared that Pakistan’s economy had made a “remarkable turnaround”.To be sure, the pandemic did play a key role in ramming Pakistan's economy that contracted for the first time in seven decades. But the downward trend had been evident as early as mid-2018. Pakistan's GDP grew by 1.9% in 2019, down from a decade-high of 5.8% the previous year when Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf came to power.Pakistan watchers in New Delhi suggest PM Khan’s proclamation on the economy may have jumped the gun.Not everyone in Pakistan outside the government is as convinced either. Like this opinion piece in the Dawn. “Whenever you hear the government proclaim triumph about rising exports, keep in mind that the trade deficit has grown even faster than exports in the same July to December period,” commentator Khurram Husain cautioned on the government’s spin to the data on PM Khan’s claims of economic recovery.Also Read: Imran Khan squeezed between a shrinking economy and expanding oppositionBesides, Pakistan is also struggling to contain inflation that shot up to 10.7% in 2020, up from 6.8% in 2019 and 4.7% in 2018 when the Imran Khan government came to power. A recent spike in food prices indicates that the rising trend is likely to continue.Pakistan, in a desperate effort to contain food prices, ended up aggressively importing essentials like wheat, sugar and canola to such an extent that, according to a Bloomberg report earlier this month, the Karachi Port was jammed.“The result: Pakistan’s cement exports declined 18% to 633,431 tons last month, steeper than the 5% drop seen in November, amid non-availability of berths to load the goods,” the Bloomberg report said.The economy is also under strain due to rising debt stocks. By the end of September 2020, Pakistan's total debt and liabilities stood at Pakistani Rupee 44,801 billion ($280 billion), an increase of PKR 245 billion over a three-month period.Moreover, around 30% of Pakistan's total debt is sourced through external borrowings and reflects an increase of $ 1.05 billion during the July-September quarter of the current fiscal. Pakistan would need to pay around PKR 1,200 billion towards servicing the debt and liabilities in the current fiscal.Currently, Pakistan spends around one-third of the total budget on debt servicing. PM Khan admitted the impact of the debt burden recently even if it was to blame his predecessors. “Half of the taxes we [the government] collect go into debt settlement of loans taken by previous governments,” he told reporters this month.Quite a bit of PM Imran Khan’s attempt to build the narrative around Pakistan’s economic turnaround has focused on the current account that had been in surplus for around five months till December, a rarity in a country dependent on imports and stagnant exports. PM Khan had, for weeks, lauded the current account surplus as “great news” and spoke about the ‘achievement’ with some pride last week too.Also Read: At UN Covid meet, cash-strapped Pak PM Imran Khan seeks debt reliefEconomists have, however, pointed that the current account surplus was possibly one positive consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic that had slowed down economic activity and led to a decline in the demand for fuel in an era of low global oil prices. It also helped that travel restrictions around the world had impeded the flow of remittances via the informal channels and forced workers abroad to use the formal remittance channels.But it is time for Pakistan to tighten its belt as it looks to revive the International Monetary Fund’s $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). It was stalled in February 2020 after the Covid-19 outbreak that gave PM Khan the space to put off hard decisions.The first one came on Thursday when the government announced plans to increase the power tariff by Rs1.95 a unit. Local media reports have indicated that the government could soon also withdraw PKR 150 billion worth of tax exemption to the corporate sector.PM Khan did not refer to the corporate income tax rates and exemptions at the launch of a digital payments system 'Raast' earlier this month. But he did hint at the need to expand the tax base. Out of 220 million people in Pakistan, income tax paid by 3,000 people accounted for 70% of the collections, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/imran-khan-celebrated-pak-economy-s-recovery-why-it-is-too-soon-101611304913952.html
22-01-2021||News||The democratic dilemma posed by social media||I remember the day I was introduced to The Facebook. A Harvard undergraduate whom I had met in a class invited me via email to join this mysterious club. I created my (rudimentary) account, found it populated with only Harvard students, and unable to figure out its purpose beyond invitations to parties and events on campus, shrugged and didn’t browse it again for another couple of years or so.I was, of course, hopelessly behind the times. The Facebook became Facebook, and the whole world and their mother (and mine) joined. Facebook was first a way for people to connect with friends and family, then with people who were in their orbit perhaps, but not in their social circles, and finally, with strangers. This universality and sheer liberal reach of Facebook, and later, other social media outlets such as Twitter, seemed to be the ultimate harbinger of democracy and transparency.Fast forward then to Wednesday’s American presidential inauguration. President Joe Biden struck a sombre note. “Democracy,” he said, had “prevailed” but it is “fragile.” Biden was referring to the storming of the United States (US) Capitol on January 6, when a group of protesters, egged on by Donald Trump to believe that the election had been fraudulent, attacked the very seat of American democracy. Trump was rightly blamed for his instigating role in the riots but there was another culprit as well — social media. The reputation of Facebook and Twitter lay in tatters. What followed in the aftermath of the insurrection — the suspensions and banning of accounts — did nothing to restore their democratic reputation.To understand how we got here we need to look to the evolution of social media as a tool by which not just ordinary people but countries began to do business. Twitter and Facebook would connect ordinary citizens yes, but also people to their political leaders, and political leaders to their counterparts.One of the earliest inklings of the power of social media to change the way international politics is structured came during the Arab Spring. The suicide of a vegetable vendor to protest against the Tunisian government went viral across Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, inspiring protests across West Asia and North Africa. Governments fell, and civil wars broke out. Social media played a critical role, spreading democratic ideas across multiple nations, and connecting citizens. It was lauded as “liberation technology” for ushering in an age of transparency and information sharing for the good. Political leaders were swift to capitalise on it.When Barack Obama taped a message for Nowruz, the Persian New Year, for example, it went viral in Iran. It was shared on over 60,000 blogs, and watched by more than one third of the citizens of Iran. During his second term, when two US Navy patrol boats strayed into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf, and the Iranian government detained the American sailors on board, diplomacy between Iran and the US played out on not just through the usual diplomatic back channels but also on Twitter. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, and US Secretary of State, John Kerry announced the outcome on Twitter, resolving the #sailors episode.They were, of course, far from the only ones using social media to address contentious bilateral relations. In 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the step of opening a social media account on Sina Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, with a highly symbolic and viral post: “hello China! Looking forward to interacting with Chinese friends.”But the opposite also happened. Social media also became a way to trade international barbs. Trump’s pugnacious tweets — often misspelt, and in all caps — called out friends and foes, individuals and countries. More disturbingly, the direct communication of leaders and the presence of millions of followers gave, as recent research has shown, democratic voice not only to those who were excluded from political spaces but also to those who would use it, paradoxically, for illiberal goals. In Trump’s case it meant bringing together a far-Right network of people from across the world who congregated in the dubious corners and chat rooms of social media to trade conspiracy theories.Thus, “defending democracy” as Biden just vowed to do, is not so simple. On one hand, social media, by its inherent ability to democratise politics, created an insurrection that could have decapitated one of the branches of American government. On the other, the clampdown on social media that followed to control the violence, even though successful, was also deeply troubling. The banning of Trump and others from Twitter and Facebook, and the shutdown of Parler made clear that the power to silence voices, whether of the one or of millions, lies with just three men on the planet – Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. No wonder defending democracy will be a huge and unenviable task for President Biden’s team.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of international relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of Oxford The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-democratic-dilemma-posed-by-social-media-101611238896051.html
22-01-2021||News||Putting the consumer at the centre of Digital India||The telecom revolution in India is an unparalleled success story. From a tele-density of 2% in 1995 to 12% in 2005 to over 90% in 2020, things have come a long way. India today has over 500 million active internet users, who consume the highest volume of data in the world (average of 25GB per month) and pay the lowest rates in the world (average price of $0.30 per GB vs $8 in the US). This massive rise in the use of the mobile internet helped lay the foundation for many businesses, besides delivering governance efficiently.With accelerating consumption, India has become a lucrative market for B2C tech companies, which thrive on a growing reliance on their platforms. But this also means that India urgently needs an evolved regulatory framework which empowers the consumer to utilise this digital transformation without being vulnerable to data security threats.So far, India’s approach to consumer empowerment is inconsistent at best and depends on whether the sector has a regulator overseeing it. For sectors that have regulators — TRAI for telecom; SEBI for stock markets; RBI for banking — the government has managed to ensure greater transparency in protecting the interests of the consumer. Those that do not have regulators generally fall within the ambit of the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) where the scope of the issue gets constrained to monetary transactions. As a result, there is no mechanism to redress issues such as losing privacy, as opposed to losing money.India’s consumer internet is dominated by American Big Tech. This has implications for freedom of expression because its content rules and broader policy determinations will determine our online public squares. Repeated offences on data breaches and sharing of data between platforms have been ignored — in the absence of a regulator.India has conventionally resorted to broad trade and market restrictions — such as blocking — rather than nuanced regulation of the digital space. In a digitally integrated world, globalisation of ideas and information has helped economies find novel ways to power growth and inclusion. Denying digital access to certain services be it through app bans or internet shutdowns, is an act of digital de-globalisation.The Supreme Court, in 2019, acknowledged that internet access is integral to the right to freedom of speech and expression while adding that any restriction on internet access must pass the test of proportionality, and suggested the evolution of a rules-based mechanism to govern the internet. In 2020 alone, India lost $2.8 billion due to internet shutdowns, about three-quarters of the $4 billion lost worldwide due to internet curbs. Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, which gives the government the provision to block public access to specific webpages, websites and mobile applications, has been used extensively, and often without accountability. As the government evolves its policies to empower a digital India, a comprehensive national security law needs to be brought in, which thrives on compliance rather than bans as a regulation mechanism. The Personal Data Protection Bill has a good approach on the consumer side whereby the emphasis is on providing more control and transparency to consumers, enabling them to become “owners” of their information. There, however, remains concerns, including the extent of autonomy of the Proposed Data Protection Authority which is supposed to be the regulator under the Bill.One way to empower consumers is by creating mechanisms to ensure inter-operability, by making it easier to switch services from one platform to another. In telecom, interoperability is implemented. However, in the internet space, and more prominently in the app space, consumers do not have this choice. People wanting to exit Facebook or WhatsApp cannot do so without relinquishing data, history, contacts. The journey towards a Digital India is rewarding and a great propeller for growth. A strong and consistent governance framework together with a digitally empowered Indian consumer will be a great step in building an Atmanirbhar Bharat.Lloyd Mathias is an early-stage investor and a business strategistThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/putting-the-consumer-at-the-centre-of-digital-india-101611235350806.html
22-01-2021||News||The working of a ‘project finance economy’||Every country seeks growth in its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to meet the needs of its citizens. A growth in GDP is a function of the amount of labour utilised in a country, the amount of capital deployed, and the increase in the country’s productivity. Any nation that seeks to accelerate its GDP growth must employ more people, use more capital or increase its productivity.In a set of brilliant Reith lectures last year, Mark Carney discusses how the economic theoretician tries to paint the discipline of economics, as a neutral technical discipline, with immutable laws that provide good and bad answers. But are their answers good for developing countries in general, and India, in particular? In a developed economy, the level of per capita income of the population is high, the levels of unemployment are typically low, the tax base is broad, and governments can meet their expenditure from tax revenues. The need to borrow arises primarily to smoothen the timing of revenue and expenditure flows. These countries have reasonably robust soft and hard infrastructure.It is not that everything is perfect in terms of access or even in the quality of infrastructure, but life chances for people are much better than in other parts of the world. It is true that sometimes these countries start to trail in some areas of innovation by falling behind in research and development (R&D) investment, but essentially, they have high per capita incomes and governments have the resources to meet their current expenditures. In normal periods, these economies can be said to be in a steady state and like low inflation with balanced budgets. If they run fiscal deficits, it is on account of unanticipated shocks or by political choice. I would like to call these economies “working capital economies”.In contrast, developing economies are those that have low per capita income and high unemployment or disguised unemployment (very low productivity jobs). They are not in a steady state. They often lag in their soft infrastructure — reasonable schooling, decent healthcare, and levels of malnutrition in children. They have gaps in their hard infrastructure in respect to the availability of drinking water, power, public transport, roads, rail, airports and ports. Typically, they have lower spending on R&D and technology.Therefore, these economies operate at low productivity levels. Often, these economies have access to cheap labour, but it is mostly unskilled, they typically exhibit a shortage of capital and struggle to grow sustainably. Revenue is not enough for the desperately needed capital expenditures. They need to borrow and invest in infrastructure to break out of their low productivity trap to be able to raise their per capita incomes and get close to full employment. I term these economies “project finance economies”.Project finance economies have different imperatives from working capital economies. They need investment to fill the gaps in their infrastructure and lack the resources to do so. They need to run fiscal deficits, tolerate higher inflation, and keep interest rates lower relative to their level of inflation so that they may raise the resources to build the needed infrastructure. Only by improving their soft and hard infrastructure can they raise economic productivity, which creates the ability for them to put their economies on a sustainable growth path and allow them to service their loans.Inflation around 7% creates some money illusion and increases consumer expenditure and makes employees feel an improvement in their situation. Lower interest rates spur capital investment and if the money is well spent, raise the productivity of the economy and increase per capita incomes. The important requirement is that the borrowing is used to fund capital and not current expenditure.The passage of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) in 2003 in India was to restrict the ability of governments to run fiscal deficits. This was done with a view to constrain them from being irresponsible and taking on more debt than it could service. The question is should the Act have constrained the ability of the government to borrow or should it have ensured that if the government borrowed, it was for capital expenditures that would raise our productivity.Further, in 2016, India decided to establish an inflation target that is to be monitored through a monetary policy committee. The inflation target has been set at 4% with a 2% band on either side. The question is should a project finance economy set a low 4% target, when for most of India’s independent history it had an average inflation of 7% with a few spikes without major problems? South Korea did the same during the 20-year period of its rapid GDP growth between 1980-95. To kill inflation, the Reserve Bank of India kept interest rates higher than in most parts of the world between 2014-2018, making us the haven of the carry trade by over-estimating inflation consistently. This discouraged capital investments and led to a slowdown in exports because of an overvalued currency.We need a reset away from simple neo-classical dogma to create the right policies for sustainable employment generating growth in India by improving our productivity.

22-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Amravati and Hingoli set example with repeated 100% turnout||Rural districts like Amravati and Hingoli are setting an example for cities by attaining repeated 100% turnout for both Covid-19 vaccinates—Covaxin and Covishield. District health officials said timely intimation and counselling hold the key to their success.Amravati has a daily target to vaccinate 500 healthcare workers (HCWs), of which 100 are for Covaxin and the remaining 400 for Covishield. On Friday, the district recorded 116% turnout, as they vaccinated 558 healthcare workers (HCWs). Hingoli attained a 100% success rate by inoculating the targeted 200 HCWs.Since the beginning of the mass immunisation programme on January 16, all 36 districts are facing technical glitches in the centralised CoWIN application, which has marred their spirit to a great extent. Despite these shortfalls, the two districts—Amravati and Hingoli have been attaining 100% turnout repeatedly by adopting different strategies.Timely dissemination of information has helped achieve a maximum number of HCWs. “We start calling the registered beneficiaries by 5pm. As our daily target is 200 HCWs, we are done with our calling within two hours. This gives enough time to HCWs in getting ready for their next day’s vaccination,” said Dr Shivaji Pawar, district health officer (DHO), Hingoli.Counselling has also helped to boost the morale of HCWs in the hospital. “We have been counselling HCWs, both, before and after vaccination. Along with that, while setting up appointments over the phone, our officers counsel anyone who shows resistance and make them understand the importance of the vaccination,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, DHO, Amravati.All 36 districts in Maharashtra have started the walk-in vaccination for HCWs who are registered on the centralised Co-WIN application. Now, all the 285 vaccination sites had inoculated the registered HCWs even if they don’t appointment for the day by clicking on the newly added option— ‘add beneficiary’. With this, the number of overall turnouts has increased further. “Since the start of this facility, I am getting more than the targeted figure. For instance, we vaccinated 551 beneficiaries on Wednesday and 558 on Friday. Even though it adds on to the pressure, we never turn away any beneficiaries,” said Dr Ranmale.The CoWIN app has been regenerating the old names of the beneficiaries in the new list. To address the issue, the districts have been shortlisting more than the targeted beneficiaries which helped to get more HCWs for immunisation. “After the first day of the immunisation, we understood that we need to invite more than the targeted number which will help in better turnout. So, if we have 200 targets, we call 250 people,” said Dr Pawar.The HCWs include doctors, nurses, ward boys, ASHA and Anganwadi workers. So, the health officers have created WhatsApp groups of the HCWs according to their profile. “If we want to vaccinate 50 ASHA workers, we also inform their leaders who quickly pass on the messages timely. So, we have also created such groups which help in passing on the information faster,” said Dr Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraamravati-and-hingoli-set-example-with-repeated-100-turnout-101611340126913.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Private hospitals in Mumbai sensitise staff about the need for Covid-19 vaccination||To encourage healthcare workers (HCWs) to get inoculated, major private hospitals in the city are sensitising staffers about the importance of getting vaccinated. Additionally, hospitals are adjusting work schedules of HCWs so that they are able to meet their appointed dates of vaccination.In the city, in the last four days of the vaccination, only 61.24 % of the shortlisted HCWs got inoculated. Out of the 14,352 HCWs who were called for vaccination, only 8,790 of them showed up on their assigned dates.Around 1.30 lakh HCWs in Mumbai have registered on the Covid vaccine intelligence network (CoWIN) app, which is monitoring the vaccination drive, and of them, 70,000 are employed at private hospitals. Private hospitals in the city said not even 50% of registered HCWs are getting inoculated. “One of the main reasons for low turnout is the lack of knowledge and the right information about the vaccines among potential beneficiaries. Due to technical glitches in the CoWIN application, the turnout has been badly affected. But people are interpreting it in a negative light,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital. To address questions and clear doubts about vaccination among HCWs, many senior officers and heads of departments at hospitals are getting inoculated first. Dr Ravishankar, chief executive officer (CEO) of Lilavati Hospital, got the vaccine on Wednesday. “Since the day I have taken the vaccine, many of our in-house HCWs have been motivated [to do the same]. Many people who had doubts about the efficiency of the vaccine have now decided to take it,” he said. Several private hospitals are disseminating information about the need to get vaccinated through hospital WhatsApp groups. “We have been holding awareness workshops to sensitise staffers. Raising awareness among HCWs is the need of the hour. We need to bust myths among the public through face-to-face counselling and social media,” said Dr Harish Shetty, a city psychiatrist who got the vaccine on January 16, the first day of the vaccination drive. Many doctors are raising awareness among their peers by doing webinars, and some hospitals are providing alternative shifts to HCWs to accommodate vaccine appointments. “For the convenience of staffers, we are also adjusting their shifts and timing as per their appointment date of the vaccination,” said Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital. On Thursday, the Association of Hospitals, a trust comprising private hospitals, wrote to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) seeking permission to vaccinate staff in their premises. “We have 2,100 HCWs, so if we get permission to vaccinate them, we can get them inoculated within a week. This will save time for HCWs to travel to distant vaccine centres for inoculation and secondly, it will increase the turnout, which will boost public confidence,” said Dr Bhansali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/private-hospitals-in-mumbai-sensitise-staff-about-the-need-for-covid-19-vaccination-101611340006936.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Fuel price soars again, petrol crosses ₹92 mark in Mumbai||Petrol prices on Friday touched a new high in the city. The price of one litre of petrol is now ₹92.04, while the one litre of diesel will cost ₹82.40.The increase comes after the price remained constant for two days in the city.On January 19, one litre of petrol was available at ₹91.80 and one litre of diesel was available at ₹82.13.Earlier, the highest petrol price was recorded in October 2018 with a litre costing ₹91.34 in the city, while the highest price of diesel was recorded in the city last week, on January 14, costing ₹81.60 for one litre.Fuel prices have increased across all metro cities in the country. In Delhi, one litre of petrol costs ₹85.45 and one litre of diesel costs ₹75.63.Transporters across the country have called for an urgent meeting to discuss the rise in fuel prices.“The government is taking undue advantage of the vulnerability of the consumers. They refused to lower the fuel prices when international crude oil prices plummeted. The Central government has increased the excise duty and the state government has increased the value-added tax (VAT), making fuel a highly taxed commodity in the world. The high cost of diesel prices are taking a toll on small operators and if this is not checked, a strong action seems imminent,” said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).Citizens have urged the Maharashtra government to reduce VAT. “The prices of fuel have been increasing constantly. During the pandemic, people have already suffered a lot, the state government should immediately reduce VAT on fuel,” said Aarti Singh, a Vikhroli resident.Earlier on January 14, the AIMTC had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking to reduce VAT on diesel and petrol in Maharashtra to extend relief to the road transport sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-price-soars-again-petrol-crosses-92-mark-in-mumbai-101611339947017.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||HC stay and Centre’s objections: Maharashtra govt stares at legal hurdles over Mumbai Metro 3 car shed site||While a committee appointed by the Maharashtra government has backed Kanjurmarg over Aarey as the right plot for building a car shed for Metro lines 3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and 6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli), the state still has legal hurdles to clear before undertaking work at Kanjurmarg. A top official from the state government, who did not wish to be named, said that the committee’s recommendations have no standing until the court clears the land parcel for construction of the shed. “The matter is pending in the court. It is as clear,” the official said. In November 2020, the Bombay high court (HC) had stayed the transfer of 102 acres of land to the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA). The court had also stated that the land transfer by the collector was bordering on fraud on power. The court is set to hear the matter in February again. On October 6, the collector transferred possession of the piece of land to MMRDA and two days later the authority, in turn, handed it over to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited, which started levelling work at the site.The Central government also challenged these actions on the land claiming that the entire salt pan land, including the 102 acres at Kanjurmarg, belongs to its salt department and has always been under the administrative control of the deputy salt commissioner.Trivankumar Karnani, a lawyer by profession said, “Nothing supersedes the court of law. Ideally, the matter should have been settled by the government instead of delaying such a crucial project. Matters related to title disputes take a long time to get resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-stay-and-centre-s-objections-maharashtra-govt-stares-at-legal-hurdles-over-mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-site-101611339766739.html
22-01-2021||Pune||3,000 abandoned vehicles clutter city roads: Pune Traffic Branch||Pedestrians, commuters, and the city traffic police are facing adversities with at least 3,000 abandoned vehicles cluttering different nooks, crannies, and roads of the city. According to the traffic branch, the abandoned vehicles obstruct traffic flow and create security issues on public roads. Citizens are of the view that it is essential to take strong and timely action through the special drives in decluttering the city roads. Some areas dotted with abandoned cars include Pune Camp, peth areas, Aundh, Baner, Pashan, Kondhwa, Mohammadwadi, Undri, Bibvewadi, Hadapsar, Sahakarnagar, Yerawada, Kalyani Nagar, Kharadi, and other far-flung suburbs of the city, according to civil society members. DCP (Traffic) Rahul Srirame said, “The issue of abandoned vehicles is very serious, and we are taking sustainable action against these vehicles. The drive will intensify further. However, the PMC anti encroachment squad is also entitled to take action in this regard.” “It is the duty of police and PMC to declutter the road for a free flow of traffic. The current situation is like garaging of the roads and these vehicles must be towed away and heavy penalties must be recovered from the violators as they are obstructing free flow of traffic causing inconvenience to the citizens,” said RTI activist Vivek Velankar. ‘ Earlier, the state government in its government resolution (GR) had directed the municipal commissioners to take effective steps to remove the abandoned vehicles through special drives and appoint a dedicated officer of the rank of the deputy municipal commissioner to implement the decluttering initiative. The GR states, “Municipal corporations have been directed to undertake a special one-month drive to remove abandoned vehicles from the street. The action should be taken in coordination with local police and traffic departments.” It further stated that the civic bodies can act against abandoned vehicles that obstruct traffic flow and create security issues on public roads. Most civic bodies in the state face this issue, so it is necessary to take time-bound action through the special drive. The control of traffic rule stipulated that “the owner of the motor vehicle or his heirs or assigners shall be liable to make any reasonable expense incurred by any police officer in connection with moving, lighting, watching, or removal of a vehicle or its contents in accordance with sub-rule (1) and (2) and any police officer, or any person into whose custody the vehicle has been entrusted by any police officer, shall be 12 entitled to detain the vehicle until he has received payment accordingly.” Traffic rule further states, “If the vehicle has been stationary in one place for a continuous period of 10 hours and adequate steps have not been taken for its repairs or removal by the owner or his representative, remove the vehicle and its contents to the nearest place of safe custody.” When a motor vehicle has been stationary in a duly appointed parking place for a period exceeding that specified by an authority competent in this behalf, in respect of the said place or, if no such periods has been specified, for a period exceeding six hours, any police officer may remove the vehicle in the nearest place of safe custody, the rules states. Box Chapter VIII, Control of traffic, Rule 222 Vehicle abandoned on road states- If any motor vehicle is allowed to stand in any place, other than a duly appointed parking place, in such a way as to cause obstruction to traffic or danger to any person, any police officer, or an officer of the motor vehicle department not below the rank of assistant inspector of motor vehicles may forthwith cause the vehicle to be moved to the nearest place where the vehicle shall not cause undue obstruction to traffic or danger; Unless the vehicle is moved to a position where it shall not cause obstruction or danger, take all reasonable precautions to indicated the presence of the vehicle; detain the vehicle if parked in no parking zone, by applying wheel clamps in order to initiate legal proceedings||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/3000-abandoned-vehicles-clutter-city-roads-pune-traffic-branch-101611336345901.html

The zoo has begun fencing the enclosures around vulnerable species such as deers and antelopes with chain link. Though the enclosure of the animal is being protected, the zoo boundary remains vulnerable as work to raise the perimeter wall has not begun yet. A part of the perimeter wall of the zoo collapsed in the heavy rain of September 25, 2019, and has still not been re-built. “The chain link fencing has been put up around the enclosures of sambars, blackbucks, chinkara, and spotted deer to protect them. However, the work of building the wall has not started yet,” said Ajay Wayse, executive engineer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) who looks after the civic work of the zoo.On January 6, 2021, stray dogs managed to get inside the enclosure of the blackbucks. Dogs chased the blackbucks and according to officials, four blackbucks died due to a cardiac shock. Blackbucks are protected animals under schedule I of the wildlife (protection) act which prohibits their hunting and poaching.After this incident, officials claimed that the dogs could have entered the enclosure from the broken wall near the nullah. Now, the enclosures are being covered with chain link fencing but the broken wall near the nullah still remains to be constructed.Elected representatives of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) staged a protest on this issue at the PMC general body meeting earlier this week.“The wall had collapsed in the flood faced by the city on September 25, 2019. It has been more than a year and the wall hasn’t been constructed by the PMC. This negligence has caused lives of four blackbucks,” said Vasant More, leader MNS.Vasant More accused the PMC of ignoring this issue and causing a delay in the process of constructing the wall. “They had issued a tender earlier and the work was just about to begin. Now, the previous tender has been canceled and a new tendering process has started which means the process will start from scratch. So, how many more months will it take to construct this wall?” More asked.The zoo currently has 448 animals and about 100 staffers who keep the zoo guarded and take care of animals. The zoo has remained closed to the public since March 14, 2020, due to Covid-19. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city. On weekdays, the zoo used to see 5,000-10,000 visitors. However, the number would increase on weekends to 12,000-18,000 visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/chain-link-installed-at-katraj-zoo-boundary-wall-repairs-pending-since-2019-101611336285959.html

The building which reported the fire was a new facility where no vaccine production had started clarified SII.Uddhav Thackeray, chief minister, who visited the institute on Friday, said, “Amidst the pandemic, SII’s vaccine production is a ray of hope and so when the news came that a fire had broken out, it was shocking. Unfortunately, five people have been reported dead.”“After inspection and based on the information that I have got I can say that the vaccine doses production and the stockpile at the storage facility remained unaffected,” he said.Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, SII, said, “We are estimating the extent of the damage to be more than ₹1,000 crore because of the equipment damaged and the product that was going to be launched over there. Fortunately, we have got multiple facilities and as the CM explained Covid vaccine remains unaffected.”“The new products that were to be launched and sent to other countries, Rotavirus and BCG vaccines, will be affected greatly. However, for that too we will try to fulfil the gap through our other facilities. Mainly the loss is financially and will not affect the supply,” he said.Cyrus Poonawalla, chairman and founder, SII, said, “The building which caught fire had not yet started the production which was to start later. Therefore no vaccine was stored there. If the fire was reported from the building where the vaccine was stored it could have been greater damage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sii-estimates-loss-of-rs-1-000-crore-covishield-production-unaffected-101611336166459.html

The incident is under investigation and it will take its due course of time. The investigation is on and once the report comes out it will be clear whether it was an ambush or an accident.”On Thursday afternoon at around 2: 37 pm, a major fire broke inside an under-construction building in SII’s Manjri facility located in the outskirts of the city where five people were reported dead.Currently, multiple agencies including Pune police, MIDC fire officials, forensics and factory department are investigating the fire incident.As the building comes under the Special Economic Zone (SEZ), MIDC is the planning authority.MV Ogale, deputy chief fire officer, MIDC fire brigade, who was at the spot said that the fire compliance system at the building was in place and fully operational. He said, “After our preliminary investigation at the site we found that the welding had not yet started during the time of the incident as is being reported and so the exact cause of the fire is not yet known.”“The building has got the completion certificate and the fire compliance was in place and in good operational condition. This was the reason why the fire could be controlled in two hours. The reason why the fire grew so much is that the building is an enclosed structure as it is a pharmaceutical building and smoke, which is basically hot gases, remained trapped inside, got accumulated and spread within the building. All the things that came in contact with the smoke got ignited,” he said.Ogale said, “There was no inflammable stuff at the accident site. The building was not operational and production was not underway at the site.”“We found the bodies of the five people near the staircase so they were trying to escape now we need to find out why they could not escape. The bodies were not charred, but got blackened due to the heavy dense black smoke and the smoke particles settled on their body. The cause of death is due to the fumes due to which they collapsed and got some burn injuries.”“The investigation is still underway as many agencies are involved,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/midc-fire-officials-give-clean-chit-to-serum-cm-says-lets-wait-for-final-report-101611336166953.html

The order specifies that if the driver or any other passenger in the private vehicle is not a member of the same family, then the mask will be compulsory for all. This relaxation will be applicable only within the limits of Pune city.Murlidhar Mohol, mayor, took to his official Twitter handle and announced, “Wearing a face mask will not be mandatory while travelling with family in a private vehicle. This relaxation will be applicable only within the boundaries of Pune city.”Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of Pune police, confirmed the decision and said, “We discussed the issue a decision was taken to relax rules for family travelling together in a four-wheeler.”“A meeting was held on Friday where Ajit Pawar, Pune guardian minister, reviewed the Covid-19 situation. This issue was raised in the meeting and the decision was taken,” said Siddharth Shirole, an elected member of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly from Shivajinagar constituency.“Guardian minister held a meeting with the mayor, MALs and other civic authorities.

After such a rising public demand the city authorities were mulling the decision.Sandip Khardekar, chairman, Creative Foundation, who had written to civic authorities to revoke the compulsion was not satisfied with the announcement. “The decision which has been declared specifies that the fine will not be collected if only family members are travelling in the private vehicle, but how will they cross-check if all are family members? This leaves scope for collecting fines.“Masks should be mandatory in transport vehicles, but the compulsion should be relaxed for all private vehicles. That’s what BMC has done,” he said.Ankush Kakade, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and former mayor of Pune, said that the decision was necessary.“The compulsion should have been relaxed a long time back,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/face-mask-not-mandatory-while-travelling-with-family-in-private-vehicle-101611336165904.html

During this long stay at home and uncertainty over future studies, my family members started to pressurise me to get married. As I have a younger sister who will also have to be married in the future, I gave in. The family hurriedly married me in June,” said Jyotsana.Many girls who are pursuing higher studies and preparing for competitive exams in Maharashtra’s rural parts are being forced to get married by family members since the lockdown started in March 2020. “I have completed my postgraduation from Savitribai Phule Pune University and was preparing for competitive exams, but the exam dates were not announced. Though my husband’s family will support me to prepare for competitive exams, things change and responsibilities get added after marriage.” added Jyotsana. Prajakta (name changed), 25, who got married in July, is among the toppers in university exams. “I was preparing for competitive exams and had filled up the preliminary form for year 2020 when Covid struck, lockdown began and I returned in my village. The two years I spent on preparations to crack competitive exams ended in my parents getting me married in July. I had decided not to get married till I achieve my career goal, but now it is all a dream.”Talking about the sad reality of rural girls been forced to get married because of uncertainty over further studies, Ruksanan Patil Shaikh, secretary of the National Student’s Union of India (NSUI) Maharashtra and a student from rural area, said, “The Covid pandemic has affected all fields, including education. For students, especially girls, coming from rural parts there are high expectations from family. Girls who do not score high marks are threatened by family to be married off. Covid, lockdown and subsequently delay in reopening of colleges gave families a chance to get their daughters married. Parents also fall to social pressure as villagers constantly say that girls should be married at the earliest. It is only because of the support from my family that I could return to Pune and resume my studies.”Sandhya Sonawane, second year Law student and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) student wing president (Pune region), said, “The rural mentality that girls should not be allowed to study beyond a point is still prevalent. As girls returned to their villages post lockdown, they faced constant pressure from family and relatives to get married. The lockdown has left many girls across the state to get married in the last six to seven months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/colleges-shut-during-lockdown-leave-many-girls-in-pune-rural-areas-with-no-option-but-to-get-married-101611327105486.html

It is not correct to say anything now. After the probe gets over, we will know whether it was an accident or sabotage."Adar Poonawalla, CEO of SII said there was no damage to the Covishield vaccine production, but other facilities involved in the production of Rotavirus and BCG vaccines were damaged."The financial losses (due to the fire) are to the tune of ₹1,000 crore," he said.The Manjari facility is where Covishield, the SII vaccine against Covid-19 which is being used in the nationwide inoculation drive, is manufactured.The building where the fire broke out is one km from the Covishield vaccine manufacturing unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sii-fire-accident-or-sabotage-to-be-known-after-probe-says-uddhav-thackeray-101611319102766.html

The Chancellor’s office and the state government have also been asking the institutions to get accredited for the last several years, but the impact has been far from encouraging.The latest figures have brought the total number of NAAC-accredited colleges to less than 100 in the state. This includes just six in the A-grade. The number of accredited colleges was 107 last year. Bihar has 250 constituent colleges and an even higher number of affiliated or private colleges.The accreditation of several institutions lapsed in the last one year after the validity of five years but many of them did not even submit the Institutional Information for Quality Assessment (IIQA) to NAAC prior to expiry of the validity period, which would have allowed institutions to use the grade already awarded.According to figures available with the State Higher Education Council, the number of accredited colleges in Bihar as on December 31, 2020, is 96, which includes affiliated colleges also, while there are just six accredited universities.“There are 93 colleges that have submitted IIQA, while 77 of them have also submitted the self-study report (SSR) and eight await peer team visits. Due to Covid-19 pandemic, some of the institutions have faced delays,” said an SHEC official, adding education minister Dr Ashok Choudhary during a review meeting also urged the universities to speed up accreditation exercise.NAAC accreditation is now obligatory for all higher learning institutes by 2022, more so for state universities which strive for grants from the University Service Commission (UGC), Rashtriya Uchchtar Shiksha ABhiyaan (RUSA) and other national agencies.In 2018, two of Bihar premiere institutions, 156-year-old Patna College and 92-year-old Patna Science College, were ranked ‘C’ and ‘B’ respectively NAAC. The Academic Staff College of PU was categorized non-performer, ranked 62nd out of 66 institutions assessed.A senior college principal, who did not want to be quoted, said the colleges were indifferent to NAAC accreditation out of fear of getting low grade, which can stop funding from UGC and other institutions. “There is huge vacancy in all the institutions. Bihar state university service commission (BSUSC) has started the exercise, but it is not likely to happen too soon. With faculty members, everything suffers,” he said.The UGC deadline to all the vice chancellors to fill up vacancies and update the status on the UGC’s university activity monitoring portal was November 10, 2019. But that is not the only handicap. The universities and colleges are also grappling with infrastructure deficiencies, lack of reforms and delayed sessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/naac-accreditation-bihar-s-tally-drops-to-below-100-deadline-for-all-is-2022-101611319304710.html

Bapat and other elected members have pointed out that the work is going on at snail’s pace. Pawaskar said, “The project comprises of many sub-projects, yet the overall completion of work is 25 per cent. While work was slow during the initial stages, we have instructed contractors to strictly follow the deadline and are regularly monitoring the progress.”The government issues debt securities in the form of municipal bonds. With the bonds, civic bodies raise money from the market for a fixed period and guarantees to return the principal plus interest. What is 24x7 water project PMC decided to execute the 24x7 water project for equal distribution of water across the city. The scheme remained quite controversial due to inflated tenders. The main objectives of the project are as follows: Safe and equitable water supply to all citizens for the next 30 years Distribution of water 24 hours every day Reduce the amounts of water losses and non-revenue water Ensuring technological, economical & environmental sustainability of the water supply service The above objectives are to be achieved by adopting the following approach: Introducing universal smart-metering of water consumption and application of water charges based on the effective water consumption by the consumer Conducting water audits by setting bulk flow meters in all stages of the water supply system Introducing a SCADA system for timely and effective control of system operations, water quality monitoring and achieving high service level benchmarks Undertaking systematic leakage detection and repair activity to bring down the level of non-revenue Water in the distribution system to the desired level of 15% Use of GIS-based technologies to integrate geo-spatial and real time data Deploying innovative and IEC (Information, Education and Communication) strategies in print and digital media to proactively engage with all citizens Existing and proposed water system in Pune Particulars/Existing/ Proposed Raw water from Khadakwasla and Pavana reservoir/Khadakwasla, Bhama Askhed and Mulshi Dam Water treatment plant capacity/ 2314 MLD/300 MLD Water supply zones/67/141 Service reservoirs/58/103 Distribution network/ 2325 km/ 1618 km Transmission network/93.54 km/139.23 km Automatic meter reading/zero/3.15 lakh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmcwater-department-seeks-rs-200-cr-more-through-municipal-bonds-for-24x7-water-plan-101611317744590.html

The egg prices, too, have reduced by 20 per cent as per the association.Moreover, the outbreak has also hit the hotel industry in the district which was already reeling under 50 per cent losses due to the lockdown. The hotel industry association claimed a 15 per cent slump in business as demand for chicken dishes have reduced.The association claimed that they were merely able to do 40 per cent of their usual business this time of the year.Sayyed Sheikh, secretary, Thane Poultry Farmers Association, said, “Last year, the rumours of consuming chicken could cause Coronavirus impacted the sale of chicken in the city. This year has started with bird flu despite alerts that chicken cooked well or eggs boiled well can be had despite the bird flu scare. The chicken prices have come down by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. A kilogram of chicken sold for ₹180- ₹200 earlier is now being sold for ₹100. The poultry sellers are facing a lot of losses overall.”There are a few who continue to purchase poultry, but they are only a handful and constitute hardly 40 per cent of the daily business, say traders.Sheikh informed that the prices of eggs too have reduced from ₹6 to ₹4 per egg. “The price of a dozen eggs has reduced from ₹70 to ₹55.”Meanwhile, the hotel owners across Thane District also noticed a slump in business. Raghunath Rai, secretary, Thane Hotels Association, said, “We are still reeling under the business slowdown caused due to the lockdown. There are hardly 40 per cent people visiting hotels or opt for take away. Since the onset of the bird flu scare, there has been an additional slump in business and the demand for chicken dishes has also reduced.”Moreover, some hotels that serve non-vegetarian dishes have also seen 30 per cent impact in their business. Umesh Shetty, president, Thane Hotel Owners Association, said, “The demand for all meat dishes has reduced in the wake of the bird flu, but sea food continues to be popular. Many hotels are luring customers by introducing sea food special menus or offers.”Despite repeated alerts by the government that chicken and eggs can be consumed, there are only a few who consider it safe to have these items.“It is better to stay off meat and eggs for a few days instead of worrying about the right temperature to cook the chicken or boil eggs. Despite the low prices of chicken, we would like to wait for a few more days until the situation has returned to normal,” said Stella Monteiro, 43, resident of Kolshet, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-hits-poultry-business-in-thane-district-prices-consumption-down-101611317625900.html
22-01-2021||Bhopal||Don't let `ego` come in way of breaking farm laws impasse: Uma Bharti||Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti on Friday said the Centre and protesting farmers should ensure that stubbornness and ego do not come in the way of resolving differences over the new agri-marketing laws.The former Union minister said it is after a gap of more than 30 years that farmers have gathered near Delhi to push for their demands.It is an opportunity for both the government and farmers. Stubbornness and ego from both sides should not come in the way (of finding a solution to impasse over new laws), she told reporters at her bungalow here.Her comments came after scribes sought her views on the nearly two-month-long protest by farmers on Delhi borders. Multiple rounds of talks have failed to break the deadlock on the three new agri laws enacted by the Centre in September.The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said farmers came together under the leadership of farm leaders Mahendra Singh Tikait and Sharad Joshi around 30 years ago.In 1988, Tikait had mobilised a large number of farmers of Uttar Pradesh and reached Delhi to seek redressal of their grievances related to agrarian distress and price of their produce, among others.But differences between them (farmers) surfaced after some time then, said Bharti.Gujarat has always been a state of farmers. Farming was the foundation of Gujarats economy, industries came later (there), said.Thus, a big opportunity has come in the way of (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi as well as farmers (to resolve differences over the new laws), the BJP leader said.Farmers are demanding a repeal of the three farm laws which seek to encourage private trade, contract farming and remove stock limit on foodgrains.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/dont-let-ego-come-in-way-of-breaking-farm-laws-impasse-uma-101611316244294.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman withdraws plaint against Munde; Pawar says NCP stand vindicated||A day after a woman withdrew her complaint of sexual exploitation against Maharashtra social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said their decision stands vindicated as the party had said there needed to be an investigation before taking any action against the minister. BJP, which was demanding Munde’s scalp, has now sought action against the complainant for making false allegations.In a letter posted on her Twitter handle, the woman said the relationship between Munde and her sister (with whom the minister is in a consensual relationship) had not been cordial for a long time. “I felt that I was being used as a tool for a big political conspiracy and hence decided to withdraw my complaint and some people are firing shots by putting a gun on my shoulder. I would like to clarify I am withdrawing my complaint against Dhananjay Munde and don’t want to pursue it further,” she said in the letter. According to news reports, the complainant withdrew her complaint against Munde on Thursday. Reacting to the development, Pawar said in Kolhapur, “In the beginning, I had made a statement that the case appears serious but following more revelations, the party came to the conclusion that we need to get to the bottom of this and prima facie, it appears that our decision was right.” Munde was at the centre of a controversy after the woman, a singer, accused him of rape on the pretext of marriage and promise of help with her career. She alleged that the police were not accepting her written complaint against the minister and her life was under threat. Munde, however, claimed that the woman was trying to defame and blackmail him. Meanwhile, state BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh has now demanded action against the complainant. She said that the complainant must be booked for making false allegations. “It is shocking to know that the woman has withdrawn her complaint. The allegations against Munde were also shocking for us. From day one, BJP took a stand that the case is not between two individuals — Munde and the complainant — because we don’t want to set a wrong example in Maharashtra and hence were demanding Munde’s resignation. Now, I feel it is imperative to book her (complainant) under section 192 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) because making false allegations is an offence, be it a politician or a common person such accusations can destroy someone’s life,” Wagh said in her statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-woman-withdraws-plaint-against-munde-pawar-says-ncp-stand-vindicated-101611315224951.html
22-01-2021||Lucknow||Unlike other parties, we have 'neta', 'niyat' to take BJP forward: Nadda||BJP president J P Nadda here on Friday said his party has a leader and the intention to take it forward unlike other political outfits, which he accused of being dynastic.He said "parivarvaad" (dynastic politics) can be found in all political parties except the BJP, in which an ordinary person can become a prime minister, defence minister or home minister.The BJP chief was speaking at the party's “Booth President Conference” here. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also attended the event."We have 'neta' (leader), 'niyat' (intention), 'niti' (policy), 'karyakarta' (workers) and 'karyakram' (programme). We have no reason to stop," Nadda told party workers.He said ''parivarvaad'' exists in all political parties, with the baton being passed on to the son by the father."But it is in the BJP that an ordinary person can become a prime minister, defence minister or home minister," he said.Referring to the Covid-19 pandemic, Nadda said, "Even the US was fighting against it, but what happened? It could not decide between the options of 'arth' (economy) and 'swasthya' (health). As a result, it was a political issue, an electoral issue and there was an electoral loss.They had a better health system than us. Spain and Italy had better health system than us, but all of this collapsed because the leadership did not take the decision at the appropriate time. Here, Modiji took the decision at the right time, imposed a lockdown with timely intervention and bold decision, and saved the country.”He added that at the time of the imposition of the lockdown, the testing capacity was 150 samples per day and today it is 10 lakh per day and in UP, it is over 1.5 lakh per day."At the onset of the lockdown, PPE kits were imported and today over 5 lakh PPE kits per day are being made," he said."India has the best recovery rate and lowest mortality rate. Today, our recovery rate is above 97 per cent and it is increasing every day. UP's population is 24 crore and the population of the US is (nearly) 33 crore. There, the number of people who have died is four lakh. Every life is important. Here, it is 8,000. We have to understand this difference," the BJP chief said.Nadda said the image of India has changed due to the 'swachhta abhiyan' and the toilets constructed in various households are not merely toilets, they are "izzat ghar for women"."The Ujjawla Yojana was not merely a scheme, it empowered the women," he said, adding that UP bothered about every migrant labourer, which passed through the state during the nationwide lockdown.He urged the party workers to link every farmer with the FPO (farmer producer organisation) and told them to implement social harmony in letter and spirit.Speaking at the event, Adityanath said the BJP has set new standards for political parties.Dynastic politics, casteism, regionalism and linguistic divisions weaken democracy and challenge the unity and integrity of the country, Adityanath said.Today, the world is looking towards India with hope, the chief minister said. Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma were also present at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unlike-other-parties-we-have-neta-niyat-to-take-bjp-forward-nadda-101611314959837.html

22-01-2021||Bhopal||MP order seeking proposal for opening new liquor shops sparks controversy||The Madhya Pradesh government’s order asking all district collectors to send proposals for opening new liquor shops has stirred a controversy in the state. Former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) senior leader Uma Bharti opposed the proposal and demanded a ban on the sale of liquor in all BJP-ruled states. Congress leaders also attacked the government for promoting consumption of liquor. Excise department commissioner Rajeev Chandra Dubey on Thursday released an order to collectors of all districts to send a proposal for opening new liquor shops after identifying the areas where there are no shops. Also Read: ‘Tandav makers would have been behind bars if...’: Madhya Pradesh minister“The collectors should send a proposal to increase at least 20% liquor shops in every district. The collectors should identify new area to open shops to control crime and increase revenue collection. The collectors should send the proposal within two days,” said the order. Home department minister Narottam Mishra supported the decision of opening of new shops to stop the sale of illicit liquor, especially in rural areas After this order, Mishra said, “This is a regular annual practice so it is nothing controversial.”“As compared to other states, there are fewer liquor shops in MP and due to this, the business of illicit liquor is flourishing. We are not promoting consumption of liquor but controlling the crime of illicit liquor-making,” he said. The order was released a day after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan denied that new liquor vends would be opened in the state. The CM had said, “The government doesn’t have any plan to open new liquor shops. The decision will be taken only on the basis of feelings of common people.” Uma Bharti said, “It is wrong to open new shops. I urged BJP national president JP Nadda to ban the sale of liquor in all BJP-ruled states.” “I know liquor shops are one of the important sources of revenue collection but government should think about some new sources of income,” she added. Congress MLA and former minister PC Sharma said, “The chief minister is denying the opening of new shops in the state while the home minister is openly saying that new shops should be opened. This is the double standard of BJP-led state government. Rather than dissuading people from consuming liquor, MP government is planning to promote it.” Meanwhile, 28 people died after consuming illicit liquor in Morena in the past two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-order-seeking-proposal-for-opening-new-liquor-shops-sparks-controversy-101611314625210.html

No actual vaccine was being made at that facility. The extent of the damage is more than 1,000 crore," he said.However, the production of BCG and Rotavirus vaccines will be affected in future, SII officials had said in a statement issued earlier.The impact will be a result of the financial losses suffered after the fire at an under-installation building of the SII plant at Manjari, officials of the pharmaceuticals company said.Also Read: Maharashtra orders probe into SII fire that killed 5; Covid vaccine plant safeAccording to state health minister Rajesh Tope, the fire was caused by welding sparks. “Rotavirus plant installation was going on when welding sparks caused the fire due to highly inflammable material present at the spot.

22-01-2021||Patna||‘Talibani’: Opposition slams Nitish Kumar over order against offensive posts||Opposition in Bihar has launched an offensive against the Nitish Kumar government after the state police issued a directive to treat offensive or objectionable comments against the government, ministers, MPs, MLAs, posted on social media/internet, as cyber crime.The opposition parties led by the RJD have termed the directive, issued on Thursday by the additional director general (ADG), economic offenses unit (EoU), Nayyar Husnain Khan, a grave violation of the right to freedom of speech.In the letter issued by ADG, EoU to all principal secretaries/secretaries, it has been mentioned that there are rising complaints about the growing trend of putting objectionable/ slanderous and offensive posts in the social media platforms against government officials, MPs, MLAs and ministers.“Such acts are against the law and come under the category of cyber crime. It is imperative that appropriate action is taken against such acts and persons putting posts having offensive/ abusive tenor. So, it is requested that on information of any such offensive posts in the social media, the EOU is informed so that an inquiry is made and necessary action as per law is taken,” the ADG has written in the letter.Talking to an electronic channel, the ADG (EOU) said the trend had taken serious proportions. “Just because action is not being taken against those responsible for objectionable posts, the trend has grown in the social media in recent times. The EOU will conduct inquiry into such complaints and initiate action under the I-T act and provisions of the Indian Penal Code against those indulging in such acts,” he said.Asked if the directive appeared to be putting restrictions on free speech, he said police would initiate action only as per law. The Opposition has alleged that the state government led by CM Nitish Kumar was aiming to suppress freedom of speech as it was rattled by growing criticism over law and order situation and its failures.Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav dared the CM to arrest him under the new directive and accused Kumar of promoting corruption and patronising criminals, He also alleged that the Bihar police was involved in the illegal sale of liquor.“I dare the chief minister to arrest me for these accusations under the new directive,” he said.RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha said the directive by the EOU reflected how Bihar had become a ‘talibani’ state and people would never tolerate such arbitrary action.“This is a tuglaqi farman (a reference to Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, a sultan of Tughlaq dynasty infamous for his whims). It means that the police would now put anybody in jail or harass a person if he is critical of the government or put posts highlighting the failure of the government. This is nothing but an attempt to suppress free speech and gag the peoples’ voice. This directive has to be withdrawn immediately,” he said.Congress senior leader and MLC Premchand Mishra said the directive only showed that the state government was scared of criticism and called it unacceptable and a violation of right to freedom of speech.Also Read: Bihar sand mafia attacks NHAI toll plaza staff for stopping overloaded trucksHowever, the ruling JD(U) and BJP have defended the decision claiming it would help in checking abusive and objectionable posts against the government and officials that flood social media, putting state officials and people’s representatives in bad light.“It is a good step, as these days, one can notice how people put objectionable and offensive posts against government officials and others on social media. This is wrong and needs to be checked,” said deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad.JD (U) senior leaders, former minister Neeraj Kumar and state spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan, too, defended the directive, saying it would deter unscrupulous elements from putting objectionable posts.A senior IPS officer however asked if the same directive will be applied evenly to check abusive posts against commoners as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/talibani-opposition-slams-nitish-kumar-over-order-against-offensive-posts-101611312126915.html
22-01-2021||Lucknow||Scope for growth, no nepotism in BJP: Nadda tells party workers in Lucknow||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda on Friday exhorted party booth-level workers to brief people about the government’s welfare schemes and achievements with facts and figures. He also asked them to make it a point to listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann Ki Baat programme every month. Addressing the party booth presidents of Lucknow district on the second and final day of his visit to the city, Nadda told them that the sky was the limit for them when it came to growth within the party.To substantiate his point, he mentioned specific examples, like those of PM Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union home minister Amit Shah and chief minister Yogi Adityanath.“Unlike all other political parties, where the father will always pass the political baton on to his son alone, the BJP gives opportunity to its smallest worker to grow and dream to become the country’s Prime Minister,” he said, attacking nepotism.“You may have come into the BJP by chance or by choice or by accident, but you have come to the right place,” he added.

He said Central schemes such as Ujjwala cooking gas scheme, PM-Kisan, Saubhagya and Ayushman Bharat were all meant for the poor. “Take all these welfare schemes and achievements to people at the booth-level with a political agenda,” he said, advising them to work with the “mera booth sabse mazboot” (my booth is the strongest booth) mantra. He also referred to the construction work of the Ram temple in Ayodhya and the law banning the triple talaq practice among Muslims as the government’s big achievements. Earlier, addressing the event, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the BJP had risen to become the world’s biggest political party by the dint of hard work and sacrifice by its workers. He said the BJP had set new standards of democratic values for others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/scope-for-growth-no-nepotism-in-bjp-nadda-tells-party-workers-in-lucknow-101611312344809.html

ED officials confirmed the development. The anti-money laundering agency is carrying out searches as part of their probe in the alleged diversion of funds from Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) and its subsidiary companies to the Viva group companies. HDIL is accused of defrauding PMC Bank of over ₹ ₹6,670 crore by fraudulently obtaining nearly 70% of the bank’s overall loans.One of the HDIL subsidiaries, Guruashish Constructions Private Limited, controlled by Pravin Raut, is suspected to have diverted funds to Viva groups. The ED has already provisionally attached properties worth ₹72 crore belonging to Raut under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Commenting on the development MLA Thakur said, “We were prepared for the ED’s visit after the action on Pravin Raut. Around 35-40 personnel from ED in seven big vehicles arrived at our Virar office at 9.30 am and they (ED) are still present. We are cooperating with the ED as we have nothing to hide. All our dealings are through cheques. We are prepared to answer all their queries and even willing to visit the ED office. We have nothing to hide.”ED began the money laundering probe in the PMC Bank case after Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai Police registered a criminal case in September 2019 against HDIL, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan and Waryam Singh, Joy Thomas (chairman and managing director of PMC bank Ltd.) and others for causing loss in thousands of crores to PMC Bank.Also read | PMC Bank fraud: ED summons Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s wife againED earlier stated that investigation had revealed that ₹95 crore was siphoned off through HDIL by Pravin Raut in conspiracy and connivance with others.

The party alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party and its top leaders were shielding Goswami.In Mumbai, a protest was held outside Republic TV’s office in Lower Parel followed by a rally at Jambori Maidan in Worli. As part of its nationwide protest over the issues, key Congress leaders led marches in their respective districts. “Goswami knew about the Balakot airstrike three days in advance and the information was leaked to him by top BJP leaders. He is a ‘traitor’ and should be booked for sedition. BJP leaders are shielding him for their political interest by compromising national security. Goswami has used the sacrifice of the CRPF jawans martyred in Pulwama attack for financial gain by boosting TRPs. If central agencies failed to take action against him, Mumbai Police should go ahead and book him for these serious violations,” said Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap.Also Read: Congress steps up attack on Centre over Arnab Goswami’s chatsMaharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat said, “It appears Goswami was in the know about the airstrike as part of Indian defence forces’ retaliation in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019. Goswami appears to know about the airstrike three days in advance. Goswami, in one of his chats, has said that it was revealed to him by a big name in the Modi government. Thorough investigation and arrest of Goswami is a must as the issue relates to national security.”In a statement on January 19, Goswami said, “It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. I am horrified that the Congress party thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the government is committing a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arnab-goswami-chat-leaks-congress-stages-protests-across-maharashtra-101611306164025.html
22-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC plays down Rajib Banerjee’s resignation amid murmur of brewing dissent||West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) party suffered another major blow on Friday when forest minister Rajib Banerjee resigned from the government amid speculations that he too may join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the assembly elections.Banerjee, the legislator from Domjur, is the second minister from Howrah district and the third minister in the state to resign on the eve of the crucial state polls. Banerjee had skipped five consecutive meetings of the state cabinet and more than a dozen party programmes since September last year, when he started voicing his dissent against a section of the leadership in Howrah.Suvendu Adhikari, the heavyweight leader from East Midnapore district resigned from the government and the TMC and joined the BJP on December 19. Former Indian cricketer and sports and youth affairs minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla resigned from the party on January 5. He served as the president of the Howrah district unit. The government immediately relieved him of his ministerial responsibilities.On Friday, Banerjee sent his resignation letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the morning. “I regret to inform you that I hereby tender my resignation from my office as a cabinet minister being in charge of the forest department …..It has been a great honour and privilege to serve the people of West Bengal. I heartily convey my gratitude for getting this opportunity,” the letter said.Also Read: West Bengal Govt under debt of crores of rupees, says former TMC MLABanerjee went to the Raj Bhawan in the afternoon and submitted a copy of the letter to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.After meeting the governor, Banerjee told the media that he wanted to resign as minister two and a half years ago when he was removed from irrigation department.“I held a meeting of the irrigation department in north Bengal on that day and was at a party meeting when I saw on television that I had been removed from the department. I was not even aware of it. I was extremely hurt that I got the news from television. Reshuffling the cabinet is the chief minister’s prerogative but the minimum decency was not shown to me,” said Banerjee.“I met the chief minister and said I would no longer serve as minister. She stopped me. Subsequently I served as a minister in several departments such as tribal welfare and jails. I am grateful to the chief minister for giving me the opportunity to serve. People will decide whether I did well or not,” said Banerjee.“I will continue to service the people from whatever platform I get,” he added but avoided questions on his next move.Banerjee’s voice chocked while he was talking to journalists and tears rolled down his cheeks. “For the past one and a half months I was extremely hurt by the behavior of some of my party colleagues. I never made any personal attack. I feel extremely hurt today. I had no option but to resign. I offer my apology if I have hurt anyone,” he said.Banerjee said that before meeting the governor he went to the chief minister's office at her residence and submitted the resignation letter.BJP’s Barrackpore Lok Sabha member and Rajib Banerjee’s former colleague in the TMC, Arjun Singh said the young minister would be welcomed into the BJP if he decides to join. “More legislators and leaders will leave the TMC,” said Singh.TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “This will not make any difference to the TMC. If people like these leave, our party will get more consolidated.”Another prominent legislator from Howrah, Vaishali Dalmiya, has also voiced dissent against the TMC leadership in the district. Former Howrah mayor Rathin Chakraborty has also aired his dissent.Like Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Banerjee was one of the younger faces in the cabinet and known for his clean image.While Shukla has said that he will stay away from politics and dedicate himself to sports, Banerjee did not comment on his future plans till Friday afternoon. There are speculations that he and some more TMC leaders may join the BJP during the next visits of Union home minister Amit Shah or BJP national president J P Nadda.Shah is likely to visit Bengal on January 30 while Nadda is scheduled to flag off a roadshow in north Bengal on February 5.Banerjee made news for his singing talent in June last year when he released a video of a Hindi song composed to pay homage to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley on the night of June 15. The song, ‘Hindustan Meri Jaan,’ was released on June 23. The video features images and names of the soldiers and their colonel as well as clippings of army exercises and Republic Day parades.TMC leaders said Rajib Banerjee was having severe differences with the TMC’s Howrah unit chairman and senior minister Arup Roy.TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee held several meetings with Banerjee to dissuade him from taking any drastic step. The young minister, however, continued to voice his dissent in public and on social media. “There are some leaders in the party who treat party workers like servants,” Banerjee said at a programme on January 3.“If one wants to work then there are a lot of opportunities in the TMC. Only those who are leaving can explain why they are doing it. I do not think there are organizational problems in Howrah district. The TMC district unit has been revamped and many young people have been inducted,” Chatterjee said after Banerjee resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-plays-down-rajib-banerjee-s-resignation-amid-murmur-of-brewing-dissent-101611304842882.html

If a person tests positive, (s)he is hospitalised and their sample sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) to ascertain if it is the new strain. On testing negative, passengers are advised to go home and quarantine for seven days. Over 25,000 passengers have arrived in the city from the above-mentioned countries in the last month.Also Read: New study explains how Sars-CoV-2 may seize human cellsSuresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said, “The spread of new strain is not much in Mumbai as we have detected only 60 cases till now. Of these 60 cases, 30 are of those who returned from UK and remaining those who have returned from other countries.”On why the detection of new Covid-19 strain could be low, Kakani said, “We cannot attribute the low detection to any particular reason but we are taking all precautions. Once a passenger from UK, Europe, Middle East or South Africa arrives at Mumbai airport, we screen them and quarantine them for seven days. Post this, testing is conducted.”However, as all passengers are quarantined on their arrival, BMC officials said there is no question of tracing close contacts.Kakani added, “The idea behind quarantining them on arrival is to not create close contacts. However, earlier, for five cases of the new strain we had traced close contacts as they arrived before we started quarantining incoming passengers in hotels. The process is the same,that of tracing close contacts, sanitising their houses and sealing buildings, if needed.”On January 4, BMC had said that post detection of five cases of new Covid-19 strain in those who returned from the UK, it had traced 40 close contacts of these five positive patients, and all the 40 tested negative of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-60-cases-of-new-covid-strain-detected-so-far-says-civic-body-101611300823434.html

Twelve samples were collected on Monday and sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) of Indian Council of Agricultural Research for testing, Bhopal,” Dr. Rakesh Singh, the director of the animal husbandry unit of the Delhi government, said.All the 12 samples have tested negative, he said.Last week, samples from a dead owl in the Delhi zoo had tested positive for avian influenza. Zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said they were following all protocols and monitoring the situation strictly."We have been using the ebird mobile application to keep track of the birds in the premises of the zoo," he said. This is the first time the application is being used for bird monitoring and record keeping during the outbreak of avian influenza.The application allows the user to enter sightings from anywhere in the world, even in areas with no cell service, or Internet access.Singh said that 1,338 bird deaths have been reported in Delhi between January 6 and January 21 amid the bird flu situation.Of the 207 samples collected from various places in the national capital, 24 have tested positive for avian influenza so far, he said.On Tuesday, authorities restricted the entry of public into the Red Fort till Friday after a sample of a dead crow tested positive for bird flu.Around 15 crows were found dead in the premises of the Red Fort on January 10.Last week, municipal corporations in the city had imposed a temporary ban on sale and storage of poultry or processed chicken meat after samples taken from crows and ducks at parks and lakes in the national capital tested positive for bird flu.Around 400 ducks were culled at Sanjay Lake on January 11.The Delhi government had also banned the sale of processed and packaged chicken brought from outside the city and ordered the closure of the Ghazipur poultry market in east Delhi for 10 days.However, the ban was lifted on Thursday after all the 100 samples taken from Ghazipur, Asia's largest poultry market, tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/samples-of-dead-cranes-in-delhi-zoo-test-negative-for-bid-flu-officials-101611298128844.html

After his death, his father approached the hospital to get access to the sperm.The hospital authorities told the father in January 2019 that as his son was married at the time of his death, they would require a no-objection from the widow.The father approached his daughter-in-law for a no-objection, but she did not reply. Rather it was alleged that she refused to have any communication.The father then moved the high court for access saying the sperm belongs to his deceased son.“As far as the alleged right of the petitioner to collect such preserved sperm of his son, contrary to the arguments advanced by counsel, the petitioner does not have any ‘fundamental right’ to such permission, merely by dint of his father-son relationship with the deceased,” the court said. “The father-son relationship of the petitioner and the deceased does not entail any such right of the petitioner to the progeny of his son. As such, the right espoused by the petitioner for himself is illusory and non-existent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/only-widow-of-a-dead-man-has-the-right-to-his-sperm-calcutta-hc-101611297102793.html

22-01-2021||Delhi||CWC meeting today likely to take stand on Arnab chat leak, farm protests||The ongoing farmers’ protest and the WhatsApp chat leak involving journalist Arnab Goswami are likely to feature prominently in the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Friday even as all eyes would be on the decision on the organisational polls. The CWC will debate the farmers’ protests against the three farm laws that were cleared in Parliament without review. The top executive body of the Congress may ask for a repeal of the laws a day after farmer bodies rejected the government’s proposal to put the laws in abeyance for up to 18 months. Just three days ago, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi lashed out at the government over the farm laws and announced “100% support” for protesting farmers. Gandhi maintained that the new farm laws are aimed at making monopolies in the farm sector. Also read | Ahead of UP polls, Congress releases calendar with Priyanka Gandhi’s photosSimilarly, on Wednesday, the party rallied former defence minister AK Antony and a group of senior UPA-era ministers to hit out at the government over the chat leak involving Goswami. The Congress dubbed the leak as an act of treason and pointed a finger at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. “The Arnab Goswami saga reveals an ugly spectre of inexcusable compromise with national security and an unforgivable trade-off with the oath of Constitution by the Prime Minister-home minister and those holding high offices,” a party statement had said. This is the first CWC after the farmers’ stir against agri-laws and the chat leak came out in public domain. Two CWC members said that these two issues are of vital importance to the nation as they relate to food security and national security and the CWC is likely to come out with a statement on these. The CWC meeting might also consider the upcoming assembly elections in four states and the time required for the party’s election authority (CEA) to prepare the ground for internal elections, before drawing up a schedule for the latter, which could see the election of a new president. The meeting is being closely watched both by the old guard, including the 23 signatories to an August letter to party president Sonia Gandhi seeking sweeping changes in the Congress’ functioning, as well as the young Turks, mainly leaders allied with former party president Rahul Gandhi. The signatories of the letter are waiting to see how the meeting tries to address the issues they raised. “We also want the Bihar election results taken up for discussion in the CWC,” said one of the letter-writers. The Congress fared poorly in the election, winning 19 of the 70 seats it contested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cwc-meeting-today-likely-to-take-stand-on-arnab-chat-leak-farm-protests-101611291763890.html

At least eight people are feared dead in the massive explosion that took place near a gravel and boulder crushing facility late on Thursday.“It’s shocking and unfortunate news that many people have died in a massive disaster that occurred last night near the tornado of Shivamogga. I’m in contact with senior officials since late night, teams have already been dispatched to the required rescue operation,” Yediyurappa said in a tweet in Kannada.“I wish to express my deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. The wounded are being treated and I wish them all a speedy recovery. A high-level investigation into the misdemeanour has been ordered and strict action against the guilty is certain,” the chief minister added.Police and officials were seen inspecting the blast site in Hunasodu village this morning. Shivamogga lawmaker BY Raghavendra was also present at the spot, according to news agency ANI. "A loud sound was heard which was accompanied by a vibration near Hunasodu village in Shivamogga district. There was an explosion due to dynamite or explosive material. An investigation is on. A bomb squad is coming from Bengaluru and another team from Mangaluru," Raghavendra told ANI.Shivamogga district collector KB Shivakumar said it was initially observed that there were explosives in a vehicle parked at the site. “It's being probed why they were brought here. Till now we recovered two bodies. It's being circulated in public that 10-15 [people] died. But it's not substantiated by any facts,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.“As per our preliminary information, since the incident occurred at night there was no worker working here. So, all the people who worked here regularly are safe. We have confirmed it.

The explosion was so strong that window panes shattered while many houses and even roads developed cracks, an eye witness was quoted as saying. "There has been a blast in a truck carrying gelatin. The vibrations were felt locally," a police official told PTI on Thursday.Due to its high intensity, the jolt was earlier mistaken to have been caused by an earthquake, however, geologists ruled out recording tremors in any of their observatories.The victims were reportedly transporting the explosives meant for mining when the explosion occurred. The vehicle was badly mangled and the bodies of the victims were dismembered beyond recognition.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of the blast victims.

Foreign tourists can get inner-line permits at the checkpost to enter the state. Foreign tourists have had to travel longer distances to get inner-line permits as such permits were issued only at two checkpoints, Melli and Rangpo. While inner-line permits are mandatory for foreign tourists to enter the state, such permits are not required for Indians. A notification issued by SC Gupta, the state’s chief secretary, said that in view to boost rural, religious and adventure tourism in the state, the government has decided to open the Ramman checkpost for entry of tourists to Sikkim from March 1. Also Read: Film City in Sikkim: Union minister Jitendra Singh holds discussions“The state tourism department has indicated that a large number of foreign tourists has been requesting entry through Ramman checkpost at Budang in West Sikkim,” the notification issued on Wednesday said. Around 150,000 foreign tourists visit Sikkim every year, officials said. The checkpost was closed almost a decade back after it was found that a few foreign tourists had entered the state without a permit. Ramman checkpost is located along the West Sikkim - Darjeeling border near Jorethang town and is about 90 minutes’ drive downhill from Darjeeling town in north Bengal via Tukvar and Singla. This means foreign tourists coming to Darjeeling would take less time and money to reach Sikkim. The decision has been welcomed by tourism stakeholders both in Sikkim and West Bengal. Sandipan Ghosh, secretary of Eastern Himalaya Travel and Tour Operators Association, said: “The decision will go a long way to boost the tourism industry in the region. Now, more foreign tourists visiting neighbouring Darjeeling would find it easy to visit South and West Sikkim.” While West Sikkim is a popular destination for adventure sports and has some high-altitude trekking destinations such as Dzongri and Goechala, South Sikkim has major pilgrimage tourism attractions like Buddha Park in Rabongla and Char Dham at Namchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sikkim-to-become-more-accessible-to-foreign-tourists-as-ramman-checkpost-reopens-101611289241554.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||No breakthrough in govt-farm union talks: Here’s what we know so far||Farm unions protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September have rejected the Centre’s offer to put the legislation in abeyance for at least one-and-a-half years. Here is what we know so far: • The rejection has deepened the crisis as it appeared that almost two-month-long agitation could finally be resolved. Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping at New Delhi’s borders seeking a repeal of the laws.  • In the 10th round of negotiations with a 41-member delegation representing farm unions on Wednesday, the Centre offered to suspend the legislation. • But the farmers hardened their stand on Thursday, saying they will not budge from their demand for a complete repeal. • After several rounds of internal discussions over the government offer, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the platform of farm unions leading the agitation, said on Thursday that the farmers had unanimously rejected the proposal. It said the proposal is unacceptable because its demand is a repeal of the laws.  • In a statement the unions said a full general body meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha was held on Thursday and enacting legislation for remunerative minimum support price for all farmers was reiterated. Also read | Supreme Court turns down plea seeking to stop farmers’ tractor rallyIn Wednesday’s talks, the government said that it would file an affidavit before the Supreme Court about its decision to put the laws in abeyance till a solution to farmers’ demands was found. • To discuss the issues raised by farmers, which includes a law guaranteeing assured prices for their produce, the government had also told farm unions that it proposed to set up a committee of representatives as well as experts who should be nominated both by farm unions and the government to examine “all agitation-related issues”. • The move was hailed by experts as a step back by the government, and they expected farmers to reciprocate. • The farm unions, too, said they would discuss the government’s fresh offer, sparking hopes of a resolution. • The government pushed the laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements. • Farmers say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. They have demanded a full repeal of the three agricultural laws and have also sought a legal guarantee of assured prices for farm produce. • On January 12, after two days of deliberation, the Supreme Court suspended the pro-reforms farm laws until further order. The bench dealing with the case — headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde — also appointed a committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-breakthrough-in-govt-farm-union-talks-here-s-what-we-know-so-far-101611287381848.html

The truth is that BJP is completely rattled by the ₹2500 crore scam uncovered by the AAP in the MCD, and is indulging in trash talk to only distract the public attention from this issue.”While Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that the party will start a door-to-door campaign to tell people in this regard, leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the allegations are “very serious”The AAP said the opposition party knows the writing on the wall, referring to the MCD polls scheduled next year. “The allegation by BJP is completely bogus and frivolous. If there was any scam in DJB, BJP would have already unleased the Delhi Police, CBI and Anti Corruption Bureau but they instead chose to talk to media. BJP knows the writing is on the wall and that the people of Delhi are going to vote for the AAP in the upcoming MCD elections, giving a historic mandate,” the party said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-spar-over-allegations-of-financial-irregularities-101611282082343.html

Both the Centre and the state have decided to organise various programmes for Bose’s 125th birthday next year. The year-long celebrations will begin this January 23.“This is a publicity stunt and is politically motivated...It is only to woo Bengal’s voters,” said Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minster Tapas Roy.BJP state vice-president Ritesh Tiwari criticised the TMC and said, “It is the Modi government that gave proper recognition to the Azad Hind government that Netaji (as Bose is popularly known as) formed. Nobody did it in decades.”On the other hand, the Forward Bloc, which Bose formed in 1939, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said they will celebrate the legendary freedom fighter’s birthday as Desh Prem Diwas, or day of patriotism, as declared by the previous Left Front government in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-bjp-trade-barbs-before-pm-modi-s-kolkata-visit-101611280506519.html
22-01-2021||Pune||5 dead as fire breaks out at Serum facility||Five people were killed in a blaze that ripped through the top floor and partially damaged another floor of a five-storey building at a facility of the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune on Thursday, but the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer said the incident will not hit the production of coronavirus shot Covishield.Officials said at least four people were rescued from SII’s Manjari premises in an operation spanning over an hour to bring the fire under control and save those trapped. They added that the nearest Covishield production and storage units are at least a kilometre away from the under-constructionbuilding that went up in flames.The Maharashtra government ordered a probe into the incident. State health minister Rajesh Tope said initial findings suggested that the fire was caused due to welding work and spread fast due to the presence of inflammatory material on the premises.“We have just received some distressing updates; upon further investigation we have learnt that there has unfortunately been some loss of life at the incident. We are deeply saddened and offer our deepest condolences to the family members of the departed,” SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla tweeted in the evening, a little more than an hour after posting that there were no casualties or major injuries.All of those killed were contractual labourers involved in work related to electricity; two of them from Uttar Pradesh, one from Bihar and two from Pune, according to according to Manjari legislator Chetan Tupe. Their bodies were found on the fifth floor of the building called MSEZ-03. Later in the day, SII announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹25 lakh each for the families of the deceased.“I would like to reassure all governments & the public that there would be no loss of #COVISHIELD production due to multiple production buildings that I had kept in reserve to deal with such contingencies at @SerumInstIndia. Thank you very much @PuneCityPolice & Fire Department,” Poonawalla said in another tweet.His organisation is manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca in India, where the world’s largest inoculation drive began on January 16 thanks to SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s indigenously produced Covaxin.India is also shipping Covishield to its neighbours, strengthening them in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Six countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles and Myanmar – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance.On Twitter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was anguished by the loss of lives. “In this sad hour, my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. I pray that those injured recover at the earliest,” he tweeted.Television visuals showed huge plumes of smoke billowing from the building as firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze.“Fire at Serum Institute of India in Pune has been brought under control...I have been informed that the Covid vaccine manufacturing plant is safe,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray told the media during an interaction at a guest house at Malabar Hill on Mumbai’s suburbs on Thursday evening.Thackeray will visit the Manjari facility on Friday noon, according to Pune district officials.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said directives “have been issued to the Pune police commissioner for a detailed investigation into the incident”. He said a fire audit will be conducted at the building. “(Also) A team of experts will determine the cause (of the fire),” Pawar added.Officials said the five-storey building (ground plus five floors) was planned as an extension to the production facility for rotavirus. It is a part of the Manjari facility, which falls in a special economic zone and is around 15km from Pune, which began functioning in September 2019 as an extension to SII’s Hadapsar facility in the city.The fire broke out at on the fourth and fifth floors of the building and the fire department received a call around 3:50pm, according to Pune fire brigade control room officials. It rushed at least 10 fire-tenders to the spot. The fire was brought under control around 5pm and the bodies were found during a rescue operation around 5:30pm. Embers resurfaced at around 7pm during the cooling process, but the situation was quickly brought under control.“It is the fire experts who will only be able to ascertain the actual cause of the fire,” said Tupe, the local legislator.SII is producing around 50 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine a month at other facilities in the complex. It also has plans to make up to 50 million doses of a vaccine candidate developed by Novavax Inc from around April.SII, which also makes shots against polio, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella, plans to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a World Health Organisation-backed effort to procure and distribute inoculations to poor countries.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/5-dead-as-fire-breaks-out-at-serum-facility-101611277984447.html

"Pained by the loss of lives in Shivamogga. Condolences to the bereaved families. Praying that the injured recover soon. The State Government is providing all possible assistance to the affected," his office said in a tweet.The jolt was earlier mistaken to have been caused by an earthquake, following which geologists were approached, who ruled out recording tremors in any of their observatories."There was no earthquake. But an explosion did take place at Hunsur on the outskirts of Shivamogga under the Rural Police station limits," a police officer told PTI.Another police officer said, "There has been a blast in a truck carrying gelatin. Six labourers in the truck were found dead. The vibrations were felt locally."

22-01-2021||Bhopal||17-yr-old rape victim dies by suicide||A 17-year-old rape victim died by suicide in Bhopal on Wednesday night, officials said on Thursday. The girl had consumed sleeping pills at a state government-run shelter home on Monday and was undergoing treatment at Hamidia Hospital in Bhopal, the officials said.“On Monday afternoon, the girl consumed sleeping pills to end her life. She was rushed to Hamidia hospital where she died on Wednesday while undergoing treatment. After post mortem, the body was handed over to the family,” said Sai Krishna Thota, SP, Bhopal (south).The girl’s family, however, has accused the shelter officials of harassing the girls at the home. “The shelter superintendent was harassing all the girls and a few days ago she physically assaulted them too. Depressed with life in the shelter, my sister ended her life,” the girl’s cousin said. “Even after death, the administration didn’t allow us to take the body home. The body was sent to cremation ground directly from the hospital,” he alleged. Following the girl’s death, Bhopal district collector Avinash Lavaniya has removed the superintendent of the shelter home and ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter.“The superintendent has been removed from the shelter. As of now, the aspect of physical assault didn’t come to light. The magisterial inquiry is being conducted,” Lavaniya said.The shelter home’s superintendent denied the allegations of the girl’s family. “The girls want to go home and are getting frustrated and misbehaving with staff members. A few days ago, they beat me up too. I don’t know from where the girl got the pills,” she said. The rape case had come to light in July 2020 when five minor girls were found in an inebriated state in Ratibad area.During counselling by Childline, the girls had revealed that Pyare Miyan, the owner of a vernacular newspaper in Bhopal, used to invite them to parties where he raped them.The girls were moved to a government-run shelter after at least four FIRs were filed against Miyan in Bhopal and Indore.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

22-01-2021||Budget||‘Hope govt helps small businessmen like me’||Rishab Mitra’s grocery store in the heart of Lucknow has been in the family for four generations, but the 31-year-old fears he may not be able to keep the doors open for much longer.The 31-year-old owner of Mitra Provision Store in Lucknow’s Aminabad market sells spices packed at home and home-made snacks. For a decade, he successfully competed with big stores by focusing on quality, and relying on word-of-mouth recommendations and a loyal customer base.But the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown hurt his sales. “After the pandemic, people want to opt for cheaper products even if the difference is only a few rupees,” said Mitra, who lives with his parents in their ancestral house and is unmarried.During the lockdown, Mitra’s shop was open but few people were willing to step out of their houses and online grocers delivered produce at their doorstep.Even when the lockdown was lifted, Mitra said his customers didn’t return. “Before the pandemic, online sale of groceries and food grain was not much. But the pandemic changed this scenario. Now, people prefer to purchase even grocery items online. The scare of the virus is keeping customers away from stores,” Mitra said.There was a small uptick in his sales after the lockdown ended, but a nationwide surge in infections in August-September, and news of new strains of the virus later damaged customer confidence.“Before the lockdown, I used to get around 80 to 100 customers daily. But now, this figure has come down to 40-50,” he said.He believes online stores have an advantage over them as they don’t have upfront costs like rent and maintenance.“In my free time now, I try to tap customers over phone. I am also trying to supply goods to big stores who outsource local products like snacks,” Mitra said.According to India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), a trust established by the central government, market opportunities for online commerce in India are expected to touch $200 billion by 2026 from $30 billion in 2017. E-commerce business increased by about 20% after the lockdown was imposed in India on March 25, the study added.During the pandemic, the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government provided loans on easy instalments for small shopkeepers, said Lucknow mayor Sanyukta Bhatia. “Large number of shopkeepers and vendors in Lucknow and across the state benefitted,” Bhatia said.Mitra hopes Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will support small businessmen like him when she delivers the Union budget on February 1. He wants the government to create a level-playing field for mom-and-pop stores like his, and big e-commerce firms. “The government must at least ensure parity between online and offline stores when it comes to imposing rules and regulations,” he said. He also hopes that the government announces regulations for online stores. India introduced new ecommerce rules last year, and is currently considering a cap on foreign direct investment in the sector.Mitra said, for small shopkeepers like him, complying with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) norms was not easy. “According to the new tax system, we have to file a tax return in three months. But we have to make rounds of the GST office every month,” said Mitra. He demanded the process of filing GST be revised and made easier for small traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/hope-govt-helps-small-businessmen-like-me-101611270935421.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Beyond the baoli, a simple well||The city has a village. The village has a square. The square has a well.Delhi is well-known for its centuries old step-wells, or baolis. But in the Capital it is a rare thing to chance upon an average well, without picturesque stone steps—a well that resembles those thousands of other wells spread all over the country, in as many villages. The Capital itself has hundreds of villages within its limits, but who amid us ever bumped into a well in, say, fashionable Hauz Khas Village?But here in south Delhi’s historic Chirag Dehli village, an entire square is devoted to a well. Alas, nobody uses it any more in our era of running water supply. In fact, the well has been covered with a metal netting a few years ago, preventing its use, after a peacock (of all the creatures!) accidentally fell into it—according to a shopkeeper.Surrounded by groceries and snack joints, the well is nevertheless nestled within a vibrant social life. Bengali Sweet Center advertises chhole bhature in bold white wordings as its “Sunday special.” Chhetri Chinese Food Center has a momo steamer on its plain plywood counter. There’s even a small shop named “North Eastern Grocery”, just another manifestation of the cosmopolitan character of the village, in which Bengali and Nepali are easily heard, along with Hindi, and where in fact almost every third shop offers “money order service to Nepal.”The well’s other notable neighbours include a spindly neem, with a bench under it, and the so-called “teen tarike ka ped”, or the tree with three types—neem, bargad and peepal are growing out of the same trunk.The well itself is a kind of monument. A low circular wall is built around it on a raised platform, painted with a caution not to toss broken idols or flowers inside. The most eye-popping decor consists of a large pickle jar, used as a flower pot. The place is silent this evening, except for the barking of a suspicious dog from an adjacent house. On peering through the metal netting, it is possible for the gaze to travel down the seemingly bottomless tunnel. Whether it ends with water or continues into infinite darkness is impossible to determine. Meanwhile, the sky itself starts getting dark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-beyond-the-baoli-a-simple-well-101611269730345.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||Govt will lean on its socio-economic survey to find people with comorbidities||Findings of Delhi government’s socio-economic survey – which suggests that 2.60% of the population of the Capital have chronic illnesses – is being considered for ascertaining the number of people with comorbidities, who will be in line for getting the Covid-19 vaccination in the third phase along with people aged over 50 years.The survey took place between took place between November 2018 and November 2019.The first phase of the vaccination drive – meant for health workers—is currently underway in the city. Delhi has around 300,000 health care workers of whom 240,000 have registered for the vaccine shots. The overall actual turnout so far since January 16 (the first day of the vaccination drive) has remained around 54.5%, because of what experts attribute as vaccine hesitance. (updated)The second group set to be inoculated are front line workers – which includes the police, sanitation workers, fire officials, teachers, and staff in departments which were engaged in Covid-19 management. Their number is estimated at 600,000 and the registration process for this category is currently underway.The third phase is supposed to cover people aged over 50 years and people with comorbidities, irrespective of their age. While the government estimates the number of people aged over 50 years to be around 4.2 million through electoral rolls, they are yet to ascertain the number of people with comorbidities. Registration for this category (which includes both people aged over 50 years and people with comorbidities) is yet to begin.“For people with comorbidities, so far, the government was relying on hospital data, records obtained from departments such as health and social welfare, and findings of door-to-door health surveys which were launched across all 11 revenue districts during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings of the socio-economic survey will now help in ascertaining the numbers under this category,” said a senior government official.According to the survey – which covered a sample size of around 10.2 million people, roughly half of Delhi’s population – around 2.60% of Delhi suffers from chronic illnesses that qualify as comorbid conditions. Of those who have comorbid conditions, 36.33% have diabetes, 21.75% have diseases that concern cardiac issues, hypertension and blood circulation, 9.17% have respiratory diseases, 2.33% have thalassemia, 2.02% have tuberculosis, 1.40% have leprosy, 1.33% have some form of cancer, 1.12% have haemophilia, 0.26% have HIV and the remaining 24.29% have been clubbed under “other diseases’’.The report on the survey, which HT has seen, further said, “The highest proportion of diabetes patients in Delhi has been reported as 43.34% from (the) central district and the highest proportion of cardiac patients is 26.20% in north-west district. Further, the highest proportion of patients with respiratory disease is 11.56% in (the) north district.”The findings of the survey have been uploaded on Delhi government’s website. While the Delhi government publishes an economic survey every year, this is the first such socio-economic survey with a much larger ambit beyond economic and welfare indicators, which includes schooling, nutrition, access to resources ranging from drinking water to mobile phones and television, transportation, housing and health indicators, among several others.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “The findings of the survey have the potential to contribute in several fronts of governance. Assessment of the report is underway. We are examining all aspects of it.”The survey was ordered by Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in 2018 after three girls – aged between two and eight years – of a family were found to have died of severe malnutrition in east Delhi’s Mandawli. The project, however, faced delays because of the Lok Sabha polls in 2019 and Delhi Assembly polls in February 2020, said the senior government official.Dr Suneela Garg, director professor of community medicines department at Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and member of the Lancet commission for Covid-19 India vaccination task force, said: “The findings of the government report will be very useful in ascertaining an estimated number of people in the category for people with comorbidities. So far, to identify people in this category, governments across states are digging into hospital records and departmental records. The government is also planning to take data from the Aarogya Setu application in this regard.”To ensure that no person aged over 50 years or those with comorbidities gets excluded from the vaccination drive, the government will also be opening up windows for people to get registered on their own – both online and offline. “But that window will open up after vaccines are administered to front line workers across the country. The approval will be given by the Central government. Provisions, such as giving the general public limited access to the Co-Win system through applications and setting up help desks in government offices, have been discussed in several review meetings,” said a senior official in the Delhi government’s health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-will-lean-on-its-socio-economic-survey-to-find-people-with-comorbidities-101611260836299.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi: 24 adverse reactions reported on Day 4, two require hospitalisation||On the fourth day of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, 24 people — or 0.40% of the total number of people receiving the jabs —showed adverse events.On Thursday, Delhi had witnessed its highest number of vaccinations ever since the drive started on January 16 with 73.36% or 5,942 health care workers getting inoculated.At least 22 of the 24 adverse reactions reported were minor, whereas two people needed hospitalisation. Both the people to be hospitalised had received Covaxin shots, as per data seen by HT.However, senior district officials claimed that both the hospitalisations had happened on Wednesday – when Delhi did not have an immunisation drive – following vaccinations that were done on Tuesday.“There were two people who were admitted for observation on Wednesday and were discharged soon after. Both the people had minor symptoms, such as fever for which they had been admitted. No serious adverse event has been reported in the district,” said a senior official from south-west district that showed the two hospitalisations.So far, there has been only one severe adverse event following vaccination using Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. A 22-year-old security guard at the All India Institute of Medial Sciences had developed serious allergic reaction and had to be admitted after getting the shot on January 16.There have been cases of abnormal heart rate, severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, and faintings reported after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield being administered as well.

22-01-2021||Delhi||Coronavirus vaccination turnout in Delhi leaps to 73%||The city recorded its highest turnout for the Covid-19 vaccination drive so far, with 5,942 health care workers out of the targeted 8,100 receiving the shot on Thursday.Officials said the 73.36% turnout, a nearly 25 percentage point increase from Wednesday was due largely to the government’s Co-WIN platform being tweaked to allow out-of-turn jabs for registered beneficiaries.With 100 vaccinations on Thursday, the Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital became the first major government facility to record a 100% turnout. The highest-ever turnout at a public hospital so far was 95 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Saturday, when the vaccination drive was rolled out nationally.To be sure, private hospitals such as Max-Saket and Sir Ganga Ram hospital have seen 100% turnouts before.“We were able to vaccinate 100% people on Thursday. Of course, the ‘add beneficiary’ function, which allows registered health care workers to get the shot even if their name is not slotted for the day, has helped. Along with that, we are also working on motivating our staff members and we are addressing all their concerns. Those who have already received the vaccines are also motivating others,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.The hospital had administered doses of the coronavirus vaccine to 31 people on Saturday, a number that dropped to 12 on the second day of the drive, and later increased to 35 persons on the third day.Although the turnout at Lady Hardinge Medical College was slightly lower on Thursday, the ‘walk-in’ option has helped it drive up numbers. At the hospital, 69 people were given jabs on Thursday, in comparison to 76 on Tuesday. The hospital, along with Ram Manohar Lohia, was one of the first to allow these out-of-turn shots.“Earlier we had to turn away people who were not on the list of beneficiaries for the day. Now the portal allows us to add beneficiaries as they come to the centre. Now the portal also allows us to register people from our hospital on the spot and administer the shot. There were some contractual employees whose registrations were not completed earlier,” said Dr NN Mathur, director, Lady Hardinge Medical College.Of Delhi’s 11 districts, the highest turnout on Thursday (91.5%) was in north-east Delhi, where 183 out of 200 targeted beneficiaries were vaccinated, followed by south-east (90.88%), where 727 of 800 were given jabs.The Shahdara district vaccinated 264 (44%) out of a targeted 600 persons — the lowest among the 11 districts, showed government data.The low turnout for the first three days was attributed to hesitance among beneficiaries and several instances of technical glitches which, officials said, were largely fixed by Thursday.So far, 18,795 healthcare workers in Delhi have taken the shots out of a targeted 34,497, reflecting an average turnout of 54.48%, government records showed. While the turnout was 53.3% on the first day of vaccination, it dropped down to 44.2% on Monday.However, with continuing reports of vaccine hesitancy among employees, hospitals have asked senior doctors to take the shot and motivate those working under them to get the jab.“The government is focusing on information campaign to combat the vaccine hesitancy in a big way; the situation should improve within the week. We are asking all the senior doctors to talk to those working under them to address any concern they might have. We will also put up banners with what beneficiaries who have already received the vaccine are saying,” said Dr AK Singh Rana, medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.The hospital, which is one of the six centres administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, has been seen instances of vaccine hesitancy, especially among the resident doctor who wrote to the medical superintendent asking that they be given Covishield.On Thursday, the turnout at centres giving Covaxin shots was 45.67%, compared to 75.57% at centres giving Covishield shots, government record showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/coronavirus-vaccination-turnout-in-delhi-leaps-to-73-101611259833647.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Bhosari land deal: No coercive action against NCP leader Eknath Khadse till Monday, says ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday assured the Bombay high court (HC) that it would not take any coercive action against Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse till January 25.The assurance came in response to an application filed by Khadse to quash the enforcement case information report (ECIR) registered by ED against him in connection with the Bhosari (Pune) land deal case. The controversy pertains to the purchase of a plot in Bhosari, near Pune, by Khadse’s kin for ₹3.75 crore, against the prevalent market rate of ₹30 crore. The plot’s ownership was contentious as the industries department acquired it in 1971, but the final award of the plot was not granted and the owner had not been compensated for it.HC has now posted Khadse’s application for further hearing on January 25.The court had sought to know why ED could not desist from taking action against Khadse for a few days as he had already appeared before ED concerning the case.During the hearing, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale was informed by senior counsel Aabad Ponda that Khadse had been attending the ED office and cooperating in the investigation as and when he was called for interrogation. He further said that in light of that, there was no need for Khadse’s arrest as ED had also not raised any grievance. Apart from quashing the ECIR, Khadse has also sought that his interrogation is recorded and filmed, and a lawyer is present at a visible distance during his questioning.After hearing the submissions, the court sought to know from ED as to why no interim protection should be granted to Khadse when the central agency opposed the prayer. “Why interim protection cannot be given if he has appeared and attended? What heavens are going to fall if he is given protection for a few days?” the court said.The bench then observed that the judiciary, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and agencies like ED and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are independent and should act independently and impartially. “There is a threat to democracy if these agencies don’t act independently,” observed justice Shinde.Thereafter, ED, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, informed the court on instructions that no coercive action would be taken against Khadse till the next hearing, which the court accepted, and posted the plea for further hearing on January 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhosari-land-deal-no-coercive-action-against-ncp-leader-eknath-khadse-till-monday-says-ed-101611260316231.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Would like to be Maharashtra CM someday: State NCP chief and minister Jayant Patil||State Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and water resources minister Jayant Patil said that he has the aspiration to become the chief minister (CM) of Maharashtra. He said anyone who has been in politics for a long period would desire to become the CM but his party does not have numbers. He also said that party supremo Sharad Pawar’s word would be the final one on the issue. Patil’s statement assumes significance as deputy CM and Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar is believed to be holding the second position in NCP after party chief. The rise of Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule in the party in the past few years is also being seen as an indication that Pawar senior has been grooming his daughter for bigger responsibilities. Sule is also part of the top brass and has a say in major decisions. Both Ajit Pawar and Sule are considered top CM candidates in NCP. “It is obvious. Everyone in politics would like to become the CM one day, but the decision of Pawar saheb is final for us. We have only 54 MLAs and going by the situation, I don’t believe it is possible to get the CM’s position. We need to improve the number of MLAs, and expand the party,” Patil said in response to a question in an interview at Sangli.Later, he clarified that a section of the media has distorted his statement. “I clearly said anyone who has been working for so long in politics would like to become CM but we don’t have the numbers and the final decision has to be taken by Pawar saheb,” he told reporters in Mumbai. When asked who would he support between Ajit Pawar and Sule for the top post, he said, “I don’t think there’ll come a time when I will have to choose between them. They are from one family and considering them as different entities is a mistake.” Meanwhile, when Ajit Pawar was asked for his response, he said, “I support whatever desire [to become CM] he [Patil] has expressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/would-like-to-be-maharashtra-cm-someday-state-ncp-chief-and-minister-jayant-patil-101611260076135.html

Thackeray has asked MPs to meet Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi over the Maratha quota issue and the Maharashtra-Karnataka border row over Belgaum. The CM meets MPs of both the Houses of the Parliament before the parliamentary sessions to take up issues of the state. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Thackeray said that the MPs gave him their suggestions, while he apprised them with the expectations the state has from them and the issues they are expected to raise in Delhi.“I have requested them to forget party lines and come together to work for Maharashtra. The issue of Maratha reservation is important and all MPs should together meet the PM. The role of the Centre is crucial in the court. Similarly, on the issue of the Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra, the MPs should come together to meet PM to integrate [Marathi-speaking areas] into Maharashtra,” the CM said, adding that he has asked the MPs to follow up on the pending GST dues of Maharashtra. Thackeray said that he has plans to form committees of MPs for better coordination between the state and the Centre. “I have a concept to make committees of the MPs, based on divisions and departments. These committees will coordinate with the state on projects and issues, and will also follow up with the Centre for the state-related projects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/go-beyond-party-lines-meet-pm-on-maratha-quota-belgaum-issue-and-gst-dues-maharashtra-cm-to-state-mps-101611259835956.html

Within these 11 districts, there are 30 places with confirmed cases of Avian influenza.On Thursday, Bhopal’s ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD), which is the nodal body for testing bird flu cases, confirmed the flu as the cause behind the poultry bird deaths in the five districts.The central laboratory has also confirmed the H5N8 strain of Avian influenza as a cause behind the death of a duck at Wardha district, state animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh said.The number of bird flu deaths is in the state is also rising. On Thursday, 932 bird deaths were reported owing to the flu in different districts, pushing the toll to 13,792 across Maharashtra.The state has so far culled 38,658 poultry birds, 35146 eggs and 52,684kg of feed to contain the spread of avian influenza, a press release by the animal husbandry department stated.“The district administrations will start culling poultry birds within the one-km vicinity of the infected areas from tomorrow, following guidelines issued by the Centre,” Singh said.The central government has also informed the state government that avian influenza virus cannot survive if food is cooked or boiled at a temperature of 70 degrees Celsius in three seconds. The press release further stated that well-cooked meat and boiled eggs are safe for human consumption. The government has appealed to citizens against consuming raw or half-cooked poultry meat or eggs. Officials have also directed chicken shop owners to strictly wear gloves and masks, follow stringent hygiene practices and maintain social physical distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-confirmed-in-5-more-districts-of-maharashtra-101611259596186.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||All polluting industries in Delhi will likely switch to PNG by month-end: Report||All industries in the Capital will likely switch to petroleum natural gas (PNG), a cleaner alternative to polluting fuels, by January 31, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said on Thursday.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and Adjoining Areas had in December last year directed all industrial units in Delhi to switch to PNG by January 31, and had directed the DPCC to inspect and identify industries using polluting fuels and act against those found violating the directive.In the latest report, the DPCC said out of the total 1,644 polluting industries identified in the national capital, 1,624 have converted to PNG, as on Thursday. Officials said the remaining units will be inspected in the coming weeks and a status report will be filed before the CAQM on January 31.“At least 1,624 industrial units in Delhi have converted to PNG, a safer and non-polluting fuel out of 1644 units using polluting fuels. This is a major step in controlling the city’s industrial emissions. We are hoping that by January 31, when the deadline set by the CAQM will be completed, we can make a complete switch to clean fuel,” a DPCC official said.The official said a status report has also been submitted to the CAQM and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).In an air review meeting conducted on December 22, the commission reviewed the progress of switching over of industries operating in Delhi to PNG.Representatives of the Delhi government, DPCC, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL), and Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) had attended the meeting to chalk out a plan to switch these industrial units to cleaner fuels as a long term initiative to reduce the pollution levels in Delhi.“About 1,644 of the industrial units spread across 50 industrial areas in Delhi had been identified for the switch over to PNG. The Commission stressed the need to switch over by all identified industries in Delhi considering the sector is one of the major contributors to air pollution in Delhi and the NCR or the National Capital Region,” the minutes of the meeting read.IGL and GAIL have also been directed to complete the pipeline network, metering, and associated infrastructure by January 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/all-polluting-industries-in-delhi-will-likely-switch-to-png-by-month-end-report-101611259028935.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Wednesday’s active Covid-19 case count was Mumbai’s lowest in 7 months||The city’s active case count on Wednesday touched 6,654, the lowest recorded in the past seven months, since the Maharashtra government started to publish active case figures. Mumbai now has a recovery rate of 93%. Moreover, as per data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), none of the 24 administrative wards in the city has over 500 active cases. On Thursday, the city reported 527 new Covid-19 cases and 10 deaths, taking the tally to 304,653, and toll to 11,278. The active cases in the city were 6,669 on Thursday. Since January 16, Mumbai has consistently reported less than 7,000 active Covid-19 cases, and between January 2 and January 15, Mumbai has recorded less than 8,000 active Covid-19 cases. Active cases dropped to below 10,000 on December 15 last year. Among the 24 wards, R-Central ward of Borivli West has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases at 486, followed by K-West ward (Andheri West) at 446, R-South ward at Kandivli at 412 and P-North ward (Malad) at 400.

A senior civic officer said, “For the entire month of January, Mumbai has recorded around 500-600 new cases a day. On some days in January, the city has also seen around 350 cases a day. As our recovery rate is steady, active cases are bound to go down. However, the BMC is still on alert. The situation has improved because of the measures the civic body is taking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wednesdays-active-covid-19-case-count-was-mumbai-s-lowest-in-7-months-101611259236061.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC broadside on politics in hearing on civic body funds||NeIt was supposed to be a hearing on non-payment of salaries of workers of Delhi’s municipal corporations. Instead, the interplay between the Centre (the BJP-led NDA government), the state ( the Aam Aadmi Party government), and the MCDs (controlled by the BJP), that is at the root of the crisis, provoked the court to launch a broadside against politicians in general, and warning the latter that they could be “lynched by the public” if they do not rise above politics.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli lamented the spate of “irresponsible statements” made by politicians.“People are making all kinds of irresponsible statements just to further their political agenda, unmindful of what harm they are causing to the society and people,” justice Sanghi remarked.Making generic comments about the state of polity in the country, the bench warned that something really bad could be in store for the politicians.“You have to mature and rise above all this. If this is the way things go on, I won’t be surprised if the politicians and people who indulge in this are lynched by public,” said justice Sanghi.The Delhi government did not comment on the court’s outburst, which came through during a hearing on non-payment of salaries and pensions of serving and retired employees, including teachers, doctors and sanitation workers, of the three MCDs.While directing the Delhi government to disburse to MCDs the money which was deducted against recovery of previous loans by the government to the civic bodies, the court said that the non-payment of salaries is a result of a “political slugfest.”The bench said it is “disgusted” that nobody seems to be bothered about the people who are cleaning their houses, as it shot down the Delhi government’s submissions on paucity of funds to pay for the salaries of the civic body’s employees.“You (Delhi government) are not doing any charity. It is more to do with politics rather than something else,” the bench told city government’s additional standing counsel Satyakam.But the Centre, too, came in for criticism.“The problem has also arisen because the Delhi government is sandwiched between the Centre and the MCD. All of you are behaving irresponsibly towards the employees and pensioners of the civic bodies. They have been completely ignored,” observed the court.It said that the deduction of loan payments should not have been done during the pandemic.When Satyakam told the court that the state’s revenue had fallen during the pandemic, the bench questioned the expenditure on advertisements and asked if an inquiry by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) should be ordered into the government’s expenses.“How much money you have spent on advertisements? We will order a CAG enquiry. Where did you get money from? Should we do that?”At this, Satyakam submitted that a sanction order was passed to release ₹337 crore to five local bodies including three MCDs for January to March , without making any deduction towards loan.The court, while rejecting the plea of the counsel , asked the Delhi government to file an affidavit on the amount, which according to it is liable to be paid to the MCDs as far as budget and revised estimate is concerned.It also directed the corporations to file respective affidavits disclosing their expenditures since April 2020 and made it clear that if they fail to do so, their chairpersons will have to be present in the court on February 22, the next date of hearing.“We further direct that the amounts which the MCDs and local bodies have received or will receive shall not be disbursed for any other purpose except releasing salaries and pensions and they have to first clear the arrears,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-broadside-on-politics-in-hearing-on-civic-body-funds-101611258664505.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Tribal tehsil has higher Covid-19 positivity rate than Maharashtra||Amid the dip in Covid cases across the state and country, there is one region – Shahada tehsil of tribal Nandurbar district in north Maharashtra – where the weekly positivity rate is 25%, the highest in the state and even more than the state’s weekly positivity rate of 5.5%. Reason? The recent return of a considerable number of citizens from foreign countries such as the United States and Canada. The failure of the administration to monitor and trace the contacts is to blame for the spread of the virus in around 13-14 villages in the district, according to health department officials. Shahada has a population of 61,376, according to the 2011 Census. Although the exact number of citizens who are abroad for jobs or education from here is not known, activists say it is a common trend in the region.The positivity rate is the percentage of positive cases against the total tests performed. The positivity rate between January 1 and 20 in Shahada stood at 27.21%, as 415 cases were reported from the 1,525 tests conducted. During the period, the state reported a positivity rate of 5.45%. Shahada has reported 3,415 of the 8,536 cases in Nandurbar since the Covid-19 outbreak. Of the 189 deaths in Nandurbar as of January 20, 68 were from Shahada. “The tehsil located on Tapi-Narmada basin is known for its prosperity because of the fertile irrigated land. The Gurjar-Patil community holds acres of lands and is prosperous. Many villagers are settled in other countries and keep visiting their native places regularly. After the second wave in many developed countries, the inflow went up rapidly, leading to the spread,” said an official from the health department. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the district administration has been asked to trace the contacts of the foreign returnees. District collector Rajendra Bharud said, “We have sent the samples for genome sequencing to the National Institute of Virology in Pune to check if there is any variant strain among those infected. We have increased testing and are tracing high- and low-risk contacts. Some villages in Shahada have a high number of residents travelling to countries like the US, UK, Canada for jobs and education. We have made institutional quarantine mandatory in the districts and started testing villagers by sending on-the-wheel labs.” Jitendra Patil of Unity Foundation, which works with sickle cell patients in tribal communities, said, “Shahada is the only tehsil to have an engineering college, a sugar factory and a textile mill in the district. Most of the farmers here hold acres of land purchased from tribals and grow cash crops like sugarcane and cotton. Many students of engineering college, which is decades old, are settled in foreign countries.” The district administration has now reopened Covid Care Centres in Shahada and Nandurbar and allowed admissions to government, private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tribal-tehsil-has-higher-covid-19-positivity-rate-than-maharashtra-101611258936258.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra goes past 2 million Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Thursday crossed the 2 million mark for Covid-19 cases 319 days since the first infection on March 9, 2020. The state recorded 2,886 fresh cases, pushing the count to 2,000,878, as it took 132 days to go from 1 million to 2 million infections, quicker than the 187 days for the first million, breached on September 11. Although fresh infections in the state have hit a plateau in the past few months, there are still 45,622 active cases, leading experts to say the state still has a long way towards attaining safety. Experts said they were worried over citizens not following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour as the impact of vaccination, which started on Saturday, will start showing only after months. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of figures also showed a decline in average number of daily cases in Maharashtra. In November, the average was 4,775, which fell to 3,892 in December and in January, as of Thursday, it further dropped to 3,174. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra communicable diseases prevention and control technical committee, said, “Although we are getting fewer daily cases, the number of active infections is still quite high. It simply means we need to be more careful because the situation is not what we anticipate,” he said. “Starting a vaccination drive does not mean that cases will start going down. It will happen only when common people start getting immunised, which is still far away. The next few months, healthcare providers and frontline workers are going to be vaccinated,” he added. Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients, said, “I agree the situation [Covid-19 cases] is not improving, but the position we are in is better than before. It is going to take some more time before we have full control of the situation. The vaccination drive, as it reaches the common people, will start showing positive effects,” he added. There was no drive on Thursday as planned by the state. It has decided to conduct vaccination sessions only four day a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. Meanwhile, healthcare providers are hesitant over inoculation, concerned about the vaccine’s safety. Many doctors, who have signed up for the shots have refused to turn up at vaccination centres, officials said. The issue was discussed in the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. “We were informed that doctors are refusing to get vaccinated owing to safety concerns. The problem is if doctors are not ready to take vaccines then how will we convince other health workers and the general public to take shots,” said a senior minister. Following this, state health minister Rajesh Tope declared to launch an information, education and communication (IEC) drive to counsel health workers to improve the turnout. Dr Salunkhe believes the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) is responsible for this situation as they should have strategised the drive in such a way that all the concerns would have been resolved before its commencement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-goes-past-2-million-covid-19-cases-101611258576788.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||Chill to replace warm, windy days in Delhi from Sunday, air remains ‘poor’||After experiencing warm but windy days, Delhi’s temperature is expected to plummet again from January 24, a day after a fresh western disturbance passes over the western Himalayas, India Meteorological Department said.On Thursday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 7.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was 22.8 degrees Celsius, which was a notch above what is considered to be the season’s normal.At the Palam weather station, the minimum temperature was 7.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 20.2 degrees Celsius.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that till Saturday, the minimum temperature is likely to hover around 6-7 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperatures will be around 20 degrees Celsius.“From January 24 (Sunday), the minimum temperature will start falling and from January 25, the maximum temperature will also see a fall. This will primarily be because of the cold winds blowing from Jammu Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh after spells of rain and snow on January 23,” said Srivastava.Meanwhile, the air quality in Delhi is likely to deteriorate briefly on January 23, but winds are expected to pick up again and improve the air from January 24.On Thursday, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi was 296, in the ‘poor’ zone. On Wednesday, the average AQI was 283, also in the ‘poor’ category. According to IMD scientists, this improvement has been because of strong winds blowing over the national capital. The wind speeds have been high on Wednesday and Thursday primarily because of a difference in the maximum and minimum temperatures, scientists explained.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said that the surface winds on Thursday were south-westerly and moderate, but will slow down on Friday leading to deterioration in pollution levels.“The AQI is forecasted to be in the ‘poor’ category on January 22. Under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, winds are forecasted to increase on January 23 and marginal improvement in AQI is forecasted for January 23 and January 24. However, despite the improvement, the AQI will remain within the ‘very poor’ category,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chill-to-replace-warm-windy-days-in-delhi-from-sunday-air-remains-poor-101611257513893.html
22-01-2021||Other||Shut schools and online classes turn parents into ‘screen guard’||Merely three months into the lockdown, Praket Patil’s (name changed) parents were already anxious about what was to follow. A Class 5 student of a reputed school in Mumbai’s western suburbs, Praket’s screen addiction had increased massively, as he remained cooped inside his 1-BHK (bedroom-hall-kitchen) apartment with his parents owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. After the schools closed last March and children were confined to their homes, Praket’s screen addiction, which his parents had otherwise tried to put an end through other distractions, seemed to resurface. “He would be on the phone or on the computer the entire day. For several hours, he would play games or browse the Internet. If we tried to stop him, he would become aggressive. We had seen him being obsessed with devices, but sending him out to play or taking him out on a drive in the past would distract him. But with the lockdown in place, we had no such alternative,” said Praket’s mother Shamika, an IT (information technology) professional. With schools in the state remaining closed for offline classes for more than 10 months, parents are having a tough time limiting their children’s screen time. Just like schools, extracurricular activities and coaching have also moved online and many parents are struggling to come up with ways to reduce screen usage. According to a survey conducted by OLX in June 2020, the average screen time for kids between the age of 5 and 15 years had seen a 100% rise since the first phase of lockdown in March 2020. More than half the parents who responded in the nationwide survey said their children were spending nearly five hours more on screens post the lockdown. Dr Sagar Mundada, a Mumbai-based psychiatrist, said a large number of parents have been approaching him with screen-related concerns. “While the issue of screen addiction already existed before the Covid-19 outbreak, the lockdown seems to have aggravated the situation. Children are inside their homes and it is thus becoming very difficult for parents to wean them off their devices. In several cases, we have had to prescribe medicines to calm these children as they tend to get aggressive if the screen is taken away from them. A lot of counselling along with medical help has been giving results,” he added. Praket’s family had approached a nearby psychiatrist a few days after they noticed his symptoms. “He would attend school for two hours but spend the remaining 10 hours playing games. We tried everything – from positive reinforcements to punishments – but nothing worked. As both my husband and I were working from home, it was an added pressure on us. We then took him to a psychiatrist and he prescribed a few medicines along with some activities that we could do with him. It has been nearly four months now and we can finally see some improvement,” said Shamika. While the standard operating procedures issued by the Maharashtra government only allow upto three hours of online learning, parents said children are invariably online for one thing or the other. “The school lasts for two-three hours and then there are several assignments which have to be submitted online. Activities like sports and music have also moved online and in addition to all this, children want to use their screens during their breaks. That takes the screen time to three-eight hours a day easily,” said Anita Shetty, a Malad-based parent. So far, there is no golden number suggesting the optimum number of hours to be spent on the screen. The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends less than one hour per day of screen time for children between the ages of two and five years, and limited screen time for children above the age of five years. The World Health Organization, in its guidelines issued in April 2019, had suggested that children between the ages of two and four should have no more than one hour of screen time per day. Dr Prachi Agashe, paediatric ophthalmologist and squint specialist from Agashe Hospital in Kurla, said the size of the screen, the type of device used, the brightness and the distance of viewing are significant factors that parents need to keep in mind when children use screens, to avoid the associated risks like myopia and digital eye strain. “They should also ensure that when there is a break during the online learning session, the child should essentially relax and if needed, do an activity that does not involve migrating to another screen. The time spent on the screen apart from the necessary school hours should be reduced as far as possible,” she added. Counsellors said they have been encouraging parents to take up online and offline activities with their children to ensure a healthy mix of both. “For instance, if they watch a small recipe video and then spend some time in actually making that recipe, it is an engaging activity and this is a constructive use of the screen time,” added Raheen Jummani, a Mumbai-based psychologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shut-schools-and-online-classes-turn-parents-into-screen-guard-101611257672942.html

Among them, 1,673 serve in schools run by the directorate of education, and 1,093 serve in schools run by east and south Delhi municipal corporations. Against the annual work plan and budget for the year 2020-21, proposed by the Delhi government in its meeting with the officials of the ministry of education, government of India, on May 27, 2020, the salary of contract teachers was approved only for six months and was conveyed to us on August 20, 2020, by the ministry.”“All of these contractual teachers are central teachers eligibility test (CTET) qualified and till now, they are actively engaged in supporting the semi-online teaching-learning of students in their respective schools. Their six months’ service period was completed on January 19, 2021,” he said.Sisodia, who is also the deputy chief minister of Delhi, said front-line workers, including teachers, have played a major role in the past year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He said it will be unfair if any of them would be asked to leave their services at this point in time. “I urge you to kindly extend the financial support to these teachers till at least March 31, 2021, on the existing cost-sharing basis between the Union and the Delhi government,” Sisodia wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-requests-union-education-minister-to-extend-contracts-of-ssa-teachers-101611256948573.html

The person identified himself as one D Newton from Los Angeles, United States. However, the complainant responded to the messages and later the two become friends. Newton informed the complainant that his mother resides in Pune and soon he would be coming to see her as she is hospitalised. Newton also sent photos of his air ticket to the complainant, the police said.“On January 4, Newton sent his photo from Delhi International Airport to the complainant informing him about his arrival. However, minutes later the complainant received a call from a person identifying herself as one customs officer Mariyam Gupta. Gupta informed the complainant that Newton has been detained at the airport as he was carrying $3,65,000 (equivalent to ₹2.66 crore) and carrying a huge amount of foreign currency was illegal,” stated the complaint.The complainant was informed by the customs officer that to get Newton released, he would have to pay some penalties to the authorities in Indian currency. The complainant agreed. Later he was made to pay different penalties, taxes, security charges, etc. totalling to ₹10.50 lakh. “When the customs officer demanded more money in the name of some new fines, the complainant realised that something was amiss. Later Newton and the said customs officer cut off all their communications, making the complainant realise that he was cheated,” said a police officer.The complainant approached Cuffe Parade police and lodged a complaint. “Prima facie it seems to be the handiwork of a Nigerian racket which generally cheats people using such modus -claiming that they have sent some valuables, gifts which then get caught by the customs officials at the airport and to clear the gifts, they demand money posing as custom officials under the pretext of penalties, taxes, etc.,” another officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-duped-of-10-lakh-by-a-social-media-friend-101611257253663.html

In all, nearly 96% schools in the state have reopened for Classes 9 to 12. The education department has also granted permission for the reopening of schools for Classes 5 to 8 from January 27. The state education department has also undertaken a drive to identify out-of-school students and bring them back to schools as several students remain away from education due to the pandemic. The government has also asked parents to reach out to education officials and nodal officers in case there are complaints with respect to fees and other issues with regard to schools. Practical and oral assessments will be held between April 1 and April 22 and April 9 and April 28 for HSC and SSC respectively.If students miss out on the exams due to any reason, they can appear during the re-exams, which the board conducts every year after the regular exams. Examinations for Information and Communication Technology will be conducted online. NIOS parents move NHRC Parents of students studying in the National Institute of Open Schooling have appealed to the National Human Rights Commission, demanding the cancellation of Class 10 and 12 exams under the board scheduled to be held next month.

The farmers will be joined by top leaders like Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena leader and state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat. The organisers claimed that around 50,000 farmers will participate in the protests. The march is part of the agitation being undertaken under the banner of Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) and aims to intensify the farmers’ struggle in the main capital cities across all states.“Since the Governor is the representative of the Narendra Modi government in Maharashtra, we will march to Raj Bhavan and hand him the petition against the farm laws,” said Ashok Dhawale, convenor, SSKM. “We met Sharad Pawar, Aaditya Thackeray and Balasaheb Thorat, and all have agreed to participate in the Monday Morcha,” he added.The farmers will gather in Mumbai on January 24, and a massive dharna will be organised at Azad Maidan. On January 25, the morcha to Raj Bhavan will be held, and it will culminate with a flag hoisting on January 26, Republic Day.“We will come on street on behalf of the farmers and take part in the morcha,” said Congress leader Naseem Khan. He said that the Congress will take part in every agitation till these farm laws are withdrawn. The farmers will be joined by activists of some 100 different outfits.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of the national Capital since November 26 last year, against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Social activist Feroze Mithiborwala, who is another organiser, said it was an attempt to sensitise the urban population of these regressive bills. “The whole aim of these farm bills is to favour the multinational corporations at the cost of farmers. The urban people are being made aware of how it will play havoc with the entire rural economy, and even they will bear the brunt as they will be saddled with huge food bills,” said Mithiborwala.Last week, many labour unions marched in south Mumbai and held a rally at Azad Maidan in favour of the farmers. Prominent farmer leader Raju Shetti and social activist Medha Patkar addressed the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-farmers-to-march-to-raj-bhavan-on-monday-will-be-joined-by-sharad-pawar-aaditya-thackeray-balasaheb-thorat-101611257072339.html

Miffed over MC taking over garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30, informal cart-based collectors have stopped picking up garbage from houses in other sectors, causing waste to pile up in homes and on roads. This, despite Citizen Feedback component of the Swachh Survekshan 2021 under way from January 1 to March 31 – a crucial factor in deciding the city’s ranking in the survey.Chandigarh’s urban and rural areas generate about 450 million tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. Residents of several southern sectors report that garbage hasn’t been picked up for the past four days, while a section of the garbage collectors claims that they have been on strike since January 1. In Sector 45, residents were forced to pool in money to hire private trolleys to collect the waste, said RWA president Sanjeev Bansal.“Instead of meeting RWAs, MC needs to hold talks with the garbage collectors to resolve the impasse,” said convener of the City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, Vinod Vashisht. To make matters worse, MC is planning to close down the Sehaj Safai Kendras, leaving residents worried over where to dump the waste if the collectors don’t return soon. “We have written a letter to the UT adviser raising our objection to MC’s move,” said Rajat Malhotra, general secretary of the Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation.BONE OF CONTENTIONPressing into service more than 100 new garbage collection vehicles, MC took over door-to-door garbage collection in Sectors 1 to 30 on December 23 last year.Even though some garbage collectors joined MC’s initiative as helpers, others are up in arms against the takeover. “Most of the garbage collectors have been on strike since January 1. MC took over garbage collection without our consent, assaulting livelihood of the poor. Why should MC collect user charges when we have been collecting garbage for all these years? We appeal to residents to support our cause,” said Shamsher Lotiya, president of the local unit of the Akhil Bhartiya Mazdor Sangathan.DIVIDED HOUSEMeanwhile, another section of garbage collectors contends work should continue despite differences with MC. Om Prakash Saini, president of the Chandigarh Door-to-Door Garbage Collectors’ Society, said, “We are in favour of MC collecting garbage and giving us user charges collected through water bills. Most of the issues have been sorted out and the rest will be taken up in a meeting with MC officials on Friday.” Chandigarh mayor Ravikant Sharma said he was certain that the issued will be resolved in the meeting scheduled on Friday and the protest will be called off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/that-stinking-feeling-chandigarh-residents-suffer-as-waste-piles-up-again-101611256893157.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai businessman held in GST fraud worth ₹314 crore||The Central Goods and Services Tax (GST) department on Thursday arrested a businessman from Andheri in GST fraud to the tune of ₹314.25 crore. The accused illegally availed input tax credit (ITC) and also passed the same on to other offenders, causing revenue loss to the government.The accused, Daulat Samirmal Mehta, 64, is a director of Twinstar Industries Limited and other companies having their corporate office near Chakala, Andheri (West). Mehta is also the managing director of Originet Technologies Ltd and promoter of Boostmetric Solutions Ltd, Vintage Comtrade Pvt Ltd, Stuti Comtrade Limited and Kala Exports.According to sources in the GST department, Mehta operated all six firms from his office premises. He and his staff had access to all the records, as well as the user IDs and passwords of the GSTINs of all six firms. “The accused fraudulently availed and utilised ineligible input tax credit amounting to approximately ₹122.59 crore on the strength of bogus invoices, without actual receipt of goods or services,” said a GST official.The accused also fraudulently issued bogus invoices and passed on ITC to various companies, without actual supply of goods or services, thus causing wrongful passing on of ITC amounting to approximately ₹191.66 crore to the recipient companies, a source added.ITC is an option that allows taxpayers to claim credit for taxes paid on purchase. Issuance of an invoice or bill without supply of goods or services and wrongful utilisation of ITC on a bill/invoice, without any supply of goods or services is a cognisable and non-bailable offence.The investigators have also identified the mastermind (name withheld) of the syndicate and an investigation in respect to the role of other people in the crime has been initiated.GST officials said that the accused is not cooperating with the ongoing investigation, to avoid the GST liability. However, the lawyer for the accused, advocate Ravi Hirani, denied this and said, “My client has cooperated whenever he was called for investigations. He has nothing to do with alleged offences committed by other people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-businessman-held-in-gst-fraud-worth-314-crore-101611256651669.html

22-01-2021||Mumbai||New panel on Mumbai Metro a farce, Maharashtra govt creating false narrative on Aarey, says Fadnavis||In a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, former state chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged on Thursday that the state government is being misled by a few officials on the issue of the car shed for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz). Fadnavis also said the committee formed by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to find an alternative site for the car shed is a farce and the state is creating a false narrative when it claims that the plot in Aarey Milk Colony would be insufficient by 2031. Fadnavis said the state must take immediate steps to re-start work at the Aarey plot and act against those misleading the state. The site for the Metro-3 car shed has been a contentious issue with activists protesting that a car shed in Aarey would damage Mumbai’s last green lung. While a state-appointed committee said half a dozen alternative sites were unsuitable, the MVA government decided to shift the car shed to a plot in Kanjurmarg in December 2020, which revived a four-decade-old tug of war between the Centre and state over the ownership of salt pan lands in Mumbai.Recently, MVA set up a third committee to look at the right plot between Aarey and Kanjurmarg, but Fadnavis described this as “a farce”. Addressing the media on Thursday, he said, “The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has already prepared the report in favour of Kanjurmarg and this committee is only going to sanction it.” He also said that almost 400 trees would be cut if the depot is built at Kanjurmarg. “It will increase the project cost by ₹4,000 crore plus delay the project,” he said. In a letter to Thackeray, Fadnavis said the Aarey plot was identified for the Metro-3 car depot on the basis of population estimates till 2053. He said the technical committee had allocated 30 hectares (ha) in Aarey for the depot, of which, 25ha would be utilised in the first phase, for 42 trains of eight coaches each, which would be “sufficient for 8-10 years post-2031”. “Between 2031-53, 13 trains of eight cars each will be dispatched in phases based on travel demand. For this, 1.5ha of the remaining 5ha will be utilised. This area has around 160 trees which will be transplanted in phases,” wrote Fadnavis.In an address to the state in December 2020, Thackeray had said that the Aarey plot would be insufficient for Metro-3 by 2031 while the Kanjurmarg plot, spread across 102 acres, can accommodate depots for three Metro lines (3, 4 and 6).Fadnavis described this integration as “impractical”. “In such a scenario, building a car depot almost 8kms from Aarey will increase the overall cost of the project. Moreover, different Metro routes operate at different times and the signalling system is also different. The integration will only add to the financial burden,” he said.Metro-3 was expected to be partly operational in 2021, but officials estimate there will be a delay of at least three to four years if the car depot is relocated to Kanjurmarg. In his three-page letter, Fadnavis also alleged that the state is in talks with private claimants of the land to allow them to use some of the area for residential and commercial purposes. “The previous government had received a proposal to build 1 lakh houses for the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana on the same land. The government had also appointed a committee on this. However, it was later found that these places were leased to salt pans. Hence, the land is with the Central government now,” he said.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson and general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “We request Mr Fadnavis to keep politics aside and instead tell the Central government to withdraw their ownership claim. Earlier, the Centre was ready to give land though the Kanjurmarg plot belongs to the state government. BJP should stop creating hindrances in MVA’s development works.” Meanwhile, the nine-member committee appointed by the state government had a meeting on Thursday. Sources privy to the meeting said that the committee is likely to submit its report in the coming week to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The committee had recently visited both, Aarey and Kanjurmarg sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-panel-on-mumbai-metro-a-farce-maharashtra-govt-creating-false-narrative-on-aarey-says-fadnavis-101611256171633.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Do you know your corporator, citizens ask ahead of Mumbai civic body polls||Ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Elections (BMC) elections in 2022, a group of alert Mumbaikars going by the name ‘Jaago Mumbaikar’ have initiated a survey to know if you know about your municipal wards and corporators.The survey will look at two aspects - if people are aware of their ward, their corporator, BMC’s responsibilities and what are the areas concerning them. Activists say that though BMC elections directly impact one’s quality of life, the awareness among voters is generally low, especially compared to Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.In 2017, the voter turnout for BMC elections at 55% was a record high for Mumbai since 1992. It was just 44% in the 2012 civic election as opposed to 54% in the 2014 Assembly elections and around 55% in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. In 2007, only 46.05% voters participated in the civic polls. The city has 24 municipal wards and 227 electoral wards. The elections are expected to be held in the first half of 2022.A member from Jaago Mumbaikar, who did not wish to be named said, “Once we have the survey results, we are planning to run a campaign to build awareness among Mumbaikars. We will also meet all political parties insisting on giving tickets to candidates with a clean record.”Milind Mhaske, project coordinator, Praja Foundation, which has been releasing councillor reports and also training councillors in the city said, “Though the awareness level is increasing, around 30-40% of people in the city might still not know about their electoral wards or corporator, though they might know who their MP or MLA is. This (survey) exercise is important as it will create awareness among sections, which may otherwise not be interested in participating in municipal elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/do-you-know-your-corporator-citizens-ask-ahead-of-mumbai-civic-body-polls-101611256001199.html

22-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body gets 3 international bids for constructing holding ponds||Three international bids have been received for studying and preparing a detailed project report for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) ambitious project of constructing underground silos (holding ponds) to hold excess rainwater and prevent waterlogging. This report will inform BMC about the feasibility of constructing holding ponds in the city and areas where it can be constructed.The three consultants are international companies from Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, that have tied up with our local companies. Senior civic officials said that these holding ponds are expected to be constructed in the next five years. The tenders were floated in May last year and the consultant is to be finalised by February.The ponds will be constructed along the lines of underground water holding ponds in Tokyo. The BMC had plans to construct underground water silos to collect water that flows into the Mithi river and takes up it’s carrying capacity during a heavy downpour.The consultant is being appointed to carry out a one-year study of rainfall patterns, the geography of the city, contours and also studying the rock areas. They will submit a detailed project report to the BMC following the study and will also be the project management consultant for the next four years. The consultation is expected to cost the BMC an estimated ₹31 crores.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have received three international bids from Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands. The bids are being studied as of now and we will finalise it in another 15 days.”The artificial holding pond plan was mooted by the BMC last year on the lines of Japan. The holding pond will be used to store the excess rainwater from the Vihar, Tulsi, and Powai lakes, instead of discharging into the river that overflows during monsoon. The BMC is working on several aspects for the Mithi river’s rejuvenation, including encouraging aquatic life, increasing green belt along its banks around Powai and Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road. The bid document prepared by BMC also cites assessment on the possibilities of the urban development for commercial and public activities along the river banks and boating facilities in a bid to boost tourism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-gets-3-international-bids-for-constructing-holding-ponds-101611255751661.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||Indian fliers may not get to avail discount in the near future: Experts||Passengers might not be able to avail discounts while booking their flights in the near future. The aviation ministry restricted the airlines from deciding fares on their own as the civil aviation ministry capped airfares range-bound after domestic travel resumed in a phased manner on May 24. This capping on ticket prices impacted discounts and special fares that airlines roll out from time to time to attract passengers and generate instant cash too.The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had capped domestic fares from May 2020 and extended from October to December’20 and has further extended the same up to March 31, 20, 2021.According to the report by brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the continuation of capping of airfares by the government in the long term may prove to be a huge dampener on the aviation industry as a whole, besides weakening sentiment for the regulated market.The central government imposed a cap on airlines ticket prices at the time of resumption of domestic flight services in late-May initially for a period of three months. However, since then, it has already extended the period thrice with the latest one to March 31. The report had pointed out that the average ticket price in the last quarter of the previous year was at a discount of 7% to 23% to the median fares prescribed by the government, compared with a discount of 29% to 47% in the first quarter of 2020, when there was no ceiling on fares.Ajay Prakash, ex-president of Travel Agents Association of India and CEO of Nomad Travels said, “The capping of airfares is unfair to the airlines. Even now when the ministry has reduced the capping per cent from 40 to 20, it will barely give some space to the airline considering the amount of huge loss the airlines have undergone in the past few months.”Rajji Rai, chairman of Swift group of companies who have been in the travel and tourism industry for over four decades too said airlines were in an extremely poor state. “Even if the ministry decides to do away with the capping, the airlines will continue to suffer losses as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Passengers too are suffering, as the airlines have no money and are not able to refund them for their booked tickets for travel during the lockdown period.”However, Jay Bhatia, vice president of TAAI said most airlines have already started announcing special promotional airfares post-April ‘21 and that their promos are marketing fares which attract travellers. “This is a general phenomenon when airlines entice travellers with lower bucket airfares. However, the number of seats the airlines sell at those fares is restricted by the airline concerned. The purpose of capping the airfares we feel is to ensure that the airlines don’t oversell and create further losses. Further, the price band is given so that during these turbulent times they also do not exceed and overcharge and maintain the sanctity of the situation. Normally the airlines reduce the airfares only to fight competition or to promote routes not doing well. The capping of the price band has helped the travellers and the airlines to obtain an equal share of traffic. The airfares being average fares I think were of similar band range. However, capping of fares is not for Udey Desh ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN) flights,” Bhatia said.He further added, “ Reducing the cap from 40% to 20% by the MoCA will give the airlines an extra edge, but the airlines must remember that the crisis is just over and to overcome the previous losses due to the pandemic will at least take over two years to recover fully. While they reduce the fares, they must also ensure that their costs should also be curtailed. By reducing the airfare they increase their flight loads which enhances their equity value notionally and reduces their profits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-fliers-may-not-get-to-avail-discount-in-the-near-future-experts-101611255451840.html
22-01-2021||Mumbai||High court stays state’s GR appointing Mumbai university registrar||The Bombay high court on Thursday stayed the January 8, 2021 government resolution (GR) appointing Dr Ramdas Atram as registrar of University of Mumbai (MU) on deputation, and directed Dr Atram to immediately hand over the charge to Baliram Gaikwad who was appointed as temporary registrar, after the demise of the previous registrar Dr Ajay Deshmukh. The order was passed in a petition filed by senate member Dhanesh Sawant challenging the GR and arbitrary appointment of Dr Atram contrary to the provisions of the Maharashtra State Universities Act. On Thursday, when the petition came up for hearing, the division bench of justice SC Gupte and justice SP Tavade was informed by advocate Anjali Helekar for the petitioner in the previous hearing that the university through the vice-chancellor was well-equipped to appoint its officers. She submitted that the university was a ‘statutory body’ and did not require the intervention of the state government to make appointments of its officers, hence the January 8 GR was ‘arbitrary, excessive, unreasonable and in utter disregard’ of the provisions of Maharashtra State Universities Act, 2016. The petition had further contended that appointment of a registrar had to be done as per law by the vice-chancellor, on the recommendation of a select committee constituted for the purpose. Even the temporary post had to be handed to someone appropriate for the post by the vice-chancellor only. Sawant’s petition had also alleged that the January 11 state government direction to all state universities not to start any recruitment process and seeking details of vacant posts, selection committees and panel members was an interference. Sawant’s petition also sought to set aside the directives. Additional public prosecutor Kedar Dighe for the state, however, opposed the petition and said that the petitioner had no locus and the issue could not be dealt with in a writ petition. Dighe further submitted that the state government had taken the step to appoint Dr Atram as he was more qualified as an administrator and the temporary term of the registrar appointed for six months after the demise of Deshmukh was ending on January 2. Dighe stressed that the state government had powers under the relevant laws to appoint officers to state universities and there was nothing perverse in the appointment of Dr Atram. However, the court was not satisfied by the submissions and held that the January 8 appointment order was not valid and stayed the same. The court then directed Dr Atram to hand over the charge of the registrar to Gaikwad with immediate effect and also permitted the University of Mumbai to continue with the process of regular appointment of the Registrar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/high-court-stays-state-s-gr-appointing-mumbai-university-registrar-101611255271502.html
22-01-2021||Delhi||The burglar who made away with jewellery worth ₹20 crore, but got caught within 24 hours||An electrician-cum-technician working for a jewellery showroom in South Delhi’s Kalkaji used his professional skills and supplemented them by watching YouTube videos to break into the same shop to steal 25 kilos of gold and diamond jewellery worth ₹20 crore, the Delhi Police said on Thursday after arresting the suspect and recovering the entire stolen items.RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said prima facie it appears that the suspect, 25-year-old Sheikh Nur Rahman, operated all alone in a heist that lasted a little over six hours, including over four hours inside the showroom and over 90 minutes that Rahman spent just waiting on the roof of a nearby building.Though the entire stolen jewellery weighed 25 kilos, the DCP said that a lot of it was studded with diamonds because of which the market price of the booty was ₹20 crore. “This is one of the biggest seizures of stolen jewellery in India in the recent years,” the officer said.PLANNINGRahman, for the last one year, had been employed at the Kalkaji store of Anjali Jewellers, a Kolkata-based firm which primarily caters to jewellery of Bengali tradition, said the showroom manager Arijit Chakravarty.“He would come across as any other employee, there was nothing in his appearance or mannerism to suggest he plan and execute such a heist,” said Chakravarty.But Rahman allegedly had other plans. “In one year of work, he got to know the showroom inside out. And he used his knowledge and skills to plan the heist for three months. He thought he had a foolproof plan,” said Suvashis Choudhary, joint commissioner of police (southern range).In the last three months, Rahman allegedly studied the layout of the entry and exit points, the position of the guards, the screws that needed to be opened, the CCTV cameras that needed to be disconnected and all other fine details, Choudhary said. “He then invested about ₹50,000 on buying equipment such as hydraulic iron cutters, gas cutters, suitcase, backpack, rope, etc,” said the officer.Then, Rahman created an alibi for himself by taking a 15-day leave -- beginning January 10 -- in which he would visit his home in Hooghly in West Bengal.The DCP said Rahman did book a train ticket and he even went home, but he quietly returned to Delhi within a week. But he stayed away from his residential quarter in Govindpuri that was provided by his employer.THE HEISTAround 9.30pm on Tuesday, he donned a PPE kit to ensure no one would approach him or suspect him on the streets, wore a large face mask, carried a suitcase and the burglary tools in the backpack and reached near the showroom by an auto-rickshaw.“Since he had done his survey, he reached the terrace of a mostly vacant structure located two buildings away from the four-storey jewellery showroom. He then waited on the terrace until 11pm so that the residents of the next two buildings were in their homes,” the DCP said.Once all was quiet, he easily scaled the terrace of the next two buildings and reached the roof of the showroom.He used hydraulic iron cutters to remove the fibre and tin sheets of a small opening in the roof that allowed him access to the generator room on the top floor. He lowered the heavy tools and bags using a rope. Police said Rahman took his time to operate without any noise.Once he was inside, he used the same cutter to break open an iron grill and an iron shutter to gain entry into the actual showroom which was spread over the ground, first and second floors. He didn’t even need the gas cutter he had brought along.Rahman did not touch the jewellery on the first and second floors and went directly to the ground floor because he was targeting jewellery of “low volume and high value”, said JCP Choudhary.“He cut the wires of only one CCTV camera that could have probably given away his identity. He left the other cameras, lest the management check the footage and find it suspicious that so many cameras went off at the same time,” said the officer.He then stuffed as much jewellery he could carry in his bags and left the same way he had come -- using a rope to haul up the heavy bags from the generator room to the terrace. The police said he hired an auto-rickshaw and reached his friend’s home in Karol Bagh even as he planned to leave for Kolkata on Thursday by train.The crime was detected around 11am on Wednesday when the showroom was opened.IN POLICE NETThe police formed 10 teams of about 100 police personnel and began with probing the 35-odd employees of the showroom, other people who visited occasionally for work and local criminals.The CCTV cameras threw up a lot of footage that suggested the role of an insider. For example, the thief had no trouble in finding a particular CCTV camera in the generator room to change its direction. He also knew exactly where to find drinking water on the third floor. “Most importantly, the thief knew which size screwdriver was needed for opening the screws. All this pointed to someone with particular technical skills,” JCP Choudhary said.And Rahman was the only employee who the police believed had the skills and knowledge to execute such a heist.Though Rahman had allegedly prepared an alibi, his absence came across as suspicious to the police. “Our local enquiry revealed that Rahman was seen in Delhi at a time when he was supposed to be in his hometown. He then became the primary suspect,” DCP Meena said.Thereafter, the police used his call detail records and other technical analysis to catch him from his friend’s home in Karol Bagh and recover all the stolen booty from him -- within 24 hours of him leaving the showroom.Rahman has been booked for theft in a dwelling house and trespassing. If convicted, he could land in jail for up to seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-heist-for-the-ages-lasts-for-a-day-101611254708722.html

It appears Goswami was in the know about the airstrike as part of Indian defence forces’ retaliation in response to the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019. Goswami appears to know about the airstrike three days in advance. Goswami, in one of his chats, has said that it was revealed to him by a big name in the Modi government. Thorough investigation and arrest of Goswami is a must as the issue relates to national security.”Throat said that the party will stage protest in all the districts to press the demand.In a statement on January 19, Goswami said, “It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. I am horrified that the Congress party thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/arnab-goswami-chat-leaks-congress-announces-protests-across-maharashtra-101611254851497.html

22-01-2021||World||Number of US hospitals and beds dwindled before ‘catastrophic’ pandemic||The years preceding the pandemic saw a drop in the number of U.S. hospitals and beds, and the cost of caring for Covid-19 patients could push those totals even lower, according to a trade group report.Research issued late Thursday by the American Hospital Association shows the number of facilities dropped to 6,090 in 2019 -- the most recent year data were available -- from 6,146 the previous year. Hospital beds also decreased, to around 920,000 in 2019 from 924,000 in 2018, continuing a decades-long trend.The explosion of Covid-19 has not only overwhelmed staff and facilities but pushed more hospitals into financial distress as they limited more profitable elective procedures and faced the “astronomical” costs of preparing for an influx of infected patients, the group said. Covid-19 cases “tend to be incredibly resource intensive,” the report added.Even the $175 billion providers received from the CARES Act “falls far short of covering these losses,” according to the report.Rural ‘concern’The U.S. has reported 24.5 million cases and more than 400,000 deaths from the pandemic as intensive care beds have filled across the nation, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.The AHA estimated last spring that hospitals would tally at least $323 billion in losses due to the virus through the end of 2020. But that didn’t account for certain expenses like costs for protective equipment or surging cases that continue to roil the country, it said. The long-term impact on care will be “severe, and in many cases, catastrophic,” according to the report. The viability of rural hospitals, many of which were suffering from declining revenues before the pandemic, is of “particular concern.”The number of rural community hospitals declined by 16 in 2019, to 1,805, according to the AHA.But that’s not their only issue, said James Wesp, principal of health-care consultancy Oasis LLC. “Small, rural facilities do not have the staff or certain, critical specialists and equipment to effectively treat the influx of Covid patients,” he said.The first round of the virus bypassed rural areas, and hospitals there furloughed workers or saw staff depart to take lucrative jobs in epicenters, Wesp said. “When the next wave hit these rural centers, they were not prepared from a staffing standpoint or with the necessary supplies, including PPE.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/number-of-us-hospitals-and-beds-dwindled-before-catastrophic-pandemic-101611334788803.html
22-01-2021||World||Janet Yellen wins unanimous Senate panel vote for Treasury despite Republican tax, debt concerns||The US Senate Finance Committee on Friday unanimously approved Janet Yellen's nomination as the first woman Treasury secretary, indicating that she will easily win full Senate approval, but Republicans called for her to work with them in developing economic policies.Yellen's nomination was approved 26-0 in the evenly split committee, with concerns expressed by Republicans about President Joe Biden's ambitious plans for massive coronavirus relief spending, infrastructure investment and tax hikes failing to sway them against the former Federal Reserve chair."I have very strong disagreements with Dr. Yellen on a number of her positions, particularly in the tax policy arena, but she has committed to us that she will work with us," Republican Senator Mike Crapo said after the vote."And I think the strong vote on our side to support her today is an indication that we want to engage."Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan and has pledged to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research to boost American competitiveness.At Yellen's confirmation hearing before the committee on Tuesday, Republicans expressed concerns over the price tag and increased debt in a return to fiscal conservatism after running up deficits with the 2017 tax cuts and nearly $5 trillion in coronavirus spending last year under former Republican President Donald Trump.Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, due to take over as Senate Finance Committee chairman in coming days, said he is pushing for a full confirmation vote later on Friday. But Senate leaders from both parties, still wrangling over how to organize the evenly split chamber, have not indicated any timing for a Yellen floor vote."I can tell you, a lot of times I don't think you could get a 26-to-nothing vote to agree to buy a soda. So, this is an indication that she is really an NBA All-Star when it comes to Senate confirmation," said Wyden.A full confirmation vote just days after Biden took office would put the 74-year-old PhD economist and daughter of a Brooklyn, New York family doctor quickly to work on a deep economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. She broke a similar gender barrier when she became Fed chair in 2014, a role she held until 2018.Yellen's Republican predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, was not confirmed until three weeks after Trump's 2017 inauguration, and then by a 53-47 nearly party-line vote in a Republican-controlled Senate.Concerning CommentsYellen's confirmation hearing on Tuesday highlighted some Republican lawmakers' concerns about her role in executing Biden's economic policies, including a bigger federal debt burden and repealing parts of their signature 2017 tax cuts.Yellen told senators they needed to "act big" on the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package or risk a longer recession and long-term economic scarring, job and revenue losses.Her remarks represent a new attitude toward government debt among some economists and policymakers: Focus on the interest rate being paid and the returns it will generate, rather than the overall amount borrowed. In recent months, Treasury's interest outlays have fallen from pre-pandemic levels due to lower rates.In written answers to senators' questions, Yellen said she would study raising tax rates for "pass-through" small businesses including sole proprietorships, imposing a new minimum corporate tax and raising capital gains taxes on the wealthy. She also endorsed an effective carbon pricing system and financial regulation to combat systemic risks from climate change.With Yellen still awaiting confirmation, the Biden administration on Wednesday named Andy Baukol, a longtime career international finance official, as acting Treasury secretary.

Last week, it was thought cases were growing by much as 5%, and the turnaround gave hope that the spread of the virus was being curbed, although the ministry urged caution.The closely watched reproduction "R" number was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1, down from a range of 1.2 to 1.3 last week, meaning that on average, every 10 people infected will infect between eight and 10 other people.But the Office for National Statistics estimated that the prevalence overall remained high, with about one in 55 people having the virus."Cases remain dangerously high and we must remain vigilant to keep this virus under control," the health ministry said. "It is essential that everyone continues to stay at home, whether they have had the vaccine or not."Britain has recorded more than 3.5 million infections and nearly 96,000 deaths - the world's fifth-highest toll - while the economy has been hammered. Figures on Friday showed public debt at its highest level as a proportion of GDP since 1962, and retailers had their worst year on record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-variant-found-in-uk-causes-higher-mortality-says-boris-johnson-101611336217982.html

22-01-2021||World||Parler’s new partner has ties to the Russian government||Parler LLC, the social media app popular with Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists, is attempting to get back online with the help of a Russian company whose clients include an internet service provider to Russian intelligence, raising concerns about the conservative social forum’s security if it ever formally returns.US-based Parler began working with DDoS-Guard on Jan. 17 after getting cut off from Amazon Web Services. The Russian company offers its customers cybersecurity services and web hosting, which includes reserving website names, collecting platform data and piecing it together to present on the internet.Publicly available internet information shows Parler’s data flows through a DDoS-Guard server registered to an address in Belize, which cybersecurity experts believe is a tool to protect the true identity and location of Parler’s web host. The Russian company declined to say what services it’s offering Parler.Nevertheless, cybersecurity researchers said Parler’s relationship with DDoS-Guard -- which has fulfilled contracts with several government entities including the state-owned telecommunications company TransTeleCom Co ZAO -- raises concerns that its millions of users could be susceptible to surveillance if the platform returns online. Russian telecommunications companies play an essential role in the government’s digital surveillance program, SORM, which requires service providers and carriers to install backdoors to state intelligence.“Most people would be afraid of being fronted by Russians, but Parler actually signed up for it,” said Justin Shattuck, senior security solutions engineer at Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions. “It’s a little crazy.”A data analysis indicates that Parler is the only American company -- aside from some phishing and crypto scam pages -- entrusting DDoS-Guard to host or secure any portion of its platform, Shattuck said.Mike Convertino, the former chief information security officer at F5 Networks, CrowdStrike Inc. and Twitter Inc., said that if bad actors got access to Parler’s unencrypted data, they could alert, insert or delete content on the platform.“They could insert anything they want -- cram words in the Parler CEO’s mouth or Sean Hannity’s,” said Convertino, now the chief security officer at Resilience Cyber Insurance Solutions. “You could also build a massive compendium of our citizens, or at least those who follow Trump. To see a conservative entity go into the waiting arms of a Russian hoster is out of some dystopian dream.”Parler didn’t respond to calls and emails seeking comment. The app became a popular alternative for supporters of Donald Trump after Twitter and Facebook cracked down on false claims by former US president and his followers. It was then taken offline on Jan. 11 after AWS pulled its web hosting, determining that the social media site had failed to moderate content which contributed to rioting at the US Capitol building on Jan. 6.On Thursday, a federal judge in Seattle refused Parler’s request to order Amazon.com Inc. to immediately restore hosting.A DDoS-Guard spokesman said Parler doesn’t use its hosting service but wouldn’t say exactly what services it provides. “As far as we know, the social network did not violate any laws or policies in the past.” DDoS-Guard didn’t comment on its relationship with Russian intelligence or TransTeleCom Co ZAO.TransTeleCom, among DDoS Guard’s other clients, is a state-owned telecommunications company that in turn provides internet services to a Russian intelligence agency. DDoS-Guard has also worked with the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sberbank Insurance -- majority owned by the Russian central bank -- and a regional digital development and communications committee along the Russia-Ukraine border, according to contracts and filings reviewed by Bloomberg News.When asked about Parler’s relationship with DDoS Guard, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government isn’t familiar with the company.“Of course we don’t know about this company so I can’t tell you anything,” he said. “Undoubtedly there are many competitive firms in Russia’s IT sphere and even more in cyber-security area.”U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, called on Jan. 21 for the FBI to investigate Parler’s role in the Capitol insurrection, as well as the company’s finances and ties to Russia “given the company has re-emerged on a Russian hosting service.”So long as Parler remains in its state of internet purgatory -- its homepage currently explains its technical difficulties but little more -- the platform’s user data isn’t at risk. The concerns only become a reality if Parler returns to form on its desktop and mobile apps.Despite its struggles, Chief Executive Officer John Matze said on the website that the platform’s “return is inevitable.”But even its relationship with DDoS-Guard remains in doubt. On Thursday, the cybersecurity blog KrebsOnSecurity reported that DDoS-Guard may lose a massive volume of server addresses in Belize. This could either prompt DDoS Guard to find a server closer to home, or force Parler to find yet another partner.DDoS-Guard is run by two Russians, Evgenii Marchenko and Dmitry Sabitov, and since 2017, it has offered its services to TransTeleCom. The telecom provides services to the Federal Security Service, known as FSB, the successor to the Soviet Union’s KGB, according to contracts and public records reviewed by Bloomberg News. The intelligence agency has been sanctioned and indicted by the US for waging cyber-attacks against corporate and government networks, according to the US Treasury and Justice departments.The FSB’s efforts to spy on telecommunications systems is rather explicit. The Russian government requires telecommunications providers to install the FSB’s hardware so it can conduct surveillance on its population, including monitoring phone calls, web activity and email communications, according to the Russian Ministry of Communications and critics of the program.Parler’s decision to hire DDoS-Guard came six weeks after the US government discovered a sprawling cyber-attack that breached government agencies and private companies, including cybersecurity firms. US intelligence and the FBI have said that Russia was likely behind the attack, which utilised several methods including inserting malicious code in updates for software from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp. Cybersecurity researchers have found similarities in the techniques used in the recent hacking campaign, which was first disclosed last month, to tools used in the past by Russia’s FSB.As its name suggests, DDoS-Guard provides protection against what are known as distributed denial of service attacks, or DDoS for short, in which a massive amount of junk traffic is directed at a server or network to disrupt service. Essential to DDoS protection service are filters used to scrub user data for malicious traffic when it arrives at the host server.As these data packets speed through the filters, service providers may receive unencrypted access to review the incoming traffic -- a place where an impostor could lurk to intercept data, according to Convertino.Access to such unencrypted data could allow adversaries to collect information about Parler’s user base, which accounts for a chunk of former Trump’s base of supporters, said Gene Yoo, chief executive officer at the cyber intelligence firm Resecurity.“Foreign intelligence may collect unique data using DDoS-Guard to filter Parler’s traffic, which would allow them to enumerate all of Trump’s fans and far-right supporters,” Yoo said. “Having this kind of data is a priceless asset for any foreign intelligence agency, which we know has already targeted Trump’s base with digital influence campaigns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parlers-new-partner-has-ties-to-the-russian-government-101611334474260.html
22-01-2021||World||Outrage after troops protecting US Capitol forced to sleep in parking garage||A decision to turn a chilly underground parking garage into an overnight billet for National Guard troops in Washington to protect President Joe Biden's inauguration has stirred an uproar.A number of the 25,000 troops standing guard around the US Capitol in recent days in the wake of the January 6 insurrection had been allowed to take breaks and naps in between long shifts on the floors of the building housing the US Congress.But on Thursday afternoon, after the legislature resumed work a day after the Biden inauguration, someone decided instead to force them out to a nearby parking garage.Photos that spread quickly over the internet showed guardsmen and women stretched out under flourescent lights in parking slots, with few toilets, outlets for charging phones, or other facilities available.Many members of Congress, noting that many of the troops came from their constituencies, voiced outrage."This is an insult to all National Guard units that followed orders and served in the cold and rain through the night without fail. They protected our Capitol when we needed them most," said Representative Brendan Boyle on Twitter.Lawmakers visited the troops and apologized early Friday."What happened was an outrage and it will never happen again," said Chuck Schumer, the new Senate Majority leader, as he walked in a hall in the Capitol with dozens of soldiers sleeping on both sides.Schumer said nobody knew exactly who ordered the part-time soldiers moved to the garage.Echoing the recriminations over responsibility for letting hundreds of violent supporters of then-president Donald Trump crash the Capitol on January 6, National Guard officials said Capitol Police told them to move to the garage, and the Capitol Police denied it.They "did not instruct the National Guard to vacate Capitol building facilities," said Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman in a statement."As of this morning, all Guardsmen and women have ben relocated to space within the Capitol complex."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-after-troops-protecting-us-capitol-forced-to-sleep-in-parking-garage-101611334436785.html
22-01-2021||World||Italy probes TikTok 'blackout challenge' death of 10-year-old girl||Italian prosecutors have opened a probe into the accidental death of a 10-year-old girl who allegedly took part in a "blackout challenge" on the video-sharing network TikTok.The girl died in a Palermo hospital after being discovered Wednesday by her five-year-old sister in her family bathroom with her cellphone, which was seized by police.TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, said Friday it had not managed to identify any content on its site that could have encouraged the girl to participate in any such challenge, but was helping the authorities in the probe over possible "incitement to suicide"."The safety of the TikTok community is our absolute priority, for this motive we do not allow any content that encourages, promotes or glorifies behaviour that could be dangerous," a TikTok spokesman said.Medical experts have warned about the danger of the challenge being taken up by some young people, who refer to it as "scarfing" or "the choking game" in which restricted oxygen to the brain results in a high.The girls' parents told La Repubblica newspaper that another daughter explained that her sister "was playing the blackout game"."We didn't know anything," the girl's father told the paper."We didn't know she was participating in this game. We knew that (our daughter) went on TikTok for dances, to look at videos. How could I imagine this atrocity?" he said.Italy's data protection agency filed a lawsuit against TikTok in December, alleging a "lack of attention to the protection of minors" and criticising the ease with which very young children could sign up to the video app.TikTok, which went global in 2018, has built its rapid success on its parodies, messages and short dance or comedy video performances set against popular music -- along with an algorithm that determines which content is most likely to interest each user.The death of the girl provoked strong reactions in Italy and calls for better regulation of social networks."Social networks can't become a jungle where anything is allowed," said Licia Ronzulli, president of Italy's parliamentary commission on child protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-probes-tiktok-blackout-challenge-death-of-10-year-old-girl-101611334238155.html
22-01-2021||World||US Senate approves Biden nominee Lloyd Austin as 1st Black Pentagon chief||Lloyd J. Austin, a West Point graduate who rose to the Army's elite ranks and marched through racial barriers in a 41-year career, won Senate confirmation Friday to become the nation's first Black secretary of defense.The 93-2 vote gave President Joe Biden his second Cabinet member; Avril Haines was confirmed on Wednesday as the first woman to serve as director of national intelligence. Biden is expected to win approval for others on his national security team in coming days, including Antony Blinken as secretary of state.Biden is looking for Austin to restore stability atop the Pentagon, which went through two Senate-confirmed secretaries of defense and four who held the post on an interim basis during the Trump administration.Austin's confirmation was complicated by his status as a recently retired general. He required a waiver of a legal prohibition on a military officer serving as secretary of defense within seven years of retirement. Austin retired in 2016 after serving as the first Black general to head US Central Command. He was the first Black vice chief of staff of the Army in 2012 and also served as director of the Joint Staff, a behind-the-scenes job that gave him an intimate view of the Pentagon's inner workings.The House and the Senate approved the waiver Thursday, clearing the way for the Senate confirmation vote.Read | Avril Haines is first official member of President Joe Biden's cabinetAustin, a large man with a booming voice and a tendency to shy from publicity, describes himself as the son of a postal worker and a homemaker from Thomasville, Georgia. He has promised to speak his mind to Congress and to Biden.At his confirmation hearing Tuesday, Austin said he had not sought the nomination but was ready to lead the Pentagon without clinging to his military status and with full awareness that being a political appointee and Cabinet member requires “a different perspective and unique duties from a career in uniform.”As vice president, Biden worked closely with Austin in 2010-11 to wind down US military involvement in Iraq while Austin was the top US commander in Baghdad. American forces withdrew entirely, only to return in 2014 after the Islamic State extremist group captured large swaths of Iraqi territory. At Central Command, Austin was a key architect of the strategy to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria.Biden said in December when he announced Austin as his nominee that he considered him “the person we need at this moment,” and that he trusts Austin to ensure civilian control of the military. Critics of the nomination have questioned the wisdom of making an exception to the law against a recently retired military officer serving as defense secretary, noting that the prohibition was put in place to guard against undue military influence in national security matters.Only twice before has Congress waived the prohibition — in 1950 for George C. Marshall during the Korean War and in 2017 for Jim Mattis, the retired Marine general who served as President Donald Trump's first Pentagon chief.Read | Joe Biden picks members of his cabinet: Who are they and why they matterAustin has promised to surround himself with qualified civilians. And he made clear at his confirmation hearing that he embraces Biden's early focus on combatting the coronavirus pandemic."I will quickly review the department’s contributions to coronavirus relief efforts, ensuring we are doing everything we can — and then some — to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.Under questioning by senators, Austin pledged to address white supremacy and violent extremism in the ranks of the military — problems that received relatively little public attention from his immediate predecessor, Mark Esper. Austin promised to “rid our ranks of racists,” and said he takes the problem personally.“The Defense Department’s job is to keep America safe from our enemies,” he said. “But we can’t do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.”Austin said he will insist that the leaders of every military service know that extremist behavior in their ranks is unacceptable.“This is not something we can be passive on,” he said. “This is something I think we have to be active on, and we have to lean into it and make sure that we’re doing the right things to create the right climate.”He offered glimpses of other policy priorities, indicating that he embraces the view among many in Congress that China is the “pacing challenge,” or the leading national security problem for the US.The Middle East was the main focus for Austin during much of his Army career, particularly when he reached senior officer ranks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-approves-biden-nominee-lloyd-austin-as-1st-black-pentagon-chief-101611332260007.html
22-01-2021||World||US House to deliver Trump impeachment to Senate on Monday, say Democrats||The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives will deliver an impeachment charge against former President Donald Trump to the Senate on Monday, rejecting Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's request for a delay.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who displaced McConnell as the chamber's leader after Democrats won two Georgia runoff elections this month, announced the move on the Senate floor but did not say when Trump's second impeachment trial would begin."The House will deliver the article of impeachment to the Senate. The Senate will conduct a trial of the impeachment of Donald Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be a fair trial," Schumer said on the Senate floor on Friday.That came the morning after McConnell asked the House to delay sending the charges until next Thursday, and to agree not to start the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defense against the charge that he incited insurrection by his followers who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6."This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal process over in the House," McConnell said on Friday. "The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages the Senate or the presidency itself."Read | Trump leaves town an outcast, trailed by Covid-19 pandemic, joblessnessThe moves come as Schumer and McConnell are struggling to assert control in a 50-50 chamber where Democrats hold now hold a razor-thin majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.The trial could distract from Democratic President Joe Biden's efforts to push an ambitious legislative agenda through Congress, including nearly $2 trillion in fresh Covid-19 relief for Americans and US businesses, as well as the need to confirm his Cabinet nominees.Trump last week became the first president in US history to be impeached twice, and when the Senate convenes for his trial will be the first president to be tried after leaving office, for his alleged role in urging his supporters to storm the Capitol in an attack that left five dead.Ten House Republicans joined Democrats on Jan. 13 in impeaching him. The support of at least 17 Senate Republicans would be needed to convict him; a separate vote would then be needed to ban him from running for office again.Such a vote could signal that senior Republicans were eager to remove Trump as the de facto leader of their party; he has said he may seek to run again in 2024.Trump's fate ultimately could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republican lawmakers. The Kentucky Republican said this week that the mob was "fed lies" and "provoked by the president and other powerful people."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-to-deliver-trump-impeachment-to-senate-on-monday-say-democrats-101611329537745.html

The order instead placed quotas on the Gulf nation, saying imports would have to remain close to historical levels without meaningful increases, language similar to that used when quotas were placed on Canada last year.The UAE normalized ties with Israel in August, a historic agreement that Trump brokered and touted as one of his most important foreign-policy successes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/purchase-of-f-35-jets-drones-from-us-finalised-says-uae-101611329011749.html

22-01-2021||World||Republican Andy Harris tried to enter US House chamber with gun, stopped||The US Capitol Police are probing an attempt by Republican lawmaker Andy Harris to bring a gun into the House of Representatives chamber on Thursday, a day after the inauguration of President Joe Biden. According to US media reports, Maryland representative Andy Harris set off metal detectors while he was trying to enter the House chamber, prompting a security guard to use a metal detector wand that spotted the concealed gun.While House members are allowed to carry firearms in Capitol grounds, they aren’t allowed to take it onto the House floor. The officer reportedly denied entry to Harris and sent him away. According to CNN, Harris asked fellow Republican John Katko to hold his gun but the latter refused to do so, saying he didn’t have a license to hold the firearm. Harris returned to the House chamber moments later without the gun.The metal detectors were installed last week amid heightened security concerns in the aftermath of the Capitol violence that left five dead, including one police officer. Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, popularly known as AOC, had earlier raised doubts over the intention of some of her Republican colleagues.Ocasio-Cortez had told her thousands of followers via Instagram Live that she “didn’t feel safe around other members of Congress” when rioters stormed the Capitol. “I myself did not even feel safe going to that extraction point because there were QAnons and white supremacist sympathisers and, frankly, white supremacist members of Congress in that extraction point who I know and who I had felt would disclose my location,” she had said.After the Republican lawmaker was caught trying to enter the House chamber with a gun, AOC revealed that a lot of members still don’t feel “safe around other members of Congress.” Speaking to CNN, the member of the progressive caucus said that it was not only “irresponsible” and “reckless” action to bring a gun onto the House floor, but also a violation of rules."I don't really care what they say their intentions are, I care what the impact of their actions are, and the impact is to put all 435 members of Congress in danger," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-andy-harris-prevented-from-entering-us-house-chamber-with-gun-101611324037616.html
22-01-2021||World||Grantham warns of Joe Biden stimulus further inflating epic bubble||In the waning days of Donald Trump’s presidency, Jeremy Grantham warned that U.S. stocks were in an epic bubble. He now predicts Joe Biden’s economic-recovery plan will propel them to perilous new heights, followed by an inevitable crash.“We will have a few weeks of extra money and a few weeks of putting your last, desperate chips into the game, and then an even more spectacular bust,” Grantham, the value-investing legend and co-founder of Boston-based GMO, said in a Bloomberg “Front Row” interview. “When you have reached this level of obvious super-enthusiasm, the bubble has always, without exception, broken in the next few months, not a few years.”Data show risk-taking exploded following the last round of pandemic-relief checks. Grantham has “no doubt” at least some of the $1.9 trillion in federal aid Biden is seeking from Congress will end up being spent on stocks instead of food or shelter.He envisions a collapse rivaling the 1929 crash or the dot-com bust of 2000, when the Nasdaq Composite Index plunged almost 80% in 31 months.Many investors argue today’s valuations are justified by the growth potential of transformative technologies and new business models. Grantham, 82, dismisses that argument as fanciful, and he rejects the popular theory that the Federal Reserve can cushion or even reverse the next slide with bond-buying that pumps more liquidity into financial markets.“At the lowest rates in history, you don’t have a lot in the bank to throw on the table, do you?” he said.Perma-BearFor now, however, stocks keep rising to records and Grantham’s reputation as a perma-bear who misses out on rallies only grows.GMO’s cautious stance has been costly. Assets under management fell by tens of billions of dollars during the decade-long bull market, as the firm steered clear of growth stocks. Then in April, GMO doubled down, insulating its portfolios from directional bets on the market and largely missing out on the second leg of the 2020 rebound.Even before the pandemic, Grantham thought the economy was on shaky ground. He was concerned about the steady decline in U.S. productivity, skeptical that Fed policy had achieved much beyond widening the inequality gap and worried that the profit-at-all-costs nature of American capitalism was destroying the environment and fraying the social fabric.For Grantham, the combination of fiscal stimulus and emergency Fed programs led to “spectacular excesses” and pushed an already overvalued market into bubble territory.Inflation ThreatIt could have other consequences, too.“If you think you live in a world where output doesn’t matter and you can just create paper, sooner or later you’re going to do the impossible, and that is bring back inflation,” Grantham said. “Interest rates are paper. Credit is paper. Real life is factories and workers and output, and we are not looking at increased output.”Grantham, who considers himself a student of bubbles, has been right before -- if early. GMO exited Japan in 1987 and reduced its exposure to U.S. stocks in late 1997, dodging the dot-com wipeout. Grantham also raised concerns about housing prices ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.This time, there may be few places to hide. If Grantham is right about the threat of inflation, bonds are risky.

22-01-2021||World||Biden’s student loan freeze shows path to erase billions of debt||Thanks to vagaries of the accounting world, Donald Trump’s administration had a chance in the final weeks of the presidential race to cancel more than $200 billion of student loans with no immediate hit to the Department of Education’s massive portfolio. Yet it didn’t do it.Now, perhaps Joe Biden will.For years, bean counters at the department have been writing down the value of its $1.4 trillion portfolio of student debt as they adopted ever-more-pessimistic views of how much borrowers will repay. In September, the analysts made their biggest adjustment yet, valuing loans at just 82 cents on every dollar owed, down from 104 cents in 2015, records show. The debt is now worth $258 billion less than the amount outstanding.Had officials under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos decided to identify some of the borrowers least likely to repay, and then forgiven those debts, it wouldn’t have put a major dent in the remaining portfolio’s value. Such losses were, theoretically, already reflected anyway.By Wall Street standards, the government’s loan writedowns are gigantic, amounting to $98 billion in September alone. While they have gone virtually unnoticed in the political realm so far, they are almost sure to attract attention now, as consumer advocates urge Biden’s new administration to ease the burden on young professionals and jump-start the pandemic-stricken economy.Some are starting to ask: If the government doesn’t expect to collect hundreds of billions of dollars from borrowers, why not try to erase it now?“Betsy DeVos has already decided that a bunch of this debt is not going to be paid back,” said Mike Pierce, director of policy at the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center and a former official at the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “That makes it much easier for the Biden administration to justify canceling.”The Education Department didn’t respond to messages seeking comment both before and after the change in administration.Loans or RentShortly after his inauguration as U.S. president on Wednesday, Biden asked the department to extend his predecessor’s pandemic policy of waiving interest and to continue letting borrowers skip monthly payments on government-owned student loans until at least the end of September. About 24 million borrowers have stopped payments, department data show.Biden has expressed sympathy for borrowers but suggested he’s reluctant to wipe away debt without an act of Congress. In November, he said student-loan burdens are “holding people up. They’re in real trouble. They’re having to make choices between paying their student loan and paying their rent.”While Wall Street often values its debt holdings based on the prices they would fetch in the market, the government’s markdowns mainly reflect “amounts not expected to be recovered.” From a valuation perspective, that means there wouldn’t be much immediate difference between forgiving doomed loans and waiting for borrowers to turn out their empty pockets.Still, there’s the issue of moral hazard: If authorities offer relief to struggling borrowers, it could create an incentive for others to stop repaying too, causing more of the portfolio to sour.Rush for ReliefMuch of the gap between what is owed and what the government reckons will be repaid stems from loan programs that cap monthly payments relative to borrowers’ incomes. Income-based repayment plans promise the possibility of loan forgiveness after two decades of steady payment, or one decade for public-service workers. As annual borrower defaults climbed past 1 million, Barack Obama’s administration made the repayment plans increasingly generous. Enrollment has tripled since 2014.The anticipated cost of income-based plans has risen, too. The Education Department recently realized borrowers in the plans were earning “substantially” less than it had forecast. So the government cut its projections of borrowers’ future income by 35%, boosting the estimated tab to be forgiven in later years.“There already is significant loan forgiveness,” said Constantine Yannelis, who researches student debt and teaches finance at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. “We’re just talking about moving it up or giving it to borrowers who wouldn’t qualify for it under current rules.”Yannelis said he recently found that debt owed by lower-income borrowers had a lower present value to the federal government than debt owed by high-income borrowers.Rising OddsAcross-the-board loan cancellations make little sense, but the government has all the information it needs to target forgiveness, said Adam Looney, a finance professor at the University of Utah whose research on student loans dates to his time as a tax official at the U.S. Treasury Department. In fact, he said, the Education Department’s own valuation reflects a belief the government will eventually cancel large amounts owed by people earning little or at least too little relative to their debts.Forgiving loans could encourage future students to over-borrow on the hope that their debts will be wiped away, advisers to the federal consumer bureau warned in a report this month. And that could, in turn, remove some of the pressure on colleges to lower their costs.But there is a growing expectation in the public anyway that relief is coming. In a December survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, respondents estimated there is a 39% chance -- more than ever in five years of polling -- that the federal government will cancel some amount of student loans over the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-student-loan-freeze-shows-path-to-erase-billions-of-debt-101611322506429.html

He then went further, triggering the process to pull the US completely out of the organisation. The withdrawal was due to go into effect in July this year, but Biden's order will cancel it.During her phone call on Thursday, Harris discussed the decision by the Biden administration to rejoin WHO with the health agency's Director-General Dr. Ghebreyesus.Harris emphasised that she and Biden believe that WHO is vital to controlling the spread of Covid-19 and building back better global health and pandemic preparedness, according to a readout of the call issued by the White House."The vice president and the director-general also discussed the resumption of the United States’ role in the global public health and humanitarian response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said.Harris also stressed on the Biden-Harris administration's strong support for efforts to strengthen the global Covid-19 response, mitigate its secondary impacts, including on women and girls, and advance global health security to prevent the next outbreak from becoming an epidemic or pandemic.She emphasised the importance of making the US safer through global cooperation, the White House said.Ghebreyesus thanked Harris for the call and congratulated her and Biden on their inauguration. Both the director-general and the vice president reiterated that they look forward to meeting in person.Earlier in the day, Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, while addressing WHO executive board meeting said the US will cease the drawdown of its staff seconded to the agency.The US will also resume regular engagement of its government personnel with the WHO both directly and through the agency's collaborating centres, he said.The United States intends to fulfil its financial obligations to the organisation. It sees technical collaboration at all levels as a fundamental part of our relationship with WHO, one that we value deeply and look to strengthen going forward, Fauci said."As a WHO member state, the United States will work constructively with partners to strengthen and importantly reform WHO, to help lead the collective effort to strengthen the international COVID-19 response and address its secondary impacts on people, communities, and health systems around the world,” he added.The Biden administration also intends to be fully engaged in advancing global health, supporting global health security and the global health security agenda, and building a healthier future for all people."I am also pleased to announce today that the United States plans to work multilaterally to respond to and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. President Biden will issue a directive later today which will include the intent of the US to join COVAX and support the ACT-Accelerator to advance multilateral efforts for Covid-19 vaccine, therapeutic, and diagnostic distribution, equitable access, and research and development,” Fauci said.The US will also work with WHO and member states to counter the erosion of major gains in global health that we have achieved through decades of research, collaboration and investments in health and health security, including in HIV/AIDS, food security, malaria, and epidemic preparedness, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-believes-who-is-vital-to-containing-covid-19-pandemic-kamala-harris-tells-who-chief-101611318797392.html
22-01-2021||World||US Senators to ask Biden to restore POW-MIA flag to White House||Several lawmakers plan to urge President Joe Biden on Friday to restore a flag honoring missing war veterans to the White House, according to a copy of a letter seen by Reuters, after former President Donald Trump angered some veterans by moving it.The POW-MIA flag, which is dedicated to prisoners of war and service members missing in action, was relocated last year from a prominent position atop the White House to a less visible spot on the South Lawn.The move came months after Trump signed into law a bill requiring the flag to be flown at certain federal properties including the White House every day."We ask that you take swift action to restore the flag to its place of honor atop the White House, thereby prominently recognizing the service and sacrifices of American prisoners of war, missing service members, and their families," wrote Democratic Senators Maggie Hassan and Elizabeth Warren and Republican Tom Cotton, who co-sponsored the legislation."This issue is critically important to veterans and other Americans who care deeply about the POW/MIA flag as a sign that we will never forget about the thousands of American service members who are still far from home against their will," the senators said, in a letter they plan to send on Friday.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden, who took office on Wednesday, has often extolled his deceased son Beau's military service in Iraq.The black and white POW-MIA flag, which reads: “You are not forgotten,” depicts a man beneath a guard tower gazing down at a barbed-wire fence. About 82,000 US servicemembers are still missing from conflicts dating back to World War Two.US law requires the flag to be displayed in a “manner designed to ensure visibility to the public.” In its current position, it can be viewed from limited vantage points outside the White House complex. The Trump White House declined to explain why the flag was relocated but said last year it was done in a private ceremony with full military honors.Hassan and Warren previously described the move as disrespectful and potentially illegal, while some veterans groups criticized it, including The American Ex-Prisoners of War, which described it as a "slap in the face."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-to-ask-biden-to-restore-pow-mia-flag-to-white-house-101611317500710.html
22-01-2021||World||Canada deporting thousands even as pandemic rages: Report||Canada deported thousands of people even as Covid-19 raged last year, data seen by Reuters shows, and lawyers say deportations are ramping up, putting people needlessly at risk in the midst of a global health emergency.Like many other countries, Canada is struggling to stop a second wave from spiraling out of control, and its political leaders are begging residents to stay home to prevent the spread.Lawyers and human rights advocates are decrying Canada's November decision to resume deportations. Until now, the extent of the country's pandemic deportations was not known, but recent interviews with immigration lawyers and scrutiny of government numbers has shed light on the situation.Canada counted 12,122 people as removed in 2020 - 875 more than the previous year and the highest number since at least 2015, according to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) data seen by Reuters. The government says this was necessary and done safely.The CBSA says the high number last year is because it includes people who decided to leave on their own, termed "administrative removals." In 2019 there were 1,657 administrative removals, compared with 8,215 last year.Even subtracting those numbers, that leaves thousands of people deported as the pandemic raged and governments cautioned against travel of any kind for safety reasons.Even as Canada continues to deport non-citizens during a health crisis, US President Joe Biden paused deportations for 100 days within hours of being sworn in on Wednesday.Canada officially imposed a moratorium on deportations in March that it lifted at the end of November."As much as a human rights concern it's a common sense concern," said Bill Frelick, director of Human Rights Watch's Refugee Rights Program.Countries' deportation practices have varied over the course of the pandemic. Several, including the United Kingdom, suspended deportations before resuming them. Others, like Ireland, have kept suspensions in place.The CBSA said it has been prioritizing deportations for reasons of "serious admissibility," including criminality.The vast majority of people deported in 2020 were for reasons of "noncompliance." Even taking into account administrative removals, more than 1,000 people were deported during the suspension, the data shows.'It's unbelievable'Public health experts have warned that travel of any kind can spread Covid-19 from one place to another, a risk that grows with the advent of more highly transmissible Covid variants.Many of the deportation trips involve transfers at multiple airports and flights during which people are placed in enclosed space in close quarters with other people for hours at a time, a situation ripe for transmission.Since August Canada has been conducting deportations with CBSA escorts, so Canadians are also making thousands of these round-trip flights for deportation purposes.Organizations including the Canadian Bar Association and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers spoke out against Canada's decision to resume deportations."As everybody is putting in place more restrictions in an effort to flatten the curve ... CBSA made a shocking decision to simply go back to business as usual," said Maureen Silcoff, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers."Canada has taken the position that nonessential travel is barred yet people are now being removed and there's no indication that those removals are essential."The CBSA said in a statement it lifted the moratorium on deportations because foreign government offices and borders had reopened, airlines restarted their routes and public-health protocols "have contributed to a high degree of safety for persons being removed by air.""Canada continues to uphold both its human rights and public safety obligations in relation to the removal of inadmissible foreign nationals," the statement said. "The removal process includes many checks and balances to ensure that the removal is conducted in a fair and just manner."But these deportations are endangering not only the people being deported but the government officers tasked with accompanying them to their destination, lawyers say.Immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman's Toronto office went from getting no removal cases to getting three or four in the space of a week, he said. He is now fighting for a failed refugee claimant with two young Canadian children who faces deportation to Egypt Monday."They're ramping it up as if there was no pandemic," he said. "It's unbelievable."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-deporting-thousands-even-as-pandemic-rages-report-101611317495740.html
22-01-2021||World||Explainer: How US CDC missed chances to spot Covid-19 silent spread||In early February, 57 people arrived at a Nebraska military base, among the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak. US health officials knew very little then about the mysterious new virus, and the quarantined group offered an early opportunity to size up the threat.The federal government sought help from a team at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, including Dr. James Lawler, an experienced infectious disease specialist. Lawler told Reuters he immediately asked the world-renowned US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for permission to test the quarantined group, deeming it crucial to know whether people without symptoms were infected and could spread the deadly pathogen.Agency officials worried that detained people couldn’t give proper consent because they might feel coerced into testing. “CDC does not approve this study,” an official at the quarantine site wrote to Lawler in a Feb. 8 email obtained by Reuters. “Please discontinue all contact with the travelers for research purposes.”More than two months passed before the CDC expanded its testing guidelines to include all asymptomatic people, saying soon afterward that this silent spread “may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the Covid-19 pandemic.” By November, the agency estimated that more than half of cases were spread by people not currently experiencing symptoms.Critics have widely asserted that the CDC fumbled key decisions during the coronavirus scourge because then-President Donald Trump and his administration meddled in the agency’s operations and muzzled internal experts. The matter is now the subject of a congressional inquiry. Yet Reuters has found new evidence that the CDC’s response to the pandemic also was marred by actions - or inaction - by the agency’s career scientists and frontline staff.At a crucial moment in the pandemic when Americans were quarantined after possible exposure to the virus abroad, the agency declined or resisted potentially valuable opportunities to study whether the disease could be spread by those without symptoms, according to previously undisclosed internal emails, other documents and interviews with key players.Soon after balking at testing the returnees from Wuhan, the agency delayed testing asymptomatic passengers among 318 evacuees from the Diamond Princess, a contaminated cruise ship in Japan. In addition, the agency failed at that time to make effective use of outside experts and appeared at times unprepared for the crisis on the ground, lacking adequate personal protective gear and ignoring established protocols, Reuters found.“Yes, they were interfered with politically,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, referring to alleged meddling by the Trump administration. “But that’s not the only reason CDC didn’t perform optimally during Covid-19. There are a lot of things that went wrong.”Four top public health experts or ethicists told Reuters that the question of whether to test or engage in research on detained people has always been a sensitive topic. But all said the CDC should have proceeded given the fast-moving public health emergency.Moreover, the CDC finalized rules in 2017 providing that medical testing was expressly allowed in quarantine, as long as participants were given the opportunity to give “informed consent” or opt out. Informed consent means giving people adequate information to understand the risks and benefits of a test or procedure.Gostin said the CDC’s argument against testing was “unreasonable” under the circumstances. “You are asking for consent and not imposing any harm,” he said. “There is a good reason to do it.”It’s difficult to know whether more aggressive early testing among asymptomatic people would have significantly altered the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States, which has infected 24 million people and killed more than 400,000.The CDC was not the only agency that struggled with this issue. Notably, an official with the World Health Organization called asymptomatic spread “very rare” in June, only to say a day later “we don’t actually have that answer yet.” In recent months, the WHO has said infected people without symptoms can be contagious, but “it is still not clear how frequently this occurs.”Still, some countries such as South Korea and Singapore used widespread testing early on to identify infected people with or without symptoms and, unlike the United States, broadly required or distributed masks.CDC scientists infamously botched the creation of a test for the coronavirus and took weeks trying to fix it, making widespread testing - well beyond those with symptoms - impossible during the pandemic’s first months.In response to detailed inquiries from Reuters, a CDC spokesman said the agency declined to comment.In the final weeks of the Trump administration, White House officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports of political interference.The problems within the CDC, which has suffered from a decade of declining funding, point to the steep challenge faced by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden and his CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, to rehabilitate the agency in the eyes of scientists, other public health officials and the public.Walensky “acknowledges that work has to be done to restore public confidence” in the CDC, according to a Biden spokesperson.Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, who worked at the CDC for 20 years and at one point was responsible for pandemic influenza preparedness, said the agency’s staff are “among the most dedicated professionals in the world and they were doing the best they could under the toughest circumstances.”“This has been an incredibly challenging pandemic and it would have been hard for anyone to guess what would have happened,” she said.But she and other public health specialists also told Reuters that Americans deserve a thorough examination of the agency’s shortcomings in the crisis.“We have to figure out what needs to be fixed before this happens again,” said Rasmussen, now a professor at the University of Florida.Request deniedOn Feb. 7, a group of Americans arrived from Wuhan and the surrounding province at Camp Ashland, a National Guard base near Omaha and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, a major outpost in the nation’s defenses against bioterrorism and infectious diseases.Infectious disease specialist Lawler, who worked in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations on pandemic response, suspected that some of the evacuees might be infected with the coronavirus and shedding it despite having no symptoms. His suspicions were based partly on scientific reports from Asia and Europe.Starting on Feb. 8, Lawler pressed the CDC to greenlight voluntary and limited coronavirus testing among this group, according to emails obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act.Lawler had already won support for such testing from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in charge of the returnees at Ashland, the Nebraska health department and his university’s medical faculty, emails show. HHS oversees the CDC.Later that Saturday, Eric Kasowski, the CDC’s representative at Camp Ashland, emailed Lawler to tell him that his request to test the 57 people in quarantine “was very quickly elevated to Dr. (Anne) Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director, CDC,” who had worked at the agency for 32 years.Schuchat referred questions from Reuters to the CDC press office, which declined to comment.The CDC’s answer to Lawler was no.According to the Feb. 8 email: “It is CDC’s position that since the research is being proposed for a group of individuals who are detained under a federal quarantine order, the circumstances of voluntary participation would be extremely difficult to assure and therefore, CDC does not approve this study.”Lawler said he kept pressing Kasowski. But Kasowski told Lawler the next morning that the testing proposal had been rejected again, this time by officials up to and including CDC director Robert Redfield.“This is absurd,” Lawler recalled telling Kasowski.Kasowski declined to comment, referring questions to the CDC.Instead of having everyone tested during the two-week quarantine, only one returnee who became ill and was hospitalized got tested; the results were negative for coronavirus, Lawler said. The other 56 left quarantine without knowing whether they carried the virus, and Lawler said he knows of no CDC follow up with that group.In a Feb. 10 email to Kasowski, Lawler warned that the federal government, by not testing symptomless individuals, “may be missing the submerged iceberg in the US”Major problemsWithin days, Lawler got a new federal assignment: to help evacuate more than 300 Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan.He was joined there by Dr. Michael Callahan, a veteran infectious disease specialist from Massachusetts General Hospital, who had just been appointed a special advisor to HHS on Covid-19. Callahan, who says his two years of physician scientist training at the CDC in the mid-1990s inspired him to forgo academia for a field career battling disease outbreaks, had just treated coronavirus patients in China weeks earlier.Major problems emerged soon after Lawler and Callahan arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 14.The US team, including HHS and other US personnel, had to borrow walkie talkies from Japanese authorities because they didn’t have mobile phones that worked internationally, according to an “after-action” report submitted by Lawler and Callahan in March to HHS and obtained by Reuters.Japan had to lend the US team basic protective gear because the Americans’ supplies didn’t arrive in time, the report said. Some team members were not trained for handling a “highly contagious disease.”According to Callahan, he had to turn back two CDC staffers seeking to board the Diamond Princess in Japan because they had no current experience in emergency medicine and infection control.Callahan said the problem was not isolated to the CDC’s coronavirus response. In his regular interactions in the field with CDC staff in recent years, he said, he has seen “a progressive degradation of clinical expertise and incident management,” particularly during Ebola outbreaks in Africa.The CDC needs “people that can actually do public health when bad stuff happens,” Callahan said.Not enough proofOn Feb. 17, Lawler flew with 151 cruise passengers to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. An isolation bubble was created using a plastic curtain in the rear of the plane for five passengers who had tested positive for Covid-19 in Japan.During the flight, Lawler moved two passengers who had become feverish to the isolation area, planning to take them to Nebraska Medical Center. But those precautions went awry when CDC personnel greeted the plane in Texas.“The CDC officer in charge boarded the aircraft without consulting the flight crew regarding safety or contamination issues,” according to the after-action report.The officer’s personal protective equipment “was grossly insufficient due to the high level of contamination that likely existed on the aircraft. This likely put CDC personnel and other responders on the ground at risk.”What’s more, the CDC official moved the two people who had developed symptoms mid-flight back with the group of healthy passengers, and the CDC’s handling of the flight violated disaster medicine protocols, according to the report. The CDC official is not named in the report.Similar problems occurred when Callahan arrived with another group of 167 Diamond Princess passengers at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California and a CDC officer boarded the plane, the report said.Meantime, officials at Nebraska’s public health laboratory, who had been working with Lawler, asked the CDC for permission to test passengers from the Diamond Princess while they were under quarantine, even if they didn’t have symptoms, emails show.A CDC influenza expert, Dr. Tim Uyeki, wrote back on Feb. 17 to the director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory that the agency only wanted to test symptomatic individuals and those who had previously tested positive in Japan, citing a lack of detail on the accuracy of the Japanese tests.Uyeki declined to comment and referred questions to the CDC press office.Lawler and Callahan said they flew in late February to CDC headquarters in Atlanta to meet with Redfield and other senior officials, to raise concerns about the flawed evacuation and potential for asymptomatic spread based on their observations from the Diamond Princess.Lawler said CDC officials replied that there wasn’t enough proof yet that people without symptoms spread the disease.Redfield did not return requests for comment.Meanwhile, at both quarantine sites in Texas and California, CDC staff began to test some cruise passengers without symptoms who previously had tested positive in Japan, according to Dr. Bela Matyas, the local health officer in California’s Solano County, as well as emails between the Nebraska hospital personnel and the CDC.The CDC officials had doubts about the accuracy of testing done by Japanese authorities, but the results confirmed that at least some of the passengers were indeed positive - 16 at the California base alone, Matyas said. Texas numbers were not available.During the second week of quarantine in late February, the CDC and local health officials began offering tests to all of the cruise passengers. In California, where most sought testing, 10 more people were found to have Covid-19, Matyas said.Despite this evidence of infections without symptoms, the CDC made no immediate changes in its public guidance on asymptomatic infection.‘Fairly common’By March, signs of asymptomatic spread were mounting in the United States and abroad.A tipping point for the CDC came when staffers were deployed to the outskirts of Seattle to handle an outbreak at the Issaquah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a relatively confined setting. King County and CDC officials tested 76 of the 82 residents, regardless of whether they exhibited symptoms, beginning on March 13, according to the CDC.They found 23 infected, 13 asymptomatic at the time. Ten of those went on to develop symptoms.“That was really ... our first hint that asymptomatic transmission was fairly common, especially in those settings,” said Dr. James Lewis, an official with the county health department’s Covid-19 response, in an interview.Two weeks later, on March 27, the CDC published the case study as evidence of asymptomatic infection. That same week, for the first time, the agency recommended testing health workers and first responders, even without symptoms.In a radio interview that aired on March 31, Redfield said, “We have learned that in fact” symptomless individuals “do contribute to transmission.”Based on that evidence, the CDC recommended that even asymptomatic people wear cloth face coverings in public areas. Almost a month later, on April 27, the agency expanded its testing guidelines to include “persons without symptoms.”That was 11 weeks after Lawler’s first request to test the Wuhan group in Nebraska.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-us-cdc-missed-chances-to-spot-covid-19-silent-spread-101611317040725.html
22-01-2021||World||Beijing begins mass testing for Covid, Shanghai to test all hospital staff||Beijing began testing more than 2 million residents in two districts on Friday and Shanghai began checking all hospital staff after the first local cases were reported in the financial hub in several weeks as China continues to battle the worst Covid-19 outbreak since last March.The Beijing district tests could be a run-up to the testing of the remaining 20mn in the Capital as Chinese New Year (CNY) holidays approach. Residents of two other districts have already completed one round of testing.A southern district in Beijing is under a virtual lockdown after several locally transmitted Covid-19 cases were reported this month. Mainland China reported a slight decline in new daily cases on Friday - 103 from 144 infections a day earlier.Of the new cases, 94 were local transmissions. Heilongjiang province in the northeast reported 47 new cases, while Shanghai reported six new cases and the capital, Beijing, reported three. Beijing authorities said on Friday that they will track down and investigate everyone who entered the city from December 10 as part of efforts to prevent a fresh outbreak from spreading.The new quarantine rules for the Capital could extend to 28 days. Millions in northern Chinese provinces have been under lockdown and localised restrictions amid worries that undetected infections could spread rapidly in the run-up to the CNY holidays in mid-February.Hundreds of millions of people usually travel during the holiday as migrant workers return to their home provinces to see family. Officials expect hundreds of millions to travel this year as well though the numbers are likely to be lower than in normal years.Meanwhile, China reported its first cluster of Covid-19 cases among workers in a meat processing plant, a poultry slaughterhouse in Harbin in northeast, raising fears among local consumers who have until now mainly worried about the safety of imported foods.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 88,804, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-begins-mass-testing-for-covid-shanghai-to-test-all-hospital-staff-101611317325338.html
22-01-2021||World||Florida blocks wealthy vaccine tourists after anger from elderly residents||As millions of elderly Floridians scramble to register for a limited but growing supply of Covid-19 vaccines, state officials are clamping down on so-called vaccine tourism by limiting doses to only the state's part- and full-time residents.Shirley Hicks, 70, a retired teacher from the state's west coast, spent three weeks glued to her computer to find a dose for her husband Michael, 80, after Florida became one of the first states allowing vaccines for those aged 65 or older.But with no residency requirements for vaccinations, Florida residents have watched as wealthy tourists from New York to Canada to Argentina to India have joined the rush for a jab.Hicks said it was hard to bear this influx of vaccine tourists when she had to wake up before dawn day-after-day to try to secure an appointment through Publix Super Markets, Inc., the state's largest grocer recruited for the vaccination effort."It makes me sad, it makes me angry," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Finally this week she secured an appointment for her husband to receive the vaccine on Feb. 8.But with nearly 800,000 of the state's 4.4 million 65-and-older residents living at or below the poverty line, there is a growing concern that wealthier tourists could crowd out the most at risk members in a system struggling to keep up with demand.Since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in the United States more than 10 months ago the poor and the elderly have borne the brunt of the pandemic, which has killed more than 2 million worldwide and more than 400,000 in the United States.From Argentina to IndiaLobbying group LeadingAge Florida represents more than 500 properties that house more than 80,000 senior residents."Part of those numbers are seniors that live in HUD-sponsored (Department of Housing) and affordable housing communities," said communications director Nick Van Der Linden."Part of our priority since the beginning of 2020 was to work with state agencies to let them know and make them aware that it's not just longterm care facilities, that there is a large number of low income seniors and we want to make sure they do not get overlooked."As of Thursday more than 1.3 million doses of vaccine had been distributed, according to the state's health department.Since the start of January, when the vaccine first became available, the state has prioritized its senior population, which accounts for one-fifth of 21 million residents.The state's move to prioritize its elderly helped it secure more of the vaccine, and faster, than other states but an unintentional come-one come-all policy attracted visitors from around the country and the globe, desperate for the jab.Earlier this month Argentine television personality Yanina Latorre posted a video on Instagram of her mother receiving a dose of the vaccine at a Miami drive-through center after she said fans were able to help her make the arrangement.Former Time Warner CEO and Chairman Richard Parsons said during a CNBC interview that he flew from New York to the so-called sunshine state of Florida after securing a vaccine appointment. Parsons is also the former chairman of Citibank.Last month, ahead of the vaccine's release, an Indian travel agency that deals with business travelers started to promote vaccine tourism packages.Vaccine packagesNimesh Shah, head of B2B division of Gems Tour and Travel, said the company had registered more than 5,000 people who wanted to travel to the United States for the vaccine and had valid U.S. visas.Canadian travel insurance broker Martin Firestone, who runs Travel Secure Inc. in Toronto, said the pandemic had halted the annual southerly exodus of elderly Canadians - known as snowbirds - to warmer climes, until Florida began vaccinations."My people are going for the vaccine, but they're going to stay the season," Firestone told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."I hear they're not having much of a problem getting them, which is so contradictory to what you're reading about the line-ups and the problems Florida residents are having."On Thursday Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees released a notice specifying that only full-time or season residents able to show proof of such would be eligible to receive the vaccine.“What we don't want is tourists, foreigners. We want to put seniors first," Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters this week. “You got to live here, you know, either full-time or at least part-time.”Much of the confusion and disarray stems from communication issues between the recently departed Trump administration, the states and municipalities tasked with distributing the vaccine, and the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention.The latter has for months offered guidance to help determine which segments of the population are most at risk and should be first in line for the vaccine, said Harald Schmidt, a professor in the medical ethics department at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.However ensuring those who are most at risk are actually able to get the vaccine has, is, and will continue to be a complex problem that relies on a combination of political and bureaucratic coordination and personal responsibility."It would've been more helpful if we had clarity, a national vaccination plan," Schmidt said."Everybody who is exploiting loopholes needs to be clear: If you jump the line and you could safely wait a couple of months chances are you're depriving someone who needs that vaccine."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-blocks-wealthy-vaccine-tourists-after-anger-from-elderly-residents-101611315786773.html

In addition, the number of child suicides in 2020 was the highest on record and totaled 440 students from elementary, junior high, and high schools.The health ministry believes that the increase in the number of suicides may have occurred due to the changes in the economy and lifestyle that emerged during the spread of coronavirus infection and subsequent restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-records-rise-in-suicide-rate-for-first-time-since-2009-101611315879922.html

22-01-2021||World||After big hack of US government, Biden enlists 'world-class' cybersecurity team||President Joe Biden is hiring a group of national security veterans with deep cyber expertise, drawing praise from former defense officials and investigators as the US government works to recover from one of the biggest hacks of its agencies attributed to Russian spies."It is great to see the priority that the new administration is giving to cyber," said Suzanne Spaulding, director of the Defending Democratic Institutions project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Cybersecurity was demoted as a policy field under the Trump administration. It discontinued the Cybersecurity Coordinator position at the White House, shrunk the State Department's cyber diplomacy wing, and fired federal cybersecurity leader Chris Krebs in the aftermath of Donald Trump's Nov. 3 election defeat.Disclosed in December, the hack struck eight federal agencies and numerous companies, including software provider SolarWinds Corp. U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributed it to Russian state actors. Moscow has denied involvement in the hack.Under a recent law, Biden must open a cyber-focused office reporting to a new National Cyber Director, who will coordinate the federal government's vast cyber capabilities, said Mark Montgomery, a former congressional staffer who helped design the role.The leading candidate for Cyber Director is Jen Easterly, a former high ranking National Security Agency official, according to four people familiar with the selection process.Now head of resilience at Morgan Stanley, Easterly held several senior intelligence posts in the Obama administration and helped create U.S. Cyber Command, the country's top cyber warfare unit.Easterly did not respond to requests for comment.The Biden administration "has appointed world-class cybersecurity experts to leadership positions," Microsoft corporate Vice President Tom Burt said in a statement.Some observers worry, however, that the collective group's experience is almost entirely in the public sector, said one former official and an industry analyst who requested anonymity. The distinction is important because the vast majority of U.S. internet infrastructure is owned and operated by American corporations."Finding a good balance with both government and commercial experience will be critical to success," said former DHS Cybersecurity director Amit Yoran, now chief executive of security company Tenable Inc.To replace Krebs at the Homeland Security Department, Biden plans to nominate Rob Silvers, who also worked in the Obama administration, to become director of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, according to four people briefed on the matter. Silvers declined to comment for this article.Biden's National Security Council, an arm of the White House that guides an administration's security priorities, includes five experienced cybersecurity officials.Leading the hires is National Security Agency senior official Anne Neuberger as Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber and emerging technology, a new position designed to elevate the subject internally."The United States remains woefully unprepared for 21st century security threats - the establishment and prioritization of a DNSA for Cyber and Emerging Tech on the NSC indicates the seriousness the Biden Administration will afford to addressing these challenges," said Phil Reiner, chief executive of the Institute for Security and Technology.Neuberger became one of the most visible figures at NSA in recent years after leading the spy agency's cyber defense wing, drawing praise for quickly alerting companies to hacking techniques in use by other countries.The other four hires are Michael Sulmeyer as senior director for cyber, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall as Homeland security adviser, Russ Travers as deputy homeland security adviser and Caitlin Durkovich as senior director for resilience and response at the NSC.All four previously served in senior national security posts that dealt with cybersecurity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-big-hack-of-us-government-biden-enlists-world-class-cybersecurity-team-101611313434733.html
22-01-2021||World||A day after safe inaugural for Joe Biden, over 15,000 Guard troops head home||After President Joe Biden’s inauguration went off with only a handful of minor arrests and incidents, more than 15,000 National Guard members are preparing to leave Washington, DC, and head home.The National Guard Bureau said Thursday that of the nearly 26,000 Guard troops deployed to DC for the inaugural, just 10,600 remain on duty. The bureau said the Guard is helping states with coordination and the logistics so that troops can get home.Meanwhile, The Washington Post and Politico reported that hundreds of Guard troops were forced out of areas of the Capitol they had been using for rest breaks and were relocated to a nearby garage. Photos of the troops in the garage drew outrage from lawmakers.Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, tweeted: “Just made a number of calls and have been informed Capitol Police have apologized to the Guardsmen and they will be allowed back into the complex tonight. I’ll keep checking to make sure they are.”After midnight, Duckworth tweeted an update: “Troops are now all out of the garage. Now I can go to bed.” Politico reported that they had been allowed back into the Capitol.Thousands of Guard troops from all across the country poured into DC by the planeload and busload late last week, in response to escalating security threats and fears of more rioting. Military aircraft crowded the runways at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, carrying Guard members into the region in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.Guard forces were scattered around the city, helping to secure the Capitol, monuments, Metro entrances and the perimeter of central DC, which was largely locked down for several days leading up to Wednesday's inaugural ceremony.The US Secret Service announced that the special security event for the inauguration officially ended at noon Thursday.The Guard said that it may take several days to make all the arrangements to return the 15,000 home, but it should be complete in five to 10 days. Guard members will have to turn in equipment, make travel plans and go through Covid-19 screening.Some local law enforcement agencies have asked for continued assistance from the Guard, so roughly 7,000 troops are expected to stay in the region through the end of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-day-after-safe-inaugural-for-joe-biden-over-15-000-guard-troops-head-home-101611312511228.html

Of the remaining 21, rescuers have established contact with 11, and the status of the other 10 is unknown.The deceased worker had been in a coma. Two others are said to be in poor health. Rescuers have delivered food, medicine and other supplies to the group of 11 as they work to remove debris and improve ventilation.The state media reports said exhaustion has set in among some of the workers since the Jan. 10 explosion ripped through the mine that was under construction in Qixia, a jurisdiction under Yantai in Shandong province.Rescuers were attempting to clear cages and other debris blocking the main shaft while drilling other shafts for communication, ventilation and possibly to lift workers to the surface. Boring has reached depths of around 700 meters (about 2,000 feet), the reports said.Mine managers have been detained for waiting more than 24 hours before reporting the accident, the cause of which has not been announced.Increased supervision has improved safety in China’s mining industry, which used to average 5,000 deaths per year. Yet demand for coal and precious metals continues to prompt corner-cutting, and two accidents in Chongqing last year killed 39 miners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-mine-workers-to-remain-trapped-for-at-least-2-weeks-experts-101611312972177.html
22-01-2021||World||Hong Kong pushes for surveillance cameras in classrooms to monitor teachers' speech||In order to further clamp down on dissent against the draconian National Security Law in Hong Kong, pro-establishment lawmakers argued on Friday that surveillance cameras should be installed in Hong Kong schools to monitor teachers' speech.According to South China Morning Post (SCMP), Tommy Cheung Yu-yan, an adviser to the Executive Council, Chief Executive Carrie Lam's de facto cabinet, suggested that placing CCTV cameras in classrooms would reveal if teachers had made "subversive remarks"."The recordings can help schools monitor their teaching, and can also prove some innocent if they are smeared," Cheung said as quoted by SCMP.Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung Yun-hung said the government 'clearly saw areas for improvement' in the city's schools following the social unrest of 2019 where pro-democracy demonstrators took to the city streets to protest against the authoritarian security law."If teachers are found to be incompetent in their posts, the Education Bureau will consider revoking their registration for the well-being of students, to uphold the professionalism of teachers and public confidence of the education system," he said.Lam said she aimed to rebuild confidence in a city beset by the pro-democracy demonstrations, adding it was "heartbreaking" that, among the more than 10,000 people arrested over the pro-democracy protests, 40 per cent were students."The social incidents also reveal that the law-abiding awareness of some young people is weak and that positive values such as mutual understanding and mutual respect are lacking," Lam claimed.This comes after the authoritarian national security law was imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong that criminalises any act of secession (breaking away from China), subversion (undermining the power or authority of the central government), terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison. It came into effect from July 1.However, many countries have condemned Beijing for imposing this law citing that it clamps down on freedom of the people of Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-pushes-for-surveillance-cameras-in-classrooms-to-monitor-teachers-speech-101611311493445.html

Some were in severe condition. According to officials, the first suicide bomber cried out loudly that he was ill in the middle of the bustling market, prompting a crowd to gather around him — and that’s when he detonated his explosive belt. The second detonated shortly after.The US-led coalition recently ceased combat activities and is gradually drawing down its troop presence in Iraq, sparking fears of an IS resurgence. The group has rarely been able to penetrate the capital since being dislodged by Iraqi forces and the US-led coalition in 2017.The attack was the first in nearly three years to hit the capital. Elsewhere, in northern Iraq and the western desert, attacks continue and almost exclusively target Iraqi security forces.An increase in attacks was seen last summer as militants took advantage of the government’s focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and exploited security gaps across disputed territory in northern Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-claims-deadly-and-rare-twin-blasts-in-baghdad-101611311571060.html
22-01-2021||World||UK considers paying people to stay home amid lockdown breaches||UK government officials have suggested paying people to stay home if they test positive for coronavirus, amid concerns too many are failing to get tested or comply with the lockdown rules.While the plan has not been given final approval, a draft government policy paper proposed payments of 500 pounds ($685). Currently only those on the lowest incomes receive support at this level if they’re told to quarantine.England Isn’t Listening to Johnson’s Lockdown Orders Any MoreThe policy, which would cost about 2 billion pounds a month, would be designed to overcome people’s fear of losing income if forced to self-isolate by a positive test, according to a document dated Jan. 19 obtained by the Guardian and confirmed by a person familiar with the matter.Environment Secretary George Eustice called the idea “speculation” and said “no decisions have been made” when asked about the proposal in broadcast interviews on Friday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hold a press conference at 5 p.m. on Friday.‘Huge Cost’“We do want to improve compliance rates with self-isolation for people who have been in contact with somebody who has tested positive, for instance, and we do want people to get that test if they have symptoms of the virus,” Eustice told LBC radio. “But this would also be a huge cost.”The UK is in its third national lockdown with the highest death toll in Europe. The latest figures show 94,580 people died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19.The desire to avoid isolation is the biggest barrier to requesting a test and only 17% of people with symptoms are coming forward for testing, according to the Jan. 19 policy paper. Only a quarter of people reported compliance with self-isolation rules, while 15% are still going to work as normal, the Guardian cited the document as saying.Breaking RulesMinisters have been increasingly concerned over a lack of compliance by a minority of people and on Thursday announced new fines of 800 pounds for anyone attending a house party.Johnson also signalled the lockdown could last until summer, despite coming under pressure from members of his Conservative Party for a plan to ease the lockdown as soon as the government meets its target to vaccinate the 15 million most vulnerable people. Johnson wants to achieve that goal by Feb. 15.Shops, restaurants and schools are closed, and people have been told to stay at home unless absolutely necessary. The restrictions threaten to push the economy into another recession, after suffering its worst decline in three centuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-considers-paying-people-to-stay-home-amid-lockdown-breaches-101611308076473.html
22-01-2021||World||Explained: Why has Google threatened to pull its search engine from Australia||Google has threatened to pull its search engine from Australia if the government forces it to pay media outlets for their news content. Google Australia managing director Mel Silva on Friday warned a Senate committee in Canberra that the mandatory code of conduct proposed by the government was “unworkable” and would be a “bad outcome” for all Australians who use Google’s product every day.“If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google search available in Australia,” Silva told senators.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was quick to hit back at Google, saying they don’t respond to threats. Speaking to reporters in Brisbane, Morrison said, “Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That’s done in our parliament. It’s done by our government. And that’s how things work here in Australia.”Read | Google and its ethics AI team row: What we know so farWhat is the controversy?The Australian government proposed News Media Bargaining Code after the local competition regulator worked on a mandatory code to address the alleged bargaining power imbalances between Australia’s news media businesses and two Big Techs - Google and Facebook. Australian Competitor and Consumer Commission (ACCC) had said in a report that organisations like Google and Facebook are more than mere distributors or pure intermediaries in the supply of news in Australia.It noted that these Big Techs increasingly perform similar functions as media businesses like selecting, curating and ranking content. The competition watchdog had estimated that Google and Facebook together earn around $4 billion every year from advertising. Australia’s leading news publishers demanded that the two tech giants should pay at least 10 per cent of the news advertising revenue to local new organisations.After strong objections from Google and Facebook, the government made some changes in the legislation, however, Silva claimed that it still falls short of a “workable code”. The proposed law is aimed at making Google pay the local media outlets, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., for displaying snippets of articles in search results.Read: Google to pay French publishers for online content under new copyright agreementIn December 2020, Silva wrote in a blog that the latest version of the Code forces Google to pay to show links “in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work”. She stressed that no website or search engine pays to connect people to other websites, adding the Code would force to include and pay for links to news websites in the search results.Another controversial part of the law would force Google and Facebook to enter mandatory arbitration with media outlets if they fail to reach an agreement over the value of the news content within three months. The arbiter will take the final call between the payment proposal put forward by both parties. Google has argued that the “baseball arbitration model” incentivises publishers to make ambit claims and resort to arbitration rather than good-faith negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-has-google-threatened-to-pull-its-search-engine-from-australia-101611309465850.html
22-01-2021||World||Moderna lags in WHO vaccine drive as chinese shots near approval||As concern over vaccine disparity across the world deepens, the World Health Organization is struggling to keep pace with rich western countries in green-lighting shots for use -- slowing down the Covax initiative which poorer countries are relying on for inoculation.The global body has only approved one vaccine, the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot, for use, according to a document on the status of various Covid-19 vaccines in the WHO’s regulatory process. Moderna Inc., which has seen its mRNA shot authorized in the US, Canada, the U.K., the European Union and Israel, is yet to have a dossier accepted for review by the international body.This is despite the fact that Moderna is one of 11 vaccine candidates that received funding from the WHO-backed Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, though the $1 million provided paled in comparison to the hundreds of millions the company received from the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed.In contrast, leading Chinese vaccine makers Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. are further along in the WHO approval process, the document shows, though their shots are not among the nearly 2 billion already procured by Covax.Concern is growing over a mounting vaccine gap between rich and poor nations. This week, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the world was on “the brink of a catastrophic moral failure” as companies and countries prioritize inoculating widely in developed nations over targeting the more vulnerable in poor places.As WHO Fumes at Western Drugmakers, China Fills Void on VaccinesTedros lashed out at companies, saying they’re prioritizing approvals in rich countries where profit is highest instead of submitting full dossiers on their vaccines to the WHO. That could delay distribution through Covax, the WHO-backed initiative that aims to supply vaccines to poorer countries.Moderna was the second after Pfizer to secure emergency-use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December. Its vaccine is now being rolled out in the U.S., Canada and Europe.The WHO document shows there have been no pre-submission meetings held between the agency and Moderna, nor has a dossier been accepted for review. The WHO’s anticipated decision date on Moderna’s vaccine remains end-February, though the agency says this is only an estimate.The company is in dialogue with the WHO and is committed to a successful outcome, a Moderna spokesman said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg News, without giving further details.Astra ApplicationAn application for the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University is now being scrutinized by the WHO and approval is anticipated at the end of February, while the Chinese shots are estimated to be green-lit in March, according to the document.The WHO’s struggles have opened the door for China to ramp up its vaccine diplomacy, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi pledging last week to hand out more than a million doses during a swing through Southeast Asia.That amounted to a geopolitical win just before the inauguration of President Joe Biden, who has made one of his first moves in office to re-engage with the WHO following Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the organization last year.The Chinese vaccines’ quick progress through the WHO approval process raises the likelihood that they may be some of the first shots distributed by Covax, despite not being originally included for procurement.“The Chinese government supports vaccine companies in joining Covax and actively facilitates this,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday. “I understand Chinese companies including Sinopharm, Sinovac and CanSino have all submitted formal applications to join the initiative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-lags-in-who-vaccine-drive-as-chinese-shots-near-approval-101611309544011.html

The risk-benefit balance of the vaccine “remains favorable in the elderly.”The panel met on Tuesday to review reports that some very sick older people had died after getting the vaccine. Initial cases reported last week in Norway had raised alarm, with authorities saying it was possible that vaccine side-effects could aggravate underlying illnesses even as they expected some nursing-home residents to die shortly after being vaccinated due to their frail underlying health.Norway moved to calm that anxiety on Monday, with the Norwegian Medicines Agency saying that Covid-19 is more dangerous to most patients than vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-safe-for-elderly-despite-norway-scare-who-says-101611307456384.html
22-01-2021||World||Cash for Covid? UK says no decision on reported plan for positive tests||Britain's environment minister said on Friday no decision had been taken on plans to give everyone who tested positive for Covid-19 a payment after newspapers reported people could be given 500 pounds ($683.75) to incentivise them to take tests.Newspapers said the government was considering the plan in England because surveys suggested that some people with symptoms were not taking tests because lower paid workers did not want to self-isolate if they were positive and so be unable to work.Currently, only some people receiving welfare benefits receive a 500 pound payment if they are told to self-isolate, but according to an official policy paper seen by the Guardian newspaper and others, ministers were looking at making this a universal payment to all who tested positive.This would cost up to 453 million pounds a week, 12 times the cost of the current system, the Guardian said."I'm not going to comment on this particular paper but we've always kept it under review," said minister George Eustice. "No decisions to be made on this, but this is a dynamic fast moving situation with the pandemic."Surveys have indicated that only a small proportion of people with Covid symptoms were coming forward for tests while many others ignored instructions to self-isolate because of the financial impact of quarantining.Britain saw a surge in cases at the end of last year, fuelled by a new highly-transmissible strain of the virus, which has put the health service under extreme pressure. On Thursday, it recorded 37,892 new cases with 1,290 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cash-for-covid-uk-says-no-decision-on-reported-plan-for-positive-tests-101611305663212.html

It has already applied with Pakistan’s drug regulator to get approval.“We need to keep in mind that this coronavirus vaccine is a very scarce commodity, highly in demand and you know the other countries many months ago started the advance booking, we also need to do the same, we are already late on that,” said Zaheer in a phone interview. “Once Pakistan does a booking, we will be in a position to know the delivery. I am sure the delivery will be much before other manufacturers.”The company also plans to decrease the cost of procuring the vaccines by 25%, through filling the vials locally.Concern is mounting over a growing vaccine disparity between rich and poor nations which the World Health Organization’s Director-General has called a “catastrophic moral failure”. Pakistan is not among the 51 nations that have started administering shots despite being the fifth most populous country globally, according to data collected by Bloomberg.The South Asian country has already ordered 1.2 million doses from Chinese state-backed vaccine developer Sinopharm, manufactured by unit China National Biotec Group Co., with deliveries to start Jan. 31. It has also given approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s shot for private use.Results from the phase III trials in Pakistan will likely be the earliest indication of the CanSino vaccine’s protection level against Covid-19. A high efficacy level will add another weapon against the pandemic, though other Chinese vaccines have been greeted with some skepticism because of confusing trial data.Chinese developers have trailed behind western frontrunners in reporting interim test results. As the country has mostly been able to control its coronavirus outbreaks, CanSino and other Chinese developers have had to search abroad for phase III testing sites. CanSino eventually started late-stage trials in Pakistan, Russia, Argentina, Mexico and Chile.Pakistan is currently going through a second wave of infections that caused a peak in hospitalizations and deaths last month. Still, the nation has largely been spared the sweeping outbreaks of its neighbors Iran and India: total cases number 527,000 and fatalities over 11,000.The CanSino trial in Pakistan completed the enrollment of 17,500 participants a few days ago, after the target number was increased from 10,000 participants. Only minor side effects among volunteers have been recorded so far, such as low-grade fever and body ache for one or two days, said Zaheer.CanSino has also agreed to supply 35 million doses to Mexico while Malaysia is in talks to get 3.5 million shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-vaccine-maker-to-offer-pakistan-20-million-doses-101611304834750.html
22-01-2021||World||First-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons enters into force||The first-ever treaty to ban nuclear weapons entered into force on Friday, hailed as a historic step to rid the world of its deadliest weapons but strongly opposed by the world's nuclear-armed nations.The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is now part of international law, culminating a decades-long campaign aimed at preventing a repetition of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. But getting all nations to ratify the treaty requiring them to never own such weapons seems daunting, if not impossible, in the current global climate.When the treaty was approved by the UN General Assembly in July 2017, more than 120 approved it. But none of the nine countries known or believed to possess nuclear weapons — the United States, Russia, Britain, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel — supported it and neither did the 30-nation NATO alliance.Japan, the world's only country to suffer nuclear attacks, also does not support the treaty, even though the aged survivors of the bombings in 1945 strongly push for it to do so. Japan on its own renounces use and possession of nuclear weapons, but the government has said pursuing a treaty ban is not realistic with nuclear and non-nuclear states so sharply divided over it.Nonetheless, Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize-winning coalition whose work helped spearhead the treaty, called it “a really big day for international law, for the United Nations and for survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.”The treaty received its 50th ratification on Oct 24, triggering a 90-day period before its entry into force on Jan 22.As of Thursday, Fihn told The Associated Press that 61 countries had ratified the treaty, with another ratification possible on Friday, and “from Friday, nuclear weapons will be banned by international law” in all those countries.The treaty requires that all ratifying countries “never under any circumstances ... develop, test, produce, manufacture, otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.” It also bans any transfer or use of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices — and the threat to use such weapons — and requires parties to promote the treaty to other countries.Fihn said the treaty is “really, really significant” because it will now be a key legal instrument, along with the Geneva Conventions on conduct toward civilians and soldiers during war and the conventions banning chemical and biological weapons and land mines.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the treaty demonstrated support for multilateral approaches to nuclear disarmament.“Nuclear weapons pose growing dangers and the world needs urgent action to ensure their elimination and prevent the catastrophic human and environmental consequences any use would cause,” he said in a video message. “The elimination of nuclear weapons remains the highest disarmament priority of the United Nations.” But not for the nuclear powers.As the treaty was approaching the 50 ratifications needed to trigger its entry into force, the Trump administration wrote a letter to countries that signed it saying they made “a strategic error” and urging them to rescind their ratification. The letter said the treaty “turns back the clock on verification and disarmament" and would endanger the half-century-old Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, considered the cornerstone of nonproliferation efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firstever-treaty-to-ban-nuclear-weapons-enters-into-force-101611304754126.html
22-01-2021||World||'Liberating feeling': Dr Fauci compares working under Trump, Biden admin||Dr. Anthony Fauci is back.In truth, the nation’s leading infectious-diseases expert never really went away. But after enduring nearly a year of darts and undermining comments from former President Donald Trump, Fauci now speaks with the authority of the White House again.He called it “liberating” Thursday to be backed by a science-friendly administration that has embraced his recommendations to battle Covid-19.“One of the new things in this administration is, If you don’t know the answer, don’t guess,” Fauci said in one pointed observation during a White House briefing. “Just say you don’t know the answer.”Fauci’s highly visible schedule on Thursday, the first full day of President Joe Biden’s term, underscored the new administration's confidence in the doctor but also the urgency of the moment.His day began with a 4am virtual meeting with officials of the World Health Organization, which is based in Switzerland, and stretched past a 4 p.m. appearance at the lectern in the White House briefing room.The breakneck pace showcased the urgent need to combat a pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 Americans and reached its deadliest phase just as the new president comes to office.Fauci made clear that he believed the new administration would not trade in the mixed messages that so often came from the Trump White House, where scientific fact was often obscured by the president’s political agenda.“The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the science is ... it is something of a liberating feeling,” Fauci told reporters. White House press secretary Jen Psaki had invited Fauci to take the podium first at her daily briefing.While choosing his words carefully, Fauci acknowledged that it had been difficult at times to work for Trump, who repeatedly played down the severity of the pandemic, refused to consistently promote mask-wearing and often touted unproven scientific remedies, including a malaria drug and even injecting disinfectant.“It was very clear that there were things that were said, be it regarding things like hydroxychloroquine and other things, that really was uncomfortable because they were not based in scientific fact,” Fauci said. He added that he took “no pleasure” in having to contradict the president, a move that often drew Trump’s wrath.Biden, during his presidential campaign, pledged to making Fauci his chief medical adviser when he took office, and the 80-year-old scientist was immediately in motion.Fauci was up well before dawn Thursday for the virtual meeting with WHO, which Biden had rejoined the previous day after Trump withdrew the US from the group out of anger over how it dealt with China in the early days of the pandemic. Fauci told the group that the United States would join its effort to deliver coronavirus vaccines to poor countries.In the afternoon, the doctor stood alongside Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in the White House as they unveiled a series of executive orders aimed at slowing the spread of the virus, which is killing more than 4,000 Americans a day, as well as bolstering the nation’s sluggish vaccine distribution program.Fauci had chatted amiably with reporters while awaiting the tardy new president. He acknowledged it was a long day and said that while he’d prefer to go for a run, he planned to powerwalk a few miles Thursday evening.It was all a stark contrast after being kept on a tight leash by the Trump administration. Their West Wing press shop had tightly controlled Fauci’s media appearances — and blocked most of them. The doctor went from being a constant presence in the briefing room during the first weeks of the pandemic to largely being banished as Trump grew jealous of the doctor's positive press and resentful of Fauci's willingness to contradict him.Moreover, Trump frequently undermined Fauci’s credibility, falsely insisting that the pandemic was nearly over. The president regularly referenced Fauci's early skepticism about the effectiveness of masks for ordinary Americans, a position that Fauci quickly abandoned in the face of more evidence. And he even made fun of Fauci's first pitch at a Washington Nationals game.The president's attacks on Fauci — and his dismissiveness of the science — handicapped medical professionals trying to get Americans to take the virus seriously.“There was clear political influence on the message of the pandemic. It became political to say that the pandemic was devastating our community because it was interpreted as a judgement on Trump,” said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases physician and a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine. “It actively created enemies of the public health folks in a segment of the population.”Having Fauci return to a central role, Bhadelia said, is a sign “that science was being repressed and now back.”As his handling of the pandemic became the defining issue in the 2020 campaign, Trump insisted on portraying the virus as a thing of the past. He also mercilessly attacked Fauci, retweeting messages that called for the doctor’s dismissal and reveled in “Fire Fauci!” chants at some of his rallies.Trump sidelined Fauci but dared not dismiss him, after aides convinced him of the move’s political danger.But Fauci, who has now served under seven presidents, persevered, telling friends that he would keep his head down and aim to outlast Trump and the obfuscations of his administration.“Clarity of message is the most important thing the government can be doing right now; the single biggest disservice Trump did was constantly telling people that pandemic was about to be over,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who has known Fauci for more than 20 years.In his return to the briefing room, Fauci joked with reporters, seemingly far more relaxed than at any point last year. And as he stepped off the stage, Psaki said she'd soon have him back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liberating-feeling-dr-fauci-compares-working-under-trump-biden-admin-101611304360446.html
22-01-2021||World||China finds coronavirus cluster in major chicken processing plant||China reported its first cluster of Covid-19 cases among workers in a meat processing plant, raising fears among local consumers who have until now mainly worried about the safety of imported foods.Ten confirmed cases were found in a factory which slaughters 50 million chickens a year in the northeastern city of Harbin and is owned by Thai conglomerate Charoen Pokphand, one of the world's top poultry producers.Another 28 workers at the plant and three family members were asymptomatic, officials told a news briefing on Thursday.While China repeatedly pointed to imported frozen meat and fish as the source of coronavirus cases last year, it has not reported significant clusters in its own food processing sector.Meatpacking workers in the United States, Brazil and across Europe were among the groups hit hardest by Covid-19 last year, with thousands of slaughterhouse staff infected.The cluster in the C.P. plant was detected as part of routine screening of people in the region, which has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks.Samples taken from inside the slaughterhouse, its cold storage area and the outside of product packaging during inspections earlier this week had also been found positive for the virus, city officials said.The factory could not be reached for comment on the outbreak. Two executives involved in the group's chicken business declined to comment and referred Reuters to the headquarters, which could not be reached.News of the outbreak was trending on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo, with some netizens urging others not to eat CP products.Some said community officials had already ordered a recall of the factory's products. Reuters was unable to confirm.CP is one of China's top chicken processors and also a well-known brand of eggs and other processed foods.The World Health Organization has said people should not fear food or food packaging during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finds-coronavirus-cluster-in-major-chicken-processing-plant-101611303205856.html
22-01-2021||World||Sri Lanka approves vaccine amid warnings of virus spread||Sri Lanka has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to be used against Covid-19 amid warnings from doctors that frontline health workers should be quickly vaccinated to stop the system from collapsing.Minister for Pharmaceutical Production and Regulation Channa Jayasumana said the British vaccine has been approved for emergency use, the first to be approved in Sri Lanka, while several other candidates are in the pipeline at the National Medicines Regulatory Authority.It is unknown when Sri Lanka might be able to get supplies.“Hundreds of health care workers are tested positive in several hospitals. When you have one positive case about 10 health workers will need to be sent on quarantine. System is collapsing day by day, ” said Dr. Haritha Aluthge from the Government Medical Officers’ Association, the largest doctors’ trade union in the country.“Vaccines need to be given quickly to keep the health workers’ morals up and we need health workers to treat patients,” Aluthge said.After two months during which no cases were reported from the community, a random test on a factory worker led to the detection of a new cluster. Also the owner of an eatery near the country’s main fish market alerted authorities about a rise in the sale of paracetamol, an indication people were suffering fevers. Testing of fish vendors detected a second cluster.In over three months since, Sri Lanka has reported more than 52,000 new patients and 260 deaths. Between 500 to 900 new cases are being reported daily.Doctors say complacency from all sides, officials and the public has led to the new outbreak.“We were a success story, but the issue was we all as Sri Lankans forgot Covid-19 was existing. We thought that Covid was over,” said Senal Fernando, secretary of the GMOA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-approves-vaccine-amid-warnings-of-virus-spread-101611303195379.html

When @ShippersUnbound (Tim Shipman) and I interviewed Donald Trump in 2019, we became fascinated by what the little red button did. Eventually, Trump pressed it, and a butler swiftly brought in a Diet Coke on a silver platter. It's gone now," tweeted journalist Tom Newton Dunn.The Hill reported that Trump, a soda devotee, reportedly had the button put in place on the Resolute Desk in order to "keep the carbonated beverages flowing". When pressed, a staffer would be summoned to provide the drink to the thirsty commander in chief.Trump would regularly consume 12 cans of Diet Coke a day, as per media reports. Ex-White House aide Chris Sims wrote in his 2019 book "Team of Vipers" that Trump would also use the red button as a way of pranking visitors by suggesting it could trigger nuclear capabilities, cited by The Hill."Out of nowhere, he'd suddenly press the button," Sims wrote of the former president.He added, "Not sure what to do, guests would look at one another with raised eyebrows. Moments later, a steward would enter the room carrying a glass filled with Diet Coke on a silver platter, and Trump would burst out laughing."Even though Biden may have gotten rid of the soft drink buzzer, he, according to reports, also has 'a similar taste in beverages'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-diet-coke-button-seems-to-have-left-oval-office-when-he-did-101611302756773.html
22-01-2021||World||EXPLAINER: Why Alexei Navalny is a thorn in the Kremlin's side||The return to Russia from Germany by opposition leader Alexei Navalny was marked by chaos and popular outrage, and it ended, almost predictably, with his arrest.The Jan. 17 flight from Berlin, where Navalny spent nearly five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning, carried him and his wife, along with a group of journalists documenting the journey. But the plane was diverted from its intended airport in Moscow to another one in the capital in what was seen as an apparent attempt to foil a welcome from crowds awaiting him.Authorities also took him into custody immediately, sparking outrage at home and abroad. Some Western countries threatened sanctions and his team called for nationwide demonstrations Saturday.Navalny had prepared his own surprise for his return: A video expose alleging that a lavish “palace” was built for President Vladimir Putin on the Black Sea through an elaborate corruption scheme. His team posted it on YouTube on Tuesday, and within 48 hours, it had gotten over 42 million views.Navalny faces years in prison from a previous conviction he claims was politically motivated, while political commentators say there are no good options for the Kremlin.The AP looks at his long standoff with authorities:WHO IS ALEXEI NAVALNY?Navalny, 44, is an anti-corruption campaigner and the Kremlin’s fiercest critic. He has outlasted many opposition figures and is undeterred by incessant attempts to stop his work.He has released scores of damning reports exposing corruption in Putin’s Russia. He has been a galvanizing figure in mass protests, including unprecedented 2011-12 demonstrations sparked by reports of widespread rigging of a parliamentary election.Navalny was convicted twice on criminal charges: embezzlement and later fraud. He received suspended sentences of five years and 3 1/2 years. He denounced the convictions as politically motivated, and the European Court of Human Rights disputed both convictions.Navalny sought to challenge Putin in the 2018 election, but was barred from running by one of his convictions. Nevertheless, he drew crowds of supporters almost everywhere he went in the country.Frequently arrested, he has served multiple stints in jail for charges relating to leading protests. In 2017, an attacker threw a green antiseptic liquid in his face, damaging his sight. He also was hospitalized in 2019 after a suspected poisoning while in jail.None of that has stopped him. In August 2020, he fell ill while on a domestic flight in Siberia, and the pilot landed quickly in Omsk, where he was hospitalized. His supporters managed to have him flown to Berlin, where he lay in a coma for over two weeks and was diagnosed as having been poisoned by a Soviet-era nerve agent — an allegation the Kremlin denied.After he recovered, Navalny released a recording of a phone call he said he made to a man he alleged was a member of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, who purportedly poisoned him. The FSB dismissed the recording as a fake, but it still shocked many at home and abroad.Navalny vowed to return to Russia and continue his work, while authorities threatened him with arrest.WHY DID NAVALNY RETURN AT ALL?Navalny said he didn’t leave Russia by choice, but rather “ended up in Germany in an intensive care box.” He said he never considered the possibility of staying abroad.“It doesn’t seem right to me that Alexei Navalny calls for a revolution from Berlin,” he explained in an interview in October, referring to himself in the third person. “If I’m doing something, I want to share the risks with people who work in my office.”Analysts say it would have been impossible for Navalny to remain relevant as an opposition leader outside Russia. “Remaining abroad, becoming a political emigre, would mean death to a public politician,” said Masha Lipman, an independent political analyst.Nikolai Petrov, a senior research fellow in Chatham House’s Russia and Eurasia Program, echoed her sentiment, saying: “Active, bright people who could initiate some real actions and take part in elections ... while in the country, once abroad, end up cut off from the real connection to the people.”WHY IS NAVALNY NOW FACING PRISON?His suspended sentence from the 2014 conviction carried a probationary period that was to expire in December 2020. Authorities said Navalny was subject to regular in-person check-ins with law enforcement officers.During the final days of Navalny's probation period, Russia’s prison service put him on a wanted list, accusing him of not appearing for these checks, including when he was convalescing in Germany. Officials have petitioned the court to have him serve the full 3½-year sentence. After his return, Navalny was placed in custody for 30 days, with a hearing to review his sentence scheduled for Feb. 2.Earlier this month, Russia’s Investigative Committee opened another criminal probe against him on fraud charges, alleging he embezzled donations to his Foundation for Fighting Corruption. If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison.DOES NAVALNY THREATEN THE KREMLIN?Putin never calls Navalny by name, and state-run media depict him as an unimportant blogger. But he has managed to spread his reach far outside Moscow through his widely popular YouTube accounts, including the one this week that featured the allegations about the massive Black Sea estate.His infrastructure of regional offices set up nationwide in 2017 has helped him challenge the government by mobilizing voters. In 2018, Navalny launched a project called Smart Voting that is designed to promote candidates who are most likely to defeat those from the Kremlin’s dominant United Russia party.In 2019, the project helped opposition candidates win 20 of 45 seats on the Moscow city council, and regional elections last year saw United Russia lose its majority in legislatures in three cities.Navalny has promised to use the strategy during this year’s parliamentary election, which will determine who controls the State Duma in 2024. That’s when Putin’s current term expires and he is expected to seek re-election, thanks to constitutional reforms last year.Analysts believe Navalny is capable of influencing this key vote, reason enough to want him out of the picture.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Analysts say Navalny’s return was a significant blow to Putin’s image and left the Kremlin with a dilemma.Putin has mostly worked from his residence during the coronavirus outbreak, and the widespread perception that he has stayed away from the public doesn’t compare well to Navalny’s bold comeback to the country where he was poisoned and faced arrest, said Chatham House’s Petrov.“It doesn’t matter whether people support Navalny or not; they see these two images, and Putin loses,” he said.Commentators say there is no good choice for the Kremlin: Imprisoning Navalny for a long time will make him a martyr and could lead to mass protests, while letting him go threatens the parliamentary election.So far, the crackdown has only helped Navalny, “and now, even thinking loyalists are, if not on his side, certainly not on the side of poisoners and persecutors,” Alexander Baunov of the Moscow Carnegie Center wrote in a recent article.All eyes are on what happens at Saturday’s planned protests, Petrov said. In 2013, Navalny was quickly released from prison following a five-year sentence from embezzlement conviction after a large crowd gathered near the Kremlin.Putin’s government has since become much tougher on dissent, so it is unlikely that mass protests will prompt Navalny’s immediate release, Petrov said. But the Kremlin still fears that a harsh move may destabilize the situation, and the scale of the rallies could indicate how the public would react to Navalny being imprisoned for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-why-alexei-navalny-is-a-thorn-in-the-kremlin-s-side-101611301210343.html
22-01-2021||World||Italy blames Pfizer delays as Covid vaccinations slow to a crawl||Italy’s coronavirus vaccination campaign could come to a near standstill next week amid rising anger across Europe over a slowdown in vaccine deliveries.“We received 29% fewer doses this week, and there will be a further 20% decline next week” from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE, the country’s virus emergency czar Domenico Arcuri said in a press conference on Thursday. Since Saturday the pace of vaccinations has slowed to 28,000 a day from about 80,000, with shots halted altogether in some areas like Rome and the surrounding Lazio region.The slowdown makes it even more difficult for European countries, already lagging behind the U.S. and the U.K. in the race to vaccinate citizens, to step up the pace of inoculations. Italy, which aims to vaccinate the whole population by this fall, is already delaying the next step in its campaign, which involves giving shots to those over 80. So far, Italy has vaccinated 1.3 million people, or 2.1% of the population.Even more ambitious targets in other European countries may also be at risk. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday promised that all Germans who want a shot will get one by Sept. 21. In Denmark, authorities aim to vaccinate everyone who wants a shot by June 27.Italy has threatened legal action against Pfizer after talks with the company “did not produced the desired results,” Arcuri said in a Jan. 19 statement. The company’s reassurances that the pace of deliveries will pick up again so far have failed to convince, he said on Thursday.“The delivery of vaccines must proceed in compliance with commitments”, Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on twitter. “Protection of our citizens’ health remains at the heart of the coordinated action of the EU Governments and Commission to defeat Covid”.Denmark this week also criticized Pfizer for slowing the pace of vaccine deliveries, citing a disagreement about the contractual details involving procurement of a sixth dose out of each vaccine vial. Vials had originally been labeled for five doses, though after health-care providers proved adept at squeezing a sixth dose out of each vial, the official label was changed. Pfizer has said it will ship based on numbers of doses, not vials, which would mean fewer vials of vaccine being shipped to supply the same number of doses.Separately, Pfizer on Jan. 15 said it would cut deliveries from its factory in Puurs, Belgium due to renovations. The updates are planned to boost capacity starting next month. The factory supplies countries outside the U.S.Vaccines from additional producers will be necessary in order to achieve a European Union target of 70% vaccination by summer, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said ahead of an EU leaders summit on Thursday. “Otherwise, at the current pace of production and logistics, we can only immunize 25% to 30% by summer,” Nauseda said. “That’s clearly not enough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-blames-pfizer-delays-as-covid-vaccinations-slow-to-a-crawl-101611300464557.html
22-01-2021||World||India, Pakistan square off at UN on resolution on protecting religious sites||India and Pakistan squared off at the UN over a resolution on safeguarding religious sites around the world, with the Indian side criticising Pakistan for co-sponsoring the move weeks after the demolition of a Hindu temple. The resolution on “promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites” was sponsored by Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and several other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It was passed unanimously on Thursday after Saudi Arabia and Morocco piloted delicate negotiations on a consensus text. The resolution condemned all acts of violence and destruction directed against religious sites around the world and denounced “any moves to obliterate or forcibly convert any religious sites”, while strongly deploring violence against people on the basis of their religion or beliefs. Also read | China backs Guterres for second term as UN Secretary-GeneralIt also expressed concern about an increase in instances of racial and religious intolerance and stereotyping and condemned any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination and urged states to take effective measures to combat such incidents. The resolution also called on the UN secretary general to convene a global conference to advance the UN Plan of Action to Safeguard Religious Sites. The Indian representative at the world body, while explaining the country’s position on the resolution, called for objectivity and impartiality in discussions at the UN, without nations taking sides. “It is a matter of great irony that the country where the most recent attack and demolition of a Hindu temple took place in a series of such attacks and where the rights of minorities are being emasculated is one of the co-sponsors of the resolution under the agenda item ‘Culture of Peace’,” he said. “The resolution cannot be smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,” he added. India, as a multicultural state, country safeguards all religious and cultural rights and protects places of worship. However, religious and cultural sites remain vulnerable to attacks by violent extremists, as was seen when a Hindu temple was set ablaze and razed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan last December, while authorities stood idly by, the Indian representative said. “The terrorist bombing of the Sikh gurudwara in Afghanistan where 25 Sikh worshippers were killed is yet another example of this vulnerability,” he added. Warning against selective enforcement of laws against attacks on religious sites, he stressed that as long as such selectivity exists, the world will never be able to foster a real culture of peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pakistan-square-off-at-un-on-resolution-on-protecting-religious-sites-101611299863279.html

Payette, a former astronaut, had been serving in that position since 2017.Details of the independent review haven’t yet been revealed. CBC News has reported that the findings were “damning” in the context of workplace culture in Rideau Hall during Payette’s tenure.AFP reported that the review was ordered by the government last July when allegations of a “toxic” climate at Rideau Hall first surfaced.Acknowledging the controversy, Payette issued an apology as she stepped down. “Everyone has a right to a healthy and safe work environment, at all times and under all circumstances. It appears this was not always the case at the office of the secretary to the governor general. Tensions have arisen at Rideau Hall over the past few months and for that, I am sorry,” she said in a statement.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office, too, issued a statement on the turn of events. “Every employee in the government of Canada has the right to work in a safe and healthy environment, and we will always take this very seriously. Today’s announcement provides an opportunity for new leadership at Rideau Hall to address the workplace concerns raised by employees during the review,” the PMO said.Richard Wagner, the chief justice of Canada’s supreme court, will discharge the duties of governor general till a replacement is formally appointed. “A recommendation on a replacement will be provided to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and announced in due course,” Trudeau’s office said.Payette’s secretary, Assunta di Lorenzo, has also resigned. In her statement, Payette said, she is “a strong believer in the principles of natural justice, due process and the rule of law, and that these principles apply to all equally”, and she was stepping down in “respect for the integrity of my vice-regal office and for the good of our country and of our democratic institutions”.“Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times,” she added.Payette said she took the allegations “very seriously” but “no formal complaints or official grievances were made” during her tenure.She also said that her decision to quit came at a time when her father was unwell and her family needed her support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-governor-general-julie-payette-quits-over-workplace-mistreatment-scandal-101611299563367.html
22-01-2021||World||After Trump setbacks, Kim Jong Un starts over with Biden||Last year was a disaster for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.He helplessly watched his country's already battered economy decay further amid pandemic border closures while brooding over the collapse of made-for-TV summits with former President Donald Trump that failed to lift crippling sanctions from his country.Now he must start all over again with President Joe Biden, who has previously called Kim a “thug” and accused Trump of chasing spectacles instead of meaningful reductions of Kim’s nuclear arsenal.While Kim has vowed to strengthen his nuclear weapons program in recent political speeches, he also tried to give Biden an opening by saying that the fate of their relations depends on whether Washington discards what he calls hostile U.S. policies.It’s unclear how patient Kim will be. North Korea has a history of testing new U.S. administrations with missile launches and other provocations aimed at forcing the Americans back to the negotiating table.In recent military parades in Pyongyang, Kim showcased new weapons he may test, including solid-fuel ballistic systems designed to be fired from vehicles and submarines, and the North’s biggest intercontinental ballistic missile.A revival of tensions would force the U.S. and South Korea to reckon more deeply with the possibility that Kim may never voluntarily deal away the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.Kim’s arsenal emerged as a major threat to the United States and its Asian allies following tests in 2017 that included a detonation of a purported thermonuclear warhead and flight tests of ICBMs that demonstrated the potential to reach deep into the American homeland.A year later, Kim initiated diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S., but it derailed in 2019 when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a piecemeal deal partially surrendering its nuclear capabilities.North Korea won’t likely be the top priority for Biden, who while facing mounting domestic issues is also gearing up for a push to get back into a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that Trump blew up in favor of what he called maximum pressure against Iran.The Biden administration’s “sequence of policy attention will likely be: Get America’s own house in order, strengthen U.S. alliances and align strategies toward China and Russia, and then address Iran and North Korea,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.But North Korea never likes to be ignored.Although Biden served as vice president under Barack Obama, whose policy was to wait out North Korea while gradually increasing sanctions, that method might not work because the North's weapons capabilities have grown significantly in the years since.While sanctions, border closures and crop-killing natural disasters have created the toughest challenges of Kim’s nine-year rule, he won’t be in a hurry to offer concessions, Easley said. Kim’s government has a high tolerance for domestic suffering and could expect extensive help from China, its only major ally.North Korea’s first provocation under the Biden administration could possibly be related to submarine-launched ballistic systems, which Kim showcased in recent parades.Kim’s ambitions for longer-range ICBMs and reconnaissance satellites that he expressed during the ruling party congress this month could lead to a space launch that would double as a test of long-range missile technology. That would be reminiscent of a 2009 launch that took place weeks into Obama’s first term.″(The North) is capable of conducting tests that the U.S. and its allies cannot ignore," Easley said. “Kim is likely to exploit this."The North Korean leader is trying to move the diplomacy toward an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states, rather than talks that would culminate in a full surrender of his weapons, according to Shin Beomchul, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.But North Korea probably won’t test weapons until after Biden’s State of the Union address in February, where he could set the tone of his policy toward the North, Shin said. Kim may also want to see whether the United States and South Korea proceed with a major joint military exercise expected in March.Although the allies have described their annual exercises as defensive in nature and downsized much of their combined training activity under Trump to make space for diplomacy, North Korea has called for a full stoppage of the drills, describing them as invasion rehearsals and proof of U.S. hostility.“The North during the party congress has made clear it has no intentions of budging first, but it is also interested in hearing what the United States has to say,” said Shin, who served as a South Korean diplomat during the Obama years.“Biden will not inherit Trump’s top-down diplomacy, but you could expect him to be more flexible about working-level negotiations, offering to talk with the North Koreans at any time and place and about anything,” he said.Shin expects Biden to eventually pursue a deal with North Korea that resembles the agreement with Iran that Trump pulled out of in 2018. It could provide North Korea some level of compensation for freezing its nuclear and missile capabilities at their current level.While the United States won’t likely give up its long-term commitment to denuclearizing North Korea, rolling back the country’s nuclear capabilities to zero is not a realistic near-term diplomatic goal, he said.But an Iran-style deal might not work with North Korea, which has much more advanced weapons and is unlikely to accept the monitoring steps baked into the Iran deal, said Park Won-gon, a professor at South Korea’s Handong University.One thing is clear, though, Park said: If North Korea tests its weapons, Biden will dial up sanctions that will continue to push Kim’s economy to the brink.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-trump-setbacks-kim-jong-un-starts-over-with-biden-101611296973295.html
22-01-2021||World||Congress poised for quick action on Biden's Pentagon nominee Austin||The Democratic-controlled Congress has easily passed legislation required to confirm retired Gen. Lloyd Austin as President Joe Biden’s secretary of defense, brushing aside concerns that his retirement occurred inside the seven-year window that safeguards civilian leadership of the military.It would be the first measure to be signed into law by brand-new President Joe Biden.The Senate sent the measure exempting Austin from the seven-year rule to Biden Thursday after a 69-27 Senate tally that came moments after a comparably lopsided 326-78 House vote. The back-to-back votes put Austin in position to be confirmed as secretary by Friday.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, confirmed that the confirmation vote on Austin would be conducted Friday.Austin, a 41-year veteran of the Army, has promised to surround himself with qualified civilians and include them in policy decisions. He said he has spent nearly his entire life committed to the principle of civilian control over the military.While the waiver is expected to be approved, the vote puts some Democrats in a position to look like they've flip-flopped. Many of them opposed a similar waiver in 2017 for Jim Mattis, former President Donald Trump's first secretary of defense.Austin, who would be the first Black secretary of defense, said he understands why some have questioned the wisdom of putting a recently retired general in charge of the Defense Department. Much of his focus this week, including in his remarks at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, has been on persuading members of Congress that although he has been out of uniform for less than five years, he sees himself as a civilian, not a general.Some aspects of his policy priorities are less clear. He emphasized on Tuesday that he will follow Biden’s lead in giving renewed attention to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.“I will quickly review the department’s contributions to coronavirus relief efforts, ensuring we are doing everything we can — and then some — to help distribute vaccines across the country and to vaccinate our troops and preserve readiness,” he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.Under questioning by senators, Austin pledged to address white supremacy and violent extremism in the ranks of the military — problems that received relatively little public attention from his immediate predecessor, Mark Esper. Austin promised to “rid our ranks of racists,” and said he takes the problem personally.“The Defense Department’s job is to keep America safe from our enemies,” he said. “But we can’t do that if some of those enemies lie within our own ranks.”Austin said he will insist that the leaders of every military service know that extremist behavior in their ranks is unacceptable.“This is not something we can be passive on,” he said. “This is something I think we have to be active on, and we have to lean into it and make sure that we’re doing the right things to create the right climate.”He offered glimpses of other policy priorities, indicating that he embraces the view among many in Congress that China is the “pacing challenge,” or the leading national security problem for the U.S.The Middle East was the main focus for Austin during much of his 41-year Army career, particularly when he reached senior officer ranks. He served several tours of duty as a commander in Iraq, including as the top commander in 2010-11.An aspect of the defense secretary’s job that is unfamiliar to most who take the job is the far-flung and complex network of nuclear forces that are central to U.S. defense strategy. As a career Army officer, Austin had little reason to learn the intricacies of nuclear policy, since the Army has no nuclear weapons. He told his confirmation hearing that he would bone up on this topic before committing to any change in the nuclear policies set by the Trump administration, including its pursuit of nuclear modernization.Austin, a 1975 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served in 2012 as the first Black vice chief of staff of the Army. A year later he assumed command of Central Command, where he fashioned and began implementing a strategy for rolling back the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.He describes himself as the son of a postal worker and a homemaker from Thomasville, Georgia, who will speak his mind to Congress and to Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-poised-for-quick-action-on-biden-s-pentagon-nominee-austin-101611296476159.html
22-01-2021||World||Senate leader Schumer reviewing request for Trump impeachment trial delay||U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is reviewing a request from Republicans to put off the start of former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial until mid-February, a Schumer spokesman said Thursday.Republicans argued that Trump needed time to prepare a defense against charges of inciting insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell requested the timeline after Democrats earlier in the day said that the House of Representatives could send the impeachment charge - passed last week in response to the deadly storming of the Capitol by Trump supporters - to the Senate as early as Friday.Trump, a Republican, left office on Wednesday and flew to his Florida resort, hours before Democrat Joe Biden was sworn in.McConnell said in a statement that he asked Democrats to hold off on sending the impeachment charge to the Senate until Jan. 28, and then give Trump two weeks from that day to prepare a defense.A spokesman for Schumer said the majority leader had received the proposal late Thursday afternoon. "We will review it and discuss it" with McConnell, the spokesman said.Democrats control the Senate by the narrowest possible margin, relying on Vice President Kamala Harris's tie-breaking vote in a 50-50 chamber, and also need Republican cooperation to advance much of Biden's agenda, as well as confirming Cabinet appointments.Trump is the only U.S. president to have been impeached twice, and his trial in the Senate will be the only one ever to have taken place after a president has left office.A source familiar with the planning told Reuters the House could transmit the article of impeachment as early as Friday, and No. 2 Senate Democrat Dick Durbin said he expected it "in a day or two." In Trump's first impeachment trial, the Senate began the proceedings the day after the charges were sent from the House.But Republican senators said they had discussed with McConnell the need to give Trump time for "due process," as Senator John Cornyn put it."From what I understand from today's conversation, it does not get started until sometime mid-February," Republican Senator Mike Braun told reporters.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to answer reporters' questions earlier Thursday about when she would submit the charge. Durbin told reporters that it was still not determined whether the Senate will hold a "full-blown trial with evidence and witnesses" or an "expedited" procedure.The House vote last week charged Trump with inciting the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, a failed attempt to prevent Congress from formally certifying Biden's victory.Democrats, who hold a House majority, narrowly took control of the Senate on Wednesday, but at least two-thirds of the 100-member body are required to convict Trump. A separate vote would be needed to block him from running for office again.Trump has hired South Carolina-based lawyer Butch Bowers to represent him in his Senate impeachment trial, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.While Republicans have called for a delay to allow Trump to prepare his defense, some Democrats would also favor a delay to help keep Biden's agenda and appointments on track.Senator Chris Coons said Democrats would be open to considering a delay if progress is made in confirming Biden nominees."There are dozens of senior members of the administration who need to be confirmed and deserve to be confirmed," Coons told CNN. "If we continue to make progress in that direction, then I think this is a good step. If not, you'll quickly find Democrats frustrated and insisting that we move ahead with the accountability that could be delivered by an impeachment trial."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-leader-schumer-reviewing-request-for-trump-impeachment-trial-delay-101611292644192.html
22-01-2021||World||Kremlin misread Navalny’s resolve to fight, even from prison||Russian officials were convinced opposition leader Alexey Navalny wouldn’t come back.They’d warned he’d be jailed on arrival and steadily ratcheted up threats of new probes, amid allegations ranging from stealing supporters’ donations to working for U.S. intelligence. Even fellow Kremlin critics told the 44-year-old activist it was too dangerous to return from Berlin, where he’d been recovering from a nerve-agent attack he and Western capitals blamed on President Vladimir Putin.But Navalny, convinced he could only remain a political force from inside the country, ignored their advice.His dramatic return has thrown the Kremlin on the defensive. The tension is unwelcome in a year that was supposed to be about sealing control in elections this fall as Russia recovered from the pandemic after Putin laid the groundwork to extend his rule as far as 2036.“Navalny’s plan is very simple -- to become Putin’s No. 1 headache and with his courage inspire political activism,” said Fyodor Krasheninnikov, a political consultant close to the Kremlin critic. “If he had decided not to come back, it would have been a victory for Putin.”Backers say that strategy can work even if Navalny is jailed for years, which they expect. The Russian leader’s main opponent is betting that he can bring enough supporters into the streets this year to show they won’t be intimidated. At the same time, he’s counting on a West newly energized by the inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden to raise the pressure on the Kremlin from outside.It’s a risky gamble.Long SentenceThe Kremlin is now resolved to keep Navalny in prison for several years or more, breaking with its past practice of giving him jail sentences of not more than a few weeks at a time, according to two people close to the leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss matters that aren’t public. He could get as much as 3.5 years at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 2, with another case in the works that could add 10 more.These people said the harder line comes from the Kremlin’s view that Navalny is working on behalf of Western governments -- a charge he denies. At the same time, the continuing protests in Belarus despite Russian-backed strongman Alexander Lukashenko’s brutal efforts to suppress them have raised fears about public protests, they said. Authorities hope that Navalny’s highly personalized movement will lose direction once he’s in prison.So far, that hasn’t happened. A new video he and his team released on YouTube Tuesday, exposing a grandiose Black Sea palace they alleged belongs to Putin, had over 40 million views in the first two days, a record for his group. The Kremlin calls the film’s claims untrue.“They provoked a completely unnecessary crisis with serious domestic and international consequences,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant who worked for the presidential administration in the early 2000s. “The Kremlin is now playing on Navalny’s turf.”The activist and his allies hope that his case will catalyze the public discontent that’s been simmering amid a 4% decline in real incomes and coronavirus lockdowns, driving Putin’s ratings to record lows at one point last year. They’re targeting parliamentary elections in September as a chance to send a signal of the breadth of popular unhappiness.A Levada Center poll last fall found 20% of Russians said they approved of Navalny’s work, despite uniformly negative coverage of him in state media. Half said they disapproved.Putin Support“There won’t be quick steps, but the erosion of the regime will definitely accelerate,” said Krasheninnikov. “This stress situation will force Putin and his circle to make mistakes.”Of course, Kremlin critics have for years predicted the looming collapse of Putin’s support only to be disappointed. Polls show backing for him remains strong.An early test for opponents comes Saturday, when Navalny’s allies plan rallies in dozens of cities. Authorities have already warned they wouldn’t grant permits and detained at least one organizer, moving at the same time to block websites promoting the events.While confrontation with Navalny carries risks of stoking popular anger at Putin’s continued rule, it also holds the potential prize of breaking the Kremlin’s most persistent opposition movement. The last major challenge -- which led to Putin’s 2003 imprisonment of billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky over Western protests -- signaled his rejection of any defiance of his power.“In Russia now it’s more effective to fight the regime from prison than from exile,” said Khodorkovsky, who was forced to leave Russia in 2013 after his prison term. His case is a cautionary one: he, too, returned from abroad knowing he’d be jailed but underestimated the Kremlin’s resolve. “I thought I’d get 3-4 years at most, but it turned out to be 10.”Dissent CrackdownThe Kremlin has pushed through legal changes to add new penalties for critics, as well as possibly block foreign social media that have been key organizing tools. Navalny’s supporters so far haven’t shown the fortitude of activists in Belarus, who’ve continued to protest for months despite beatings and arrests. Western criticism has been limited to rhetoric. Europe’s top diplomat is going ahead with a visit to Moscow next month -- the first of its kind in four years -- despite calls from some capitals to shelve it.Still, German Chancellor Angela Merkel Thursday renewed calls for Navalny’s immediate release, suggesting his case is back at the top of the agenda in many Western capitals. Her comments triggered a modest slide in the ruble as investors worried new sanctions could be on the horizon, Rabobank said.“It is extraordinary how frightened Vladimir Putin seems to be of one man,” Antony Blinken, Biden’s nominee for secretary of state told senators this week. “I think that speaks volumes, and Mr. Navalny is a voice, I think, for millions and millions of Russians and their voice needs to be heard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-misread-navalny-s-resolve-to-fight-even-from-prison-101611292312139.html
22-01-2021||World||Boris Johnson signals 3rd UK lockdown could last into summer||The UK’s third coronavirus lockdown looks set to endure as the government warned it’s too early to contemplate easing restrictions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel did not repeat previous assurances that the U.K. will be getting back to normal by April, even as the mass vaccination program continued to expand to reach 5 million people.Instead, they toughened up measures to enforce the current restrictions, amid concerns that too many people are still flouting the rules, making it harder to control the spread of the disease.New police fines of 800 pounds ($1,097) will be imposed on people caught attending house parties, Patel told a press conference in London. When asked if the public should book summer holidays, she said the advice now is to stay home.“It’s far too early to say or even speculate when we can lift restrictions,” Patel said. “This country remains in the grip of a pandemic.”SummerEarlier, Johnson was asked if the lockdown may need to last into the summer, and did not rule it out, warning only that the new coronavirus strain is “much more contagious” and that the U.K. faces “what is unquestionably going to be a tough few weeks ahead.”Their comments suggest a gloomier outlook than just days ago, when ministers were saying they hope to begin opening up the economy in the first half of March.Johnson is under pressure from members of his Conservative Party who are pushing for him to outline a plan to ease the lockdown as soon as the government meets its target to vaccinate the 15 million most vulnerable people, a goal he wants to achieve by Feb. 15.“Vaccinations will of course bring immunity from Covid, but they must bring immunity from lockdowns and restrictions too,” Tory lawmaker Mark Harper, chairman of the party’s so-called Covid Recovery Group, said in a statement. “This cycle of lockdowns and restrictions causes immense damage.”RulesShops, restaurants and schools are closed, and people have been told to stay at home unless absolutely necessary. The restrictions threaten to push the economy into another recession, after suffering its worst decline in three centuries.Northern Ireland’s devolved government announced an extension to the region’s lockdown to March 5.The latest U.K. data showed 1,290 people died from Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 95,829, the highest death toll in Europe. It’s had a succession of records this month of both new cases and daily deaths.Read more: Why the Mutated Coronavirus Variants Are So Worrisome: QuickTakeMinisters are considering making 500-pound payments to everyone who tests positive for Covid, in order to persuade more people with symptoms to come forward for testing, the Telegraph and the Guardian both reported late Thursday. The policy, which would cost about 2 billion pounds a month, would be designed to overcome people’s fear of losing income if forced to self-isolate by a positive test, the papers said, citing a document dated Jan. 19 and marked “official-sensitive.”Patel said that while most people are obeying the rules, a few are exhibiting “irresponsible behavior” that poses “a significant threat to public health.”Fines for attending parties will double for every further breach to a maximum penalty of 6,400 pounds, she said. Party organizers already faced 10,000-pound fines.Read more: U.K. Has Now Given Over 5 Million Covid-19 Vaccine DosesThe new enforcement action will apply to any gatherings of more than 15 people discovered by police, as ministers get tougher on those breaking lockdown restrictions.Vin Diwakar, the National Health Service medical director for London, said the U.K. is facing its biggest public health crisis since World War II, and likened breaking the rules by hosting or attending large parties to “switching on a light in the middle of a blackout in the Blitz.”“It doesn’t just put you at risk in your house,” he said. “It puts your whole street and the whole of your community at risk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-signals-3rd-uk-lockdown-could-last-into-summer-101611291749825.html
22-01-2021||World||Beijing launches mass virus tests as China's daily tally drops slightly||Beijing launched mass Covid-19 testing in some areas on Friday, while Shanghai was testing all hospital staff as China battles its worst outbreak of the disease since March and families fret over reunion plans for the Lunar New Year amid new curbs.Mainland China reported a slight decline in new daily Covid-19 cases on Friday - 103 from 144 cases a day earlier.Of these new cases, 94 were local transmissions: northeastern Heilongjiang reported 47 new cases, while Jilin province reported 19 new cases. Shanghai reported six new cases, while the capital Beijing reported three new cases.Some districts in Beijing launched mass COVID-19 tests following several consecutive days of new cases in the Chinese capital, with long queues forming in certain parts of the town.Shanghai began testing all hospital staff for the disease on Thursday after two such workers tested positive.Almost all of the local transmissions and asymptomatic cases in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, were linked to a meat processing plant owned by a joint venture between Thailand's top agro-industrial conglomerate, CP Group, and a local development zone, according to a statement by local officials.It is thought to be the first cluster of cases in a meat plant in China, although such facilities have been hotspots for pandemic outbreaks elsewhere in the world. The joint venture could not be immediately reached for comment.Tens of millions of people have been under some kind of lockdown in northern cities amid worries that undetected infections could spread quickly during the Lunar New Year holiday, which is just weeks away.Hundreds of millions of people usually travel during the holiday, in mid-February this year, as migrant workers return to their home provinces to see family. Officials expect large numbers of travellers, although much fewer than in normal years.Hebei province, next to Beijing, reported 18 new locally transmitted cases. At the high speed railway station in its largest city Shijiazhuang, passengers were allowed to get off a train on Friday but none were seen getting on."I've never been separated from my daughter over New Year before," said a woman surnamed Hao, who is in Shijiazhuang taking care of her mother and has been told by her neighbourhood she is now not allowed to return to Beijing, where the rest of her family are.Hao is hoping that restrictions will lift in time for them to reunite over the festival."When (my daughter) was studying abroad in London, I flew there on New Year's eve. She is my motivation to go back," she said. Hao's father is in a nursing home in Beijing which is no longer allowing visitors.The capital's west train station, which normally sees vast numbers of passengers passing through in the run up to the Lunar New Year, was virtually empty on Friday morning.A queue more than 200 meters long was seen outside Dengshikou Elementary School, a testing spot near the centre of the city.A man surnamed Lin said the supermarket he works at had told him to take a test that morning."People here should all be organised by their companies," he said. "I'm not that worried, though this round of the outbreak is a bit unexpected. I came as my work unit told me to."The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 119 from 113 cases a day earlier.The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mainland China now stands at 88,804, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-launches-mass-virus-tests-as-china-s-daily-tally-drops-slightly-101611291108745.html
22-01-2021||World||We have hit the ground running: Kamala Harris||With President Joe Biden signing nearly two dozen executive actions, fulfilling major campaign promises and addressing the challenges of race, health and economy head on, Vice President Kamala Harris has said the new administration has "hit the ground running".On day one in office on Wednesday, Biden signed 15 executive orders and two other directives, reversing some of the key foreign policies and national security decisions of his predecessor Donald Trump. The orders, the White House said, are aimed at addressing the major problems being faced by the country.The executive orders ranged from rejoining the Paris agreement on climate change, halting America's withdrawal from the World Health Organisation, revoking Muslim travel ban and stopping immediate construction of Mexico border wall.“We have hit the ground running,” Harris, 56, said on Thursday, a day after the historic inauguration wherein Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States and she became the first ever woman vice president of the country. Harris is the 49th Vice President of the US.Harris, who is also the first ever black American and Indian-origin person to occupy the position, had a busy first working day.In the morning, she and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff joined Biden and First Lady Jill Biden to watch the virtual presidential inaugural prayer service hosted by the Washington National Cathedral.Thereafter she joined Biden in receiving the daily intelligence briefing in the Oval Office of the White House. In the afternoon, Harris join the president for his remarks on the administration's COVID-19 response. She was standing by his side, as he signed a series of executive orders and other presidential actions responding to the COVID-19 crisis.Soon thereafter, Harris joined the president in a briefing from members of their COVID-19 team on the coronavirus response and the state of vaccinations.In between her busy schedule, Harris administered the oath of secrecy to Avril Haines, America's first woman spy chief.“Earlier today, I swore in our first Cabinet member, Avril Haines, after her confirmation by the Senate last night. As the Director of National Intelligence, Director Haines will be dedicated to keeping the American people safe,” Harris said in a tweet.In her capacity as DNI, 51-year-old Haines would oversee as many as 18 American intelligence agencies, including CIA and FBI.Meanwhile, Emhoff posted a picture of him and Harris walking towards the Oval Office. “Honoured and ready to get to work. It was a great first day,” the Second Gentleman tweeted.On Friday, Harris will join Biden in attending the daily briefing, after which the two leaders would have lunch together in the private dining room, the White House said.Harris will receive a briefing with the president on the state of the economic recovery in the state dining room. Then she will join Biden for his remarks on the administration’s response to the economic crisis. The president will also sign executive orders in issues related to the economy.In the evening, Harris will hold a virtual meeting with National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and small business owners affected by COVID-19 to discuss the Biden-Harris administration’s plan to address the ongoing economic crisis.“Kamala Harris is now the 49th Vice President of the United States. But, of course, in more ways than one she is not the 49th but the first. The first African American woman, the first Asian American woman, The first woman, to hold the office of the vice presidency in our nation's history,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the inauguration was a breath of fresh air for the country.“The inauguration of Joe Biden as president, Kamala Harris as vice president of the United States, with all of the newness that that presented, first woman, first African-American woman, first Asian-American woman, the best. Not just about demography, but about quality of leadership. So exciting,” Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-hit-the-ground-running-kamala-harris-101611291113266.html

It has yet to grant doses for the vaccination of warehouse employees, such as Amazon's.The company employs more than 800,000 people in the country and more than 19,000 US workers at Amazon had contracted the virus as of September, underscoring the vaccine's importance in keeping its staff safe and warehouses operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazons-pop-up-covid-19-vaccine-clinic-to-open-soon-in-its-seattle-headquarters-101611289924739.html
22-01-2021||World||Exercise does not undo ill effects of being fat on heart health: Report||Physical activity does not undo the negative effects of excess body weight on heart health, suggest the findings of a large study.The study was published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)."One cannot be 'fat but healthy'," said study author Dr Alejandro Lucia of the European University, Madrid, Spain. "This was the first nationwide analysis to show that being regularly active is not likely to eliminate the detrimental health effects of excess body fat. Our findings refute the notion that a physically active lifestyle can completely negate the deleterious effects of overweight and obesity."There is some evidence that fitness might mitigate the negative effects of excess body weight on heart health. It has been suggested that in adults and children, being "fat but fit" might be associated with similar cardiovascular health to being "thin but unfit". Dr. Lucia said: "This has led to controversial proposals for health policies to prioritise physical activity and fitness above weight loss. Our study sought to clarify the links between activity, body weight, and heart health."The study used data from 527,662 working adults insured by a large occupational risk prevention company in Spain. The average age of participants was 42 years and 32% were women.Participants were categorised as normal weight (body mass index [BMI] 20.0-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), or obese (BMI 30.0 kg/m2 or above). Additionally, they were grouped by activity level: 1) regularly active, defined as doing the minimum recommended for adults by the World Health Organization2 (WHO); 2) insufficiently active (some moderate to vigorous physical activity every week but less than the WHO minimum); 3) inactive (no exercise). Cardiovascular health was determined according to three major risk factors for heart attack and stroke, namely diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.Approximately 42% of participants were normal weight, 41% were overweight, and 18% were obese. The majority were inactive (63.5%), while 12.3% were insufficiently active, and 24.2% were regularly active. Some 30% had high cholesterol, 15% had high blood pressure, and 3% had diabetes.The researchers investigated the associations between each BMI and activity group and the three risk factors. At all BMI levels, any activity (whether it met the WHO minimum or not) was linked with a lower likelihood of diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol compared to no exercise at all. Dr. Lucia said: "This tells us that everyone, irrespective of their body weight, should be physically active to safeguard their health."At all weights, the odds of diabetes and hypertension decreased as physical activity rose. "More activity is better, so walking 30 minutes per day is better than walking 15 minutes a day," he said.However, overweight and obese participants were at greater cardiovascular risk than their peers with normal weight, irrespective of activity levels. As an example, compared to inactive normal-weight individuals, active obese people were approximately twice as likely to have high cholesterol, four times more likely to have diabetes, and five times more likely to have high blood pressure. Dr. Lucia said: "Exercise does not seem to compensate for the negative effects of excess weight. This finding was also observed overall in both men and women when they were analysed separately."He concluded: "Fighting obesity and inactivity is equally important; it should be a joint battle. Weight loss should remain a primary target for health policies together with promoting active lifestyles."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exercise-does-not-undo-ill-effects-of-being-fat-on-heart-health-report-101611287348748.html
22-01-2021||World||Facebook's oversight board to decide on Trump ban||Facebook Inc said on Thursday it was referring its decision to indefinitely suspend the accounts of former US President Donald Trump to its independent oversight board.Trump will remain suspended while the board, a recently created body that can overrule the company's decisions on content, reviews the decision.Facebook blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 storming of the US Capitol by the former president's supporters."I'm very confident of our case," Facebook's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, told Reuters. "I'm very confident that any reasonable person looking at the circumstances in which we took that decision and looking at our existing policies will agree.""But of course this is a decision which has had reverberations around the world," he added. It is the first time the company has blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state.Facebook did not ask for an expedited review so the board, which said on Thursday it had accepted the case, will have a maximum of 90 days to make a ruling and for Facebook to act on it. An Oversight Board spokesman said it would likely be sooner than that.The administrators of Trump's Facebook page will have the option to submit a written statement challenging Facebook's decision.Facebook had also asked the board to provide recommendations on when political leaders can or should be blocked. Facebook does not have to act on this recommendation, unlike the board's case decision which is meant to be binding.The oversight board, which currently has 20 members, was created by Facebook in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content."That's why we're here, to not leave these decisions to the leadership of Facebook but actually use the Oversight Board to look at this in a principled way," said Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a board co-chair and the former Danish prime minister.The board, which has been criticized for its delayed start and limited remit, has not yet ruled on its first batch of cases.Facebook said when it suspended Trump that the block would last at least until the end of Trump's presidential term and perhaps indefinitely. Trump's term expired on Wednesday when Joe Biden was sworn in as president.Twitter Inc has suspended Trump permanently.Crystal-clear linkTrump was not made aware in advance of Facebook's decision to suspend him indefinitely, Clegg said."Whilst it was a controversial decision because he was the president of the United States, it actually wasn't a particularly complicated one to take," he said, adding he felt there was a "crystal-clear link" between the words of Trump and the actions of people at the Capitol.Facebook and other social media companies have come under fire for the proliferation of violent rhetoric and election misinformation on their platforms, including by Trump and his allies. That criticism only increased around the unrest at the Capitol, which was also incited and organized on social platforms.Asked if Facebook bears partial responsibility for the actions that led the storming of the Capitol, Clegg said: "I accept there will always be people who say we knew this was going to happen. Dare I say it, I think it's never quite as straightforward as that."He said he did not expect other major policy changes as a consequence of recent events."I'm ... keen not to raise expectations that because of one event we will therefore make very significant course corrections which then have to apply, because we're a global company with global standards, to the rest of the world as well," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebooks-oversight-board-to-decide-on-trump-ban-101611287996929.html
22-01-2021||World||Google threatens to block its search engine in Australia over media law||Google threatened Friday to block Australians from using its search service unless the government changed landmark legislation to make the internet giant pay news outlets for their content.Google Australia managing director Mel Silva warned a Senate committee in Canberra that the world-first media law was "unworkable" and would undermine the functioning of the internet."If this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia," Silva said, the first time the company has made such a threat after months of difficult negotiations over the draft law.The legislation was introduced last year to force Google and Facebook to pay local media organisations to host news content or face millions of dollars in fines, in one of the most aggressive moves globally to check the power of the US tech giants.Under the laws, the firms would be required to compensate Australian media outlets, ranging from Rupert Murdoch's giant News Corp to public broadcasters ABC and SBS, for publishing snippets of their content in search results.The most controversial part of the law would require Google and Facebook to enter mandatory arbitration with media companies if they cannot reach agreement over the value of their content within three months.The arbiter would then choose between the payment proposal put forward by a news outlet and that coming from the tech firm."This provision in the code would set an untenable precedent for our business and the digital economy," Silva said Friday. "It is not compatible with how search engines work or now the internet works."The law would also require the platforms to give the news businesses two weeks' notice of algorithm changes affecting the distribution of their content, and includes punitive clauses to stop the firms from blocking content to avoid payment.Google and Facebook have been backed in their opposition to the law by the US government and internet architects including Tim Berners-Lee.The initiative has been closely watched around the globe, as news media worldwide have suffered in an increasingly digital economy where big tech firms overwhelmingly capture advertising revenue.Efforts to confront the tech firms on behalf of beleaguered news media in Europe have focused mainly on copyright law and have had some limited success.But the Australian law relies on antitrust provisions and would have a more far-reaching financial impact on Google and Facebook.'Don't respond to threats'Prime Minister Scott Morrison, whose conservative government has heeded demands by the country's biggest news organisations to crack down on the tech firms, responded sharply to the threat by Google, by far the dominant search engine in the country."Australia makes our rules for things you can do in Australia. That's done in our parliament," Morrison said. "People who want to work with that in Australia, you're very welcome, but we don't respond to threats."At Friday's hearing, Facebook similarly labelled the code "unworkable" in its current form and said it would cause the social media platform to stop publishing Australian news."The great majority of people who are using Facebook would continue to be able to do so, but we would no longer be able to provide news," Facebook's Simon Milner told the hearing.Both companies stressed that they were willing to pay media companies for their content through various direct arrangements, including in products like Facebook News and Google News Showcase.And they proposed a series of amendments to the draft Australian law to avoid a showdown."Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that Google wants to have happen, especially when there is another way forward," Silva said."There is a clear pathway to a fair and workable code, with only slight amendments," she said.The key change demanded by the companies is to drop the mandatory arbitration process in favour of mediated negotiations with individual news organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-threatens-to-block-search-engine-in-australia-over-media-law-101611287478935.html
22-01-2021||World||IS claims Baghdad twin bombing that killed 32, wounded 110||The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a twin suicide bombing that killed 32 people and wounded 110 at a crowded market in central Baghdad on Thursday.It was the deadliest attack on the city in three years, when another suicide bomber targeted the same area.The first attacker drew a crowd at the bustling market in the capital's Tayaran Square by claiming to feel sick, then detonated his explosives belt, the interior ministry said.As more people then flocked to the scene to help the victims, a second suicide bomber set off his explosives.The open-air market, where second-hand clothes are sold at stalls, had been teeming with people after the lifting of nearly a year of Covid-19 restrictions across the country.An AFP photographer at the scene said security forces had cordoned off the area, where blood-soaked clothes were strewn across the muddy streets and paramedics were rushing to take away the casualties.The health ministry said those who lost their lives had died on the scene of the attack, and that most of the wounded had been treated and released from hospital.After midnight, IS posted a claim of responsibility for the attack on its online propaganda channels.Such violence was commonplace in Baghdad during the sectarian bloodletting that followed the US-led invasion of 2003 and later on as IS swept across much of Iraq and also targeted the capital.But with the group's territorial defeat in late 2017, suicide bombings in the city became rare. Baghdad's concrete blast walls were dismantled and checkpoints across the city removed.'Senseless and barbaric'President Barham Saleh led political figures in condemning Thursday's attack, saying the government would "stand firmly against these rogue attempts to destabilise our country".Pope Francis, who hopes to visit Iraq in March, deplored the "senseless act of brutality".The United States, the United Nations and the European Union strongly condemned the attack.US acting secretary of state Daniel Smith said the bombings "were vicious acts of mass murder and a sobering reminder of the terrorism that continues to threaten the lives of innocent Iraqis".UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued an appeal "to the people of Iraq to reject any attempts to spread fear and violence aimed at undermining peace, stability and unity."The EU called the attack "senseless and barbaric" and reiterated its "full support to the Iraqi authorities in the fight against extremism and terrorism."The UN's Iraq mission offered condolences to the victims and said: "Such a despicable act will not weaken Iraq's march towards stability and prosperity."Iran also denounced the attack, with foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh saying his government was ready to assist Iraq "in the struggle against terrorism and extremism".The attack, he said, was meant "to disrupt the peace and stability of Iraq and to provide a pretext for foreigners to maintain their presence there".Elections loomingThe attack comes as Iraqis prepare for an election, events often preceded by bombings and assassinations.The 2018 attack took place just a few months before Iraq's last round of parliamentary elections.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi had originally set this year's general election for June, nearly a year ahead of schedule, in response to widespread protests in 2019.But authorities are in talks over rescheduling them to October, to give electoral authorities more time to register voters and new parties.The IS seized a third of Iraq in 2014 and was dangerously close to the capital, but a ferocious three-year fight by Iraqi troops pushed them back.Still, the group's sleeper cells have continued to operate in desert and mountain areas, typically targeting security forces or state infrastructure with low casualty attacks.The US-led coalition that had been supporting Iraq's campaign against IS has significantly drawn down its troop levels over the past year, citing the increased capabilities of Iraqi forces.The United States, which provides the bulk of the force, has 2,500 troops left in Iraq -- down from 5,200 a year ago.They are mainly in charge of training, providing drone surveillance and carrying out air strikes while Iraqi security forces handle security in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-claims-baghdad-twin-bombing-that-killed-32-wounded-110-101611286849650.html
22-01-2021||World||Top Iran leader posts Donald Trump-like golfer image, vows revenge||The Twitter account of Iran's Supreme Leader on Friday carried the image of a golfer resembling former President Donald Trump apparently being targeted by a drone, vowing revenge over the killing of a top Iranian general in a US drone attack.The post carried the text of remarks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in December, in which he said "Revenge is certain", renewing a vow of vengeance ahead of the first anniversary of the killing of top military commander General Qassem Soleimani in the attack in Iraq."Those who ordered the murder of General Soleimani as well as those who carried this out should be punished. This revenge will certainly happen at the right time," Khamenei tweeted on December 16, without naming Trump, who had ordered the strike.Earlier this month, Twitter removed a tweet by Khamenei in which he said US and British-made vaccines were unreliable and may be intended to "contaminate other nations". The platform said the tweet violated its rules against misinformation.There was no apparent immediate action by Twitter over the Persian-language tweet on Friday by Khamenei, Iran's highest authority. Tensions rapidly grew between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump exited a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to curb Tehran's nuclear programme. Washington reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.Iran called for action and "not just words" shortly after Joe Biden was sworn in as US president on Wednesday. Biden has said Washington will rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran resumes strict compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-iran-leader-posts-donald-trump-like-golfer-image-vows-revenge-101611286634145.html
22-01-2021||World||Pak risks FATF blacklisting as it continues to finance terrorism: Report||Pakistan might be pushed into the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) 'black list' next month as it continues to finance and tolerate terrorist organisations, Greek City Times reported.Terrorist organisations, such as Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), continue to operate with impunity in Pakistan.The FATF blacklist is a list of countries that the intra-governmental organisation considers non-cooperative in the global effort to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.The global watchdog will consider Pakistan 'greylist' status, meant for countries "under increased monitoring" during a meeting next month. The country was placed on the grey-list in 2018.FATF President Marcus Pleyer said during October's review meeting in 2020 that there were "very serious deficiencies" in Pakistan's efforts to counter terrorist financing and gave the country until the February 19-21 Plenary to resolve these issues as they cannot wait "forever", Greek City Times reported."As long as we see that the country is progressing with the action items, and we have seen progress with Pakistan, we give them a chance to repair the outstanding issues, but we do not do this forever," Pleyer said.Although Pakistan is only on a grey list, it risks being pushed into the blacklist if it does not fulfill its commitments to curb terrorism financing, and even if it does fulfill its obligations, FATF will remain suspicious and an on-sight inspection will take place, the Greek city Times reported."After that on-site visit, the next plenary will then decide whether Pakistan has indeed fully and effectively completed the action plan and then there is a decision on whether Pakistan would leave the grey list or not," the FATF chief said.The Greek City Times further highlighted several instances proving Pakistan's support to terrorism.A video of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's (JuD) Central Leader, Convener Tehreek Hurmat-e-Rasool, and Chief Editor of 'Weekly Jarrar', Amir Hamza, emerged of them addressing the "Tahaffuz Hurmat-e-Rasool Conference" (Conference of Protection of the Sanctity of Prophet Muhammad) at Muridke in Punjab on October 29, 2020.In his address, Hamza praised the Chechen teenager that beheaded school teacher Samuel Paty in France in October last year.This was because Paty showed a cartoon depiction of Muhammad, the founder of Islam.In October, the FATF decided that Pakistan will continue to be on its greylist and asked it to continue to work on implementing an action plan to address its strategic deficiencies including demonstrating that its law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terrorist financing activity and demonstrating that prosecutions result in effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.Pakistan is on the FATF's grey list since June 2018 and the government was given a final warning in February 2020 to complete the 27 action points by June in the same year.The FATF extended the June deadline to September due to the spread of coronavirus that disrupted the FATF plenary meetings.Pakistan is facing the difficult task of clearing its name from the FATF grey list. As things stand, Islamabad is finding it difficult to shield terror perpetrators and implement the FATF action plan at the same time.In recent weeks, Pakistan has tried to paint a picture that it started the reforms, including the passing of some Bills to prevent blacklisting by the FATF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-risks-fatf-blacklisting-as-it-continues-to-finance-terrorism-report-101611282126757.html
22-01-2021||World||Joe Biden has no plans to call Donald Trump: White House||US President Joe Biden has no plans to call his predecessor Donald Trump, the White House has said.“There's no call planned,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.She was responding to questions on the remarks made by Biden a day earlier when he said that Trump has left him a "very generous" letter in the Oval Office, and he plans to talk to him.Trump did not attend his inauguration, a rare for an outgoing president.“What he was conveying is that he didn't want to release a private note without having agreement from the former president. But I wouldn't say he's seeking it through a phone call, he was just trying to be respectful in that moment of a private letter that was sent,” Psaki said.It is customary for outgoing presidents to write their successors a letter and leave it for them on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.However, given that the former president broke several of the past traditions, including skipping Biden's inauguration ceremony and never formally congratulated him on his election win, it was unclear until Wednesday whether Trump would maintain the tradition of outgoing presidents leaving notes for their successors."The president wrote a very generous letter. Because it was private, I will not talk about it until I talk to him. But it was generous," Biden had told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-has-no-plans-to-call-donald-trump-white-house-101611282958984.html

And when I say wartime, people look at me like wartime? Well, as I said last night, 4,00,000 Americans have died. That's more than World War II... this is a wartime undertaking,” he said.The death toll will likely top 5,00,000 next month, he said, adding that the cases will continue to mount."We didn't get into this mess overnight and it's going to take months for us to turn things around but let me be equally clear we will get through this, we will defeat this pandemic, and to a nation waiting for action, let me be the clearest on this point, help is on the way,” he said.Unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat the pandemic, Biden said this plan reflects the ideas he set forward during the campaign and they have been further refined over the last three months.The national strategy is comprehensive and detailed, and is based on science and truth not politics and denial, he said.Biden said the plan starts with mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign to meet the goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days in office.“We are on day one. This will be one of the greatest operational challenges our nation has ever undertaken, and I am committed to getting it done; we're committed to getting it done. We will move heaven and earth to get more people vaccinated for free and create more places for them to get vaccinated to mobilise more medical teams to get shots in people's arms and to increase vaccine supply and get it out the door as fast as possible,” he said.Biden said that he has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to start standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centres. The goal is to stand up 100 centres within the next month, he said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will launch the federal pharmacy programme to make vaccines available to communities beginning early February.“We will also task the Department of Health and Human Services to prepare and expand the pool of medical professionals who can administer the vaccine, and ensure that we have enough vaccinators to meet the nation's needs and quickly,” he said.Biden also signed an executive action to use the Defense Production Act and all other available authorities to direct all federal agencies and private industry to accelerate the making of everything that's needed to protect, test, vaccinate, and take care of people.Biden said that he, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the entire administration will always be honest and transparent with Americans about both the good news and the bad.“We will level with you when we make a mistake. We'll straight up say what happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-launches-100-days-mask-challenge-makes-quarantine-mandatory-for-people-entering-us-101611281160128.html
22-01-2021||World||McConnell seeks to push Donald Trump impeachment trial to February||Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is proposing to push back the start of Donald Trump's impeachment trial to February to give the former president time to prepare and review his case.House Democrats who voted to impeach Trump last week for inciting the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot have signaled they want to move quickly to trial as President Joe Biden begins his term, saying a full reckoning is necessary before the country — and the Congress — can move on.But McConnell in a statement Thursday evening suggested a more expansive timeline that would see the House transmit the article of impeachment next week, on Jan. 28, launching the trial's first phase. After that, the Senate would give the president's defense team and House prosecutors two weeks to file briefs. Arguments in the trial would likely begin in mid-February.“Senate Republicans are strongly united behind the principle that the institution of the Senate, the office of the presidency, and former President Trump himself all deserve a full and fair process that respects his rights and the serious factual, legal, and constitutional questions at stake,” especially given the unprecedented speed of the House process, McConnell said.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is reviewing the plan and will discuss it with McConnell, a spokesperson said. The two leaders are also negotiating how the new 50-50 Senate will work and how they will balance other priorities.A trial delay could appeal to some Democrats, as it would give the Senate more time to confirm Biden's Cabinet nominees and debate a new round of coronavirus relief. Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a key ally of the president's, told CNN that Democrats would consider a delay “if we are making progress on confirming the very talented, seasoned and diverse team that President Joe Biden has nominated.”The ultimate power over timing rests with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who can trigger the start of the trial at any point by sending to the Senate the charge of incitement of an insurrection. The California Democrat has not yet said when she will do that.“It will be soon. I don’t think it will be long, but we must do it,” Pelosi said Thursday. She said Trump doesn’t deserve a “get-out-of-jail card” just because he has left office and Biden and others are calling for national unity.Facing his second impeachment trial in two years, Trump began to assemble his defense team by hiring attorney Butch Bowers to represent him, according to an adviser. Bowers previously served as counsel to former South Carolina Govs. Nikki Haley and Mark Sanford.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina helped Trump find Bowers after members of his past legal teams indicated they did not plan to join the new effort. Trump is at a disadvantage compared to his first trial, in which he had the full resources of the White House counsel's office to defend him.Pelosi's nine impeachment managers, who will be prosecuting the House case, have been regularly meeting to discuss strategy. Pelosi said she would talk to them “in the next few days” about when the Senate might be ready for a trial.Shortly before the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump told thousands of his supporters at a rally near the White House to “fight like hell” against the election results that Congress was certifying. A mob marched down to the Capitol and rushed in, interrupting the count. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the mayhem, and the House impeached Trump a week later, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats in support.Pelosi said it would be “harmful to unity” to forget that “people died here on Jan. 6, the attempt to undermine our election, to undermine our democracy, to dishonor our Constitution.”Trump was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate at his first impeachment trial. The White House legal team, aided by Trump's personal lawyers, aggressively fought the House charges that he had encouraged the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. This time around, Pelosi noted, the House is not seeking to convict the president over private conversations but for a very public insurrection that they themselves experienced and that played out on live television.“This year, the whole world bore witness to the president’s incitement,” Pelosi said.Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said it was still too early to know how long a trial would take or if Democrats would want to call witnesses. But he said, “You don’t need to tell us what was going on with the mob scene we were rushing down the staircase to escape.”McConnell, who said this week that Trump “provoked” his supporters before the riot, has not said how he will vote. He told his GOP colleagues that it will be a vote of conscience.Democrats would need the support of at least 17 Republicans to convict Trump, a high bar. While a handful of Senate Republicans have indicated they are open to conviction, most have said they believe a trial will be divisive and questioned the legality of trying a president after he has left office.Graham said that if he were Trump’s lawyer, he would focus on that argument and on the merits of the case — and whether it was “incitement” under the law.“I guess the public record is your television screen,” Graham said. “So, I don’t see why this would take a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcconnell-seeks-to-push-donald-trump-impeachment-trial-to-february-101611277827523.html

We look forward to our day in court to right this wrong,” Doyle said in a statement.Gokal was fired after an internal investigation by the health department.Authorities said Gokal disregarded rules related to punctured vaccine vials with viable doses that direct employees to ensure that such doses are brought back to the main office so they can be administered to at-risk front-line workers, including health care employees and police officers, and to vulnerable populations.The mishandling of vaccine can result in the loss of government funding to the county, according to the health department.Gokal is facing a misdemeanor charge of theft by a public servant. If convicted, he faces up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.In Wisconsin, a pharmacist was arrested in December after being accused of ruining 57 vials of the Moderna vaccine because he allegedly believed the vaccine would mutate recipients’ DNA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-doc-steals-damaged-vial-of-covid-19-vaccine-administers-to-friends-family-official-101611277351953.html

Not even the Pakistani High Commissioner in Ottawa has been called into the foreign ministry for an explication on this. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," he said, while speaking on reactions of Karima's death.He added, "Pakistani intelligence has taken a leaf from Iranian intelligence in targetting their own dissidents abroad... Silence on Ottawa's part is simply not an option. Why has he not been prepared to speak on Pakistan? What is happening in Pakistan's Balochistan is atrocious."Fatah, who is also leading the Friends For Karima Baloch committee, called for Karima's death to not be considered a suicide stating that "there is no reason to" do so."There was no reason for her to commit suicide. She had her whole life ahead of her," he said.Karima, a prominent Baloch voice, went missing last Sunday and her body was found a day later in Toronto.The Baloch activists' death has also sparked protests across Europe and North America as the Baloch diaspora took to the streets in Toronto, Berlin and Netherlands calling on the Canadian government to investigate.Baloch had campaigned vigorously against the disappearances and human rights violations in the troubled Balochistan province of Pakistan.Requesting the United Nations to intervene, Baloch Human Rights Council (BHRC) in a letter has said Pakistan has "responded violently to the genuine demands of the Baloch people".In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Naseer Dashti, BHRC executive president, wrote, "Her family and political friends believe that Pakistani secret agencies are involved in the death of Karima Mehrab and have rejected the initial report of the Toronto police."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/karima-baloch-death-scholars-urge-canada-to-reconsider-diplomatic-relations-101611275538351.html
22-01-2021||World||US Covid-19 deaths top its World War II fatalities||America’s coronavirus deaths surpassed the country’s troop fatalities in World War II as cases surged past 96 million worldwide, fuelled by the emergence of new variants including one that was first detected in Britain.“We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We’re entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus,” US President Joe Biden said at his inauguration. A Johns Hopkins University tracker on Wednesday showed that 405,400 people have died from the disease in the US, more than the 405,399 total US combat and non-combat deaths in WWII.Meanwhile, Amazon has offered its logistics to help with the Biden administration’s aim to inoculate 100mn Americans with Covid vaccine in 100 days.China’s commercial hub of Shanghai reported its first locally transmitted cases in two months on Thursday. China plans to impose strict testing requirements during the Lunar New Year holiday season, when millions of people travel.Russia said it could supply Hungary with its Sputnik V vaccine from next month, after Budapest gave initial approval to the shot, which was also registered for domestic use on Thursday by the UAE. Russia is seeking international endorsement for Sputnik V, named after the satellite that triggered the Cold War space race, and is building up its global customer base.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-deaths-top-its-world-war-ii-fatalities-101611274090279.html
22-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s US to bolster coronavirus fight||The US will resume funding for the World Health Organization (WHO) and join its COVAX programme that aims to share coronavirus vaccines fairly around the world, American President Joe Biden’s top adviser on the pandemic, Dr Anthony Fauci, said on Thursday.“I am honoured to announce that the United States will remain a member” of the WHO, Fauci told a virtual meeting of the world body. This was the first public statement by a member of Biden’s administration to an international audience - and a sign of the priority that the new president has made of fighting Covid-19 both at home and with global partners.Fauci said Biden will issue a directive on Thursday that shows US intention to join the COVAX effort to deploy vaccines to people in need in rich and poor countries. Under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, the US had been a high-profile and the most deep-pocketed holdout from the COVAX programme.The WHO chief and others welcomed the US announcement. “This is a good day for the WHO and a good day for global health,” director-general Tedros Adhanom said. “The role of the United States, its role, global role, is very, very crucial.”China on Thursday congratulated Biden on becoming the US president and welcomed his decisions to rejoin the WHO as well as the Paris Agreement on the climate crisis.“With cooperation from both sides, the better angels in China-US relations will beat the evil forces,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a ministry briefing on Thursday.Also, China sanctioned several members of the bygone Trump administration, including former secretary of state Mike Pompeo. The sanctions, announced as Biden was taking oath on Wednesday, was in response to punitive measures recently announced by Pompeo.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis and Agenci||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-us-to-bolster-coronavirus-fight-101611273644631.html

22-01-2021||World||Pfizer cuts Covid-19 vaccine deliveries by as much as half to some EU countries||Pfizer has slashed in half the volume of Covid-19 vaccines it will deliver to some EU countries this week, government officials said on Thursday, as frustration over the US drugmaker's unexpected cut in supplies grows.Romania got only 50% of its planned volume for this week, the other half being allocated gradually by the end of March, with deliveries returning to normal starting next week, deputy health minister Andrei Baciu told Reuters.It was a similar situation in Poland which on Monday received 176,000 doses, a drop of around 50% from what was expected, authorities said.The Czech government was bracing for the disruption to last weeks, slowing its vaccination campaign just as second doses get under way."We have to expect that there will be a reduction in the number of open vaccination appointments in the following three weeks," Health Minister Jan Blatny told reporters, with Pfizer deliveries falling by about 15% this week and as much as 30% for the following two weeks.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have declined to comment on the cuts beyond their statement last week, which announced cuts to deliveries as they ramp up manufacturing in Europe.Some countries reckon they can handle it. Norway has an emergency stockpile and will continue administering doses as planned, the government's public health body said.The US drugmaker has told Bulgaria and Poland it will replace missing doses, top officials said.But Denmark's Serum Institute said its 50% loss of shots this week would lead to a 10% shortfall for the first quarter.Italy, meanwhile, is threatening legal action against Pfizer, with COVID-19 special commissioner Domenico Arcuri saying on Thursday that the country has been told to expect a 20% cut next week after reducing this week's supply by almost 30%UNDERMINING EFFORTSWith governments across the region still reeling from the surprise cuts, officials say the reductions are undermining their efforts to inoculate their citizens and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 2 million people.Adding to the upheaval are worries about supplies of special syringes needed to extract six doses from each vial of Pfizer's shot.Europe's disease surveillance agency warned on Thursday that three variants of the coronavirus that emerged in Britain, South Africa and Brazil will lead to more Covid-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths.In Hungary, where the authorities gave the go ahead for the use of Britain's AstraZeneca and Russia's Sputnik V vaccines ahead of the EU drug regulator, a senior official called on Brussels to try and ensure deliveries from Pfizer and other vaccine makers would stick to schedule."We would be happy if the (European) Commission could take steps as soon as possible to ensure that Pfizer and other manufacturers would change deliveries," Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said.The problem has spread to countries outside the trading bloc too - Canada is facing delays as is Switzerland, where the mountain canton of Grisons got only 1,000 shots from Pfizer this week, far short of the 3,000 it had been anticipating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-cuts-covid-19-vaccine-deliveries-by-as-much-as-half-to-some-eu-countries-101611272896308.html
22-01-2021||World||US President Joe Biden signs burst of virus orders, vows 'Help is on the way'||With a burst of executive orders, President Joe Biden served notice Thursday that America's war on COVID-19 is under new command, promising an anxious nation progress to reduce infections and lift the siege it has endured for nearly a year.At the same time, he tried to manage expectations in his second day in office, saying despite the best intentions “we're going to face setbacks.” He brushed off a reporter's question on whether his goal of 100 million coronavirus shots in 100 days should be more ambitious, a point pressed by some public health experts.The 10 orders signed by Biden are aimed at jump starting his national COVID-19 strategy to increase vaccinations and testing, lay the groundwork for reopening schools and businesses, and immediately increase the use of masks — including a requirement that Americans mask up for travel. One directive calls for addressing health care inequities in minority communities hard hit by the virus.“We didn’t get into this mess overnight, and it will take months to turn this around,” Biden said at the White House. U.S. deaths have have surged past 400,000, and he noted projections that they could reach 500,000 in a month.But then, looking directly into the TV camera, Biden declared: "To a nation waiting for action, let me be clear on this point: Help is on the way.”The new president has vowed to take far more aggressive measures to contain the virus than his predecessor, starting with stringent adherence to public health guidance. A key difference is that under Biden, the federal government is assuming full responsibility for the COVID response. And instead of delegating major tasks to states, he is offering to help them with technical backup and federal money.He faces steep obstacles, with the virus actively spreading in most states, vaccine shortages, slow progress on distribution and political uncertainty over whether congressional Republicans will help him pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief and COVID response package.Adding to the challenges are virus mutations, particularly one that has emerged in South Africa, that may make vaccines somewhat less effective. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters at the White House briefing that “we are paying very close attention to it.” Biden's plan includes an expansion of research capabilities to map out the genetic structure of new variants.On Thursday a group influential with Republican office holders lent its support to the president's strategy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said, “We support the new administration’s focus on removing roadblocks to vaccinations and reopening schools, both of which are important steps to accelerating a broad-based economic recovery for all Americans.”Biden officials have said they've been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the Trump administration during the transition. They say they don’t have a complete understanding of their predecessors’ actions on vaccine distribution. And they face a litany of complaints from states that say they are not getting enough vaccine even as they are being asked to vaccinate more categories of people.Biden's mask order for travel applies to airports and planes, ships, intercity buses, trains and public transportation. Travelers from abroad must furnish a negative COVID-19 test before departing for the U.S. and must quarantine upon arrival. Biden has already mandated masks on federal property.Although airlines, Amtrak and other transport providers now require masks, Biden's order makes it a federal mandate, leaving little wiggle room for passengers tempted to argue about their rights. The action was applauded by airline unions and supported by a major industry trade group.It marks a sharp break with the culture of President Donald Trump's administration, under which masks were optional, and Trump made a point of going maskless and hosting big gatherings of like-minded supporters. Science has shown that masks, properly worn, cut down on coronavirus transmission.Biden said his administration's coronavirus decisions would be based on science, not politics.Biden is seeking to expand testing and vaccine availability, with the goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days in office. But some independent experts say his administration should strive for two or three times that number. Even with the slow pace of vaccinations, the U.S. is already closing in on 1 million shots a day.“It's a disappointingly low bar,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician.Asked about that at the White House on Thursday, Biden told a reporter: “When I announced it, you all said it’s not possible. Come on, give me a break, man.”Fauci told reporters the U.S. could return to “a degree of normality” by the fall if the vaccination campaign goes well. Achieving widespread or “herd” immunity would require vaccinating as many as 280 million people.Biden has directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin setting up vaccination centers, aiming to have 100 up and running in a month. He's ordering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin a program to make vaccines available through local pharmacies starting next month, building on a plan devised by the Trump administration. And he's launching an effort to train more people to administer shots.Biden has set a goal of having most K-8 schools reopen in his first 100 days, and he's ordering the departments of Education and Health and Human Services to provide clear guidance for reopening them safely. States would also be able to tap FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to help get schools back open.Getting schools and child care going will help ease the drag on the U.S. economy, making it easier for parents to return to their jobs and for restaurants to find lunch-time customers.But administration officials stressed that reopening schools safely depends on increased testing.Biden is giving government agencies a green light to use the Cold War-era Defense Production Act. It allows the government to direct private industry to produce supplies needed in times of national emergency. In this case it could be anything from swabs, to masks, to certain chemicals.“We do not have nearly enough testing capacity in this country,” said White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients.The Biden plan estimates that a national vaccination strategy with expanded testing requires $160 billion, and he wants an additional $170 billion to aid the reopening of schools and universities.As part of his strategy, Biden ordered establishment of a Health Equity Task Force to ensure that minority and underserved communities are not left out of the government's response. Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans have borne a heavy burden of death and disease from the virus. Surveys have shown vaccine hesitancy is higher among African Americans, a problem the administration plans to address through an education campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-signs-burst-of-virus-orders-vows-help-is-on-the-way-101611269396118.html
22-01-2021||World||Donald Trump returns to a business empire ravaged by pandemic||Donald Trump is returning to a family business ravaged by pandemic shutdowns and restrictions, with revenue plunging more than 40% at his Doral golf property, his Washington hotel and both his Scottish resorts over the past year.Trump's 2020 financial disclosure released as he left office this week was just the latest bad news for his financial empire after banks, real estate brokerages and golf organizations announced they were cutting ties with his company following the storming of the Capitol this month by his political supporters.The disclosure showed sizable debt facing the company of more than $300 million, much of it coming due in the next four years, and a major bright spot: Revenue at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, his new post-presidency home, rose by a few million dollars.Eric Trump, who with Donald Trump Jr. has run the Trump Organization the past four years, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday that the disclosure doesn't tell the whole story, calling the debt “negligible” and the outlook for the company bright, especially at its golf resorts and courses.“The golf business has never been stronger. We took in hundreds and hundreds of new members,” he said, adding that profits were in the “tens of millions.”Hinting at possible new ventures in the post-presidency era, Eric Trump raised the prospect of a flurry of new licensing deals in which the Trump name is put on a product or building for a fee, a business that has generated tens of millions for the company in the past.“The opportunities are endless,” he said, declining to give details.The disclosure report filed each year with federal ethics officials shows only revenue figures, not profits, but the hit to Trump's business appeared widespread.The National Doral Golf Club outside of Miami, his biggest money maker among the family's golf properties, took in $44.2 million in revenue, a drop of $33 million from 2019. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, once buzzing with lobbyists and diplomats before operations were cut back last year, generated just $15.1 million in revenue, down more than 60% from the year before.Trump's Turnberry club in Scotland took in less than $10 million, down more than 60%. Revenue at the family's golf club in Aberdeen dropped by roughly the same proportion.The Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach club where Trump arrived Wednesday, saw revenue rise 10% to $24.2 million. Revenue at a golf club near that club and one in Charlotte, North Carolina, also rose, up about 5 percent to $13 million each.In total, Trump's vast holding of hotels, resorts, office buildings, licensing deals and other assets took in at least $278 million for 2020 and the first few weeks of the new year, down more than a third from a minimum of about $450 million in 2019.The financial blow from former clients and business partners cutting ties to Trump is unclear, but it could be sizable. The PGA of America canceled a championship tournament at Trump’s Bedminster club in New Jersey, and several banks said they would no longer lend to the company, making it more difficult to roll over its debt with new loans.In addition, New York City said it would be canceling various contracts with the company, including those running skating rinks and a golf club in the Bronx. Revenue at that course, the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, fell 20% last year to $6.4 million.Eric Trump dismissed the backlash, saying parts of the business that get less attention, such as its commercial buildings, are thriving.“I’ve signed 125,000 square feet of office space in the fourth quarter alone,” he said, referring to new leases. “We hit it out of the park.”The disclosure report was unclear on that claim, though the revenue at four of the company's most important commercial buildings — Trump Tower on New York’s Fifth Avenue, a Wall Street building, and two towers owned with real estate giant Vornado -- seemed to have held up during the pandemic.The report, which gives some figures in broad ranges and vague “more than” estimates, said the four took in over $20 million in total last year, unchanged from a year earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-returns-to-a-business-empire-ravaged-by-pandemic-101611269149602.html

22-01-2021||India||Covaxin well-tolerated: Phase 1 peer-review||New DelhiBharat Biotech Covaxin was well tolerated with no vaccine-related serious adverse events in a small group of volunteers, according to a peer review of the company’s phase 1 clinical trials published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases on Friday.“…BBV152(Covaxin) led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses… BBV152 induced binding and neutralising antibody responses that were similar to those induced by other SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine candidates,” the study said, in line with the data preprint data released by the company.Phase 1 clinical trials are mostly used to test safety of a vaccine and the effects of various doses and combinations. The company found that there was no significant difference in the highest dose it tested as compared to the lowest, making the case for the higher dose to be used. The overall incidence of solicited local and systemic adverse events in this study was 14–21%. The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site, followed by headache, fatigue, and fever. Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 participants were randomized equally to receive three vaccine formulations in groups of 100 each (doses were as 3ug with Algel-IMDG, 6ug with Algel-IMDG or 6ug with Algel) while the control group had 75 participants. Algel and Algel-IMDG refer to different kinds of adjuvants -- additives that are designed to enhance immune response. The whole-virion inactivated virus vaccine has been made in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The vaccine is still in phase 3 trials -- where it is being tested in over 25,000 people for safety and efficacy -- but has been approved for emergency use. The other vaccine, Covishield, has safety and efficacy data from phase III trials.Hundreds of thousands of people have already received it, and experts believe the controversy around Covaxin still not clearing adequate levels in trials may be contributing to hesitancy. On Thursday, centres administering Covishield showed over 75% turnout while in those with Covaxin, less than 30% turned up.“13,000 volunteers have been successfully administered the 2nd dose in the phase 3 clinical trials of Covaxin. My heartfelt thanks to all of them for their pro-vaccine public health volunteerism,” said Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech International Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-well-tolerated-phase-1-peerreview-101611339166084.html
22-01-2021||India||Cong wants JPC to probe ‘security breach’||New Delhi: The Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest executive body, on Friday stepped up its attack on the chat transcripts between journalist Arnab Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into what it called a breach of national security. The transcripts between the editor-in-chief of Republic TV and the ex-CEO of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (Barc) were a part of a Mumbai Police probe into an alleged television ratings scam. The portions of the chat referred by the Congress pertain to the 2019 Pulwama attack and India’s retaliation.“The CWC demands a timebound investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee to enquire into the breach of national security, violations of the Official Secrets Act and the role of the persons involved. Ultimately, those who are guilty of treasonous behaviour must be brought before the law and punished,” the CWC resolution said.CWC met on Friday to discuss dates for organisational polls, the farm protests and the chat leak. Its resolution, read out to the media by general secretaries Randeep Surjewala and KC Venugopal, said that CWC expresses its “grave concern at recent revelations “ exposing the “sordid conversations that have undoubtedly compromised national security”.The Congress maintained that people in the “highest echelons of government” were involved in the breach, raising secrecy concerns of “vital and sensitive military operations”.“The revelations also point to inexcusable and deliberate subversion of government structures, scandalous and extraneous influence over Government policies, and a vicious attack on the independence of the judiciary. The shameful compromise of the Modi Government with non-government players has been exposed,” it said. In her opening speech, too, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said, “the silence from the government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed”.Reacting to the CWC’s demand, the Republic TV management reiterated their statement on the matter issued on January 19. The statement by Goswami had said, “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime...It is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime. It was publicly available information and thousands of journalists reported, wrote, broadcast and analysed in the same direction after Pulwama. There are thousands of articles from that time suggesting a hard and tough response from the India Forces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-wants-jpc-to-probe-security-breach-101611339106101.html
22-01-2021||India||Local Body elections: Andhra govt, state poll panel at loggerheads||Hyderabad : The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government of Andhra Pradesh and state election commissioner (SEC) Ramesh Kumar on Friday headed for a showdown over the conduct of elections to village councils in the state in February. As Kumar prepared to issue a notification on Saturday for the first phase of the gram panchayat elections, the state government sent a note to the SEC asking for a deferment of the election process pending a Supreme Court directive on the matter. Meanwhile, state government employees, including those from revenue, panchayat raj and the police departments, announced that they would boycott the election process, stating that they cannot risk their lives amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In the morning, the Supreme Court rejected a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government challenging the Thursday’s state high court order giving a green signal to the SEC to go ahead with the local body elections. The apex court said there were flaws in the SLP and asked the government to file a fresh petition by Monday. The elections to as many as 13,371 gram panchayats will be held in four phases – February 5, 9, 13 and 17. Kumar rejected the state government’s appeal and announced that he would go ahead with initiating the election process. He also issued orders suspending two district collectors, a superintendent of police, two DSPs and five circle inspectors. The SEC charged them with failure to prevent irregularities and curb poll violence during the initial phase of elections to block parishad and zilla parishad elections in March 2020, before they were postponed due to the imposition of a lockdown in the country on account of Covid-19. In the afternoon, representatives of several employees’ unions met chief secretary Adityanath Das and submitted a nine-page memorandum, stating that they would not be able to participate in the gram panchayat elections until the Covid-19 vaccination programme was completed. The employees’ joint action committee leader Boppa Raju found fault with the SEC for deciding to hold elections during the vaccination period. “How can vaccination and elections be held simultaneously? We can’t take part in the election process, unless all the employees are given two doses of vaccine,” he said. With the employees refusing to cooperate, Kumar met governor Biswabhushan Harichandan and explained the situation. He asked the Governor to issue directions to the state government to cooperate with the SEC in smooth conduct of the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-body-elections-andhra-govt-state-poll-panel-at-loggerheads-101611338993748.html
22-01-2021||India||Follow my father’s ideology... he’d never, ever give up on idea of India: Mehbooba Mufti||Mehbooba Mufti, 61, was the last chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir before the momentous events of August 5, 2019, when the Centre scrapped the special status and converted the state into two Union territories. A former ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mufti, who heads the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), also spent the maximum time under detention before being freed in October 2020. She spoke to Harinder Baweja on a range of issues. Edited excerpts: How has August 5, 2019, changed you? Are you disturbed, or has it made you more determined?August 5 was a black day in the history of our country. It destroyed the trust that people of Jammu & Kashmir had placed while choosing to be a part of this country. People like me who believed in the Constitution of this country too felt cheated. It was disturbing, and quite humiliating to see our special status robbed. Do you still see yourself as an Indian or only as a Kashmiri -- a sentiment many expressed after the special status was changed?Well, it has been a very difficult and traumatic experience, swinging from one extreme to another. But my politics has revolved around my father’s ideology, and I am sure he would never ever have given up on idea of India. He believed that J&K had to be resolved to restore peace with dignity, without compromising on sovereignty of the country. It has to become a bridge of friendship rather than a battlefield between India and Pakistan. So that vision is more relevant today, and needs to be fulfilled for lasting peace in the region.Have you ever thought of quitting politics or would you be willing to be the chief minister of the UT of J&K?Yes I did think about it but then the thought of giving up on everything that my father held so dear to his heart would be a betrayal of sorts. But my politics is going to be much more than just fighting for power. I will continue my struggle for peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue.After your release, you said you don’t recognise the Indian national flag. Many called it sedition.Unfortunately, a majority of the embedded media chose to distort my statement deliberately. Because J&K’s constitution and flag was snatched unconstitutionally, I said I will wait for it to be restored, and hold both the flags together. Let’s not forget both the Indian and J&K flag derived their legitimacy from the Indian Constitution. If that amounts to sedition, then so be it. Students are called anti-nationals, activists and NGOs as urban Naxalites; Shaheen Bagh protestors as Pakistani; farmers are Khalistani; and we Kashmiri as terrorists. So in any case, dissent or criticism of the ruling party has become anti-national and sedition in today’s India.What message do you derive from the local DDC polls as far as you and your party’s political future is concerned?The message was quite clear that PDP’s strength is its vision and party worker. Despite Delhi engineering a split in our party, our workers continue to work tirelessly to fulfill the party’s vision of peace with dignity. Their hard work paid off, and even though we fought fewer seats, our strike rate was good. So that’s very encouraging.The people of Kashmir are angry with mainstream parties such as the NC and the PDP, and feel that since both have allied with the Centre, particularly the BJP, you are responsible for Aug 5. How much blame are you willing to take?We placed our faith in the Prime Minister of this country and assumed he would carry forward the peace process initiated by (former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee). Assuming that the resolution of larger J&K issue has to come from Delhi, we tried to engage the BJP by aligning with them. Sadly, the BJP views everything through the prism of petty electoral gains, and lacks the vision and resolve to take decisions that will heal and build the country. Instead, it has chosen to take India down a dark and regressive path steeped in division, bigotry, and hatred for minorities. Unfortunately, J&K became a political experimental laboratory.Let’s be candid and honest: did you ally with the BJP because of your father Mufti Saeed, or did you see some political merit in it too?My father had a political vision not only for J&K but also for the country. He put everything at stake, including his credibility, while aligning with the BJP, only with the intention to secure what we already had -- our special status – and to find a peaceful and dignified solution to the Kashmir problem. He was of the firm opinion that the resolution of Kashmir issue would not only end the bloodshed in the state but would also be in the interest of the country nationally as well as internationally. So even though I have never been a great fan of the BJP, I could not walk away from his decision. Will you ever ally with the BJP again? It was my father’s decision for a larger cause, and I honoured it. That’s that and doesn’t go beyond it. Will the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) fight elections collectively going forward?The PAGD was formed for a larger cause and fighting assembly elections separately or together is going to be a collective decision. There are bound to be teething problems as we have been political rivals traditionally. The spirit and larger purpose of this alliance will take time to reach to our grass root workers. Sajjad Lone’s leaving has been a loss too.You had said that there would be no one to hold the Tricolour if Article 370 was touched. How do you explain the lack of protests?Well the way BJP has vandalised the Constitution and are running the country on their party agenda, they themselves have sidelined everything that this country stood for. They used the Tricolor to protest in support of rapists in Kathua. Mainstream parties in J&K held the Tricolor for the last 70 years not out of fear of being called anti-nationals, but out of their conviction. But when you destroy the faith and trust that Kashmiris put in the country, how does holding or not holding the flag matter? They have terrorised and stunned people into silence. All the central agencies such as NIA, ED, CBI etc. are used to threaten people here. Such draconian measures have led to an uneasy and forced sense of calm.Are you in touch, or in occasional conversations with the current government, either directly or through the L-G and the NSA? What do you discuss with them?There hasn’t been much conversation but whenever there is, I tell them to let democracy prevail and allow people to express themselves. You can jail a person, not his ideas or thoughts.When you think of your political future -- what do you envisage?I can’t separate my destiny from that of the people of J&K anymore. We are all in it together, so we either sink or swim. For me, resolution of Kashmir is the most important issue, and it was also my father’s desire to see it resolved in a peaceful and dignified way.Do you fear being arrested again?The Enforcement Directorate has been burrowing through my bank accounts and that of my family. Since they couldn’t find any financial impropriety, they started auditing the expenditure on my father’s mausoleum. Three senior PDP leaders have been arrested for a month now without being served any order for the detention. Our youth president Waheed Parra, too, has been jailed under UAPA on flimsy charges. All this is being done to blackmail me into silence. And frankly, they are capable of anything if they can send NIA summons to an organisation such as the Khalsa Aid which has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-my-father-s-ideology-he-d-never-ever-give-up-on-idea-of-india-mehbooba-mufti-101611338993271.html
22-01-2021||India||PM talks to health workers to dispel fears over vaccines||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sought to set at rest fears and misconceptions over the efficacy and safety of Covid-19 vaccines, and sought to dispel the “vaccine hesitancy” that has kept the turnouts low at inoculation centres. In an interaction with health workers in Varanasi, his Lok Sabha constituency, Modi said the vaccines had been launched after completing all scientific processes of trial and testing. It was only when scientists gave the green signal that the vaccination drive, billed as the world’s biggest, started on January 16, he added.“When doctors and health workers give a clean chit to the vaccine, it sends a very strong message among people about the efficacy of the shots,” he said through a video conference with the health workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic Union health ministry data showed that till 6pm on Friday, there were close to 230,000 more vaccinations were done across the country -- a total comparable to what was seen the day before. But there were also significantly more vaccination sessions on Friday, 6,230 compared to 4,043, implying that turnout had dropped again after a brief increase on Thursday. During each session, 100 people are selected and invited -- on Thursday, almost 57% showed up, but on Friday, this proportion fell to 36%. Modi’s interaction came a day after the government launched a mass awareness campaign to drive home its message that the made-in-India vaccines -- Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India; and Covaxin, developed locally by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International -- were completely safe.The two vaccines received emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator on January 3, clearing the ground for the start of the vaccination drive.Health practitioners who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus or have administered the shots to others took part in Modi’s interaction with Varanasi’s health workers, sharing their first-hand experience.“Really, corona warriors have done a wonderful job,” Modi said in the 30-minute interaction during which he spoke to a government doctor, a lab technician and three nurses deployed at three vaccination centres —the District Women’s Hospital, Pt Deendayal Upadhyay District Hospital and the Haathi community health centre -- in Varanasi. “Our preparation has been such that the vaccine is fast reaching every corner of the country,” Modi said. “And on the world’s biggest need today, we are completely self-reliant. Not just that, India is also helping out many countries with vaccines.”He appealed to doctors, hospitals and vaccinators to accelerate the inoculation of all health workers in Varanasi so that the next phase of the vaccination drive can get underway soon.

22-01-2021||India||BSY reshuffles cabinet to contain dissent||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday caved into demands of dissenting ministers and made changes to his cabinet by redistributing portfolios to calm tempers, barely a day after rebellion broke out within his government.The changes were made less than a day after his government distributed and reshuffled several portfolios to newly inducted ministers who were sworn in on January 13 .The move leaves the 77-year old chief minister vulnerable to more such demands from disgruntled leaders within his two-year old government riven by dissent.J.C.Madhuswamy, who was stripped of minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs was given Haj and Wakf department along with his earlier allotted medical education.“Even I do not know the details as I am in Mysuru and have had no contact with the CM. I will wait a few days before taking any decision,” Madhuswamy said on Friday. He, however, refused to reveal what decision he is likely to take.K.Gopalaiah, a former Janata Dal (Secular) leader who helped Yediyurappa to power along with 16 other legislators, was handed the excise department. Gopalaiah said that he was happy with the newly allotted excise portfolio.N.Nagaraju (M.T.B), one of the several people, who had openly lashed out at the choice of portfolios, was made minister for municipal administration and sugarcane development.However, health and family welfare minister K.Sudhakar remains disenchanted after he was stripped of the medical education portfolio, people aware of developments said.Gopalaiah said that the issue of Sudhakar is something that the CM has to take care of.Sudhakar is one of the several legislators within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Karnataka who hone feelings of neglect in the latest cabinet reshuffle exercise.Several legislators overlooked in the cabinet have also started holding meetings among themselves to decide the next course of action to be heard by the party’s central leadership.Yediyurappa divested from his own kitty and handed over planning, programme monitoring and statistics department to K.C.Narayana Gowda, another dissenting minister.Arvind Limbavali, a legislator who helped secure the support of the turncoats, was given the Kannada and culture portfolio in addition to the forest department, he was allocated on Thursday.Yediyurappa’s fire fighting may have prevented an imminent explosion of dissent but simmering tensions are likely to play out in the near future that could make life more difficult for the chief minister.With elections just two years away, any cracks within the BJP is likely to play to the advantage of the Congress, the principal opposition party in the state.Narendar Pani, political analyst and faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), said that this style of functioning is typical of Yediyurappa who is trying to cultivate a section of legislators and others loyal to him.“He is treating the turncoats as one branch within the party by taking from one and giving it to another. As long as he doesn’t have a major faction developing against him, he should be okay and get his job done,” Pani added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-reshuffles-cabinet-to-contain-dissent-101611338746646.html
22-01-2021||India||CBI books Cambridge Analytica over Facebook data theft||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against Alexander Nix of British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) and Aleksandr Kogan of Global Science Research Limited, UK, for allegedly harvesting personal data of up to 562,000 Indians from Facebook for commercial purposes, officials said on Friday.The move comes after a two-year-long investigation. The CBI enquiry revealed that Kogan, founder and director of Global Science Research, created a Facebook app, “thisisyourdigitallife”; the app was authorised to collect certain specific data of the users for academic and research purposes.The agency said that the app illegally collected additional unauthorised data of users as well as their friends’ network on Facebook; in all, data of 335 users and their network of 562,000 of their friends were compromised. Globally, it is believed that the app compromised the data of 87 million Facebook users. Kogan has been named as accused in the CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered on January 19 and has been charged under sections of criminal conspiracy and the Information Technology Act.Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny sometime around March 2018 when several international media platforms, citing former CA employees, associates and documents, claimed that the company had harvested private information without their consent from the Facebook profiles of 87 million Facebook accounts. The reports said the data may have been used to shape the outcomes of the 2016 US presidential election as well as the 2016 Brexit referendum. Last year, the UK Information Commissioner said CA was not involved in the Brexit vote. Union law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Rajya Sabha in 2018 that the probe will be handed over to the CBI.The anti-corruption agency launched a preliminary enquiry (PE), a precursor to an FIR, against CA in July 2018 on a complaint by the ministry of electronics and information technology.During the enquiry, CBI contacted 335 app users out of which six responded to the agency and were examined during the course of enquiry. “They unanimously stated that they were misled by the app and were not aware of the fact that their personal (data) and (their) friends’ data was harvested. They also said that they would not have used the app if they knew that it would do so,” the CBI FIR added. HT has reviewed a copy of the FIR. Global Science Research, CBI said, entered into a criminal conspiracy with CA in 2014 . “Facebook had collected written certificates from Kogan (Global Science Research) and CA during 2016-17 declaring that all such data obtained by them through the app, thisisyourdigitallife, was accounted for and destroyed. This facts confirms that Global Science harvested data sets and provided the same to CA for commercial purposes,” the CBI FIR stated.The FIR also adds that the agency could not ascertain the veracity of claims by Global Science and CA that they had destroyed the data sets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-cambridge-analytica-over-facebook-data-theft-101611338746078.html

The social media volunteers should write and comment only after cross-checking facts. We must get facts right before making any comment on social media.”He asked the volunteers to refrain from using abusive language. “While replying to even the most provocative comments by opposition workers, we must not use abusive language. We should use courteous language while replying to comments and must not troll anyone on social media.”The BJP chief directed the volunteers to keep on reminding people of the good work done by the state and central governments on social media as public memory was known to be short.“People have short memories so they must be periodically reminded of all the development work of the government. We must also keep reminding them about the mistakes of the opposition parties. Like those who are out on bail in the National Herald case are trying to look honest. Those who are accused in the 2-G spectrum case, Commonwealth Games scam and coal scam are preaching about honesty,” Nadda said.Citing the example of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Nadda said the standard of the opposition has fallen. He said: “When the Covid-19 pandemic started the Prime Minister, after consulting experts, decided to impose lockdown then Rahul Gandhi criticised him. When lockdown was lifted then also Rahul Gandhi criticised him. It was like criticising the sun for rising in the morning and setting in the evening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/be-factually-correct-focus-on-quality-nadda-to-bjp-s-social-media-cell-in-up-101611338108380.html
22-01-2021||India||Hold tractor rally outside Delhi, police tells farm leaders; farmers deny||Talks between farmer leaders and police over the proposed January 26 tractor rally in the national capital remained inconclusive on Friday as both sides stuck to their stand with the unions saying it was the government's responsibility to maintain peace.According to sources, police officers at the meeting requested the farmers' union leaders to hold their tractor rally outside Delhi, citing security reasons on Republic Day.Following the meeting, a farmer leader said they will take out their rally on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi and will not settle for anything less than that.Joint Commissioner of Police (Northern Range) S S Yadav coordinated the meeting along with other senior police officers. Another round of talks between the police and farmer unions is likely to take place at Singhu Border on Saturday.After the Central government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday farmer leaders said they will intensify their agitation now and alleged that the government's approach was not right during the meeting.They also said their tractor rally will go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions have told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.Coming out of the meeting with the government at Vigyan Bhavan, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said, "Tractor march on January 26 will take place as decided by us on Outer Ring Road. We have informed the police it is for the government to ensure that it should be peaceful."The government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday as the farmer leaders stuck to their demands for a complete repeal of three farm laws they find pro-corporate and a legal guarantee for minimum support price, even as the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12-18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks, the 11th round could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting as the government also hardened its position saying it is ready to meet again once the unions agree to discuss the suspension proposal.This followed a big climbdown made by the Centre during the last round when they offered to suspend the laws and form a joint committee to find solutions.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November 28, demanding a repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP (minimum support price) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hold-tractor-rally-outside-delhi-police-tells-farm-leaders-farmers-deny-101611336442484.html
22-01-2021||India||'Sanctity lost': 5 things Narendra Singh Tomar said on farmers' protest||Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday accused the ongoing farmers' protest of losing its sanctity. The accusation from BJP ministers is not new but on Friday after the 11th round of meeting failed, the protest came under a sharp attack of the minister.Here are five things that minister said which can shape up the protest in the coming days> "Government gave many proposals to end the protest, but no resolution possible when the sanctity of agitation is lost."> "Government always maintained it is ready to consider alternatives to repeal; Our proposal is in the interest of farmers and of the country."> "We told unions to get back to us by Saturday with their decision on our proposal; If they agree, we will meet again."'Will intensify protest now': Farmers issue threat as 11th round of talks fails> "Some external force definitely trying to ensure agitation continues; Obviously, those forces are against farmers' interests."> "We told farmers to come up with their own proposal, other than repeal if they have anything better than our offer."Farmers' unions have rejected the Centre's proposal of holding the implementation of the farm laws for 1.5 years. This was decided in a meeting of all farmers' unions on Thursday. After the decision was conveyed to the Centre during Friday's meeting which took place briefly as there was no discussion, the minister asked the union leaders to come up with an alternative plan, excepting the repeal of the farm laws.As no new date for another meeting has been announced, the situation has reached a dead-end, though agriculture minister said if the unions agree to Centre's proposal, or come up with their own new proposal, there will be further discussion.(With PTI Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanctity-lost-5-things-narendra-singh-tomar-said-on-farmers-protest-101611336221309.html

However, the list of 1,400 HCWs on the hospital side was intact.The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), an autonomous institute, also claimed that the portal did not reflect names of around 1,400 HCWs.The PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS together contribute nearly 9,000 healthcare workers in Patna.As per the list generated through the CoWIN app, the PMCH had to vaccinate 163 HCWs on Thursday. However, it ended up vaccinating 97, and its hospital superintendent, Dr Bimal Karak, claimed 100% achievement in vaccination target for the day.“There was duplication in the list of recipients, generated through the portal for Thursday. The list included names of some beneficiaries we had already vaccinated. As such, we achieved 100% target by vaccinating 97 beneficiaries at our hospital on Thursday. We have apprised the health authorities about it,” said Dr Karak.On the other hand, NMCH principal, Dr Hiralal Mahto, said names of some HCWs in the medical college were missing from the portal.“I was among the first few to send the list of healthcare workers under the medical college establishment to the Patna civil surgeon last December. The hospital list went later. However, my hospital superintendent informed me yesterday that the medical college list, which includes senior faculty members, was missing from the portal. I have apprised the civil surgeon about it,” said Dr Mahto.“We have asked the NMCH to send us its list once again so that we can verify and re-load the names missing from the portal,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh.That beneficiary names are missing from the portal was detected after the government on Tuesday tweaked the CoWIN portal to allow on-the-spot administration of shots to those already enrolled for vaccination on the portal.“We have checked. Beneficiary names have not gone missing, but for some reason have not been uploaded. We will upload the names missing from the portal so that no healthcare worker, willing to take the vaccine, is left out,” said executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, also the state nodal officer for the vaccination.Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit and Kumar took jabs of Covishield at the IGIMS on Friday, in an effort to boost vaccination footfall, which dropped from 62% on day one (January 16) to a cumulative percentage of 54.47% after four days of vaccination.As many as 464,160 healthcare workers have enrolled for vaccination in the first phase in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/duplication-missing-names-of-health-workers-on-cowin-add-to-concerns-in-bihar-101611324152240.html

The elephant succumbed to his injuries on January 19.Prasath, 36, and Raymond, 28, have been booked for offences under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.The horrific video of the incident has emerged showing the miscreants throwing a flaming cloth wrapped against wood on the jumbo. The animal can be seen with flames over his head and is running around trumpeting and in pain.“This is heartbreaking and cruel. The action we take against them should serve as a deterrent,” said Nilgiris district collector J Innocent Divya.Officials have also sealed a homestay that the duo was running.Forest officials have been following the elephant since November. “It (the elephant) had an injury on its back and it was roaming around in human habitation and was not returning to the forest,” said LCS Srikanth, deputy director of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in Masinagudi.The department had tranquilised the pachyderm in December. “But it was still weak and moving around very slowly,” said Srikanth.Forest officials noticed serious injuries to its ear in the first week of January. On the 19th morning they tranquilised the elephant again to take it for treatment to a nearby camp. “It died when we were nearing the camp,” Srikanth said.The post-mortem is complete and the report is awaited, the officials said.Animal rights activists said that this cruelty was part of the larger problem of man-animal conflict.“Resorts, factories have encroached forest and tribal lands and outsiders don’t understand animals,” said S Muralidharan, founder of Chennai-based Indian Centre for Animal Rights and Education (INCARE).“This is a criminal act and punishments under the Wildlife (Protection) Act aren't severe. The court should take suo-motu cognisance of this; go out of the law books and pronounce stringent imprisonment so it serves as an example,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephants-ears-torched-in-tamil-nadu-s-nilgiris-it-dies-2-arrested-101611333852301.html
22-01-2021||India||‘Zero tolerance for misuse of money and muscle power’: EC in poll-bound Bengal||The Election Commission of India has zero tolerance towards misuse of money power, muscle power and state machinery, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora said on Friday.The poll panel also said that central forces would be deployed in West Bengal ahead of the crucial 2021 assembly polls as per the ECI’s final assessment and that the forces would work in close coordination with the state police.“The Commission has zero tolerance about misuse of money power, muscle power and government machinery. I am not denying that incidents don’t happen despite the commission makings such statements. But whenever incidents have come to our notice we try to move very swiftly,” Arora told the media in Kolkata.The ECI’s full bench comprising the CEC and election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar were in West Bengal on a two-day visit to take stock of the poll preparedness and law and order situation ahead of the crucial assembly polls scheduled to be held this year.On Thursday, meetings were held with political parties and senior IAS and IPS officers of the state, while the ECI met the state's chief secretary, home secretary and DGP on Friday before flying back to Delhi.The ECI also said that election expenditure would be closely monitored so that money power doesn’t vitiate a level playing field.“We have decided to send a special expenditure observer to West Bengal and Assam apart from a special police observer and general observer. We feel that in more than one way there are kinds of possibilities of money power being misused in most states these days,” he addedThe poll panel also said that volunteers of the civic police and green police would be excluded from the election process.“We also heard from political parties something about civic police and green police in West Bengal. Without going into the merits of such force our own belief as commission is that anybody who is given even a semblance of uniform, in one way or the other, assumes a position of authority. We have taken a cast-iron assurance from the chief secretary and the DGP that civic police shall not be used in any work related to polling,” Arora said.Referring to Trinamool Congress' (TMC) allegation that the Border Security Force (BSF) is coercing voters to favour one party, the ECI said that the remark was “unfortunate”.It also said, “Home ministry doesn’t have unlimited central forces. Internal security also demands engagement of central forces in many places. There are 23 companies already deployed in West Bengal in some sensitive areas. We will deploy as much as we can,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zero-tolerance-for-misuse-of-money-and-muscle-power-ec-in-poll-bound-bengal-101611332873605.html

He alleged that the Centre had struck at the DSGMC because it was at the forefront in providing aid to the farm movement."The DSGMC has been providing langar to farmers from the very first day they arrived at the Singhu border and continues to do so even today," Badal said in a statement.He underscored that the DSGMC was the same body that had won universal praise during the coronavirus lockdown for the service it rendered to humanity, as well as during the time of natural disasters."Now, the same body is being vilified," he said. "The DSGMC will not be affected by such cowardly acts and will not step back from assisting peacefully-agitating farmer brethren."Badal said it was "strange" that a case had been registered against Sirsa and others with regard to a complaint that had been filed against the then DSGMC president, Manjit Singh G K, in 2018.Sirsa's name has been included now even though he was not named in the original complaint, while that of G K has been excluded, Badal said. "This shows how the police and other investigating agencies are being misused by the BJP against its opponents."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-supporting-farmer-protests-being-vilified-sukhbir-singh-badal-101611331376164.html

Apart from the surging numbers, a worrying point is that another returnee from the United Kingdom (UK) has been detected with the genetically-modified strain.Now almost half of the active cases in the country are being reported from the state which was once lauded for its virus control measures. According to the state health ministry, the active case load in the state is 70,395-- out of 8,77,282 total cases 8,03, 094 have recovered. With 17 deaths, the death toll has also gone up to 3564. But many health experts have questioned the toll saying many deaths failed to find place in the official list.A person who had returned from the UK two weeks back in north Kerala’s Kannur has been detected with the modified strain of the virus. With this, the total number of modified virus cases has gone up to 10 in the state. In daily positive cases, Ernakulam district topped with 1018 infections, health ministry data shows. In view of rising cases many health experts have asked the state to scale up its testing and give more emphasis to RT-PCR tests. They say more than half of the tests are still antigen which is not dependable. Latest statistics show in recovery and test rates also the state is lagging when compared to other states.The rising case graph has triggered a blame game in the state-- health minister K K Shailaja said the opposition failed to do anything feasible to control the pandemic and its activists carried out a series of agitations across the state vitiating the fluid situation. But the opposition said the minister was getting angry because she was getting “bad publicity” these days due to a hike in Covid-19 cases.The first state to report a Covid-19 case in the country in January last year, a China –returned medical student, Kerala was on the verge of flattening the curve in May but cases surged when restrictions were removed in May-June. But still the state managed its numbers well but cases started increasing in September after Onam festivities. The situation aggravated further after the local body elections in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-logs-another-covid-19-surge-with-6753-new-infections-tpr-rises-to-1163-101611330173694.html

The offer of government jobs comes in addition to the compensation of ₹5 lakh that will be given to the families."I have received reports that 76 farmers have passed away during the protest against three farm laws.

He asked, "Is the constitution even there? As per the constitution Schedule VII part-2, the government should have consulted the agrarian states like Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, UP and Rajasthan first in matters related to agriculture before passing the laws.""Why did Centre change it without discussion in Parliament? They passed it in Lok Sabha as they'd more members. In Rajya Sabha, it was passed in chaos as they sensed things can go wrong," the chief minister said.He said, the centre needs to understand Punjab is not the only state protesting, farmers from across India have united on the Delhi border to agitate against the laws imposed by the government.

22-01-2021||India||WHO ranks Rajasthan best-prepared state for Covid vaccination||Rajasthan has been rated as the most efficient Indian state for Covid vaccination by the World Health Organization, India, as it ranked green in five categories necessary to start a successful vaccination drive, state government officials said.The state health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said the WHO representative had shared a presentation at a review meeting convened by chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday that showed Rajasthan was the only state that had scored on every parameter.“The WHO has put us in green categories of vaccination after seeing preparations of state government like transport facilities, cold storage points, supply plan, reach etc. While some other states are put in the green category on limited parameters, our state has been kept under green category on every single parameter,” said Dr Raghuraj Singh, Rajasthan’s project director, immunization.Quoting from the WHO presentation, Mahajan said: “According to WHO observation of 67% session sites during vaccination it was found that because of the advance preparation, on all the observed sites 100% team members and vaccinator officer were found wearing a mask, separate dedicated rooms were created as per protocols and the beneficiary duelist was available at every site,” Mahajan said.He further said that at 99% sites, physical distancing was maintained, AEFI (Adverse events following immunization) kits were available and at 78% sites, Cowin app was used. The WHO had prepared a guidance document for governments in November 2020 for prioritisation of Covid vaccination and decided to rank governments on holding state and district level task forces, training of vaccinators, sensitization of private health institutions and logistics for carrying out vaccination.The WHO, in a presentation made to all states, on Thursday ranked Rajasthan green in all categories. If one goes by the presentation, Gujarat would be second best as it is ranked green in all categories except sensitization of private institutions.“For Covid vaccination preparation, Rajasthan is the only state in the country which has done well on all parameters set by the WHO,” said Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot in a tweet.“According to the state head of World Health Organization (WHO) regarding the preparation of Covid vaccination, Rajasthan is the only state in the country which is the leader in all standards. Like Covid management, Rajasthan is ahead in the country in Covid vaccination management,” he tweeted.As a result of good groundwork in Rajasthan, around 97% of Covid vaccines were utilised during the first three days of the vaccination drive against the target of 90%, set by the central government. The vaccine wastage percentage in the state was 3.40%, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-ranks-rajasthan-best-prepared-state-for-covid-vaccination-101611327866409.html
22-01-2021||India||Countries offered Chinese vaccines turn to India for Covid-19 shots||Several countries that have been offered or purchased Chinese Covid-19 vaccines, including Brazil and Cambodia, have turned to India for supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine amid questions about the efficacy of some of the Chinese jabs.India is receiving numerous requests for vaccines, both as grant assistance and commercial supplies, and these have increased since New Delhi rolled out nearly five million doses of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India, for seven countries in the neighbourhood.On Friday, India rolled out two million doses as commercial supplies to Brazil, where the question of opting between the AstraZeneca vaccine and Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine is at the heart of differences between President Jair Bolsonaro and several governors, including Sao Paulo governor João Doria, widely seen as Bolsonaro’s main rival for the 2022 presidential race.Bolsonaro had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 8 to expedite the shipping of two million doses of Covishield as he hoped to launch the vaccination drive from the presidential palace this week. At the time, however, India was yet to launch its own vaccination drive and officials were working out the timeframe for rolling out vaccine grants and commercial supplies.Doria subsequently launched the vaccination drive with CoronaVac, and Brazil plans to cover 230 million people with its vaccination drive. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Brazil intends to acquire more of the AstraZeneca jab and also manufacture it. Indonesia, which has received three million doses of CoronaVac for its free vaccination drive, too is looking to acquire the AstraZeneca vaccine from India. Indonesia’s Indofarma company is in talks with the Serum Institute to procure Covishield. “Hopefully, this will be realised soon,” said a person aware of the discussions.On Monday, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen made a request for vaccine assistance from India during a meeting with Indian envoy Devyani Khobragade. Officials in Phnom Penh said the country is interested in both Covishield and Covaxin, which is made by Bharat Biotech, as they can be stored at temperatures suitable for Cambodia.China, one of the biggest supporters of Cambodia that has provided soft loans worth billions of dollars, has donated one million doses of Sinovac vaccine to vaccinate 500,000 people. However, the people cited above said Cambodia will need many more doses to cover a majority of its population of nearly 17 million.At the same time, questions have been raised about the efficacy of CoronaVac after trials in Brazil demonstrated an efficacy rate of around 50% – significantly lower than those of the vaccines from AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer. A trial in Indonesia also showed an efficacy of 65.3%.Though Sinovac is conducting trials in several countries, experts have questioned its lack of openness and noted the company has not released much data. John Moore, a vaccine researcher with Weill Cornell Medicine, told NPR: “It's science by press release. The Chinese are being, well, characteristically less than transparent.”Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said: “If you look at it from the viewpoint of beneficiary countries, no single supplier can provide their entire need for vaccines and they are looking for more options. They cannot say no to China and some vaccines may not be up to the mark though they want to exercise other options.“There is a clear preference for multiple options, and India is preferred option for potential beneficiary countries because of its global reputation as a vaccine manufacturer. Besides, the Serum Institute has the Oxford-AstraZeneca connection. This is good for Indian diplomacy in both South Asia and the extended neighbourhood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countries-offered-chinese-vaccines-turn-to-india-for-covid-19-shots-101611326769842.html
22-01-2021||India||Hours after Rajib Banerjee quits govt, TMC expels Bally MLA Vaishali Dalmiya||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) sent a strong message to its rebel leaders on Friday evening by expelling Vaishali Dalmiya, the legislator from Bally in Howrah district, hours after forest minister Rajib Banerjee, the lawmaker from the district’s Domjur assembly seat quit the cabinet.The move came amid strong speculations that both Dalmiya and Banerjee may soon join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the assembly polls due in April-May.The TMC formally informed the media at 6.31pm that Dalmiya had been expelled. “Disciplinary committee of Trinamool meets. Vaishali Dalmiya has been expelled from the party,” said the brief statement.Though a newcomer in politics, Dalmiya was considered a high-profile lawmaker as she is the daughter of Jagmohan Dalmiya, the Kolkata-based industrialist who served as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). He was the BCCI president till his death in 2015.Banerjee, the legislator from Domjur, is the second minister from Howrah district and the third minister in the state to resign on the eve of the crucial assembly polls.Former Indian cricketer and sports and youth affairs minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla was the first legislator from Howrah district to resign from the TMC on January 5. He represented the Howrah North seat and was also the president of the TMC’s district unit.Suvendu Adhikari, the TMC leader from East Midnapore district resigned from the government and the TMC and was welcomed into the BJP by Union home minister Amit Shah on December 19.Dalmiya drew the ire of the TMC leadership for her recent remarks against a section of Howrah district leaders. Like Shukla, she joined politics in 2016. The day Shukla resigned, she said during a live television show that there are “termites in the TMC who are breaking the party from within”.After Banerjee quit on Friday, Dalmiya told the media that many new legislators were not allowed to work freely by the TMC’s Howrah district unit chairman and minister Arup Roy. She even alleged that Roy did not let her inaugurate her own projects.“The party did the right thing by expelling her. There is no place for people who make statements against the party. The chief minister fielded Dalmiya in the 2016 polls because she wanted to include people from various backgrounds in development projects. Many such people are working without making complaints,” TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh told reporters.Dalmiya did not comment on her expulsion till 7 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hours-after-rajib-banerjee-quits-govt-tmc-expels-bally-mla-vaishali-dalmiya-101611326077836.html

The outbreak, gripping the length of the country, has been detected in 13 states - Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. While the flu in poultry birds has been reported from nine states - Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, 12 states have reported the outbreak in crow, migratory birds and wild birds. These states include - Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab."Till 22nd January, 2021 outbreaks of Avian Influenza (Bird flu) have been confirmed in 9 States (Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab) for poultry birds and in 12 States (Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab) for Crow/Migratory/ Wild birds," a statement by ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying on Friday read.The flu has been confirmed in poultry samples from Uttarakhand's Almora and Gujarat's Somnath, the ministry said.In crows, the flu has been confirmed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama) and Uttarkhand's Kaliji Pheasantbird in Tehri range, the ministry said.Avian Influenza has been confirmed in crows in the States of UT of Jammu and Kashmir(Kulgam, Anantnag, Budgam and Pulwama); in Kaliji Pheasantbird inTehri range of Uttarakhand.Soon after the outbreak killed more than 25,000 birds earlier this month, the government had rushed to control the outbreak and prevent further spread by asking states to strengthen the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfect the affected areas, and properly dispose of dead birds and carcasses.The animal husbandry ministry had also asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan.To prevent the disease transmission from affected birds to poultry and humans, the ministry has asked states to follow the general prevention guidelines.“Coordination with the forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States. The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures,” the ministry said in a statement.Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds. It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say. There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say. According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans. Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus.The Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has previously pointed to migratory birds as a cause for the spread of flu which has triggered an alarm in north, central and southern India. “In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i.e. from September-October to February-March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” the ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-j-k-to-kerala-bird-flu-spreads-to-13-indian-states-union-territories-101611319582330.html
22-01-2021||India||UPSC exam: No extra chance for those who missed last attempt due to Covid||The Centre on Friday refused to offer an extra chance to those candidates who missed their last attempt in the UPSC Civil Services examination in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Seeking an additional chance in view of the extraordinary situation prevailing in the country due to Covid-19, several candidates, many of whom included frontline workers and those engaged in essential services, had approached the Supreme Court demanding an extra attempt.They stated that Covid duties, serious economic and emotional stress due to the pandemic, and poor internet connectivity in far-flung areas were all factors that added up to deprive them of preparing better for the examination.General category candidates are allowed six attempts till the age of 32 while for OBC candidates, there is relaxation upto nine attempts till they attain 35 years of age. Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) candidates get unlimited attempts till the age of 37.As the bench took up their case on Friday, additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju informed a three-judge bench, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, that the proposal made in the petition cannot be accepted. Intimating the oral instruction received from the government officials late Thursday, the law officer told the court that the government had decided not to offer an additional chance to candidates who took their last attempt at the UPSC Civil Services Examination (CSE) 2020.The bench, also comprising justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari, told ASG Raju to put this fact on affidavit and posted the matter for Monday.Senior advocates Shyam Divan and CU Singh who appeared for the petitioners, more than 100 in all, told the top court that on September 30, 2020, this court had asked the Centre to explore the possibility of granting an exemption in age or attempts for last chance candidates.The order stated, “We have impressed upon Additional Solicitor General SV Raju appearing for the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to explore the possibility of providing one more attempt to such candidates with corresponding extension of age limit. He has agreed to convey the sentiments of the court to all concerned and to take a formal decision thereon expeditiously.”No such decision was taken by the government. The candidates were left with no option but to appear in the examination, Divan argued. Some of the petitioners in the present round before the top court were party to the September 30 order.“During this pandemic, while everyone had a choice to save their attempt by leaving the exam in 2020, while taking care of their health, the chance candidates were given no choice at all and had to sit for the exam, despite the lack of opportunity to prepare,” said the petition filed by advocate Anushree Kapadia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upsc-exam-no-extra-chance-for-those-who-missed-last-attempt-due-to-covid-101611324929792.html

MEA responds||India said on Friday it had not received any request from Pakistan for supply of Covid-19 vaccines even as it began commercial exports of doses by sending two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco.Pakistan has not yet placed orders for commercial supplies of vaccines and authorities have been racing to procure doses to begin inoculating the most vulnerable segments of the population. China on Thursday offered 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine to Pakistan.“I am not aware of any request for the supply of Indian-made vaccines on a [government-to-government] basis or commercial basis,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing.He declined to answer a question on how India would respond if Pakistan were to request vaccines from the country, saying it was “hypothetical at this stage”.Early on Friday, two aircraft took off with two million doses each for Brazil and Morocco – the first commercial supplies of Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India.Contractual supplies to Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Bangladesh and Myanmar will follow in the coming days. Bangladesh signed an agreement with the Serum Institute last year for 30 million doses.Brazil had planned to send an aircraft to India on January 15, a day before the country launched the world’s biggest vaccination drive, to pick up two million doses of Covishield. It had to put off the move after the Indian side said exports would take some more time.Srivastava said many countries have shown interest in accessing vaccines from India, the global hub of vaccine production. He also reiterated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used for the benefit of all humanity to fight Covid-19.“Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout [of the vaccination drive], India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” he said.“It will be ensured that domestic manufacturers will have adequate stocks to meet domestic requirements while supplying abroad.”On Wednesday, India had also begun providing vaccines to friendly neighbours as grant assistance. The “Vaccine Maitri” initiative has so far benefited Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Bangladesh (two million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Myanmar (1.5 million doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses), and Seychelles (50,000 doses).Srivastava also two made-in-India vaccines were in production, four were in active clinical trials, and 15 more were in pre-clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-request-from-pakistan-for-covid-19-vaccines-says-india-101611322236816.html

The two had slipped out of Sri Lanka when drug enforcement officials closed in on them and had been operating out of Chennai.The NCB said the two - MMM Nawas and Mohamed Afnas - were key players in the multinational crime syndicate that was behind the 100 kg heroin and 18.325kg of methamphetamine seized from a Sri Lankan vessel “Shenaya Duwa” in the high seas south of Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi on 26 November. Six Sri Lankan nationals who were in the vessel were arrested and five pistols seized from themNCB, India’s federal drug enforcement agency had been working on leads from this seizure for the last two months and finally tracked down the two players.“Nawas and Afnas controlled the pickup and delivery of narcotic drugs from Pakistani and Iranian vessels for the syndicate that has its tentacles in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Australia,” a senior NCB official said.The NCB believes Pakistani drug traffickers lodged in Sri Lankan prisons play the lead role in the syndicate that sources large quantities of drugs from the Golden Crescent - Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran - and delivers them to Sri Lankan and Maldivian entities.The Golden Crescent has two important transit points for processed heroin in the island nations of Sri Lanka and Maldives. “And the heroin from this region is usually loaded in fishing vessels setting sail from the ports of Iran and Pakistan for mid-sea transfer into similar vessels of Sri Lanka and Maldives. However, the mid-sea transfers happen in territorial waters of India or very near to its territorial waters. There is a big network of foreign entities controlling this lucrative trade,” a spokesperson for the NCB said.The NCB said drug syndicates that earlier mostly depended on smuggling narcotics through the north-western borders of India had increasingly been relying on the sea route since the traditional route for the Afghani-Pakistani heroin had become tougher to breach.“This has also led to the increased use of the sea route by traffickers to smuggle heroin into India,” the agency, which has stepped up coordination with drug enforcement agencies such as the Australian Federal Police, Police Narcotics Bureau of Sri Lanka and the US Drug Enforcement Administration, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-catches-2-lankans-sitting-tight-in-chennai-unravels-pak-drug-syndicate-101611323015313.html

Police personnel are protectors and they should never hurt innocent people," he said."Using these cameras, which will remain on all the time, we can monitor the conduct of policemen towards public," Rupani said.This technology will not only help police personnel improve their behaviour towards citizens, but it will also protect them from false allegations, he said.In another major announcement, Rupani, who also handles the Home department, disbanded the Rapid Response Cell, commonly known as RR Cell in police circles.RR cells work directly under the respective range inspector generals of police (IGs).Each range comprises three to four districts, and each district superintendent of police (SPs) reports to the concerned Range IG."RR Cells were created in 1995 to help range IGs to conduct raids in a prompt manner. In the present scenario, its usefulness has diminished. The government has decided to dissolve all RR Cells in the state. We want to strengthen the district SPs for effective law enforcement" said Rupani.The decision has come weeks after the Gujarat Anti- Corruption Bureau (ACB) caught an assistant sub-inspector attached to the RR Cell of Ahmedabad Range while allegedly accepting a bribe of ₹50 lakh.The chief minister, however, asserted that there is no connection between the decision and the arrest of the sub- inspector by ACB in December, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-cm-announces-body-cameras-for-policemen-101611321702493.html

Two meetings between farmers' representatives and police officials have been held in which Delhi Police asked them to take out their march on Kundli border, but farmers have said they will take out the march on the Outer Ring Road. It will be a peaceful march with no intention to disrupt the government's Republic Day parade. So as of now, Delhi Police have not given permission to hold tractor march as the farmers have planned.Farmers are planning to display tableaux of all many states in the tractor parade like it happens in Republic Day's parade.While thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi border points since November 26, several others in the past few days have been on their way to join the tractor march.The march has been a much-anticipated movement of the ongoing protest as the unions have been planning for this for long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-no-going-back-on-republic-day-tractor-march-say-union-leaders-101611319074305.html

For the first time, the tender required minimum 75% local content requirement of the total value of the tender. This is expected to give a boost to the “AtmaNirbhar Bharat” mission. In this tender, 3 bidders participated and the lowest offer was from indigenous manufacturer M/s Medha Servo Drives Ltd. who successfully met the minimum local content of 75% of the total value,” it added.According to the delivery schedule for supply of these rakes – the first 2 prototype rakes will be delivered in 20 months, thereafter on successful commissioning; the firm will be delivering an average of 6 rakes per quarter.In August 2020, the Indian Railways cancelled its global tender issued for manufacturing 44 sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains, the ministry of railways announced late on Friday.The move came after Chinese joint venture company CRRC Pioneer Electric (India) Private Limited emerged as the only foreign bidder for the global tender floated for manufacturing 44 rakes of Vande Bharat trains in July.The JV was established jointly by China-based CRRC Yongji Electric Co. Ltd. and Gurugram-based Pioneer Fil-med Private Limited in 2015.Indian Railways’ Integral Coach Factory, Chennai had floated a tender for manufacturing 44 rakes or train sets of semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains on July 10, 2020.The other five bidders then included state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Bharat Industries, Sangrur, Electrowaves Electronics (P) Ltd, MEDHA Servo Drives Private Limited, Powernetics Equipment India Private Limited, according to the railway ministry.The ambitious ‘Make in India’ project involves the manufacturing of 44 train sets comprising 16 coaches each for Vande Bharat.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi-Varanasi route on February 15, 2019.

We asked them to convey their decision tomorrow," Tomar told news agency ANI."The talks remained inconclusive as farmers' welfare was not at the heart of talks from the unions' side. I am sad about it," Tomar said. The government has also sought alternatives, Tomar said. To the government's displeasure, the farmers reiterated their plan to carry out a Tractor Rally on Republic Day, before the talks began on Friday.Krantikari Kisan Union chief Darshan Pal on Thursday re-emphasised that the rally will take place only on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi, adding that the leaders will hold another meeting with the police after 11th round of talks with the governmentThe rally in the national capital will run at the same time as Republic Day celebrations on January 26.“Govt has said tractor parade on Republic Day can’t be conducted on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, due to security reasons. We’re clear that we will conduct tractor parade there only. After tomorrow’s meeting with Centre, we’ll hold another meeting with police,” news agency ANI quoted Pal as saying.While the meeting lasted for almost five hours, the two sides sat face to face for less than 30 minutes. In the very beginning, the farmer leaders informed the government that they have decided to reject the proposal made by the government in the last round of talks on Wednesday, reported news agency PTI.Coming out of the meeting venue, farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka said there was no headway in the discussions and the government asked unions to deliberate on its proposal again.The farmers have been camping out at several entry points to the capital New Delhi since late November in protest against the legislation that they say will hurt farm incomes and leave them vulnerable to big corporations. The government has defended the laws, saying the reforms will make agriculture competitive and bring prosperity to farmers.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-intensify-protest-now-farmers-issue-threat-as-11th-round-of-talks-fails-101611316271961.html

22-01-2021||India||‘KTR for CM’ chorus grows in TRS amid rumours that he may replace his father||After a brief lull, speculations over Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state information technology minister K T Rama Rao taking over as the next chief minister replacing his father K Chandrasekhar Rao, have started surfacing again over the last few days.“Advance congratulations” have been pouring in for KTR, as the chief minister’s son is popularly known, from various quarters of the party including ministers, MLAs and senior leaders. “He has been receiving congratulatory messages from his followers on social media and also on his personal number,” a party leader familiar with the development said.On Thursday, senior TRS leader and presently deputy speaker of the Telangana assembly T Padma Rao openly addressed KTR as “chief minister-in-waiting,” in the latter’s presence at a function of the South Central Railway employees in Secunderabad.“I congratulate K T Rama Rao garu, who is going to become the chief minister of the state very soon, on behalf of the state assembly and also railway employees,” Padma Rao said, amidst loud cheers from the audience. He wished that soon after assuming charge as the chief minister, KTR would take up the issues of railway employees.Interestingly, KTR neither stopped the TRS leader from calling him future CM nor made any reference to it when his turn came to speak.What triggered the fresh speculations over the anointment of KTR as the next chief minister was a comment made by Telangana health minister Eatala Rajender in an interview to a vernacular television channel on Monday evening.“KTR may become the chief minister soon. Definitely it will happen. So what? What is wrong in it?” Eatala said, reacting to a question as to why KCR did not inaugurate the Covid-19 vaccination programme when all the other chief ministers in the country launched it and gave their messages to the people.“There might be various reasons for KCR not launching the vaccination programme. There is no need for picking holes in it. His son, KTR, has been looking after 99 per cent of the party and the government programmes in the absence of KCR. He launched the recent vaccination programme and as a health minister, I attended the same,” he said.Several other TRS leaders, including ministers T Srinivasa Yadav, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, V Srinivas Goud, Puvvada Ajay Kumar and Gangula Kamalakar and lawmakers like Bajireddy Goverdhan and Mohd Shakeel also endorsed the health minister’s opinion.“KTR is going to be the chief minister of the state soon. He has all the qualities to head the state. There is nothing wrong in it,” Srinivasa Yadav said.Another senior party leader who did not wish to be named said there was a serious discussion going on within the chief minister’s family over the timing of the anointment of KTR. “There is talk that it might happen in the third week of February. But it is also expected that KCR will step down after the party’s plenary in April,” he said.So far, there was neither denial nor confirmation about the change of guard in the state from Pragati Bhavan, the official bungalow of the chief minister.The opposition parties have reacted to the developments with a pinch of salt. “It appears KCR has grown old and is not able to handle the administration. So, he wants to hand over the mantle to his son. The party MLAs, too, seem to be feeling enough of KCR and hence, they are pitching for KTR as the CM,” senior Telangana Congress leader and lawmaker T Jeevan Reddy said on Friday.BJP state president Bandi Sanjay said KTR replacing KCR was an internal matter of the TRS. “But I still feel, KCR should make an OBC or a Dalit leader CM,” he said.Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said there was no surprise in KCR making KTR the chief minister as dynasty politics is a nationwide phenomenon. “Particularly, regional parties are like private limited companies, where power is transferred from one generation to the next generation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktr-for-cm-chorus-grows-in-trs-amid-rumours-that-he-may-replace-his-father-101611315019415.html

"It is an act of miscreants. Never disclose OTP and personal details to such telecallers," the Centre said through its PIB fact check handle.Some #Fraudsters claiming to be from Drug Authority of India are calling senior citizens to confirm their Aadhaar and OTP for #COVID19Vaccine allocationIt is an act of miscreants.

As of now, healthcare workers are getting vaccinated across the country. Next in line are other frontline workers which include defence personnel, police, civic officials among others. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers may get inoculated in that phase. After that, senior citizens — people above 50 years — will be vaccinated.Before the vaccination began and the government's phase-wise vaccination plan was disclosed, fraudsters were calling up people in Madhya Pradesh asking them to pay ₹500 for vaccine registration. Madhya Pradesh cyber cell said the callers were traced to Haryana, Hyderabad and Telangana.After the government revealed its plan of first phase vaccination, the registration of which is an internal process, fraudsters are targetting the next phases the details of which are yet to be out.Though the Centre has not yet revealed when the vaccination of senior citizens will begin or what the price for each dose will be for the senior citizens, the health department has made it clear that there will be no third-party registration. The data of senior citizens are being souced from electoral rolls while people will be allowed to self-register once the Co-WIN application is launched for everybody.Hindustan Times earlier reported that CoWin platform will allow the public to access some of its features on the Aarogya Setu app as well for self-registration.For self-registration, any of these documents — driving licence, PAN card, bank passbook, passport, pension document, MGNERGA job card, voter ID, official IDs of MPs/ MLAs/ MLCs, government-issued service ID card and health insurance smartcard issued by Ministry of Labour — will be required.

Apart from front-line health professionals, the state governments should be given the option of laying out a state-specific order of beneficiaries, so that the vaccination programme is taken forward with utmost speed and efficiency," the resolution mentioned.Asking the government to ensure necessary steps are taken to overcome the hesitancy amongst front-line health professionals on Covid-19 vaccination, CWC in its resolution appealed and said, "CWC appeals to the people of India to come forward without any hesitation and vaccinate themselves."At the CWC, Congress President Sonia Gandhi blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its handling of the pandemic. “The government has inflicted untold suffering on the people of our country by the manner in which it has managed the Covid-19 pandemic. It will take years for the scars to heal." Gandhi hoped that India's nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive would be completed to the fullest extent.The internal committee of Congress also slammed the pricing of drug for Covid-19 - a disease outbreak that has toppled economies across the globe from early last year, torpedoed economies, and tested the mettle of public health system in every affected nation - and sought a clear policy."CWC expresses its dismay over reports that the Vaccine may be sold in the open market at ₹2,000/- for two dosages per individual. Such profiteering in times of grave adversity simply cannot be permitted. Government needs to explicitly and publicly declare a clear policy in this regard," the CWC resolution said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-boost-pm-modi-s-image-congress-picks-holes-in-govt-s-covid-19-vaccine-plan-101611308529932.html

It also instructed authorities to get the mental health of the child examined by an expert committee. Earlier, the government had opposed the accused mother's bail plea saying crucial evidence was found on her mobile phone and she gave the boy steroids.The 36-year-old woman, hailing from Kollam district, was arrested and remanded to judicial custody after her husband and son filed a complaint two weeks back. The case got wide publicity as it was the first time in the state that a mother was arrested under Pocso charges, that too, for exploiting her own child.But after her arrest, the youngest son told the media that his brother was tutored under threat to lay such a charge and that their father, who married another woman without divorcing his mother, used to physically assault them regularly.The woman’s family later alleged that the police made undue haste in arresting her and a proper investigation was not carried out. The State Women Commission and the Child Welfare Commission had also criticised her arrest.Also Read: Kerala assembly turns down motion for removal of Speaker P SreeramakrishnanRelatives later claimed that the mother was falsely implicated after she sent her husband a notice for alimony and threatened to move the court against his practice of bigamy. They said the couple were estranged for the last three years and the husband forcibly took his three children to a West Asian country, where he was working.The father had claimed that the mother was exploiting the son for quite some time and the boy revealed his alleged ordeal to a psychiatrist in the Gulf. He later approached the Child Welfare Commission, which forwarded his complaint to the police. When the case snowballed into a controversy, the police put the blame on the commission. However, commission member N Sunanda said police were requested to probe the matter and weren't told to arrest the mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-mother-accused-of-son-s-sexual-abuse-gets-bail-court-orders-sit-probe-101611309318268.html

It is clear that among those involved are persons in the highest echelons of government and there has been a breach of secrecy concerning vital and sensitive military operations," the CWC said in a letter."The revelations also point to inexcusable and deliberate subversion of government structures, scandalous and extraneous influence over government policies, and a vicious attack on the independence of the judiciary," it added.The CWC said that the "shameful" compromise of the Modi government with "non-government players" has been exposed."It is shocking that three days after the revelations, the Prime Minister and the Central government remain silent on the issue as though the storm will pass," it added.The CWC further said that the silence underlined the government's collusion, complicity and guilt."The storm will not pass and we will hold the Central government accountable for compromising national security and aiding India’s adversaries," the resolution added.The CWC demanded a time-bound investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to enquire into the "breach of national security, violations of the Official Secrets Act and the role of the persons involved.""Ultimately, those who are guilty of treasonous behaviour must be brought before the law and punished," it added.Workers of the Congress staged agitations across Maharashtra, including in Mumbai, demanding action against Goswami over leaked WhatsApp chats related to the Balakot airstrike and other sensitive national issues. The party alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its top leaders were shielding Goswami.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-security-compromised-cwc-on-arnab-goswami-s-leaked-chats-101611307812267.html

Pakistani rangers confirmed to the Border Security Force (BSF) that the youth was taken into custody by the Sindh police after he crossed over. Now, efforts are on to ensure his return.19-year-old Gemara Ram Meghwal, a resident of Kumharo Ka Tiba of Sajjan Ka Paar village under Bijrad police station area in Barmer district, had crossed the international border on the intervening night of November 4 last year. His family members lodged a missing complaint with Bijrad police on November 16 after their search proved to be futile.In the missing complaint, family members expressed apprehension that the boy might have crossed to Pakistan since the family lived very close to the Indo-Pak international border and they had relatives in Pabni village in Pakistan, which is located right across the border from their village. According to the complainant, Gemara Ram used to say he will go to Pakistan to meet the relatives.Family members further claimed that they have got calls from their relatives in Pakistan confirming a boy had crossed the border and was arrested by the Pakistani police.Jetha Ram, station house officer at Bijrad police station told HT that Gemara Ram had an affair with a girl, who was his neighbour.

The study, funded by Bharat Biotech International, was conducted during the phase 1 trial of the vaccine. Though Bharat Biotech funded the study, the funder had no role in data collection, data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report, but was involved in study design, the Lancet report says..@TheLancetInfDis publishes findings from trial of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 developed by @BharatBiotech & ICMR. @TheLancet @MoHFW_INDIA @DeptHealthRes Read more: https://t.co/KKZJOf6Ew1 pic.twitter.com/ZCfu2pfOwbThe study was conducted during the lockdown and around 375 participants were enrolled for the purpose between July 13 and 30. The study also notes that since the number of daily infections was high at that time, participants were more exposed to the virus. "The sample size was intentionally large to enable the inference of meaningful conclusions regarding neutralising responses. With several reports questioning the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against antigenically divergent strains, we report neutralising responses to homologous and heterologous strains," the report said.Coronavirus vaccine doses from India arrive in NepalThis trial was held at 11 hospitals across India and the doses were administered 14 days apart, not 28 days as what will be done to vaccine recipients.The participants were divided into several groups and all reported enhanced immune responses, the report said.Participants were observed for two hours after the trial to assess reactogenicity and were also instructed to record local and systemic reactions within seven days (after each dose). The overall incidence of solicited local and systemic adverse events in this study was 14–21% in all vaccine-treated groups."The results reported here do not permit efficacy assessments. The analysis of safety outcomes requires more extensive phase 2 and 3 clinical trials," it said.The Drug Controller General of India granted restricted emergency use authorisation to Bharat Biotech's Covaxin under the clinical trial mode, which entails taking consent from the beneficiaries before administering them with the doses, and then following up on each beneficiary.From January 16 onwards, healthcare workers of the country are being administered vaccines — both Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-led-to-enhanced-immune-responses-says-lancet-101611306952662.html

"We are determined to fight for the farmers," said Mishra. Former MLA from Padmapur and BJP leader Pradip Purohit said they are prepared to spend seven nights protesting for farmers.On Thursday, at least 10,000 farmers and BJP leaders had surrounded the RDC office in Sambalpur town, protesting ‘katani chhatani’ or deductions in farmers’ payments by rice millers alleging poor quality of paddy, non compliance to the FAQ fixed for paddy procurement, non-generation of token in time for farmers, lapsing of token and unnecessary laying of paddy bags at different market yards.The BJP leaders alleged that the government's ‘failure’ in buying paddy from the farmers had resulted in the distress sale of the grain, with farmers in districts like Keonjhar being forced to sell the crop at around ₹1200 per quintal against the MSP of ₹1868 per quintal.Facing political heat over the issue, Odisha food supplies and cooperative minister Ranendra Pratap Swain on Thursday suspended 15 secretaries of primary agriculture cooperative societies that act as agents of Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation and purchase from the farmers. The department suspended secretaries of primary agriculture cooperative societies in western Odisha districts of Bargarh, Sambalpur, Bolangir, Boudh and northern Odisha district of Keonjhar.BJD leader Srimoyee Mishra said BJP was resorting to such agitation to divert attention from the farmers' agitation in Delhi. "This Kharif marketing season, a record 37 lakh metric tonne of paddy have been procured by the government. The government would procure all paddy from farmers," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-protests-shoddy-paddy-procurement-govt-suspends-15-officials-101611303266566.html

22-01-2021||India||Union ministers start 11th round of talks with protesting farmer unions||The eleventh round of talks between protesting farmer unions and three central ministers got underway here on Friday to break the nearly two-month-long deadlock on the three new agri laws.In the last round of meeting held on Wednesday, the government yielded some ground in its bid to end the farmers' protest on various border points of the national capital. The Centre had offered to put on hold the three laws for 12-18 months and also set up a joint committee to find solutions.However, the farmer unions on Thursday rejected the government's offer and remained stuck to their two major demand -- repeal of three farm laws and legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP). Farmers group said they will continue protest and also hold tractor rally on January 26, the Republic Day.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash are holding the talks with the representatives of 41 farmer unions at the Vigyan Bhawan here."In a full general body meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha..., the proposal put forth by the government...was rejected. A full repeal of three central farm acts and enacting a legislation for remunerative MSP for all farmers were reiterated as the pending demands of the movement," Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of protesting unions, had said in a statement on Thursday.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws.Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati, the other three members on the panel, started the consultation process with stakeholders on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-ministers-start-11th-round-of-talks-with-protesting-farmer-unions-101611300987897.html

He added that today's India is not afraid of working on experiments for solving problems.Addressing the 18th Convocation of Tezpur University, PM Modi said that people should not be afraid of taking risks and doing experiments."The Indian team in Australia is a great example of the change in approach. Even after losing the first test, they continued fighting. Even after suffering injuries, our players kept fighting for wins and kept looking for new solutions. In challenging conditions, they stood up to challenge. Some players may have been less experienced, but their bravery was no less. They created history with the right talent and temperament. They defeated such an experienced team like Australia. This performance of our players is a life lesson," he said."The first lesson is we should be confident about our ability. The second is if we move forward with a positive mindset then the result will also come positive. The third is if you have an option to go out safely and on the other hand you have an option of a win then you should explore the possibility of a win. Even if you lose, while trying to win, it can't be considered as a loss. You should not be afraid of taking risks and doing experiments. We have to be proactive and fearless," PM Modi added.The Prime Minister said that today's India is not afraid of working on experiments for solving problems."The world's largest banking inclusion campaign is ongoing in India. The world's largest toilet building, house-providing, clean-drinking water providing and vaccination drive is in India," he added.India has recently won Border-Gavaskar Trophy after defeating Australia in Test series by 2-1. What makes the feat even more commendable is how the Indians fought multiple injuries and mental fatigue - due to the bio-bubble restrictions -- to register a historic win.In the first Test against Australia, India was bundled out for 36 and many pundits predicted that the visiting team will face a 4-0 drubbing. But proving every critic wrong, the Rahane-led side registered famous victories in Melbourne and Brisbane.After India emerged victorious in the final test at The Gabba, PM Modi had tweeted: "We are all overjoyed at the success of the Indian Cricket Team in Australia. Their remarkable energy and passion was visible throughout. So was their stellar intent, remarkable grit and determination. Congratulations to the team! Best wishes for your future endeavours."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-india-s-cricket-win-over-australia-says-country-not-afraid-of-challenges-101611300827306.html
22-01-2021||India||HT Environment Conclave: Govt to train village women to test water quality||The Union government will train five women from every village to test the quality of water at nominal charges as part of the ambitious Jal Jeevan mission, Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Shekhawat said on Friday, delivering the keynote address at the Hindustan Times Environment Conclave.The government will put up inexpensive water-quality testing infrastructure accessible to every village to achieve the government’s mission to provide safe drinking water to all by 2024, the minister said.“When we need to tests our blood, we all know where to go. But we have problems to test the water we drink. We will set up laboratories that will provide water quality tests for nominal charges,” the minister said.Also read | HT Environment Conclave: Reserve carbon space for developing world, says JavadekarThe minister said the sustainable environment could not be based on the development of any one nation or segment of society. “It has to be based on the ecological integrity of every human being,” he said.Piped drinking water to rural households is a critical component for achieving universal access to safe drinking water in a country where, in 2015, 163 million Indians lacked access to clean water, the highest for any country, according to the NGO WaterAid.A key benchmark is that piped water supply at 55 LPCD under normal conditions should be available within household premises or at a distance of not more than 100 metres from the house.The Jal Jeevan mission aims to provide piped drinking water to all rural households by 2024.Shekhawat said the government used the Covid-19 lockdown period to ramp up infrastructure and logistics to be able to adhere to targets.“When we started off, only 17% of households had piped drinking water. During the pandemic-lockdown period, we managed to provide piped drinking water to 3.30 crore households,” the minister said.The minister said India aspires to be a global leader in achieving a sustainable environment. “The key thing I keep saying is that we should not lead our lives as consumers of natural resources but as custodians so that we can leave a better world than the one we were born into for the sake of our coming generation,” Shekhawat said.The minister said the path before the government was full of dire challenges.There are 52000 places where water is toxic due to excessive fluoride and arsenic etc. Water quality in many regions of Punjab and Rajasthan was hazardous due to overuse of pesticides, he said.“That’s when our PM Narendra Modi decided to reach safe water to every household.”Highlighting the key programmes to make water safe and conserve water, the minister said the Atal Bhujal mission was dedicated to recharging groundwater, while Jal Shakti campaign was devoted to creating awareness.The Dam Rehabilitation Yojana has been launched to run fitness checks on hundreds of historic dams, which is critical for managing water.“The resolve of the Prime Minister to reach drinking water to everyone is the first such resolve in the world,” the minister said.“One water connection to a household makes a big difference you can’t imagine. It brings confidence to the family,” Shekhawat said.Due to the large public-participation programme like “Catch the rain where it falls”, water conservation had become a mass movement.He cited the example of Vadodara where residents were able to save 10 crore gallons of water.Shekhawat complemented the Hindustan Times group for organising an environment conclave to further the cause of the environment and a sustainable future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-environment-conclave-govt-to-train-village-women-to-test-water-quality-101611300763417.html

Prior to Adhikari's exit, Banerjee had openly said that loyal party workers in TMC are being "overlooked". He later reiterated that those working in the interest of people and hardworking are not getting due importance in Mamata Banerjee-ruled Trinamool Congress.The tussle between Banerjee and senior leaders in Howrah over alleged nepotism and corruption first surfaced in public in July last year. “The rectification drive initiated by Mamata Banerjee will not succeed if action is taken against small fish and the big ones are allowed to go scot-free,” the minister had said then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-forest-minister-rajib-banerjee-resigns-as-cabinet-minister-101611299965808.html

The latest example of it was witnessed in the cricket field when the Indian team despite loss and hardships, overcame them and won in the next matches,” said Modi while addressing the 18th convocation of Tezpur University in Assam online. “Despite being injured, our players persevered on the field to save the match. Notwithstanding challenging conditions, they didn’t despair and faced them. Some players had less experience but their determination was not and they created history,” he added. Also Read: PM Narendra Modi to chat with beneficiaries during Covid vaccination drive in UPModi said that the team had both talent and temperament to take on the experienced Australian team with senior players and defeat them. “This performance by our players also teaches us big life lessons. One is to have belief in our abilities, second is to have a positive mindset. If we have a positive mindset, the outcome will also be similar,” said Modi. “The third and most important lesson is when you have the option of leaving a challenge safely and on the other hand have the choice of a difficult victory, you should explore the possibility of a win. If you fail in the attempt to win, there is no loss. We should never be afraid of taking risks and experimenting. We have to be proactive and fearless to overcome the fear of failure,” he added. Modi stated that despite questions and concerns about India’s ability to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has been able to turn things around for the better. “At the start of this pandemic, concerns were expressed on how India, with such a large population, could be devastated by Covid-19. But India showed the world that if you have resolve and resilience, it doesn’t take long to create resources,” he said. “Instead of compromising with the situation and waiting for the problem to increase, we took quick and proactive steps. As a result, we were able to face and fight the virus effectively. We limited the spread of the disease with made-in-India solutions and improved our health infrastructure. Now our vaccines are giving many countries the assurance of a safety shield,” added Modi. The PM praised the innovation hub of Tezpur University and initiatives like the simple and cheap way of purifying water by the department of chemical science, which is benefiting many villages across Assam and in several other states. “Such technology can strengthen the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to provide clean drinking water to all households. Measures to turn waste to energy from crop waste and tasks being done on biogas and organic fertilisers by Tezpur University can solve a big problem for the country,” said Modi. Research and documentation of tribes of the northeast and their disappearing languages, preservation of manuscripts written on birch during the period of Srimanta Sankardeva and digitszation of old books being done at Tezpur University were also lauded Modi. The event witnessed conferring of degrees and diplomas to 1,218 students who graduated in 2020. Among the degree recipients, 48 toppers of various undergraduate and postgraduate programmes were awarded gold medals. The event was held in a blended mode observing Covid-19 protocols, wherein only the PhD scholars and gold medallists received their degrees and medals in person while the rest of the recipients were awarded degrees and diplomas virtually.

In our meeting it was unanimously decided that we reject their proposal,” news agency ANI quoted Pandher as saying. “In today’s meeting, we will discuss MSP and repeal of the three farm laws,” he also said.In today's meeting we will discuss MSP and repeal of the three farm laws: SS Pandher, Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee https://t.co/ntjhtKq9vKPandher was referring to the decision taken by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions leading the protests, to reject the government's offer to put the legislation in abeyance for at least one-and-a-half years during in the 10th round of talks on Wednesday.Of the four demands raised by farmers, both sides have arrived at a consensus on two; however, the negotiations are stuck on the demands for MSP and repeal. While the government has repeatedly said it won’t repeal the laws and has instead offered to amend and set up a committee to review the laws, the unions are adamant on a complete rollback. The implementation of the laws is already on hold, as ordered by the Supreme Court last week.The protesting farmers are gearing up for a mega tractor march on Republic Day. Farmers’ leaders are in talks with the Delhi Police to decide upon its route. The march, they’ve already announced, would be “peaceful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poison-inside-sweets-farmers-leader-on-centre-s-offer-to-suspend-farm-laws-101611297445912.html
22-01-2021||India||More Indians stepping out; surge in flight, hotel bookings: Report||Indians of all age groups have started stepping out of their cities, filling domestic flights to almost 100% capacity, reveals a recent survey.The survey by RateGain Technologies, a SaaS company for travel and hospitality, cites the upcoming long wedding and travel season as the reasons for this surge in domestic travel. SaaS is a web application managed by travel technology providers.Recent reports also stated around 80% Indians were willing to get the Covid-19 vaccine within six to twelve months of it being available, making Indians most optimistic about the vaccine, giving hope to the tourism industry in the fastest growing outbound market of the world of some revival.While international travel continues mostly restricted to UAE, domestic bookings are majorly dominated by last-minute travel bookings, stated RateGain’s report, adding that India consistently made higher travel bookings than last year in December. Highlighting top social media trends, RateGain stated that hotels in Maldives got ten times more engagement on their social media in the last quarter of 2020, owing to the corridor it opened with India, welcoming over 65,000 tourists.“Indian hotels saw their highest surge in engagement during November, due to a surge experienced by hotels in Mumbai, as they received their guests during the long Diwali weekend for staycations. Goa, which was the most booked destination in December and had the most check-ins in December and January, saw three times higher engagement during November on Facebook. Hotels in India are driving more followers on Instagram by almost ten times as compared to new fans on Facebook, showing that hotels are targeting the younger generation that is joining the workforce and would be most likely to travel,” the report stated. “In the new normal, Indian millennial traveller would play a critical role in the recovery of the region and therefore, this recovery is not encouraging for the domestic hotel industry alone but also for neighbouring Asian markets that rely on China and India to drive their tourism markets,” said Kamesh Shukla, executive vice president, RateGain. Tourist destinations such as Goa, Shimla, and Jammu continued to be among the top ten destinations booked even two weeks after the new year. This, according to RateGain, emphasises the role of social media in playing in the recovery of the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-indians-stepping-out-surge-in-flight-hotel-bookingsreport-101611297643058.html
22-01-2021||India||CWC may hold organisational elections between May 15 and May 30||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on Friday may consider holding the much-awaited organisational elections, which could see the election of a new president, between May 15 and May 30, after the assembly elections in four states are over. The party is also looking at a possible window in February to hold the internal polls. Four states—Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam—and the Union Territory of Puducherry are due for assembly elections in April-May this year. At least two CWC members said that the party needs to complete its internal polls by February as this will give enough time for the new team to prepare for the polls. The Congress is out of power in all four states. It is in power in Puducherry. Also Read: Ahead of UP polls, Congress releases calendar with Priyanka Gandhi’s photosParty functionaries maintained that a long gap between the assembly polls and the organisational elections is required so that the assembly campaign doesn’t suffer. “The May schedule can allow the new team under the new president time to settle down as it doesn’t have to bother about facing an imminent election. The February schedule for internal poll can also give the new time enough time to face the state elections,” said a functionary. Subject to the endorsement of CWC, the elections could be slated for the second half of February or in May. For its part, the Central Election Authority (CEA) has sought a 25-day timeframe for organising the polls. A key decision to be taken relates to convening the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session or organising the voting at the level of state units. The latter option is doable as the delegates’ list collated and cross-checked by CEA is broadly along the lines of names received from the Pradesh Congress Committees. The CEA was set up last year by interim president Sonia Gandhi for the purpose of holding organisational polls. It has completed the task of drawing up the list of AICC delegates who form the electoral college for the party chief’s election. The poll panel’s recommendations, together with the list of delegates, are understood to have been forwarded to KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary in charge of organisation. They are likely to come up for discussion at Friday’s meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-working-committee-may-consider-party-polls-in-may-or-february-101611296442778.html

22-01-2021||India||CBI files case against Cambridge Analytica for Facebook data theft||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica (CA) and Global Science Research Limited, UK, for allegedly harvesting personal data of Indians from Facebook, officials said on Friday. The agency, after two and a half years of enquiry, has found that personal data of 335 users and around 562,000 additional users who were part of the friend’s network of these 355 users was illegally collected. CBI enquiry revealed that Dr Alexandr Kogan, founder and director of Global Science Research had created an app - “thisisyourdigitallife”. As per the platform policy of Facebook, the app was authorised to collect certain specific data of the users for academic and research purposes. The agency says that the app, however, illegally collected additional unauthorised data of the users as well as their friends’ network in the Facebook. Kogan has been named as accused in the CBI First Information Report (FIR) registered on January 19 and has been charged under sections of criminal conspiracy and Information Technology Act.CBI says that the data was collected with the knowledge and consent of users. The data collected includes demographic information, pages liked on FB, and contents of private messages etc, CBI says. The FB conveyed that 335 users had installed the app in India. They have estimated that data of 562,000 additional users who were part of friends’ network of these 335 users has also been unauthorisedly harvested by the app, CBI adds.Cambridge Analytica earlier faced allegations that it used personal information harvested from 87 million Facebook accounts to help Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Union law and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had told Rajya Sabha in 2018 that the probe will be handed over to the CBI.The anti-corruption agency had launched a preliminary enquiry against CA in July 2018 on the complaint of ministry of Information Technology. During the enquiry, CBI had contacted 335 app users out of which six responded to the agency and were examined during the course of enquiry. “They unanimously stated that they were misled by the app and were not aware of the fact that their personal and friends’ data was harvested. They also said that they would not have used the app if they knew that it would do so,” CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, adds. Global Science Research, CBI says, entered into a criminal conspiracy with CA during 2014 and right to use illegally harvested data sets was given to the latter for commercial purposes. “Facebook had collected written certificates from Alexandr Kogan (Global Science Research) and CA during 2016-17 declaring that all such data obtained by them through the app, thisisyourdigitallife, was accounted for and destroyed. This facts confirms that Global Science harvested data sets and provided the same to CA for commercial purposes,” CBI FIR states. However, CBI adds, enquiry could not authenticate the veracity of claim by Global Science and CA that they had destroyed the data sets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-case-against-cambridge-analytica-for-facebook-data-theft-101611296022541.html

22-01-2021||India||From farm laws to economy: What Sonia Gandhi said at CWC meet||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday criticised the Centre over the ongoing protests by the farmers over the three agricultural laws and the way it has been handling the coronavirus pandemic as well as the state of the country's economy. Gandhi made the remarks during her opening speech at the ongoing Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting. “The agitation of farmers continues and the government has shown shocking insensitivity and arrogance going through the charade of consultations,” she told her party's leaders.The party also discussed the possibility of internal polls in the coming months. It may consider a proposal to hold organisational elections between May 15 and May 30, which could see the election of a new president, party functionaries said on Friday. The Congress could also hold the internal polls in February, they added.Here’s what Sonia Gandhi said at the CWC meet:1. She alleged that Parliament was consciously denied an opportunity for examining any meaningful details, implications and impacts of the new agricultural laws. Reiterating the party’s stand on the legislation, Gandhi said, “We reject them categorically because they will destroy the foundations of food security that are based on the three pillars of MSP, public procurement and PDS.”2. Speaking about the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive, Gandhi said she hoped that the process would be completed to the fullest extent. She, however, slammed the BJP government for its handling of the pandemic, saying, “The government has inflicted untold suffering on the people of our country by the manner in which it has managed the Covid-19 pandemic.It will take years for the scars to heal."3. The Congress president also addressed the state of the country’s economy, which she said remained grim, adding “large parts of the economy like MSME and the informal sector have been decimated with the government refusing to extend a lifeline.”4. Alleging that panic privatisation has gripped the government, Gandhi accused it of weakening the labour and environmental laws and called out its “selling off of carefully built-up public assets.”5. In a veiled attack at the government over the Central Vista project, the Congress leader said, “When public expenditure has to be carefully prioritised, it is very painful to find huge amounts of money being allocated and spent on initiatives that can only be described as ‘personal vanity projects.”6. Hinting at leaked chats of journalist Arnab Goswami, Gandhi said, “Very recently there have been very disturbing reports on how national security has been so thoroughly compromised,” adding that a few days back senior party leader AK Antony had said that leaking of official secrets of military operations is treason. “Yet the silence from the government’s side on what has been revealed has been deafening. Those who give certificates of patriotism and nationalism to others now stand totally exposed,” she said without naming anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cwc-meet-underway-sonia-gandhi-opens-with-remarks-on-farmers-protest-covid19-101611293373128.html

He added that the vaccine was safe and there should be no misconception about it among the beneficiaries. There was no report of any adverse event during the first round of vaccination, he claimed. UP recorded the highest turn out on the vaccination day with 22,643 healthcare workers getting the first jab, he said.The integrated command and control centre (ICCC), set up in all the 75 districts in June last year for monitoring Covid cases, will now collect feedback from the beneficiaries of Covid vaccine on a daily basis, Singh said.A health department officer said, in the first round of vaccination, the healthcare workers were given Covaxin doses at 11 centers in five districts of Ambedkar Nagar, Badaun, Firozabad, Bahraich and Jhansi, whereas, at 306 centers in the remaining districts, Covishield doses were administered to the beneficiaries.The number of the centers for Covaxin shots has been increased in the round two. The health department has made it mandatory to get consent before administering Covaxin.The minister added that health workers not suffering from any disease will be given both Covishield and Covaxin.Also Read: Covid-19: PM Modi likely to take vaccine in second phase of drivePrincipal secretary health and family welfare, Alok Kumar said, the health department has completed all the preparations for the second round of vaccination drive. The vaccine has been stored at 1,298 cold chain stores across the state. The state has planned to vaccinate a total of 9 lakh healthcare care workers and we have adequate vaccines to give the second dose to the beneficiaries after 28 days, said Kumar.The state government has decided to hold the vaccination drive twice a week on Thursday and Friday, while the third and fourth vaccination round will be organized on January 28 and 29, he said.In Lucknow, 35 vaccination centres and 85 vaccination session sites/booths have been made, where 8,500 healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and paramedical, cleaning and other hospital staff will get the jab. In Lucknow, Covaxin will be administered to 600 medical staff at three hospitals.“The vaccination session will begin at 9 am,” said Dr MK Singh, in charge of vaccination in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-chat-with-beneficiaries-during-covid-vaccination-drive-in-up-101611288693828.html

Here is what we know about Yediyurappa’s seeming isolation and what has led to it:• At the core of the chaos are members of the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S) whom Yediyurappa convinced to resign.• The resignations brought down the previous JD (S)-Congress alliance government.In all, 17 members resigned from the legislature. • In the subsequent by-election, 14 of them contested; 11 won and sought their promised rewards, ministerial berths. • At least three ministers—N Nagaraju, K Gopalaiah, and K C Narayana Gowda—of the seven inducted into his Cabinet on January 13 met at health minister K Sudhakar’s residence and later called on Yediyurappa to express their anger at the distribution of portfolios.Also read | Hours after BS Yediyurappa assigns Karnataka portfolios, ministers complain• Nagaraju said there was not much he can do in the excise department and had asked for a portfolio that is more development-oriented.• Gopalaiah, who was stripped of the food, civil supplies, and consumer affairs ministry, sought to know what he had done to deserve such treatment.• Yediyurappa and his ministerial colleagues, R Ashok and Basavaraj Bommai, among others, swung into damage control mode.

22-01-2021||India||At UN meet, India hits out at Pakistan over Hindu temple's vandalism||India on Thursday slammed Pakistan over the vandalism of a Hindu temple that was set ablaze by a mob of hundreds in December last year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of the neighbouring country. As the United Nations adopted a resolution, “Promoting a culture of peace and tolerance to safeguard religious sites”, India stressed that religious and cultural heritage sites remained vulnerable to terror acts and destruction in the “world of growing terrorism, violent extremism, radicalization and intolerance.”TS Tirumurti, the Indian ambassador to the United Nations, said as a multicultural state, India safeguards all religious and cultural rights and protects places of worship as he criticised Pakistan, saying authorities stood by idly when the temple in Karak town was attacked. Warning against the selective enforcement of laws against attacks on religious sites, Tirumurti stressed that, as long as such selectivity exists, the world will never be able to foster a real culture of peace. “This resolution cannot be a smokescreen for countries like Pakistan to hide behind,” he said.Pakistan's representative, while exercising his right of reply, categorically rejected the “unwarranted assertions” made against his country by India. Speaking about other such events across the globe, India said, “Images of shattering of iconic Bamyan Buddha by fundamentalists are still vivid in our memories. The terrorist bombing of Sikh gurudwara in Afghanistan where 25 worshipers were killed is another example of this vulnerability,” according to news agency ANI.India also reiterated its call for the application of the principles of objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality to form the basis of discussions in the United Nations especially on the issue of religion. “United Nations including the UN Alliance of Civilizations should not take sides and as long as such selectivity exists, the world can never truly foster a culture of peace. We must stand united against the forces that supplant dialogue and peace with hatred and violence,” the Indian envoy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-un-meet-india-hits-out-at-pakistan-over-hindu-temple-s-vandalism-101611286543019.html

22-01-2021||India||Govt-farm leaders to meet today, unions adamant on R-Day rally | Key points||Protests against the three contentious farm laws entered Day 58 on Friday. Thousands of farmers, who have been agitating on the outskirts of Delhi since November 26, have refused to budge until all the three laws are repealed. The protesters are also gearing up for a tractor march, which was announced earlier this month against the laws, on Republic Day.Here’s a look at some key points as protests against the farm laws enter day 58:1. The 11th round of talks between the government and farmers' leaders will take place on Friday. Discussions are stuck at two demands by the farmers: a legal assurance on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and complete rollback of the laws. The government has repeatedly said it won’t repeal the laws.2. On Thursday, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmers' unions who are leading the protests, rejected the government’s proposal to suspend the laws for up to 18 months. The government had given this proposal in the 10th round of talks on January 20.3. After SKM rejected the government’s proposal, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar met home minister Amit Shah late on Thursday night. Tomar, railways minister Piyush Goyal and minister of state (MoS) for commerce Som Parkash have been representing the government in the talks with the farmers' leaders.4. On Thursday, farmers' leaders met officials of the Delhi Police for a second straight day over the proposed tractor rally on Republic Day. However, just like Wednesday, the meeting was inconclusive. Another round of talks is likely to take place between the two sides.5. The farmers are adamant to hold the rally on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road, albeit “peacefully.” However, the police, apprehensive over a possible law and order situation, have asked them to hold their rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, where a “trailer” tractor march was held on January 7.6. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to withdraw its plea filed through Delhi Police seeking an injunction on the tractor parade, calling it a “police matter.” In its plea, the police argued that the parade would “malign the nation’s image.”7. The committee constituted by the top court to oversee negotiations between the Centre and farmers on Thursday held a virtual interaction with farmers' unions from 10 states. The panel currently comprises Ashok Gulati, PK Joshi and Anil Ghanwat.8. A fourth member of the panel, Bhupinder Singh Mann, had recused himself from the committee. A controversy had erupted over the names of the members of the panel as farmers' leaders said that all of them had backed the three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govtfarm-leaders-to-meet-today-unions-adamant-on-r-day-rally-key-points-101611285069082.html
22-01-2021||India||PM Modi to interact with Covid-19 vaccination beneficiaries, vaccinators in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries and vaccinators in Varanasi via video conferencing at 1.15pm on Friday. Modi tweeted the interaction will be a first-hand opportunity to hear their experiences as well as feedback as the world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India and front-line warriors are getting vaccinated.The interaction comes as over a million health workers have now been vaccinated, with over 230,000 getting doses on Thursday alone. The government data shows there has been an increase in daily immunisations after the drive was seen to be losing steam due to vaccine hesitancy and technical glitches.Also Read: Covid-19: PM Modi likely to take vaccine in second phase of driveReports suggest that Modi is likely to address vaccine hesitancy affecting turnouts in his interaction.News agency Press Trust of India quoted the Prime Minister’s Office saying that Modi’s interaction in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi follows his “continuous dialogue and discussion with scientists, political leaders, officials and other stakeholders to proactively ensure smooth conduct of the world’s largest vaccination drive”.Modi launched the inoculation drive on January 16 with over 300 million front-line workers prioritised to get the jabs first.The immunisation numbers reported on Thursday are the highest in a single day. The highest before this was a little over 200,000 doses that were given on the day of the launch on January 16. The increase comes on the back of tweaks in the digital management platform to allow walk-ins and repeated appeals from top government officials for people to come forward.The cumulative number of vaccinations, while still a little over 57% of the target, is an improvement over what was seen on Wednesday when it was 55%. Some regions such as Delhi saw a significant jump in turnout. The city was averaging around 50% but it was over 73% on Thursday.According to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data, India is now the fastest country to breach the million mark, taking only six days compared to nine by the US. But almost nine million more health workers are still to be vaccinated and, at two doses per person (second doses need to be given 28 days after the first), India will need to ramp up its pace further to achieve the 300 million target it has set for later this summer.The pace in recent days has worried authorities as well as experts and has been leading to wastage of doses since vaccinators at some locations could not find enough recipients to finish quantities from the vials that they had opened.On Tuesday, the top health officials of the country appealed to recipients to not be reluctant and said it was particularly upsetting that doctors and nurses were being hesitant despite adequate data and arrangements to tackle side effects.On Thursday, the government launched a mass awareness campaign.The grant of emergency approval to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin this month without efficacy data for the home-grown vaccine has triggered criticism from experts and the opposition. The data from the international trials of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, also approved by India’s drug regulator, suggests that it prevents transmission. This requires more research before it can be established. No such data is available for Covaxin as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-pm-modi-to-interact-with-beneficiaries-vaccinators-in-varanasi-101611285341539.html

22-01-2021||India||Biden supports ‘successful’ ties between US, India leaders, says White House||President Joe Biden “respects and values” the “long, bipartisan, successful” relationship between leaders of the United States and India and looks forward to continuing it, the White House spokesperson said Thursday.President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken at least once since the American leader’s election last November, and could again soon as the American leader begins calling up counterparts in allied and partner countries. Biden will start making these calls Friday, with Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, being the first.“President Biden, who of course has visited India many times, respects and values the long, bipartisan, successful relationship between leaders in India and the United States. He looks forward to a continuation of that,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in response to a question at the daily news briefing.As further proof of Biden’s support for the relationship, Psaki brought up Vice-President Kamala Harris. “Obviously, he selected -- and yesterday, she was sworn in -- the first Indian American to serve as President or Vice President, certainly a historic moment for all of us in this country, but a further, you know, cementing of the importance of our relationship.”Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, came to the US from Chennai, India and her father, Donald Harris, from Jamaica.Shortly after Biden was sworn-in Wednesday, Modi posted tweets congratulating the president and committing to work with him. “My warmest congratulations to Joe Biden on his assumption of office as the President of the United States of America. I look forward to working with him to strengthen India-US strategic partnership,” he had said in one of them.In the second, he said, “We stand united and resilient in addressing common challenges and advancing global peace and security”. And in yet another post, he had said, “The India-US partnership is based on shared values. We have a substantial and multifaceted bilateral agenda, growing economic engagement and vibrant people to people linkages. Committed to working with President @JoeBiden to take the India-US partnership to even greater heights.”Biden and Modi go back further than the November call. In 2014, Biden, who was vice-president then, had hosted a lunch for the Indian prime minister at the state department. Modi, who was observing Navratri fasts at the time, skipped the meal part of the event, as he had at the dinner hosted for him and his team by President Barack Obama at the White House.Of Biden’s visits referenced by Psaki, the most recent was in July 2013, when he was vice-president. He had visited India in preparation for then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s upcoming US visit. Singh, incidentally, was President Obama’s first state guest, in 2009.Also Read: Joe Biden has no plans to call Donald Trump: White HouseAs the new administration settles in, policy makers and experts in both the US and India are eager to know its policy and approach on India. Mitt Romney, the Republican senator, asked Antony Blinken, the nominee for secretary of states, about it at the latter's confirmation hearing Tuesday.Blinken had spoken of the same bipartisan support, but he had put in the context of ties between the two countries, rather than their leaders. He had gone on to say that given all that has already been done by the previous administration, “One area I think that has a lot of promise, and maybe even necessity, is actually climate,” Blinken said at his confirmation hearing by the senate foreign relations committee. “At the current rate things are going, India is poised over the next two or three decades to catch up to China in terms of the emissions that it produces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-supports-successful-ties-between-us-india-leaders-says-white-house-101611283006284.html

It looks forward to a continuation of that,” Psaki said responding to a question on India-US relationship under the Biden Administration.The historic inauguration of India-origin Kamala Harris, she said, further cements this relationship.“Obviously, he selected and yesterday, she (Harris) was sworn in the first Indian American to serve as president or vice president.

22-01-2021||India||Curtailed by pandemic, the Republic Day parade is different this year||Many events that were a regular feature of the Republic Day Celebrations in the national capital will be missing this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures put in place to contain its spread, said government officials.One prominent event that drew crowds and cheers – stunts on motorcycles by the army and the personnel of the paramilitary forces – have been cancelled this year.The veterans’ parade by ex-servicemen and women, too, has been knocked off the programme chart, and so is the parade by recipients of the national bravery awards. In the 2020 Republic Day parade, veterans as old as 99 and 100 years had participated in the parade and the motorcycle stunts were performed by women officers of the Central Reserve Police Force.Government officials, who did not wish to be named, said these events were cancelled because the elderly and children are more susceptible to contract Covid-19. “There will be no enclosure for schoolchildren this year either. The total number of the enclosures has also been reduced -- from 36 to 22. The number of attendees will be 25,000 as against 150,000 until last year. Only 4,000 entries will be through tickets, the others would be invitation-based. The motorcycle stunt event was cancelled as it involved the participants sitting closely together and supporting each other while staying in close proximity on moving motorcycles,” said a senior official involved in the Republic Day arrangements.The official further said no children below the age of 15 years would be allowed at the venue on the India Gate lawns on January 26. Unlike the 12X12 format of the marching contingent with 124 participants, the format this year is 8X12, with only 96 participants.“Not just the spectators but the number of media persons has also been reduced from 300 to 100. The workers on the lawns are currently being tested at the Covid booth set up at the venue. Police personnel who will be at the gates and in charge of frisking will be wearing personal protective equipment suits and will carry thermal scanners. Officers from the security unit, who will guard the VIPs, will undergo Covid-19 testing and are already in quarantine for seven days before the Republic Day function,” a second official, privy to the arrangement details, said.Also, this year, instead of a gallery (benches arranged in rows and raised on platforms) for spectators, the ministry of defence has arranged for chairs -- so that they can be kept apart on the lawns to ensure a distance of six feet between spectators.“Another change is that only the tableaux will go to the Red Fort. The parade will culminate at the National Stadium at the C-Hexagon of India Gate,” the second official said.But there is an addition as well this year. At least 122 soldiers of the Bangladesh Armed Forces will be taking part in the parade. According to a press statement issued by the High Commission of India in Dhaka, this is only the third time since Independence that a foreign military contingent has been invited to participate in the national parade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curtailed-by-pandemic-the-republic-day-parade-is-different-this-year-101611281743315.html
22-01-2021||India||PM Modi to interact with Covid-19 jab beneficiaries, vaccinators in Varanasi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with beneficiaries and vaccinators, who will share their experience of the inoculation campaign against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), in his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi on Friday. The vaccination drive has started at six centres in the city and the first shot of the vaccine was administered to a sanitary staff Rashid Khan at the Sir Sunderlal Hospital of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), according to news agency ANI.“The interaction follows continuous dialogue and discussion by the Prime Minister with scientists, political leaders, officials and other stakeholders to proactively ensure smooth conduct of the world’s largest vaccination drive,” Modi’s office said in a statement.As many as 10,40,014 health workers have been administered Covid-19 vaccines through 18,161 sessions till Thursday 6pm, Dr Manohar Agnani, the additional secretary in the Union health ministry said citing a provisional report. The health ministry said 187 adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were till 6pm on the sixth day of the vaccination drive.In the first phase of the vaccination drive, nearly 30 million health and frontline workers are being administered the shot and in the second phase, around 270 million people above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with a high risk of infection, will be vaccinated.Top government officials have said that the Prime Minister, 70, is likely to be vaccinated for Covid-19 in the second phase of the immunisation programme, which may happen in March or April. “PM will take the vaccine when his turn will come after completion of the first phase,” said an official in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). “He himself said this in his meeting with chief ministers that politicians shouldn’t try to break the queue and only take the vaccine when their turn comes,” the official added.India is currently administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India and known locally as Covishield, and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.On Thursday, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said vaccination will be the last nail in the coffin of Covid-19 and that it was unfortunate that some people are spreading misinformation about the vaccination for political reasons. He was referring to doubts raised by opposition leaders against the indigenously developed Covaxin, which is still in the third phase of trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-covid-19-jab-beneficiaries-vaccinators-in-varanasi-101611279958514.html
22-01-2021||India||Dissent escalates in Karnataka BJP against Yediyurappa after cabinet reshuffle||Hours after he shuffled his cabinet to allocate portfolios to newly inducted ministers, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa faced a backlash on Thursday from both the old guard and the new entrants, leaving the 77-year-old seemingly isolated.The new ministers as well as those who were divested of key portfolios hit back at the chief minister. The CM inducted seven ministers into his cabinet on January 13.At least three ministers--N.Nagaraju, K.Gopalaiah and K.C.Narayana Gowda--met at health minister K.Sudhakar’s residence and later called on Yediyurappa to express their anger at the distribution of portfolios.“There isn’t much I can do in the excise department and had asked for a portfolio which is more development -oriented. I have conveyed this to the CM,” Nagaraju said.Gopalaiah, who was stripped of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs ministry, sought to know what he had done to deserve such treatment.Yediyurappa, revenue minister R.Ashok and home minister Basavaraj Bommai, among others, swung into damage control mode .“There is no difference of opinion among the new ministers,” Yediyurappa claimed, flanked by Ashok and Bommai, who helped him to calm the dissidents, at least temporarily.Many of the ministers unhappy with the changes did not attend a cabinet meeting on Thursday, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.Sudhakar, who fought hard to wrest control of the medical education department from B.Sriramulu at the peak of the pandemic, and succeeded, was stripped of the portfolio in the reshuffle.With no backing from the central leadership of the Bharatiua Janata Party (BJP), Yediyurappa now finds himself confronting a burst of dissidence that has the potential to end another term of the Lingayat leader in the chief minister’s office well ahead of the end of his tenure.Even J.C.Madhuswamy, a key member of Yediyurappa’s inner circle, expressed his unhappiness at being divested of the minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs portfolios.“We will wait till the current crisis to play out and then put in motion our plans to be heard by the party,” said one BJP legislator, requesting not to be named.The lack of action against Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal) for open rebellion against the chief minister was an indication of Yediyurappa’s souring relations with the central leadership of the BJP, analysts said.“This is a repeat of what happened from 2008-13 in Karnataka. Corruption is increasing and in the due course, all these irregularities will be exposed. There is no money for relief measures, but the government is busy with its internal bickering. All this will help the Congress in the future,” said Ramalinga Reddy, working president of the Karnataka unit of the Congress party.The analysts said central leadership of the BJP seems to have left it to Yediyurappa to deal with the problem.“If the high command wants to control dissent, they can, but they have left it at Yediyurappa’s doorstep, stating that you brought them, so you control them. Basically he has been left to fend for himself,” said A.Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University.At the core of the chaos are members of the Congress and the JD(S), whom Yediyurappa convinced to resign, a move that brought down the alliance government of the two parties in the state. In all, 17 members resigned from the legislature. In the subsequent by-election, 14 of them contested , 11 won, and sought their promised rewards, a ministerial berth. The CM’s unsuccessful attempt to meet heir demand has left both the defectors and the party’s old loyalists unhappy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-escalates-in-karnataka-bjp-against-yediyurappa-after-cabinet-reshuffle-101611281326551.html
22-01-2021||India||Will decide in 4 weeks on mercy plea of Rajiv case convict: Tamil Nadu Guv to SC||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Thursday told the Supreme Court that a decision on the mercy petition of one of the convicts serving a life sentence for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, AG Perarivalan will be taken within four weeks. The petition has been pending with the Governor since December 30, 2015.During pendency of the mercy plea, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet in September 2018 recommended release of all seven convicts including Perarivalan for their involvement in the 1991 assassination. Citing inaction on part of the Governor tin deciding on his clemency plea moved under Article 161 of the Constitution, Perarivalan came to Supreme Court for passing necessary directions.On Thursday, in a surprise turn of events, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the Governor before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer and Indu Malhotra. Though the Governor is not a party in Perarivalan’s petition, the court wished to know his stand. Mehta informed the court that within three to four weeks, a decision will be taken “as per the Constitution”.The bench recorded this statement and adjourned the matter for four weeks. The court’s order said: “The learned Solicitor General submitted that the application filed by the petitioner under Article 161 of the Constitution of India shall be considered within four weeks from today.”In the past, the court had been critical of mercy petitions not being addressed. In this case, Perivalan has spent almost three decades in jail.Perarivalan was among seven persons convicted by a Special TADA court for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate former PM Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991. In November 2020, during the arguments on Perarivalan’s petition, the Centre took a legal objection to the Governor having power to decide on the mercy plea. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj who represented the Centre argued that the entire issue of granting remission in such a case lies with the President under Article 72 and not the Governor under Article 161.Article 161 gives the Governor the “power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends”.The Raj Bhavan in Chennai said that an official statement will be made after receiving information from Solicitor General Mehta.Perarivalan’s counsel, senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan objected to the Centre taking this objection for the first time in these proceedings. He pointed out that in September 2018, the State Cabinet had already decided on the petitioner’s release. If this submission of Centre was accepted, Shankarnaraynan wondered what would happen to the pardon powers exercised by Governors over the past 70 years.Perarivalan in his petition told the Court that after filing his mercy petition, the investigating officer in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case made a disclosure that he made a mistake by excluding the exculpatory parts of the statement given by Perarivalan during the recording of his evidence. Perarivalan has maintained throughout that he had no knowledge of the plot while supplying the battery that would go on to power the belt bomb used by the suicide bomber.Tamil Nadu’s Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan informed the apex court on November 3 last year that the Governor had sought a report from the Union Home Ministry under which a multi-disciplinary probe is underway on the larger conspiracy behind the former PM’s assassination.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is spearheading the probe filed an affidavit before the top court on November 20, 2020 stating that it had nothing to do with this matter as remission under Article 161 was purely between the convict and the Governor.In Tamil Nadu, both the ruling AIADMK and the Opposition DMK have previously spoken in support of the convicts’ release. In November last year, DMK president MK Stalin met the governor and urged him to release the seven prisoners on humanitarian grounds.(With inputs from Divya Chandrababu)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-decide-in-4-weeks-on-mercy-plea-of-rajiv-case-convict-tamil-nadu-guv-to-sc-101611281131683.html

Jayalalithaa, tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Thursday at a Bengaluru hospital, six days before she is to be released from prison.“She tested positive for Covid-19 but there are no other complications and her oxygen saturation is around 98% with about 10 litres of oxygen. There is a lung infection,” Dr K.Ramesh Krishna, medical superintendent at Victoria Hospital, said on Thursday.He said that doctors would decide when she would be discharged, but added that treatment it could take as long as a week or 10 days.Sasikala had tested negative on Wednesday when she was taken to Bowring Hospital in Bengaluru after complaining of breathlessness and fever.Sasikala, 63, is due to be released from Bengaluru’s Parappana Agrahara prison on January 27 after serving a four-year term following her conviction for amassing assets disproportionate to her income. She will be released months before assembly elections are held in Tamil Nadu.Sasikala’s nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) chief TTV Dhinakaran reached Bengaluru on Thursday morning and met her for a few minutes when she was being shifted from Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute to Victoria Hospital for treatment.“She is looking good. Two of our relatives who are doctors have also met her,” Dhinakaran told reporters outside the hospital.Whether Dhinakaran returns to Chennai or stays back in Bengaluru depends on Sasikala’s health, said a person close to him on condition of anonymity.The expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader has comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes and hypothyroidism.On Tuesday, after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, Tamil Nadu chief minister and ruling AIADMK coordinator Edapaddi Palaniswami ruled out inducting Sasikala into his party.Although Sasikala appointed Palaniswami to be chief minister, he subsequently joined hands with the man he replaced, O Paneerselvam, Jayalalithaa’s deputy; the party expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran in 2017. Dhinakaran, an independent MLA, started the AMMK and won a 4% vote share in the 2019 parliamentary elections in Tamil Nadu.Palaniswami will also inaugurate a memorial to Jayalalithaa in Chennai on January 27--the day Sasikala is expected to walk out of prison. The Rs. 79-crore memorial is located at Chennai’s Marina beach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sasikala-tests-positive-for-covid-days-before-release-from-prison-101611280874242.html
22-01-2021||India||India sends Covishield vaccines to Mauritius, Seychelles, Myanmar||India on Friday dispatched consignments of Serum Institute of India's (SII's) Covid-19 vaccine Covishield to Myanmar, Seychelles and Mauritius as part of the donation program to its neighbours and key partners. Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance. There are also plans to supply doses to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Commercial supplies of Covishield to several countries that have agreements with the Serum Institute of India will also begin from Friday, people familiar with the development have said. Two flights will carry two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco early on Friday morning.Under India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy, India has already dispatched vaccines to Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives as India has assured that friendly nations get every form of support. Between March and April 2020, when the world was coming to grips with the outbreak of Covid-19 and lockdowns in every major capital city of the world, India helped the Maldives in the evacuation of its citizens from China's Wuhan and deployed a 14-member Rapid Response Team consisting of doctors and paramedics to guide the Maldivian authorities and personnel in tackling Covid-19.India also sent large shipments of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol tablets to Brazil, the United States (US) and South Africa and more than 140 other nations also received essential medical supplies from India under Operation Sanjivani. Brazil, Morocco, South Africa and Saudi Arabia also will receive vaccines from India under the commercial agreement signed with Serum Institute of India (SII).Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India will continue to prioritise the healthcare needs of its people as well for humanity at large as governments across the world try to end the coronavirus pandemic.PM Modi in his speech in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last October had highlighted that India continues to remain the ‘pharmacy of the world’ and is committed to ensuring that nations across the world get the requisite amount of medical help in times of crisis. “As the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today, India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis,” the Prime Minister had said.Here is a list of countries which has received vaccines from India:The following countries will receive Covishield under grant assistance from India on Friday:India will also dispatch on Friday Covishield vaccines to these countries under the commercial agreement:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-covishield-vaccines-to-mauritius-seychelles-myanmar-101611280448648.html

The elite commando unit was raised in 2009.Maheshwari also said that keeping in mind the increasing responsibility of its VIP security wing, the force is enhancing its skills to match up to the Special Protection Group (SPG), which protects the Prime Minister and is a separate agency.“We have improved our VIP security skills. We are following the best security standards... we are working to match our skills with the best standards of the SPG,” he said.The CRPF provides security to 62 VIPs, including home minister Amit Shah, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and former prime minister Manmohan Singh, among others.Maheshwari also said that IED attacks are currently a major threat for the force. “There are tools to detect IEDs (improvised explosive devices), but none of them is perfect. This is a field in which internationally all organisations are trying,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-induct-women-officers-in-specialised-anti-maoist-force-crpf-dg-101611280732001.html
22-01-2021||India||No clear definition, computer-aided offence a cybercrime: MHA report||The Union home ministry, in its report submitted to the Parliamentary panel on Home Affairs, has said that even as there is no “legislative definition for cybercrime”, any offence committed “against a computer resource or with the aid of a computer resource is called a cybercrime”.“Such offences are dealt as per the legal provisions of the Information Technology Act, Indian Penal Code, POSCO etc,” the ministry has said.It added that government has also straightened the legal framework by dealing with cybercrime cases against women and children as child sex abuse materials. Last year, the government rolled out the Cyber Crime prevention against Women and Children scheme, with an online cybercrime reporting platform.It added that the ministry has also provided ₹95.77 crores to states and Union territories under the scheme to set up cybercrime forensic cum training laboratories.The panel was meeting officials from the ministry of Home Affairs to get feedback on the ministry’s action on cybercrime against women and children, and the number of cases it has so far found.It has also noted that the total number of cases regarding cybercrimes against women were 4,232 in 2018, 6,030 in 2019 and 8,379 in 2020. The number of persons convicted were 30, 31 and 70, respectively. In February 2019, the ministry of Home Affairs had noted that over 60,000 cybercrime cases had been recorded from 2016-2019. “As per data maintained by National Crime Records Bureau, 12317, 21796 & 27248 cases of cybercrime incidents have been registered in year 2016, 2017 & 2018, respectively. Data pertaining to year 2019 is not compiled. As awareness and recording of cybercrimes has improved, there has been an increase in reporting of cybercrimes,” the home ministry told Lok Sabha in response to an unstarred question.TMC MP Dinesh Trivedi said that considering the vast nature of cybercrime and transnational implications, a separate ministry should be set up to look into it, people familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. “The intervention was made by TMC MP Dinesh Trivedi,” a person said. “He said that considering cybercrime transcends geographical boundaries, it requires a separate ministry.”People familiar with the matter added BJP MP and union minister Satya Pal Singh also asked what the ministry was planning to do regarding cybercrimes such phishing scandal, while BJP MP Rakesh Sinha raised the issue of social media websites being misused to lure women and children.“He (Sinha) asked if the ministry was considering working in tandem with social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter to adopt a more targeted approach to stop this,” the person mentioned above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-clear-definition-computer-aided-offence-a-cybercrime-mhareport-101611280208763.html
22-01-2021||India||Amid India’s Covid vaccine export, China offers 500k doses to Pak||China has offered 500,000 doses of a coronavirus vaccine to its ally Pakistan, an apparent response to the rolling out of supplies by India for its neighbours and key partners, including three million doses delivered to Bangladesh and Nepal on Thursday.Two Indian flights carried two million doses of Covishield to Dhaka and one million doses to Kathmandu, and people familiar with matter said on condition of anonymity that supplies would be sent to Seychelles (50,000 doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses) and Myanmar (1.5 million doses) on Friday. Seven countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as assistance. There are plans to supply doses to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. The people added commercial supplies of Covishield to several countries that have agreements with the Serum Institute of India will also begin Friday. Two flights will carry two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco.After a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced on Thursday that Beijing had gifted 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as aid.“I want to give the nation the good news that China has promised to immediately provide 500,000 doses of vaccine to Pakistan by January 31,” Qureshi said. “They (China) have said you can send your airplane and immediately airlift this drug.”Pakistan is currently the world’s most populous country that hasn’t rolled out a vaccination drive. It is also the only country in the region to have approved the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use. The approval for Sinopharm earlier this week came days after Pakistan cleared the AstraZeneca vaccine.In Kathmandu, while handing over vaccine supplies to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli , Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra said this reflected “India’s Neighbourhood First policy in action”. Oli thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the “generous grant...”Observers have noted that India speedily rolled the aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16. The assistance came against the backdrop of China’s efforts to forge cooperation in fighting Covid-19 within South Asia by holding meetings with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since last year.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash lauded the alacrity with which India responded to needs of its neighbours, saying it was in line with its efforts to be the first responder in all emergencies.“This is my definition of the Neighbourhood First policy. It is the kind of policy and approach that we need to follow and its shows the difference between India and other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-india-s-covid-vaccine-export-china-offers-500k-doses-to-pak-101611279591212.html

Indigenously developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s research centre Imarat, the weapon has a range of 100 km. It was test-fired from the IAF’s Jaguar fighter planes.It is the first smart weapon to be fired from an Indian Hawk Mk132 trainer aircraft. “HAL has been focusing on the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign. The company-owned Hawk-I platform is being extensively used for certification of systems and weapons developed indigenously by DRDO and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research labs,” HAL chairman R Madhavan said. The plane was flown by HAL test pilots Wing Commanders (retd) P Awasthi and M Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hawki-aircraft-test-fires-drdo-s-smart-weapon-101611279354221.html
22-01-2021||India||Covid-19: PM Modi likely to take vaccine in second phase of drive||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to get vaccinated for Covid-19 in the second phase of the immunisation programme, and it may happen in March or April, said three top government officials , underlining that the leader opposed politicians jumping the queue of inoculation determined by the government and experts.India is currently administering vaccines to 30 million health care and frontline workers. The second phase of the programme will involve 270 million people over 50 and those with compromised immunity or underlying medical conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19. Modi, 70, is likely to be in this batch, said a highly placed official in the vaccination drive, adding that the exact dates hadn’t been determined.“PM will take the vaccine when his turn will come after completion of the first phase,”said an official in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). “He himself said this in his meeting with chief ministers that politicians shouldn’t try to break the queue and only take the vaccine when their turn comes,” the official added. He was referring to a January 11 meeting between Modi and chief ministers where the PM shot down suggestions of including politicians in the first phase of vaccination.A third official, from the Union health ministry, said the PM’s turn is likely to come by March or April. When asked if the PM would opt for a particular vaccine, the official refused to respond. “It’s too early to say anything,” he said.The country is currently administering the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, made by Serum Institute of India and known locally as Covishield, and the Bharat Biotech-manufactured Covaxin.Dr Vinod Paul, member (health) of Niti Aayog and who heads the government’s Covid-19 task force, said the second phase was crucial. “Phase 2 is our real focus of effort after health care and frontline workers. These are people who are above 50 and most political leaders would feature in this section,” said Dr Paul.Currently, about 10 million health care workers are being administered the vaccine. Other frontline workers will perhaps start getting the vaccine in about a week’s time, according to Dr Paul.It wasn’t clear whether the Prime Minister would have to register on the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN) app, which is being used to monitor vaccinations. HT reported last week that the Centre may allow self-registration by the elderly and those with comorbidities on platform, which is currently closed to the public, for faster and easier enrolment of beneficiaries. Neither the PMO nor the Union health ministry had details about the logistics for the PM’s vaccination.On Friday, Modi will interact with people who have been vaccinated and vaccinators in Varanasi at 1:15pm via video conferencing. The participants in the interaction will share their experience of vaccination. The interaction follows continuous dialogue and discussion by the PM with scientists, political leaders, officials and other stakeholders to proactively ensure smooth conduct of the drive.Dr Paul said the government was trying to fight vaccine hesitancy. “We are trying to make ‘role models’ of prominent doctors taking vaccines willingly to remove hesitancy about vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pm-modi-likely-to-take-vaccine-in-second-phase-of-drive-101611279162725.html
22-01-2021||India||‘Construction in our own territory’: China on Arunachal village report||China on Thursday dismissed a report that said it had built a village in Arunachal Pradesh, saying the construction activities were within its own territory and its sovereign right.The Chinese foreign ministry was responding to the report based on satellite imagery, which showed rows of houses in Indian territory that has been under Chinese control since 1959, and which is disputed.“First, I would like to tell you that China’s position on the east sector of the China-India boundary, or Zangnan (the southern part of China’s Tibet), is consistent and clear. We have never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally established on Chinese territory,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing while responding to a question on the report on Thursday.“China’s normal construction on its own territory is entirely a matter of sovereignty,” Hua added.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet opposing New Delhi’s consistent stand that the northeastern state is an integral and inalienable part of India.Using satellite images dated November 1, 2020, television channel NDTV reported the village is located on the banks of the Tsari Chu river, which lies in the area disputed between India and China.The report said the village comprises more than 100 homes; an image dated August 26, 2019, did not show any habitation in the same area.The India-China border dispute covers the 3488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).The report about the new village in Arunachal Pradesh comes amid a military stand-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh, which has lasted for over eight months.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off in eastern Ladakh but no significant headway has been made so far.Earlier this week, Chinese state media said New Delhi was trying to hype news about the village.The Indian media reports were “a blatant attempt to stir up troubles on the China-India border,” Zhang Yongpan, a research fellow of the Institute of Chinese Borderland Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the tabloid Global Times on Tuesday.The external affairs ministry in India when asked about the development said on Monday that it keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on the country’s security and takes necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.India had stepped up the construction of border infrastructure, including roads and bridges for the improvement of livelihood of its citizens, MEA said.“Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-in-our-own-territory-china-on-arunachal-village-report-101611278481343.html
22-01-2021||India||IT panel quizzes Facebook, Twitter over data protection||The parliamentary panel on information technology on Thursday quizzed Facebook and Twitter over their data-sharing and protection protocols in the wake of recent changes to WhatsApp’s privacy policy that have since been deferred , people familiar with the proceedings said.“It was a constructive debate, with all parties agreeing that technology is evolving everyday,” said a person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity. “It is a constant and persistent challenge and everyone agreed that they need to work together to find a solution.”The panel summoned Facebook, WhatsApp’s parent company, after the latter’s new privacy policy, which stated that the messaging app would mandatorily share data with the social media website, caused a storm. Some of WhatsApp’s users decided to leave the platform. The resulting controversy forced WhatsApp to defer the implementation of its policy from February to April. Experts said the new policy would allow Facebook to collect a vast amount of metadata.The ministry of electronics and information technology has also written to WhatsApp asking it to withdraw the changes. Officials from the ministry were present at the meeting and said that they were keeping tabs on the situation, with the need of the hour being straightening India’s personal data policy.At the meeting, Facebook did not mention whether the policy will be revoked. “They did reassure the panel that individual rights were its priority and asserted that the policy was introduced in 2016. They maintained that the new policy will not infringe on the rights of users and there should be no concerns regarding data sharing.”A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Twitter also faced criticism for doing too little to curb hate speech, the person mentioned above said.Twitter said it takes immediate action when it comes to tackling abusive content. “We appreciate the opportunity of being able to share our views before the Standing Committee on Information Technology. We put the people who use our service first at every step, and have made progress when it comes to making Twitter a safer place,” a Twitter spokesperson said.Interestingly, one of the panel’s members, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Nishikant Dubey, criticised Twitter for overreach in banning former US President Donald Trump from the platform.“Twitter can’t act as both an intermediary and a publisher, it has to be one or the other,” a second person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.Representatives from WhatsApp also attended the meeting. “We wish to thank the Honorable Parliamentary Committee for giving us an opportunity to appear before them and provide our views. We look forward to assisting the Hon’ble Committee in future as well,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-panel-quizzes-facebook-twitter-over-data-protection-101611278197941.html
22-01-2021||India||Kashmir’s saffron yield breaks decade-old record||Kashmir’s saffron output crossed 13.36 tonnes in 2020, the most in a decade, thanks to a the introduction of a scheme in 2010 to rejuvenate the cultivation of the spice , officials said.Saffron is reputed to be the world’s most expensive spice and is known as the king of condiments. It fetches between ₹1.5 lakh and ₹2.5 lakh per kilogram.Saffron production peaked in Kashmir in the 1990s with an annual average output of around 15.5 tonnes. It has since declined as saffron fields, mainly in Pampore near Srinagar, depended on rain for irrigation, particularly in September and October. Either too much or too little rain was among the reasons for the decline in production.The production was 11.72 tonnes in 2015 compared to 1.4 tonnes four years earlier.Kashmir is the only place in India where saffron is cultivated. It is the region’s second-largest revenue earner after horticulture and is estimated to support around 20,000 families.Chief agriculture officer Mohammad Qasim Ghani said the credit for the increase in the production goes to the National Mission on Saffron launched in 2010 under which root rejuvenation of the crop and sprinkler irrigation were launched.Saffron yield in the area where the scheme was implemented has increased to 4.5 to 5 kilograms per hectare, Ghani said. “Kashmir has the potential to produce 6 to 7 kilograms of saffron per hectare. Earlier, in the 1980s, our production was over 6 kilograms {per hectare}.”Ghani blamed dry weather spells among the reasons for the earlier dip in the yield.In a tweet, Jammu & Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha’s office praised the achievement. “Great Achievement: Annual yield of the world’s costliest spice, #Saffron, cultivated in Kashmir has crossed 13 metric tonnes for the first time in the last 10 years.”Zahoor Ahmad, a saffron grower, said timely rain and snow had boosted production. “We hope that from now onwards the production will keep rising,” Ahmad added.Officials said saffron is grown across 3,700 hectares in Kashmir compared to 5,500 hectares in the late 1980s. The ₹410 crore National Mission on Saffron Mission has been implemented on 3,500 hectares. Of this, 3,200 hectares of the land is located in Pampore, and the rest in Srinagar and Budgam.Officials said the mission had helped bring more land under saffron cultivation. Many growers had earlier started converting saffron fields into apple orchards and using them for commercial purposes because of their prime locations, mostly along the Srinagar-Jammu highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmirs-saffron-yield-breaks-decade-old-record-101611273444209.html
22-01-2021||India||Deadline over, CBI yet to take a call on Babri case||Although the 90-day deadline for filing an appeal in the Babri Masjid demolition conspiracy case expired about two weeks ago, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is yet to take a call on the matter and is examining if it should approach the concerned high court against the verdict, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.One of the people, a senior CBI officer, said that “the Special CBI Court judgement (dated September 30 last year) is still being examined , but we are still undecided.”Legally, a final call on whether to go for an appeal rests with the Centre.“Technically, the deadline for filing an appeal in any judgement is 90 days from the date of receiving the copy of the court’s order, but if the agency has genuine reasons for explaining the delay, the appeal can be filed anytime. In the past too, CBI has challenged court verdicts even after one year or two years,” added the officer cited above.Further explaining the procedure, this officer said: “Any file related to an appeal is first examined by the investigation team and the legal team of CBI; then by supervisory officers, additional director/special director before it reaches the CBI Director and his legal advisor for their views. If it is decided that CBI should challenge the order, the file is sent to the government for its approval. The DoPT {Department of Personnel and Training}seeks the views of the law ministry, which may or may not seek attorney general’s opinion. Sometimes, all this takes a few weeks and sometimes, several months”.But if asked by the Allahabad high court, CBI will have to file a reply on an appeal filed by two Ayodhya residents against the Lucknow special court’s September 30, 2020 verdict acquitting all 32 accused, including Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.Haji Mahboob and Sayyyad Akhlaq Ahmad, witnesses in the case, filed a revision petition in the Allahabad high court on January 8 saying that the trial court committed an error in not convicting the accused while there was ample evidence on record.All India Muslim Personal Law Board executive member and counsel for Mahboob and Ahmad , Zafaryab Jilani, said : “It is CBI’s duty to file an appeal in the case because they filed a charge-sheet. The high court is currently examining our revision petition”.CBI didn’t respond to a detailed email query sent by HT.The central agency had alleged during the probe and trial that there was a conspiracy to destroy the disputed structure so that a Ram Temple could be built at the site.During the trial, the agency had produced 351 witnesses and 600 documents as evidence.CBI judge Surendra Kumar Yadav, while ordering the acquittal last year, cited a lack of evidence and added the probe agency could not prove the authenticity of the audio and video evidence submitted. He said the demolition was not pre-planned and that the accused tried to stop “anti-social” elements who razed the mosque on December 6, 1992.The larger Ram Janmabhoomi - Babri Masjid case was decided by the apex court in late 2019; the court allowed the construction of a Ram temple at the site and ordered the creation of a trust for the purpose. It also ordered that 5 acres of land be given to the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in lieu of the disputed site, for the construction of a mosque.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-over-cbi-yet-to-take-a-call-on-babri-case-101611272035318.html
22-01-2021||India||Govt denies RTIs on agri laws citing court hearings||The Centre has cited hearings in the Supreme Court and high courts on the three farms bills and the Niti Aayog Council not having studied a report on amendments to the Essential Commodities Act as reasons to deny information on the these bills to separate Right To Information (RTI) applications filed by activists.Several RTI applications have been filed with the agriculture ministry and Niti Aayog since November 27, when farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh started their protests against the three farm bills.The farmer bodies are seeking repeal of the three farm bills. The government has ruled out repealing of the laws and said consultations were being held with states and other stakeholders over the past decade.In his RTI application, Noida-based activist Vikrant Tongad sought inspection of all files related to the farm bills; another activist, Anjali Bhardwaj of Satark Nagrik Sangathan (SNS) wanted to know whether pre-legislative consultation on the bills was done.In a reply to Tongad, Ashish Bagde, central public information officer of the department of agriculture cooperation and farmer welfare, said the information sought involves laws challenged in the Supreme Court and high courts. “As such being a sub-judice matter it may not be feasible at this moment to provide the information under section 8 (1) (b) of the RTI Act, 2005,” Bagde said.Section 8 (1) (b) prohibits sharing of the information which has been “expressly forbidden to be published” by the court or tribunal and where providing such information may constitute contempt of court. “No court has so far prohibited the government from sharing of information on farm bills,” said Nikhil Dey, a member of National Campaign for People’s Right to Information.Bhardwaj filed two RTI applications. The first was with the agriculture ministry regarding the consultation with agriculture department of various states, some progressive farmers and prominent agriculture mandi (market) officials with respect to the three Ordinances.She received the same reply that Tongad did.Her second RTI application was filed with Niti Aayog on the High Powered Committee of Chief Ministers for Transforming Indian Agriculture, which the Central government claimed, had recommended changes in the Essential Commodities Act. She sought a copy of the committee’s report, details of all meetings of the committee and its minutes.During the debate on the introduction of the three farm bills on September 14, 2020, junior agriculture minister Raosaheb Danve said that the amendments to the Essential Commodities Act were discussed and approved by the high powered committee. The amendments have removed stock limits for agriculture produce such as onions, cereal, pulses and oilseeds from the list of essential commodities so as to remove fear of private investors of excessive regulatory interference. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already refuted his claim.In a response to the application, NITI Aayog’s central public information officer, Manash Chaudhary, said he was “constrained” in sharing the committee’s report as the same was yet to be placed before the Governing Council of the body. He also said the minutes of the meetings cannot be shared as they are part of final report.Bhardwaj said the reply clearly shows that the final report has not been discussed with all chief ministers. “It is unfortunate as the issue of deliberations and consultations on the ordinances and legislations are a matter of great public interest,” she said.Venkatesh Nayak of Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative said the government should have proactively put information about public consultations on three farm laws in public domain.He added that this would have shown that “ the government has done excessive consultation with stakeholders, as being claimed by ministers, and the farm laws have backing of prominent farmer bodies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-denies-rtis-on-agri-laws-citing-court-hearings-101611269927801.html
22-01-2021||India||Farmer unions reject offer to put farm laws on hold||Farm unions protesting three new agricultural laws have rejected the Union government’s offer to put the legislation in abeyance for at least one-and-a-half years — a decision that has deepened the crisis just when it appeared that a 56-day-long agitation by tens of thousands of farmers on the Capital’s borders could finally be resolved.In the 10th round of negotiations with a 41-member delegation representing farm unions on Wednesday, the Union government offered to suspend the three pieces of legislation in its most far-reaching proposal yet.But the farmers, instead of agreeing to meet the government midway, hardened their already rigid position on Thursday, saying they will not budge from their demand for a complete repeal of the laws.After several rounds of internal discussions over the government offer, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the platform of farm unions leading the agitation, said on Thursday evening that the farmers had unanimously rejected the proposal.“The proposal to suspend the laws is not acceptable because our demand is a repeal of the laws,” said Darshan Pal, a senior leader of the agitation.A statement put out by the unions said a full general body meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha was held on Thursday. “The proposal put forth by the government yesterday, was rejected. A full repeal of three central farm acts and enacting a legislation for remunerative MSP [minimum support price] for all farmers were reiterated as the pending demands of the movement,” the statement said.In Wednesday’s talks, the government said that it would move an affidavit before the Supreme Court stating it’s decision to put the laws in abeyance till a solution to farmers’ demands was found. To discuss the issues raised by farmers, which includes a law guaranteeing assured prices for their produce, the government had also told farm unions that it proposed to set up a committee of representatives as well as experts who should be nominated both by farm unions and the government to examine “all agitation-related issues”.The move was hailed by experts as a step back by the government, and they expected farmers to reciprocate. The farm unions, too, said they would discuss the government’s fresh offer, sparking hopes of a resolution. But Thursday’s inflexible position by the farmers now leaves few options to resolve the crisis.Rakesh Tikait, the leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Tikait faction) said the full general body of the farm unions felt that accepting the government’s proposal would defeat the purpose of the agitation. “We will attend the talks with the Centre tomorrow where we will tell them that their proposal is not acceptable,” he said.Joginder Singh Ugrahan, another senior farm leader, said the government’s proposal would “divert and delay” the farmers’ demands.The government has pushed a set of agricultural laws to ease restrictions in farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming based on written agreements.Farmers staging a massive protest on several of Delhi’s border points say the laws will erode their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of big corporations. They have demanded a full repeal of the three agricultural laws and have also sought a legal guarantee of assured prices for farm produce.On January 12, after two days of deliberation, the Supreme Court suspended the pro-reforms farm laws until further order. The bench dealing with the case — headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde — also appointed a committee to look into farmers’ grievances over the laws.Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday said the Supreme Court had put the laws in abeyance for a short time. “Our proposal is to put the laws on hold for a full year-and-a half or even more till a solution is found.”Tomar added that if farmers were to accept the proposal in principle, then it would begin work on setting up the committee and its modalities, saying the laws would be suspended so that a committee could find a settlement.“The farm unions have closed the option of any possibility of amendments. They want status quo. That is why they have showed no flexibility in dealing with the government,” said Abhinav Saikia, an agronomist with farm startup IndAgro.There are some other farm unions that are in support of the new laws.“The government seems to have conceded a lot of ground with several proposals it has made so far, from diluting the laws’ provisions to putting them on hold, but the latest stand of farmers have brought matters to a standstill. We don’t want a repeal,” said Anil Bijoria, the leader of Haryana Farmers’ Producer Association, a pro-reform farm organisation.“The government has said that farmers can ask for anything other than repeal. The government now has to decide between repealing the laws or see a more intense agitation,” said RS Mani, a retired faculty at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-reject-offer-to-put-farm-laws-on-hold-101611268669847.html
22-01-2021||India||Internal elections, upcoming assembly polls in focus as Cong Working Committee meets today||The Congress Working Committee meeting on Friday might consider the upcoming assembly elections in four states and the time required for the party’s central election authority (CEA) to prepare the ground for internal elections, before drawing up a schedule for the latter, which could see the election of a new president.The meeting is being closely watched both by the old guard, including the 23 signatories to a August letter to party president Sonia Gandhi seeking sweeping changes in the Congress’ functioning, as well as the young Turks, mainly leaders allied with former party president Rahul Gandhi.The signatories said they are waiting to see how the meeting tries to address the issues they raised. “We also want the Bihar election results taken up for discussion in the CWC,” said one of the letter writers. The Congress fared poorly in the election, winning 19 of the 70 seats it contested.The young Turks, some Congress leaders said, may yet again demand that the CWC pick Rahul Gandhi as the next party chief . CWC, the highest executive body of the Congress, can appoint a provisional President pending the election of a regular President by the All India Congress Committee (AICC) .Gandhi himself has given no indication so far that he wants to return to the post he quit after the party’s dismal showing in the 2019 Lok Saha elections. “We asked him several times in the past few months but he hasn’t even given a hint of interest,” added this person who asked not to be named.If it takes up the issue of organizational elections to the post of the party chief, CWC will also take a call on whether a full-fledged session of the AICC plenary needs to be called or voting can be held at the level of state units.Four states—Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam—and the UT of Puducherry will face assembly elections in April-May this year. At least two CWC members said that the party needs to complete its internal polls by February as this will give enough time for the new team to prepare for the polls. The Congress is out of power in all four states.Subject to the endorsement of CWC, the elections could be slated for February. For its part, CEA has sought a 25-day time-frame for organizing the polls. A key decision to be taken relates to convening the AICC session or organizing the voting at the level of state units. The latter option is doable as the delegates’ list collated and cross-checked by CEA is broadly on the lines of names received from the Pradesh Congress Committees.The Central Election Authority set up last year by interim president Sonia Gandhi for the purpose of holding organizational polls has completed the task of drawing up the list of AICC delegates who form the electoral-college for the party chief’s election. The poll panel’s recommendations, together with the list of delegates, are understood to have been forwarded to KC Venugopal, AICC general secretary in charge of organisation. They are likely to come up for discussion at Friday’s meeting.A senior leader said on condition of anonymity that Venugopal and Ambika Soni have also been in contact with Rajya Sabha Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of the 23 signatories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internal-elections-upcoming-assembly-polls-in-focus-as-cwc-meets-today-101611268021899.html
22-01-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccinations cross 1 million, drive picks up pace in Delhi||More than one million health workers in India have now been vaccinated for the coronavirus, with over 230,000 getting doses on Thursday alone, according to government data that at last shows an increase in daily immunisations after the drive was seen to be losing steam due to vaccine hesitancy and technical glitches.The numbers reported on Thursday are the highest in a single day — the most before this was a little over 200,000 doses that were given on the day of the launch on January 16 — and come on the back of tweaks in the digital management platform to allow walk-ins, and repeated appeals from top government officials for people to come forward.The cumulative number of vaccinations, while still a little over 57% of the target, is an improvement over what was seen as on Wednesday when it was 55%. Some regions such as Delhi saw a significant jump in turnout — the city was averaging around 50% but it was over 73% on Thursday.Officials credited the improvement to changes in the Co-WIN application that now allows vaccinators to administer shots to walk-in health care workers if those scheduled did not turn up. “The app has been modified to allow creation of more session sites, more sessions per site, and change in site location as per the local requirement. Instead of daily plan, officials concerned can now plan and schedule the sessions for the entire weak,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry.Data from University of Oxford’s Our World in Data shows that India is now the fastest country to breach the million mark, taking only six days compared to nine by the United States. But almost nine million more health workers are still to be vaccinated and, at two doses per person (second doses need to be given 28 days after the first), India will need to ramp up its pace further to achieve the 300 million target it has set for later this summer.The pace in recent days has worried authorities as well as experts, and has been leading to wastage of doses since vaccinators at some locations could not find enough recipients to finish quantities from the vials that they had opened.On Tuesday, the top health officials of the country appealed to recipients to not be reluctant, and said it was particularly upsetting that doctors and nurses were being hesitant despite adequate data and arrangements to tackle side effects.On Thursday, the government launched a mass awareness campaign, tapping even an old Bollywood classic — a Kishore Kumar song from the 1972 Rajesh Khanna starrer Amar Prem — to drive home its message.“Kuch toh log kahenge, logon ka kaam hai kehna…” goes the song composed by the late RD Burman, whose lyrics have been modified and appear on a series of posters developed by the Union health ministry asking people to ignore vaccine-related rumors. The lyrics translate as “people will say something; then it is their job to say this...”The posters also have quotes from health care workers who took the shot against Covid-19.“You are aware that I have taken Covaxin and I have zero side-effects. Data shows that these two vaccines are safe, safe, safe,” says VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, in one of the posters. Paul took the shot on January 16, the day of the launch of the vaccination drive, at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“The misinformation must be countered fiercely. States must do all they can to counter rumour-mongering against Covid-19 vaccines. Let us put a stop to these falsehoods,” Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said while launching the posters on Thursday.“The paradox is that countries across the globe are asking us for access to the vaccines while a section of our own is fomenting misinformation and doubts for narrow political ends,” he added.He assured people that the vaccines were absolutely safe.“All eminent doctors of well-known hospitals have taken the vaccine and praised the exercise for its desired end. The elimination of polio and smallpox was made possible by large-scale immunisation,” he said.To be sure, while the data from the international trials of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine (Covishield is the Indian version of this) suggests that it prevents transmission, this requires more research before it can be established. No such data is available for Covaxin.Former Union health secretary K Sujatha Rao also said the initial period after a vaccine’s launch was usually tough, and required efforts to convince people to take the preventive shot.“It was a task for us to ensure people accepted vaccines, during the initial period of launch of the universal immunisation programme. We had to launch massive door- to-door information, education, and communication campaigns along with our development partners at that time to create awareness among people. It was by no means an easy task at the beginning but gradually picked up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccinations-cross-1-million-drive-picks-up-pace-in-delhi-101611267529354.html
22-01-2021||India||Army plans to deploy 10,000 troops as LAC reinforcements||With a planned and gradual drawdown of soldiers underway in the Northeast, where the security situation has significantly improved, the Indian Army plans to redeploy up to 10,000 extra troops by the year-end to carry out the force’s primary task --- dealing with the Chinese threat in the eastern sector, people familiar with the development said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.These soldiers are part of a reserve division whose elements can be swiftly marshalled to support front-line troops guarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China to deal with any contingency in the sensitive sector, the people said.While around 3,000 soldiers have already been pulled out of counter-insurgency and internal security duties in the Northeast, another 7,000 soldiers are expected to be withdrawn by the year-end, said one of the people cited above.The move will help the army focus on the borders and train for conventional operations, experts said.Several parliamentary panels have made recommendations in their reports to reduce the army’s exposure to counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties because it results in blunting the force’s focus on its main task --- defending the country from external aggression.Also, the Kargil Review Committeem (KRC), which tabled its report in Parliament in February 2000, said the army’s role in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties was resulting in the development of a mindset that distracts it from performing its primary role. The KRC underlined the pressing need to evolve a long-term strategy to reduce the army’s role in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations.On January 12, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said the army was in the process of reducing its footprint in the Northeast to sharpen its focus on external threats. No such drawdown of troops is currently planned in Jammu and Kashmir though, he stressed.The planned pull out of some units from a counter-insurgency role in the Northeast is a good step, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“The security situation is almost completely under control and it can now be handled by the police and central armed police forces. It will enable Eastern Command formations to focus on their primary role along the Northern borders,” he said.With both the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan and LAC being volatile, any reduction in internal security duties would be of great help in effective management of the borders and training for conventional operations, Hooda added.The internal security situation in the Northeast has improved considerably with a large number of insurgent cadres surrendering before the security forces, and successful operations carried out last year.Compared to 2018, there was a 40% increase in the apprehension of insurgents last year, a 60% decline in violent incidents and a140% increase in seizure of contraband, resulting in choking the supply of funds, according to government data accessed by Hindustan Times.“There has been a progressive decline in violence over a period of time. However, continued efforts are needed to achieve the desired level of peace, especially in Manipur, Nagaland and south Arunachal Pradesh,” said a second official. More troops will be withdrawn when the situation further stabilises in these states.Excellent coordination with Myanmar (Op Sunrise) has also made it hard for Indian insurgent groups to set up camps and operate from there, said a third official. However, one concern that remains is that the cadre strength of valley-based insurgent groups (VBIGs) in Manipur remains intact, he said.“The current focus of all stakeholders is primarily on the ongoing Naga peace talks,” said a fourth official.On the situation in Assam, he said the army had gradually started disengaging from the counter-insurgency grid in lower Assam and begun handing over the operational responsibility to the state government.“A comprehensive view of the security situation in lower Assam is being taken post the Bodoland Territorial Council elections that were held in December 2020 and a decision on disengagement of remaining forces will also be deliberated upon subsequently,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-plans-to-deploy-10-000-troops-as-lac-reinforcements-101611266923783.html
22-01-2021||India||SC notice on plea to ban Mirzapur web series, set up pre-screening body for OTT||The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice on a petition seeking a ban on the popular web series ‘Mirzapur’ on Amazon Prime Video for its obscene, vulgar depiction of women and showing the city, otherwise famous for its rich cultural and historical value, as a city of goons, criminals and women indulging in adultery.The petition filed by Sujeet Kumar Singh, a resident of Mirzapur district in Uttar Pradesh, said, “Showing such ridiculous and shameless things on a city or district is an insult to approximately 30 lakh population (residing in Mirzapur) and the rich culture of Mirzapur.” The web series Mirzapur was launched in 2018 by Excel Entertainment and due to its successful run, the second edition of the web series was launched in October 2020.The petition demanded an immediate ban on further screening of the web series and sought directions from the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to set up a pre-screening committee for censoring content of similar web series, movies or other programmes release on over the top (OTT) platforms. Further, no content should be released on the online streaming platforms without obtaining a certificate from the said authority, the petition added.“The web series ‘Mirzapur’ is full with nudity, vulgarity, harsh and abusive language which is a violation of Cinematograph Act and Information Technology Act. It (web series) also violates Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act as it shows women as sex toys…. raises a finger on relation of daughter-in-law and father-in-law,” stated the petition drawn up by Rudra Vikram Singh. In this regard, the petition even sought action against Excel Entertainment, Amazon Prime Video and the actors in the web series for violating the above laws.Quite contrary to what is being depicted, the petition highlighted the rich legacy of this district that once served among the biggest trading centres in northern India of the 17th century. This place is home to the famous Vindhyachal temple which is situated here River Ganga meets Vindhya Range and the red marbles of Mirzapur were used by Emperor Ashoka to make Ashok Stambh and Baudh Stup, the petition stated.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde issued notice on the petition. The petitioner informed the Court that the matter could be heard along with a separate PIL pending consideration before the Court where a demand has been raised to monitor and regulate content on the OTT platforms.On this petition filed by two lawyers Shashank Shekhar Jha and Apurva Arhatia , the Court issued notice on October 15 last year. The petition had pointed out the legal loophole that allowed uncensored screening of movies or web series on OTT platforms. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certificate applies for movies meant for theatrical exhibition alone, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-on-plea-to-ban-mirzapur-web-series-set-up-pre-screening-body-for-ott-101611258594983.html

If vaccines get frozen, then they will be wasted. Our goal is to ensure that every citizen gets the vaccine without any wastage.”RC Gautam, state cold chain officer said that the main focus of the officials is to ensure that the temperature of the vaccines is maintained between two degrees to eight degrees Celsius.“The first thing I do when I reach office is to personally go and check the temperatures of the vaccines. The same routine is followed at the end of the day before leaving. The temperatures are noted down for regular monitoring. We have to regularly ensure that temperature is maintained as per the guidelines because we cannot let the vaccines go waste. We also have auto-connection generators so that cooling is not stopped even during power cuts,” said Gautam.Gautam manages the state cold chain storage where vaccines for Covid-19, measles, rubella, Hepatitis B and other diseases are kept.Uttarakhand at present has over 92,000 doses of Covishield vaccine, after a second consignment was received by the state on Wednesday afternoon. The state received the first consignment of 1.13 lakh vaccines on January 13.“From the moment they are unloaded from the flight till they reach the regional stores or district stores, we continuously monitor the movement of the vaccines. Though all our drivers are trained in handling vaccines but still, each time before sending vaccines to different districts, we give special instructions to drivers that they should not stop the vehicle anywhere, neither should anyone attempt to open the packages,” he added.Speaking on why the drivers are instructed to not stop while delivering vaccines, Gautam said, “We package the vaccines in such a manner with cold packs inside the boxes, that the required temperatures are maintained. But if drivers stop in between then there are slight chances of the temperature changing due to different altitude.”So far, the state has not reported any wastage of vaccines.The Uttarakhand government has developed over 300 cold chain points, where the vaccines are stored in temperatures between two and eight degrees as guided by the Centre. Further, 483 ice-lined refrigerators, 547 deep freezers and three walk-in freezers have been arranged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-temperature-checks-regular-monitoring-keep-vaccines-safe-in-uttarakhand-101611258036674.html
22-01-2021||India||SC issues notice on BJP leader's plea, wants Mumbai mayor's response in 15 days||The Supreme Court on Thursday set out to examine a plea by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staking claim for the post of the Leader of the Opposition in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) which currently has the Mayor and the LOP, both belonging to different political parties but having allegiance to the same ruling coalition in the state.The plea before the court was made by BJP councillor Prabhakar Tukaram Shinde, who is currently the Group Leader of the BJP in MCGM.Issuing a notice on Shinde’s petition, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde asked the MCGM and its Mayor to respond whether the power to have a Leader of Opposition for the House could be exercised only once during the term of the House.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said, “We want to know if the power of the Mayor (in appointing a Leader of Opposition) once exercised cannot be exercised again.” Shinde’s petition was aggrieved by the order passed by the Mayor on March 5, 2020 rejecting his demand to be made Leader of Opposition in MCGM.In the 227-member House, Shiv Sena has 97 councillors while the second largest party having numerical strength is the BJP with 83 seats. The Indian National Congress (INC) with only 29 seats presently has its member as Leader of Opposition. In 2017, when elections to MCGM were held, BJP remained neutral and decided against taking up the post of the Leader of Opposition. Thus the post fell in favour of INC councillor Ravi Raja.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi who appeared for Shinde said, “When the leader of the largest opposition party is willing to take up the responsibility of the leader of opposition, the law does not deny him the same merely because he had initially expressed unwillingness to do so for various considerations.” Shinde had earlier approached the Bombay High Court which rejected his petition on September 21 last year.The CJI-headed bench asked Rohatgi, “You chose not to be the leader of opposition.” Rohatgi said that the matter involved the interpretation of Section 37-IA which provides that the post of Leader of Opposition is not permanent and can be changed looking at the changed political dynamics in the state. This fact was recorded by Shinde in his petition, stating, “This arrangement wherein member of the ruling coalition occupy the Treasury as well as post of Leader of Opposition is nothing but a mockery of democracy.”Senior advocate C Aryama Sundaram appeared for the MCGM and the Mayor and agreed to respond to Shinde’s petition. The bench sought their response in 15 days and made it clear to all parties that the issue will be decided on the next date of hearing and the matter shall be disposed. The tenure of the House is due to get over by February 2022. Shinde told the Court, “Four years have gone by. I want to be appointed as leader of opposition for at least one year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-on-bjp-leader-s-plea-wants-mumbai-mayor-s-response-in-15-days-101611256100578.html

22-01-2021||India||Citizenship row hits GTA chairman Anit Thapa after Nepalese portal’s claim||A Kathmandu-based news portal sparked a row in the north Bengal hills on Thursday with a report that claimed that Anit Thapa, chairman of board of administrators of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), is a Nepali citizen.Thapa, who is also the general secretary of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Binoy Tamang faction) refuted the allegations and said: “It is a conspiracy to malign me.”The Nepali news portal on Thursday morning published news with the heading “India’s leader Nepal’s citizenship.”In its report, the portal said that Thapa had gone to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 1995. It also claimed Thapa’s Nepali citizenship was issued from Nepal’s Jhapa district in 1994 and he was shown as the son of one Binod Thapa but there was man by that name in the said address. Thapa had stayed in Dubai for two years before he returned to Nepal, the news portal wrote.Later in the day, Thapa issued a statement saying: “The allegation is baseless and is a conspiracy against me. If anyone can prove the allegation, he can file a case against me. Every time when Darjeeling hills raise the voice in the interest of Indian Gorkhas, conspiracy is hatched to throttle the voice.”He denied going to Dubai and said: “I went to Sweden and Europe on Indian passport. I was an Indian citizen and I am an Indian citizen.”For years, Thapa has been accused of holding dual citizenship (of India and Nepal). In January, 2020 the sub-divisional officer of Kurseong in Darjeeling district had issued a general notice asking people to appear before him in connection with the information regarding Thapa’s alleged Nepali citizenship.The notice was issued with reference to an anonymous letter written to the Union home minister on August 12, 2019 in connection with Thapa’s alleged Nepali citizenship.“We had conducted the enquiry and had forwarded the findings to the district magistrate,” said Abhishek Chaurasia the Kurseong sub-divisional officer.While Shashank Sethi, the district magistrate of Darjeeling could not be contacted despite repeated attempts, Chaurasia refused to divulge any details of the enquiry.The opposition parties in the hills attacked Thapa soon after the news went viral.Mahendra Chettri, the Gorkha National Liberation Front spokesperson said, “We demand action against Thapa for holding dual citizenship.”Kalyan Dewan, president of the BJP’s Darjeeling hills district committee said: "The allegation is serious and the onus of proving the allegations false lies with Thapa himself."Santa Chhetri, TMC's Rajya Sabha MP said: "It is the duty of the government to investigate."Roshan Giri, general secretary of the GJM (Bimal Gurung faction) said, “We will comment only after consulting legal experts.”Thapa was one of the main trusted lieutenants of Bimal Gurung who founded the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) in 2007 to spearhead the movement for a separate state of Gorkhaland in Darjeeling hills.In 2017, when the Gorkhaland movement had rocked the Darjeeling hills for three months, Thapa and Binoy Tamang joined hands with the West Bengal government that effectively derailed the movement.The GJM split and Tamang headed the new faction while Gurung went into hiding after being charged under anti-terror law by the Mamata Banerjee government. The state government installed Tamang as the chairman of the board of administrators in the semi-autonomous GTA in September 2017. Thapa became its chairman, after Tamang resigned from the post to unsuccessfully contest a bye-election for Darjeeling assembly seat in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citizenship-row-hits-gta-chairman-anit-thapa-after-nepalese-portal-s-claim-101611254321574.html
22-01-2021||India||Dissent escalates in K’taka BJP against BSY after cabinet reshuffle||Bengaluru: Hours after he shuffled his cabinet to allocate portfolios to newly inducted ministers, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa faced a backlash on Thursday from both the old guard and the new entrants, leaving the 77-year-old seemingly isolated.The new ministers as well as those who were divested of key portfolios hit back at the chief minister. The CM inducted seven ministers into his cabinet on January 13.At least three ministers--N.Nagaraju, K.Gopalaiah and K.C.Narayana Gowda--met at health minister K.Sudhakar’s residence and later called on Yediyurappa to express their anger at the distribution of portfolios. “There isn’t much I can do in the excise department and had asked for a portfolio which is more development -oriented. I have conveyed this to the CM,” Nagaraju said. Gopalaiah, who was stripped of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs ministry, sought to know what he had done to deserve such treatment. Yediyurappa, revenue minister R.Ashok and home minister Basavaraj Bommai, among others, swung into damage control mode . “There is no difference of opinion among the new ministers,” Yediyurappa claimed, flanked by Ashok and Bommai, who helped him to calm the dissidents, at least temporarily. Many of the ministers unhappy with the changes did not attend a cabinet meeting on Thursday, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. Sudhakar, who fought hard to wrest control of the medical education department from B.Sriramulu at the peak of the pandemic, and succeeded, was stripped of the portfolio in the reshuffle. With no backing from the central leadership of the Bharatiua Janata Party (BJP), Yediyurappa now finds himself confronting a burst of dissidence that has the potential to end another term of the Lingayat leader in the chief minister’s office well ahead of the end of his tenure.Even J.C.Madhuswamy, a key member of Yediyurappa’s inner circle, expressed his unhappiness at being divested of the minor irrigation, law and parliamentary affairs portfolios. “We will wait till the current crisis to play out and then put in motion our plans to be heard by the party,” said one BJP legislator, requesting not to be named. The lack of action against Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal) for open rebellion against the chief minister was an indication of Yediyurappa’s souring relations with the central leadership of the BJP, analysts said. “This is a repeat of what happened from 2008-13 in Karnataka. Corruption is increasing and in the due course, all these irregularities will be exposed. There is no money for relief measures, but the government is busy with its internal bickering. All this will help the Congress in the future,” said Ramalinga Reddy, working president of the Karnataka unit of the Congress party. The analysts said central leadership of the BJP seems to have left it to Yediyurappa to deal with the problem. “If the high command wants to control dissent, they can, but they have left it at Yediyurappa’s doorstep, stating that you brought them, so you control them. Basically he has been left to fend for himself,” said A.Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University. At the core of the chaos are members of the Congress and the JD(S), whom Yediyurappa convinced to resign, a move that brought down the alliance government of the two parties in the state. In all, 17 members resigned from the legislature. In the subsequent by-election, 14 of them contested , 11 won, and sought their promised rewards, a ministerial berth. The CM’s unsuccessful attempt to meet heir demand has left both the defectors and the party’s old loyalists unhappy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-escalates-in-k-taka-bjp-against-bsy-after-cabinet-reshuffle-101611254490614.html
22-01-2021||India||Will decide in 4 weeks on mercy plea of Rajiv case convict: TN Guv to SC||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Thursday told the Supreme Court that a decision on the mercy petition of one of the convicts serving a life sentence for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, AG Perarivalan will be taken within four weeks. The petition has been pending with the Governor since December 30, 2015.During pendency of the mercy plea, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet in September 2018 recommended release of all seven convicts including Perarivalan for their involvement in the 1991 assassination. Citing inaction on part of the Governor tin deciding on his clemency plea moved under Article 161 of the Constitution, Perarivalan came to Supreme Court for passing necessary directions.On Thursday, in a surprise turn of events, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the Governor before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer and Indu Malhotra. Though the Governor is not a party in Perarivalan’s petition, the court wished to know his stand. Mehta informed the court that within three to four weeks, a decision will be taken “as per the Constitution”.The bench recorded this statement and adjourned the matter for four weeks. The court’s order said: “The learned Solicitor General submitted that the application filed by the petitioner under Article 161 of the Constitution of India shall be considered within four weeks from today.”In the past, the court had been critical of mercy petitions not being addressed. In this case, Perivalan has spent almost three decades in jail. Perarivalan was among seven persons convicted by a Special TADA court for being part of the conspiracy to assassinate former PM Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991. In November 2020, during the arguments on Perarivalan’s petition, the Centre took a legal objection to the Governor having power to decide on the mercy plea. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) KM Nataraj who represented the Centre argued that the entire issue of granting remission in such a case lies with the President under Article 72 and not the Governor under Article 161.Article 161 gives the Governor the “power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends”. The Raj Bhavan in Chennai said that an official statement will be made after receiving information from Solicitor General Mehta.Perarivalan’s counsel, senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan objected to the Centre taking this objection for the first time in these proceedings. He pointed out that in September 2018, the State Cabinet had already decided on the petitioner’s release. If this submission of Centre was accepted, Shankarnaraynan wondered what would happen to the pardon powers exercised by Governors over the past 70 years.Perarivalan in his petition told the Court that after filing his mercy petition, the investigating officer in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case made a disclosure that he made a mistake by excluding the exculpatory parts of the statement given by Perarivalan during the recording of his evidence. Perarivalan has maintained throughout that he had no knowledge of the plot while supplying the battery that would go on to power the belt bomb used by the suicide bomber.Tamil Nadu’s Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan informed the apex court on November 3 last year that the Governor had sought a report from the Union Home Ministry under which a multi-disciplinary probe is underway on the larger conspiracy behind the former PM’s assassination. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which is spearheading the probe filed an affidavit before the top court on November 20, 2020 stating that it had nothing to do with this matter as remission under Article 161 was purely between the convict and the Governor. In Tamil Nadu, both the ruling AIADMK and the Opposition DMK have previously spoken in support of the convicts’ release. In November last year, DMK president MK Stalin met the governor and urged him to release the seven prisoners on humanitarian grounds.

22-01-2021||India||Ahead of elections, TMC says BSF being misused||Kolkata The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has lodged a complaint with the Election Commission of India alleging that the Border Security Force was threatening people living in areas in the state bordering Bangladesh, asking them to vote for a particular political party. While the party did not name the Bharatiya Janata Party, it implied that it was referring to the national party which has emerged its main rival in the state. The BJP, meanwhile has alleged that at least 400,000- 500,000 Rohingyas, who illegally entered the country through the Indo-Bangla border, have been included in the voters’ list and urged the poll panel to order a special audit of the electoral roll. Elections in the state are likely in the first half of the year. “BSF personnel are going to border villages and threatening villagers to vote for a particular political party. Villagers are being told that the state administration won’t be able to help them and that they would be left at the mercy of BSF. We have taken up the matter with the ECI,” said Partha Chatterjee, TMC general secretary and state education minister, after meeting the Chief Election Commissioner.  BSF, however, has refuted the charges saying that the allegations were baseless and far from truth “ BSF is a professional border guarding force. We have actively checked on illegal infiltration and smuggling and criminals involved in such activities have been brought to book. The statements made by Chatterjee, are without any basis and far from truth,” said a statement issued by the force. Representatives of both parties met Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and the two election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar on Thursday. The full bench of the ECI is in West Bengal on a two-day visit to take stock of the election preparedness and law and order situation in the poll-bound state. “Border areas are very sensitive. We have urged ECI to cross-check the voters’ list in some areas where there has been an alarming increase in number of electors,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP president in West Bengal , claiming that at least 400,000- 500,000 lakh Rohingyas have been included in the list. The BJP in its letter to ECI alleged that at least five border districts – Malda, Murshidabad, Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur, and South 24 Parganas – have registered high population growth in the last four years. Three of these – Malda Murshidabad and Uttar Dinajpur have a Muslim majority, according to the 2011 census. HT could not independently ascertain whether this is the case. The BJP team has also demanded that central forces be deployed at least 15 days before the polls. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha pols where the party won 18 of the 42 seats in the state, the BJP has set a target of winning more than 200 seats in the 294-seated legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-elections-tmc-says-bsf-being-misused-101611254310518.html

22-01-2021||India||India sends 3 mn vaccine doses to neighbours, Pak gets some from China||China has offered 500,000 doses of a Coronavirus vaccine to its ally Pakistan, an apparent response to the rolling out of supplies by India for its neighbours and key partners, including three million doses delivered to Bangladesh and Nepal on Thursday.Two Indian flights carried two million doses of Covishield to Dhaka and one million doses to Kathmandu, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that supplies would be sent to Seychelles (50,000 doses), Mauritius (100,000 doses) and Myanmar (1.5 million doses) on Friday.Seven countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius – are part of India’s initial rollout of vaccines as grant assistance. There are also plans to supply doses to Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.The people added commercial supplies of Covishield to several countries that have agreements with the Serum Institute of India will also begin from Friday. Two flights will carry two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco early on Friday morning.After a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi announced on Thursday that Beijing had gifted 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as aid.“I want to give the nation the good news that China has promised to immediately provide 500,000 doses of vaccine to Pakistan by January 31,” Qureshi said. “They (China) have said you can send your airplane and immediately airlift this drug,”Qureshi quoted Wang as saying that Pakistan was the first country China thought of assisting with vaccines in view of their "all-weather strategic relationship". He also said China would supply more than a million doses by February.Pakistan is currently the world’s most populous country that hasn’t rolled out a vaccination programme. It is also the only country in the region to have approved the Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use. The approval for Sinopharm earlier this week came days after Pakistan cleared the AstraZeneca vaccine.The two million doses gifted by India to Bangladesh were handed over by Indian envoy Vikram Doraiswami to foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and health minister Zahid Maleque in Dhaka. This was the single largest consignment of vaccines provided by India to any country so far.Momen said India had stood by Bangladesh during the Liberation War of 1971 as well as the pandemic that had impacted the world. “This proves the true friendship between Bangladesh and India,” he said.India’s vaccine assistance reached Nepal within a week of a request made by visiting Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali during a visit to New Delhi last week. While handing over the supplies to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Kathmandu, Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra said this reflected “India’s Neighbourhood First policy in action”.Oli thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for the “generous grant of one million doses of Covid vaccine to Nepal at this critical time when India is rolling out vaccination for its own people”.Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16. The assistance came against the backdrop of China’s efforts to forge cooperation in fighting Covid-19 within South Asia by holding meetings with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since last year.Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash lauded the alacrity with which the Indian government had responded to the needs of its neighbours, saying it was in line with its efforts to be the first responder in all emergency situations.“This is my definition of the Neighbourhood First policy. It is the kind of policy and approach that we need to follow and its shows the difference between India and other countries. I can’t think of such selflessness by any other country in an hour of need.”Observers have noted that India speedily rolled out millions of doses as aid despite the massive requirements of its own vaccination drive that began on January 16.

He had told the Congress MPs that it was due to the intense efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that India’s relationship with Gulf countries had gone way beyond diaspora and energy as in the past.The state of the relationship will be on display later this month when the United Arab Emirates Air Force will handle the mid-air refuelling of India’s three Rafale fighter jets flying into the Indian Air Force station at Ambala from France, people familiar with the matter said.The UAE air force’s Airbus multi-role transport tanker will twice refuel the three Indian fighter jets on their non-stop eight-hour flight from Bordeaux-Merignac base in France to join the Golden Arrows Squadron in Ambala.When five Rafale fighters flew non-stop to India from France on July 29, 2020, the aircraft was refuelled four times by a French MRTT.The UAE air force’s gesture is the first-of-its-kind and reflects how the two countries are rapidly cementing their security ties, a person familiar with the matter said. The next level would be trilateral military exercises involving France, UAE and India.Officials said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, one of the key architects of relations with UAE and Saudi Arabia, and Diplomatic Advisor to the French President, Emmanuel Bonne, had discussed the trilateral military exercises during the strategic dialogue held during Bonne’s India visit on January 6.Also Read: On Rafale and deadly Panther choppers, India gets a huge offer from FranceIndia and UAE have forged a very close relationship since 2014 with PM Modi leading the initiative. This is in sharp contrast to the state of bilateral ties in 1999 when UAE hadn’t allowed the Indian Ambassador to enter the airbase where Indian Airlines’ hijacked plane, IC-814, had refuelled before flying to Taliban-controlled Kandahar airport. Today, New Delhi and Abu Dhabi not only have multi-faceted security ties but also exchange vital information about the respective regions. It is due to such close ties, that UAE has deported over 100 Indian criminals taking shelter in the Emirates since 2014, a senior diplomat said.The UAE Air Force will also provide mid-air refuelling to the next batch of seven Rafale fighters coming to India in the second half of April. As of now, four French Air Force’s Rafale fighters along with an Airbus MRTT are exercising with the Indian Air Force in the skies over Pokhran. The French fighters will later participate in annual exercises with the Australian Air Force. India is also considering Airbus MRTT as one of the options to boost IAF’s power projection and endurance in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-3-rafales-reaching-india-to-be-refuelled-mid-air-by-uae-air-force-101611209885564.html

22-01-2021||Today's||To protect women, challenge patriarchy||Seldom has the State’s concern to protect one half of its citizens been so high. In Andhra Pradesh, a Disha law. In Maharashtra, a Shakti Bill. And “love jihad” ordinances in three states. All in the name of protecting women.We should be so reassured. But even as Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was launching a “samman” (respect) programme, explaining how employed women can register at the local thana so that they can be tracked for their own safety, came news of nine men raping a 13-year-old multiple times over a span of a couple of days in Umaria.India’s endemic rape problem is a matter of concern. Laws passed since 2013 have not flatlined the graph. In nine states, the number of young women who faced sexual violence as children has gone up, finds the latest round of the National Family Health Survey.Now, Maharashtra’s stringent Shakti Bill, based on Andhra Pradesh’s Disha law, expands the death sentence for rape, but also dilutes the standards of consent, making rape more difficult to prove in courts. An outcry by women activists has led to a review.So many laws, still no solution. Perhaps because there’s a contradiction here. The contradiction in wanting to protect women but within the decorous folds of patriarchy. We will keep women “safe” as long as they are bound by family structures, even though data on domestic violence and sexual abuse tells us the family is not the safest place.In Uttar Pradesh (UP), the police have announced they will use artificial intelligence to spot women in “distress”. How is distress defined? How this will work is yet to be revealed. What we do know is that UP subscribes to the idea of the helpless Hindu woman duped by the scheming Muslim man. This is the bedrock of its “love jihad” law that robs adult women of autonomy, an autonomy that the Allahabad High Court and some other courts still defend.Safety means empowering all women — single, divorced, rebellious — to live as equal citizens. It means respecting women’s choices. Rape stems from male entitlement and the idea that a woman’s consent doesn’t count. You cannot solve it with laws that spring from the same patriarchal mindset.This mindset is not limited to our legislators. The chief justice of our highest court wants women to stay away from protests, as if we have not been an integral part of movements from Independence and Chipko onwards.The head of the National Commission of Women (NCW) meets the Maharashtra governor to discuss “love jihad”, even though NCW has no evidence of it. One of its members says a rape and murder in Badaun could have been avoided if the 50-year-old anganwadi worker had not ventured out alone in the evening. Clearly, we are looking at the wrong solutions. A good start is a new vocabulary. Reduce words like “protection” and “respect”. Embrace a more affirmative language of empowerment, independence, rights.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-protect-women-challenge-patriarchy-101611335566565.html
22-01-2021||Today's||When invasion of privacy comes back full circle||At a personal level, I find it abhorrent that it has become par for the course for our private conversations, on the phone or on WhatsApp, to slip so easily into the public domain. Where they are then torn apart salaciously, discussed, and distorted without context or due process. It actually militates against all principles of natural justice.Yet, like so many others, I too felt the “aha” moment, looking at the ethical scandal that has enveloped Republic TV anchor and promoter, Arnab Goswami. There was no escaping the grand irony. A bombastic man who has been not just the judge, but also the hangman at a private kangaroo court, night after night, distributing and withdrawing certificates of patriotism and propriety, has now been tripped by the proverbial shoe on the other foot.Just a few months ago, Goswami — as well as all prominent anchors from his competing television networks, including those who are hand-wringing about him now — were using someone else’s leaked WhatsApp conversations as “evidence” to brand a young woman, Rhea Chakraborty as a murderer. Based on strands of conversation, entirely decontextualised, there were even whisper campaigns about the appropriateness of her relationship with Mahesh Bhatt.And the same leaks and casual exchanges — which is how people talk when they think no one is listening — were used by Goswami and his cohorts to malign several directors and actors as drug-peddlers. Reputations were bent and broken, people convicted and buried, as gloating television hosts danced on their metaphorical graves, in a grotesque modern-day medieval witch hunt.Thus, of all the people in this world, the one person who cannot lay any claim to privacy or being misunderstood or misrepresented is Goswami. I have not had the patience to trawl through the miles of his once private, now public, exchanges with the former head of India’s TV rating agency.But the parts that really stayed with me were his gleeful reductionism over the horrific terror strike in Pulwama and the subsequent strike in Balakot. Again, it is the hypocrisy that is staggering. Channels such as the one run by Goswami have reduced the dignified constitutional patriotism that guides the Indian spirit to a prime-time caricature. People have been declared traitors because he willed it so. The banality of descriptives such as “anti-national” has rolled off his tongue with wilful destructiveness.So, at this moment, we seek to measure him only by his own standards. What might he have said about a colleague in the media fraternity who was caught talking similarly on her phone? I have often argued with my liberal friends for their failure to gauge the pulse of the country on national security. But no soldier or soldier’s family that I know would find it pardonable that lives lost in the line of duty are treated as fodder for television eyeballs. As Apurva Purohit, the daughter of a soldier killed in the terror strike told me, “This is disgusting. This is not what my father died for.”Again, from anyone else, I would be sympathetic to the argument that there is not a human being alive who would be comfortable with what they believe to be their private space suddenly ripped open for the world to see.Ten years ago, I was hauled over the coals by media colleagues for a conversation on what came to be called the Radia Tapes. Shocked, hurt that my integrity had been questioned over a man I had never met or spoken to in my life — the then telecom minister, A Raja — I opened myself to a one-hour interrogation by my peers on national television, ready to answer anything asked of me, adamant that I had done no wrong and my work spoke for itself. As someone who asked questions of people all my life, I was ready to face them too. But then and now, I saw it as a deeply dangerous media-manufactured narrative to selectively target competitors within the fraternity.Today, I am struck by how life turns full circle. The sanctimony that a section of the media wears like a second skin comes undone so fast when the scrutiny is on them. In many ways, we journalists, so trapped by egos and the ratings wars, have brought this moment upon ourselves. Instead of acknowledging that there may not be even one of us whose loose, casual talk, with sources and friends alike, would pass everyone’s test of approval, we have spent our energy on tripping the other and weakening the fighting capacity of our profession.And Arnab Goswami is a parable for the Republic. And for the times we live in.Barkha Dutt is an award-winning journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/when-invasion-of-privacy-comes-back-full-circle-101611335386803.html
22-01-2021||Editorials||Decoding the 50,000 mark||The occasion of Sensex, the benchmark index of BSE crossing 50,000 (it has since fallen below that level), has been used by analysts to don their cheerleader costumes and predict that it could touch 100,000 in the next five years. That’s entirely possible — the general direction of any sound equity index in the long-term is northward — but it must be acknowledged that at this point in time, three-quarters of the way through a year when the Indian economy will shrink by 7.7%, the index, and by extension, the market, do appear overheated. On Thursday, the day when the index crossed 50,000, India’s price-earnings multiple (a measure of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued) was 34.36. The average PE multiple of the S&P 500 is around 13-15, and by any measure, and in any market, a multiple of 34.36 is definitely high. And only six of the constituents of the Sensex have a so-called PEG ratio (the Price Earnings Multiple compared to earnings growth) less than 1, an indication that they are undervalued. The rest, like many other stocks in the Indian market, are perhaps overvalued.Still, both the PE multiple and the PEG ratio are based on past (or trailing) earnings, and the market is booming today because people expect the future to be rosier. There is some merit in that. The economy is expected to grow in 2021-22 (by 8.8%, according to the International Monetary Fund), and in 2022-23 (when the services sector is really expected to revive after the pandemic). There is also a global surge in liquidity, facilitated by a loose monetary policy across the world, and at least some of that money is flowing into India. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought around $23 billion of Indian equities in 2020, the highest across emerging markets. That could continue through 2021. And companies (at least the good ones that happen to be in sectors that are reviving fast) are expected to do better too; according to a research note from UBS Global Wealth Management, earnings of companies in developing countries could increase 28% this year. That kind of growth could mean saner PE multiples and PEG ratios if future earnings are considered. The questions investors have to ask themselves, as always, have to do with their investment goals, risk appetite, and time frame. That is more important than being carried away by the euphoria brought about by big numbers — such as 50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/decoding-the-50-000-mark-hteditorial-101611323865844.html
22-01-2021||Editorials||Farmers should shed rigidity||Fifty-six days after farmers — largely from Punjab and Haryana — blocked Delhi’s borders, demanding the repeal of farm laws, the government, on Wednesday, offered to suspend the farm laws for a period of 18 months and set up a committee with representatives from both sides to discuss all issues. The farm unions, on Thursday, rejected the proposal, reiterated their demand for a repeal of laws, and decided to continue protests. This is questionable, both in terms of principle and tactics.This newspaper has stressed that the farm laws will open up India’s agricultural markets, enable greater choice for farmers, and create a mechanism for closer agri-industry interface. The ideal scenario would have been sticking to reforms after winning over the protesting farmers and addressing their reservations. But the government’s decision to retreat was understandable. The political logic of continuing with the reforms, in the face of the mass movement, at a time when there are multiple other crises facing the nation, was becoming increasingly untenable. With its offer, the government was hoping to send a signal of reconciliation, defuse a potentially volatile situation, and buy time. The retreat holds a lesson — any structural economic change must involve wider democratic deliberation.But even as the government has stepped back, farm unions have stuck to a rigid position. This suggests disregard for the process of lawmaking. In a democracy, farm groups exercised their right to protest — but they should not take over the rights of a sovereign Parliament and an elected government, and dictate terms from the streets. It appears that farm groups are not willing to meet the government midway, when it has, for all practical purposes, backtracked. This derails the process of democracy, which necessarily involves a spirit of accommodation. Farm groups also run the risk of losing out on wider public support and solidarity. In the middle of an agitation, protesters can make the mistake of overestimating their strength — but then a law of diminishing returns sets in. This is a crucial moment for farm groups. They would be served well to treat the government’s new proposal as a victory, revise their position, and engage in consultations with the government to chart future reforms. India needs agri reforms — and it can only come through a process of dialogue. The government has stepped back. It is time for farm groups to reciprocate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-centre-retreats-101611239789549.html
22-01-2021||Editorials||The Congress must get its act together||On Friday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) is set to meet to discuss the way forward for the party’s organisational makeover and elections. This is long due. There is an acute leadership crisis in the Congress — Sonia Gandhi is president but doesn’t want to be in charge; Rahul Gandhi doesn’t want to be president but is the key power centre; and other aspirants don’t quite know whether the Nehru-Gandhi family wants to be in or out.There is an acute organisational crisis — state units are ridden with factionalism, and even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) builds its election-winning machine on the ground, the Congress footprint is shrinking. And there is an acute ideological crisis — the party vacillates between being Centre-Right on identity issues, carefully staying away from minority-related concerns or questions of secularism and nationalism, while being pretty far to the Left on economic issues, as evidenced in Rahul Gandhi’s attack on farm laws and Indian capitalism.CWC is itself a part of the problem, for it is a body of nominated individuals, many with limited or non-existent mass base who have thrived on patronage politics. The room for dissent in the party is limited even as leaders can see that its electoral prospects — in both state polls and 2024 elections — remain dim. All of this calls not just for another routine working committee meeting which produces a statement about having faith in the current leadership. What is needed is a radical surgery and an overhaul at each level of the party. The Congress owes it to Indian democracy to get its act together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-congress-must-get-its-act-together-101611235169260.html
