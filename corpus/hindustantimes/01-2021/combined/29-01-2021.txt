The three mutual and eight broad propositions spelt out by the minister, who was India’s longest-serving envoy to China over the past decade, are reminders to Beijing that the bilateral relationship between the two Asian powers is not a one-way street. The proposition that India and China are civilization states, something that Beijing seems so reluctant to acknowledge about New Delhi, is designed to remind the Middle Kingdom that all civilization states have their ups and downs in their history and nothing is permanent.That the Xi Jinping regime must adhere to all past agreements and desist from any unilateral change of status quo of LAC is also a clear message from the Modi government that any new agreement, possibly on disengagement and de-escalation, will have credibility only if the past understandings are honoured in letter and spirit. Simply put, the Modi government wants iron-clad guarantees that China will not repeat the 2020 aggression on the north or south banks of Pangong Tso if and when the Indian Army goes back to its permanent base as part of any future understanding on East Ladakh.In his speech, Jaishankar has yellow-carded China for using Pakistan as a proxy in its rivalry with India and at the same time expecting New Delhi to be neutral in its conduct of foreign policy. The fact is that China has used Pakistan to block India’s entry into the Nuclear’s Suppliers Group though the two ‘iron brothers’, as Islamabad and Beijing describe their relationship, have a patchy track record on nuclear non-proliferation.China also backed Pakistan to get global terrorists such as Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar off the hook at the UNSC 1267 committee while both of them tried to frame Indian engineers working in Afghanistan in terror cases.In the present context too, Beijing has been talking about de-escalation plans with New Delhi for East Ladakh but has been making aggressive moves in north Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.While Beijing routinely fires threats at other countries including India to dissuade them from taking up the issue of Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong or Taiwan, China hasn’t respected Indian sovereignty by taking up huge infrastructure projects in the occupied Northern Areas and Kashmir in its endeavour to use warm water ports of Gwadar and Karachi for trade with Middle-East and the Persian Gulf.Jaishankar’s speech, delivered against this backdrop, signals India’s determination to continue to stand up to Xi Jinping’s expansionist plans for Asia as an equal and make it clear that nothing that Beijing does against India will be overlooked, or allowed to go unpunished. The ball is firmly in China’s court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/jaishankar-yellow-cards-china-for-violations-of-pacts-spells-out-the-india-way-101611905237020.html
29-01-2021||News||Jack Ma story: China’s deep strategic ambition||Earlier this month, the Chinese tech tycoon, Jack Ma, made his first public appearance ever since the suspension of Ant Group’s $37 billion IPO in November. Ant is an affiliate company of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant that he co-founded. The crackdown on Ant followed Jack Ma’s comments in late October during a public event in Shanghai. He had then criticised Chinese regulators for harbouring a “pawnshop mentality,” focusing on pledges and collaterals when it came to finance.According to the Wall Street Journal’s reportage, this was the last straw in the battle between the regulators and Jack Ma, with President Xi Jinping personally engaged in greenlighting regulations that would scuttle Ant’s plans. The politics of personalities, of course, is a key component of all of this. However, viewing the developments with regard to Ant simply through such a prism or as an issue of Jack Ma being tamed after he had become too big for his boots is missing the woods for the trees. Ant Group’s case lies at the intersection of the changes that are taking place in the Chinese Party-State’s approach to the financial and technology sectors. Essentially, these are about expanding the State’s authority over private entities to meet the challenges of stability and direct capital towards strategic imperatives. This approach is captured in official statements that talk about “preventing capital from expanding in a disorderly fashion,” something that was among the eight priorities identified after December’s Central Economic Work Conference.As far back as 2017, Xi had listed “preventing financial risks” as one of the “three tough battles” that the party must prioritise. Given the expanding size of the fintech sector, stricter regulations shouldn’t really come as a surprise. Ant, of course, is the leader in this space. It operates Alipay, a payments app with more than 1.3 billion users. An overwhelming majority of these come from China, with others coming via e-wallet partnerships in other countries, including India. Over the years, Alipay has expanded the scope of its services to include online shopping along with linking to a suite of wealth management products and lending services. As part of the latter, it connects banks to small firms and individuals. According to estimates, Ant has facilitated loans to more than 20 million small businesses and hundreds of millions of individuals. The risk in all of this is largely borne by banks, while Ant earns a transaction fee. For instance, Ant reportedly funds merely two per cent of its consumer loans, estimated at $257 billion. This expansion into multiple business streams, the ability to then pick and choose winners, and lack of risk-sharing are what regulators are currently targeting through anti-monopoly rules by placing greater capital requirements for firms engaged in microlending. Ant’s case may have been the trigger, but the changes have sector-wide implications. These are likely to continue to evolve further as the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, operationalises its new digital currency.Reigning in the fintech sector, however, is just one aspect of the sweeping changes taking place across the technology ecosystem in China. There is a slew of regulatory shifts that have either been proposed recently or are being debated. These touch upon areas ranging from data protection and privacy, anti-monopoly, news and content moderation, the scope of internet services and responsibilities of service providers, and taxation of the digital economy. Of course, there are multiple objectives that these changes are seeking to meet, including keeping pace with technological advancement and addressing consumer concerns. But the fundamental principle underlying them is to rebalance the power dynamic between the State and technology firms in favour of the former.The primary driver to do so is the increasing acknowledgement of the strategic role of innovation in powering future growth along with the vision of the State’s role in guiding the markets to ensure this. This was underscored in the communique issued after the Fifth Plenary session in late October, as it was in the statement issued at the end of the Central Economic Work Conference. The latter was categorical. It listed “national strategic scientific and technological strength” as the top priority, and called for a “new nationwide system” that must give “full play to the role of the state as the organizer of major scientific and technological innovation.” This statist vision of the future is very different from the government creating a level-playing field for private capital to compete and the market to do its job. It is about the State guiding capital and private entities towards what it believes are national strategic priorities, rather than allowing them to simply focus on generating greater revenue. These priorities include expanding research and making breakthroughs in core technologies. This, Beijing hopes, will reduce China’s dependence on the West, easing the threat of coercion. At the same time, the regulatory innovation that it is attempting will likely bolster China’s capacity to shape global technology governance norms and standards.Manoj Kewalramani is fellow, China Studies at the Takshashila InstitutionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/jack-ma-story-china-s-deep-strategic-ambition-101611843191458.html
29-01-2021||Noida||Politicians flock to UP Gate protest site after emotional appeal by Rakesh Tikait||A day after the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait broke down and made an emotional appeal to people to provide him with food and water, thousands arrived at the UP Gate protest site on Friday, providing strength to the farmer, whose numbers at the site had declined since the incidents of violence in Delhi on Republic Day (Tuesday). The farmers on Thursday had alleged that the Ghaziabad district administration was trying to pressurise them to leave the site and had snapped electricity and even curtailed their water supply. Tikait had also alleged on Thursday evening that some BJP MLAs were planning attacks on the protesters once he got arrested by the Ghaziabad police. On Friday, the protest site close to Ghazipur in east Delhi saw visits from politicians, with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia arriving in the morning to inspect the arrangements after the Delhi government provided water tankers and mobile toilets at the site. “Delhi chief minister had spoken to Rakesh Tikait who told him that the UP government has snapped power and water supplies. So, we made arrangements of water tankers and toilets and now the farmers can use them. I came here to take a look of the arrangements,” Sisodia told reporters at UP Gate. “We have support for the farmers, and it is unfortunate that they are being termed as violent and traitors .Why is the BJP not able to hear voice of lakhs of farmers, why are they just listening to the voices of a few capitalists,” Sisodia said, while adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should withdraw the three farm laws. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had also tweeted in support of farmers and Rakesh Tikait and stated that the demands raised by farmers were genuine. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, on the other hand, said water supply and electricity had not been stopped.“The number of water tankers had been reduced as the gathering had decreased at UP Gate. So, a few tankers had been deployed elsewhere. The electricity lines had some fault and this was not deliberate. Such issues have taken place previously at UP Gate. We have served them a notice to vacate the site and we are waiting for their reply,” Pandey, added.Later on Friday, senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda also arrived at the UP Gate protest site where he met Rakesh Tikait and other farmer leaders present at the site. Jayant Chaudhary, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader, also met Rakesh Tikait while extending his full support to the ongoing agitation. This was Chaudhary’s second visit to the UP Gate site. “They say that they want an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-sufficient), but call farmers ‘desh drohi’ (anti national) and try to pressurise them through use of force. Farmers will never bow down in such a manner. I have come here to support the farmers as a common man, while our party also fights for their cause,” he added. Another Congress leader, Ajay Kumar Lallu, who is also the president of UP Congress committee, arrived at the UP Gate site to support the ongoing movement. Lallu had previously visited UP Gate on December 5 last year. “We fail to understand why the ‘anna daatas’ (food providers) are given dates after dates but the government is not ready to listen to their voices. About 130 farmers have lost their life during the ongoing agitation. Those who indulged in violence have been identified. It, however, seems like they are being protected. We will raise the issues of farmers in Parliament and even on the streets,” Lallu, said. The committee of farmers at UP Gate have already decided that they will not allow any politicians to share their dais. “Even if a politician comes here to support farmers, they will be treated as guests. We have cases where politicians from the BJP donated us flags and even food items, while not revealing their names. So, anyone who supports the farmers is welcome here,” Rakesh Tikait said at UP Gate on Friday. Chandra Mohan, spokesperson and BJP UP state secretary said that “nautanki” (drama) was being played out by some people in name of farmers’ agitation. “These people have got reduced to zero in politics and have now indulged in negative politics. The BJP has always been instrumental and focussed to increase the income of farmers. Farmers always keep country before self and are very patriotic. Further, we have never termed anyone as ‘gaddar’ and never spoken against any community. Over the issue of the new laws, we have spoken to number of farmers’ organisation who support the new farm laws,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/politicians-flock-to-up-gate-protest-site-after-emotional-appeal-by-rakesh-tikait-101611944958620.html
29-01-2021||Noida||Noida, Greater Noida Ghaziabad only cities across country with ‘severe’ AQI on Friday||Noida: The air quality of Noida and its neighbouring cities turned ‘severe’ on Friday after having remained within the ‘very poor’ category for the past two weeks. Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad were also the only three cities in the entire country to be in the ‘severe’ category of air quality on Friday.Ghaziabad was the most polluted city, followed by Greater Noida and Noida, while rest of the national Capital region were under ‘very poor’ category.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Friday was 423, against 338 a day earlier. Greater Noida’s AQI was 420 against 318 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 415 against 359 on Thursday. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The three cities have been in either ‘very poor’ or ‘severe’ levels of AQI since January 13, while the best air quality last realised was under ‘moderate’ category on January 4. Pollution monitoring agencies stated that the air quality will keep fluctuating into dangerous levels, even as the best respite expected for the next few days will be the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category.“The wind speed was moderate, around 15 kmph, in certain areas of the NCR including south Delhi, however, it went low to around 5 kmph in some parts towards the afternoon. That could be one of the reasons why ventilation in certain areas of NCR has been poor and the particle pollutants could not disperse,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. On Friday, the average volume of major pollutant particulate matter (PM) 2.5 spiked to five times the standard. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Friday was 299.54 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3), against 236.31µg/m3 a day earlier. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 297.23µg/m3, against 233.2µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 324.81µg/m3, against 221.06µg/m3 a day earlier.The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the weather conditions are not too supportive to pull the region’s air quality out of the ‘very poor’ category. “Surface winds are slow and in west south-westerly direction, and forecasted to improve significantly over 48hrs. An improvement in ventilation index is forecasted for the next two days, AQI is likely to marginally improve to the middle to lower-end of the ‘very-poor’ category for Saturday. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate towards the middle-end of the ‘very poor’ category on January 31 and February 1,” said the SAFAR statement on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-greater-noida-ghaziabad-only-cities-across-country-with-severe-aqi-on-friday-101611944959191.html
29-01-2021||Noida||BKU-Lokshakti extends support to Rakesh Tikait at Ghazipur||Bhartiya Kisan Union-Lok Shakti, which had ended its protest at Dalit Prerna Sthal on Thursday, extended its support to Rakesh Tikait on Friday and urged its union members to join protests at Ghazipur. The Bhartiya Kisan Union-Lok Shakti chief Shyoraj Singhsaid that some political leaders and MLAs had infiltrated the protests at Ghazipur border and allegedly threatened farmers on Thursday night. Hence, he added, it was time to support Tikait.Singh on Friday issued a video message and asked all Bhartiya Kisan Union-Lok Shakti members to reach the Ghazipur protest site to support Tikait. “People in western UP should reach Muzaffarnagar protest site. We have decided to support the Ghazipur protest because supporters of an MLA have reached the site and threatened the protesting farmers. The entire incident has deeply hurt Rakesh Tikait, who broke down into tears. The BKU-Lok Shakti will not tolerate such oppressive move,” he said. Singh said that he has sent around 200 supporters to camp at the Ghazipur border in support of Tikait. He said that the district administration and police should negotiate with the farmers and take suitable action and the MLA and his supporters’ involvement was unwanted. It is also expected that some farmers will march from Muzaffarnagar to Ghazipur border to extend support to Tikait. The police teams have been deployed at the Jewar toll plaza on Yamuna Expressway and at Luharli toll plaza in Dadri. Umesh Bahadur, SHO Jewar police station, said that the police have received directions from senior officials to be alert. “We have not been directed to stop farmers,” he said.The Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Lokshakti) members on Thursday had called off their protest at Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal Sector 95 after a police team visited them on Wednesday night and informed them that they did not have permission to continue the protests. The farmer leaders too said that since the protest has lost direction after the Republic Day Delhi violence, they decided to end their protest. They had been camping at the Rashtriya Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 4 last year.Rajesh S, DCP Noida Zone, said that the two protests of BKU-Lok Shakti and BKU-Bhanu peacefully ended in Noida. “There are no farmers protesting in Noida,” he said. Meanwhile, police teams are still deployed outside the Dalit Prerna Sthal and at Chilla border to ensure the protesters do not gather again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bkulokshakti-extends-support-to-rakesh-tikait-at-ghazipur-101611944957442.html
29-01-2021||Noida||Supporters flock to UP Gate at night as Tikait’s emotional appeal goes viral||Ghaziabad: Thirty-two-year-old Amrita Kundu was one of the first farmers’ supporters who reached UP-Gate protest site in Ghaziabad Thursday night from her house in Nangloi, Delhi. She said this was after she saw a video in which Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait was seen in tears, pleading with people to come with water and food. Kundu said she along with her husband immediately set out in their car to UP Gate along with a bottle of water which they finally offered to Tikait at about 11pm Thursday. “I was shocked when I came across the video of Rakesh ji wherein he was in tears at the dais. I felt very upset about this and straight away came to UP Gate to support the farmers. I and my family have been active participants in the ongoing protests at Singhu and Tikri borders as we are from a farmer family based in Kaithal, Haryana. I could not see my farmer leader crying for help and support of people. So, both of us rushed to the site with water,” she added. As videos and news reports about Tikait breaking down at the UP Gate protest site went viral, the fortunes of the protesting farmers also took a turn. “After the violence in Delhi on Republic Day, many of our people returned home and numbers were thinning. Everyone at the site was upset and even more so when the Ghaziabad police arrived to serve us a notice for vacating the site and for arresting our leader. However, the entire sequence changed when Tikait ji went into tears. He was pained by the series of events and his tears brought more and more people to the site on Thursday night,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the BKU. After the police arrived at the site, Tikait had also said at the dais that he would hang himself rather than leave the protest site. As the video gained traction, it caught the attention of people as well as a group of four who were at their home in Fatehgarh Sahib district, in Punjab. “It was very painful to watch him cry and ask for help. The four of us could not hold ourselves back and we started our journey to UP Gate, driving 300kms with a bottle of water,” said Gagandeep Singh Guraya, an advocate and resident of Fatehgarh Sahib. The group reached UP Gate in their car at about 4am on Friday and finally met Tikait. “There was dense fog in Sonepat and Karnal and our driving speed was reduced to about 5kmph at times. However, we made up for the lost time as other parts of the route were clear. We will now stay here and will see to it that more people reach here, and the protest continues,” said Love Preet Singh, another member from the group. The initial response of people in different cities across the states was unexpected for farmers at UP Gate. “As the night got on, more and more people started to come to the UP Gate site. We initially could not believe the response, but more and more vehicles started to flow in from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand,” Rajbir Singh added. It was around 7pm when Ankit Chaudhary, along with a group of his 17 friends, came across the video over social media and decided to board a tractor-trolley from Datiyana village in UP’s Muzaffarnagar.“We were filled with anger and realised that enough was enough, after we saw our leader in tears in the video. We could not resist ourselves as it seemed to us that he was in pain in trying to save the honour of farmers. So, we got the fuel tank of our tractor filled up and joined the trolley before setting out for a journey of about 150kms to UP Gate,” Chaudhary added. Rakesh Tikait is the son of farmer leader late Mahendra Singh Tikait and resident of Sisoli in Muzaffarnagar district of western UP. Like Chaudhary, Prem Singh Sobta from Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand, who saw Tikait’s video live, prepared himself within half an hour to leave for UP Gate. “We came to UP Gate in two cars and reached by midnight. I had initially come here to attend farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day and left for home thereafter. But I again rushed back when I saw the video. As people started coming, the motivation level of farmers began to rise,” he added. Tikait during his address on Thursday evening had said that he will not leave the site and will consume food and water only if people will bring these to him. This was after he alleged that while Ghaziabad officials were holding talks with him for his arrest and vacating the protest site, some unruly elements arrived at the site to unleash havoc on the protesting farmers. Meanwhile, there were apprehensions among farmers that the authorities will get the site vacated themselves and could even arrest Tikait, following FIRs lodged in connection with the incidents of violence in Delhi on the Republic Day. “When I was at the dais, I felt that something very wrong was about to happen and then I decided that I will not leave farmers and won’t vacate the site. After the video went viral, I was myself surprised that it had so much impact that people set out for UP Gate at night itself,” Tikait said. The dais at the site generally goes silent at night but Tikait was present there till 4am on Friday, meeting everyone who had arrived from their hometowns.Apart from people flocking the UP Gate protest, there were also others who were preparing to leave. An HT team at 3am on Friday spotted Ranjeet Singh resurrecting the banner of the ‘langar’ (community kitchen) set up by Sant Nirmal Singh Bhuri Wale “We had almost packed up our food items and were about to shift to our other langar which is in Haridwar. But we saw people coming to UP Gate and vehicles arriving after the video went viral. As the night continued, more and more people arrived, and we understood that the gathering will swell further. Then we decided that we will not move out and continue to serve people here,” he added. Till midnight, there was heavy deployment of about 2,000 police and security personnel at the site, while officials were preparing to get the site vacated. However, numbers of protesters started increasing and officials decided to withdraw the deployment. At around 2am, personnel of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) deployed at the site were asked to board their buses and return. Ever since the incidents seen in Delhi on January 26, the gathering at the UP Gate site has decreased considerably and stood at about 1,000-1,200 on Thursday. Protesters said that the declining numbers could have given a chance to the authorities to get the site vacated easily. However, BKU leaders said that the gathering after Tikait’s emotional outburst swelled to about 10-15,000 on Friday and almost every inch at the site was occupied. The police, however, pegged the number to be lesser. “The gathering swelled considerably at UP Gate on Friday, and we expect that it was about 5,000. The deployment at the site was also lesser on Friday,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). Thousands of protesters from UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab had been camping at the UP Gate site, near Delhi’s Ghazipur border, since November 28, 2020, demanding repeal of three new farm laws. “We have served notice to the farmer leaders at UP Gate to vacate the site and are waiting for their reply. Thereafter, our next course of action will be decided,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate of Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/supporters-flock-to-up-gate-at-night-as-tikait-s-emotional-appeal-goes-viral-101611944958055.html
29-01-2021||Noida||UP govt expands Noida’s horizons; city to get land from 80 more villages, border Bulandshahr||NOIDA: With an aim to expand the boundaries of Noida, the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday notified 80 more villages to be brought under the ambit of the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA). The area is to be developed as a “special investment region” under the name “Dadri-Noida-Ghaziabad investment region” to attract investment and create opportunities. Currently, Noida is spread over 20,000 hectares adjoining the national Capital, which will now be doubled its existing size, to share boundaries with the Bulandshahr district.The Noida authority, which was established on April 17, 1976, will get around 20,000 hectares additional land – 60 villages from Bulandshahr and 20 from Gautam Budh Nagar – to develop, allot and urbanise.“This is a good step ahead for the future of Noida as 80 more villages have been included by the Uttar Pradesh government,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Earlier, these villages were included in the development area of the UP State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) for the past 10 years. However, development could not be carried out. Now, the UP governor has taken requisite measures to include these villages as part of Noida. The authority will discuss the developmental model with the UP industrial and infrastructure development department for further progress, said officials.“We will discuss the development model with the state government and take it forward,” said Maheshwari.Officials said the state government and the Noida authority together will finalise the exact area of land to be earmarked for industrial, residential, mixed-land use and commercial use, among other purposes.At present, Noida is surrounded by Yamuna and Hindon rivers. It has around 16,000 hectares of urbanised area (along with 4,000 hectares of flood plain area), of which 47% is for residential purposes and 13% for industrial usage, while the rest of the area is for other usages that include commercial, institutional, and environmental purposes. It is left with around 250 hectares of land, which is earmarked for industrial usage but is yet to be acquired from farmers, officials said.Officials and realtors said that since Noida has emerged as the “economic capital of UP”, domestic and international investors are keen to invest in this industrial town as it has become a brand. However, it is left with no industrial land to be allotted for mega industrial projects, said officials, asking not to be identified.With 20,000 hectares of additional land in its ambit, the authority can carve out industrial sectors suitable to present market demand and create jobs, thus fuelling the local economy, said experts.“The move will certainly help in boosting growth and creation of jobs in this region. This is a much-needed step for future development,” said RK Arora, president of the Uttar Pradesh chapter of the national real estate development corporation (NAREDCO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-expands-noida-s-horizons-city-to-get-land-from-80-more-villages-border-bulandshahr-101611944899491.html

The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has been told to begin work on the same.“We have received communication from the state government on this to start work on the second phase. Subsequently, we wrote to the Gautam Budh Nagar administration for necessary action in this regard. Land from a total of seven villages will be acquired for the second phase. We have also sent the superimpose map of this land to be acquired,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of the Yeida.The Yeida had sought permission from the state government to start work on the second project in November 2020, as the 1,334 hectares land needed for the first phase of the airport project was handed over to the Swiss firm Zurich AG, the concessionaire for the airport, which will start work at the site by April, said officials.A total of 1,365 hectares will be required for phase 2, 1,318 hectares for phase 3 and phase 4 will witness land acquisition of 735 hectares, said Yeida officials.There will be two runways in phase 1 and the airport is expected to become operational by 2023-24, said officials of Yeida and Noida International Airport Limited – the two agencies working on the project. In total, the airport is projected to have five runways when it is developed to its full capacity over a total of 5,000 hectares of land, said officials. The estimated budget for the project is between ₹15,000 crore and ₹20,000 crore. “We are likely to issue a notification and invoke Section 11 of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and start the process of conducting a social impact assessment survey for this land before the acquisition can begin,” said Balram Singh additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Under phase I, villages whose residents would be rehabilitated are Rohi, Parohi, Ranhera, Kishorpur, Banwaribas and Dayanatpur.The administration will soon release the names of the seven villages from where land would be needed before the acquisition process begins, said officials.Apart from this, the administration is also likely to start land acquisition for 40 hectares needed for the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor (DMIC), which passes through the district.The administration will acquire land from Palla and some other villages for the DMIC project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-gives-green-signal-for-land-acquisition-for-second-phase-of-jewar-airport-101611944898856.html
29-01-2021||Noida||Scepticism, faulty data hinders vaccination drive in Gautam Budh Nagar||NOIDA: In what comes as a major concern for the Gautam Budh Nagar administration, many health workers said they are reluctant to receive the vaccination shot against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.The district held its fourth session of phase one of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Friday, even as several corona warriors expressed their reluctance, saying they harboured doubts about the vaccines ranging from its adverse effects to dearth of efficacy data.Rakesh Kumar, a sanitation worker, is among those who did not turn up for inoculation at the primary health centre (PHC) in Dadri. One of his colleagues, Shekhar, said his family asked him not to go for vaccination. “Last evening, he told me that since he had already suffered from Covid-19, he has already developed antibodies and now doesn’t need the vaccination,” Rakesh said of Shekhar.Sudha Singh (name changed), who works as an anganwadi worker, was informed two days ago of her vaccination slot on Friday at community health centre (CHC) in Dadri. She came to the centre, but refused to get the shot. “I’ve come here but will not take the vaccine as I’ve no idea about its accuracy and efficacy. I can’t put my life in danger as I have two small children,” she said. A sanitation worker, who was enlisted for Friday’s inoculation at a booth at the district hospital, echoed similar views. “We are not the experimental type. We were scared in going for duties but had to as there was no other option. Again, when we are sceptical about this vaccine, we are being made scapegoats. I’ll not take the vaccine unless all doctors in the district get inoculated,” he said, requesting not to be named. Reluctance apart, the faulty database has also dogged the vaccination drive in the district. Dr Abhishek Deswal, head of critical care medicine at Sharda hospital, has been deputed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Covid-19 ward with his team of doctors and paramedics. “No one from our team is enlisted in the vaccination list. I’ve informed the district magistrate and the chief medical officer (CMO), requesting them to include our names in the list on a priority basis,” he said. District magistrate Suhas LY agreed that the database has many faults. “Reluctance is a minor issue. The vaccination list includes thousands of nursing and para-medical students and staff who left the district right after the lockdown was lifted. On the other hand, this list does not include names of those health workers who joined their duties during the pandemic. These faults were not corrected on time, and the Co-WIN portal doesn’t give the rights of editing the list to the data entry operators,” he said. The DM further said that he had asked the district health department officials to prepare an updated list of health workers to be innoculated. Meanwhile, district CMO Dr Deepak Ohri said that the health department is leaving no stone unturned to finish the first phase of vaccination as quickly as possible and proceed to the next phase. “However, reluctance among many health workers is slowing down the process. We are hoping that the number of vaccine recipients will go up in the last two sessions of vaccination for the first phase. There are a variety of reasons why many corona warriors are not keen on getting a dose. So, we are asking senior doctors and hospital officials who have already taken shots to motivate others,” he said.Meanwhile, the district improved its vaccination numbers by nearly 15% this time, as 3,502 out of the intended daily target of 5,234 corona warriors took the Covid-19 shot on Friday. In the four sessions held so far, Covishield could be administered to 9,146 out of 24,453 health workers. The CMO stated that in the remaining two rounds – to be held February 4 and 5 – as many as 15,307 health workers will be inoculated. “While vaccination will take place on 60 booths on February 4, there will be 20 booths on the last session of the first phase. The second phase of vaccination will begin from February 15. We have so far uploaded the names of over 15,000 persons for the second phase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/scepticism-faulty-data-hinders-vaccination-drive-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101611944898120.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Trains for all, more time for eateries: Mumbai inching towards the old normal||With the state’s decision to resume local train services for the general public from February 1 and extend the operational timings for restaurants and shops, the city is inching back to pre-pandemic normalcy. On Friday, the Maharashtra government announced that local trains will resume services during specified hours, but to prevent overcrowding, they would not be operational during peak hours. From next month, shops and restaurants will also be allowed to stay open till 11pm and 1am respectively. On Friday, the Maharashtra government announced that from February 1, regular train services would resume for the general public from the first local train service till 7am; then between 12pm and 4pm; and from 9pm till the last local train service. With a footfall of 8 million passengers daily on Central (CR) and Western Railway (WR), the suburban railway network is the most-used public transport system in the city. Local train services in Mumbai were suspended on March 23, 2020, as part of the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. A limited number of buses operated by Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking as well as autorickshaws and taxis are already operational and there have been some reported instances of crowding in buses. The resumption of train services is expected to make commutes easier and facilitate the reopening of commercial establishments. Passengers welcomed the move to resume train services. “People can slowly resume working now and life is getting back to pre-Covid-19 times. The opening up of local trains for the general public will help passengers tremendously. Travelling by buses, taxis and private vehicles was very difficult in 2020. We had to travel for one hour one way just to reach Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and then one hour again to reach home. The travelling cost had also increased a lot,” said Renuka Singh, a Thane resident. Passenger associations said the stipulated time should be increased for the benefit of those who have long commutes between their homes and offices. “The opening up of local trains for the general public is a good move by the government. However, people staying far away will take two hours in a one-way commute. The timings should be altered and staggered office timings should be introduced by the Maharashtra government,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. The Indian Merchant Chamber (IMC) said any change in working hours — as a response to the time periods when the general public may avail local trains — would be temporary. “We are hopeful that Mumbai will bounce back to normalcy soon. If there is any significant change in working hours, it would be short-term till the situation completely normalises. We are certain this opportunity will be used sensibly by the general public,” said Ajit Mangrulkar, director-general, IMC. The government also announced an extension of working hours for hotels and shops, which was welcomed to the Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT). From February 1, shops can stay open till 11pm and restaurants can be operational till 1am. “There is a huge chunk of customers who shop late after coming back from work, which we were losing due to the previous 9pm deadline. The new timings will help regain some business,” said Mohan Gurnani, chairman, CAMIT. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, a spokesperson for the Hotels and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said the government’s announcement came as a huge relief. “Hotels and restaurants are already operating at 50% capacity and this increase in timing is a huge relief for us. This will substantially cut down our losses,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/trains-for-all-more-time-for-eateries-mumbai-inching-towards-the-old-normal-101611944538497.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Did not find material against MSC Bank directors, officers: Mumbai Police to court||The Mumbai Police on Friday informed a special anti-corruption court that they did not find any evidence against any of the persons connected with Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank concerning a fraud case.The statement was made in an affidavit filed by Mumbai Police in response to a protest petition filed by the complainant in the MSC Bank fraud case.The complainant Surinder Mohan Arora had last week filed a protest petition against the closure report filed by the Mumbai Police. He alleged that the closure report revolved around statements of accused persons – the then office bearers of the bank, completely neglecting the reports of inquiry, investigation and audit conducted by reputed independent organisations like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).Mumbai Police on Friday filed a reply on the protest petition, claiming that while investigating the case, the agency was not concerned with anyone’s political affiliation but was concerned with the illegal acts, if any, committed by them, constituting a criminal offence. “The allegations made by naming persons holding responsible posts and high offices are baseless and merely ipse-dixit,” read the statement by Mumbai Police. “During the investigation, the agency did not come across any material pinpointing any specific allegation against any specific person, director or officer of MSC Bank or any unlawful gain or undue pecuniary advantage received by an individual of MSC Bank,” read the reply.The prosecution further said, “Erroneous or imprudent decisions collectively taken in consonance with various policies, which though may result in undesired results, cannot be said to be a dishonest act with malafide intentions for causing wrongful loss to one’s own institution.” The police further claimed that NABARD’s report is “merely suggestive or recommendatory in nature”. “Those directions do not suggest any registration of offence or even direction to take action against the persons who are at the helm of the business transactions of the bank,” the statement added. The economic offence wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police had filed a first information report (FIR) in the case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Prevention of Corruption Act, and Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act. The case was filed in August 2019 on the direction of the Bombay high court (HC), which was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Arora, who had alleged police inaction into the fraud. The complaint pertained to thousands of crores of rupees obtained in loans by sugar cooperatives, spinning mills and other processing units from the district and cooperative banks.MSC Bank, the apex bank that controlled credit to the co-operative sector in the state and was handled by the then ruling politicians, landed in trouble in 2011 after an inquiry report by NABARD found that the bank was in the red with a deficit of ₹144 crore. The report indicted the board of directors of the bank for financial mismanagement that led to a ballooning of non-performing assets. The complainant Arora had then alleged that illegal loans were sanctioned, and secured assets were sold at throw-away prices, contrary to norms.The NABARD report had said that balance sheets had been fudged to show a profit of ₹2 crore when the bank was facing losses of ₹798 crore. The board had 76 directors, of whom 44 were elected representatives — 25 from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), 14 from the Congress, two each, from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Peasants and Workers Party, and one from the Shiv Sena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/did-not-find-material-against-msc-bank-directors-officers-mumbai-police-to-court-101611944118306.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s TISS allegedly scraps student elections, sparks protests||Student groups at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, are protesting against the institute’s alleged decision to scrap student body elections for the ongoing academic year.While the institute has not issued an official statement on not conducting the student body election, institute officials said that the elections cannot be conducted as students are not physically present on campus.“We looked for precedence of student elections in other universities but couldn’t find any. Student elections are a big event on campus. Conducting an online election will have its repercussions because there is the question of availability of resources,” said Asha Banu, dean of student affairs.On January 19, all members of the institute’s student election committee 2020-21, a non-elected student body that facilitates and supervises the election process on campus, resigned from their posts. “Since we as the committee are meant to conduct elections and establish the students’ representative body, the absence of any such body makes the existence of the election committee superficial and unnecessary,” the committee said in a statement.The committee stated that it had been consistently trying all official channels to communicate to the institute and request student elections. It proposed online elections and/or the formation of an interim student body till the time elections could be held. “We would like to reiterate to the concerned authorities our request to conduct elections, through which student representation can be established in the institute,” said the EC in its statement.This has sparked protests by student bodies on campus as the resignation is being seen as a protest by the committee. “The Progressive Students’ Forum (PSF) – TISS Mumbai, views this behaviour of the administration as highly condemnable and not befitting of those running an institution known for its commitment to social justice and equality,” said a member of the PSF.Banu, however, said that during the lockdown, a spontaneous system of representation has evolved through class representatives (CRs). “The CRs of various programmes are in continuous touch with the institute administration. Students issues are being highlighted via the CRs,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-tiss-allegedly-scraps-student-elections-sparks-protests-101611943938256.html

Hill schools affiliated to the board shall begin their new academic year from February,” the circular further states. The circular came as a response to several requests sent by heads of schools affiliated with the board demanding clarity on the new academic year in the backdrop of the Covid-19 outbreak and the expected delay in the board exams. Principals said they were worried about teachers not getting a summer break with this. “If the academic year begins as scheduled and board exams are delayed, teachers will be busy throughout the year,” said Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School in Vile Parle. Most schools in the city have scheduled exams for Class 9 students in February. “Due to Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant safety protocols, more teachers will be required for exam work like invigilation. By the time this would be done, the new academic year would begin followed by board exams,” said a teacher. Parents also said they were hoping the board gives some clarity on the academic calendar for 2021-22. “For Class 10 ISC students who will write their exams this year, there will be no break between the board exams and the beginning of Class 11 which will be too hectic,” said a parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/icse-board-academic-year-to-begin-in-march-mumbai-schools-fear-losing-summer-break-101611943638234.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Union Budget 2021: Travel industry hopes for tax exemption, financial aid||Ahead of the Union Budget 2021, the apex body of travel agents – Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) – has suggested that the government outlay plans to enhance and boost travel and tourism by ensuring adequate support in ease of growing the industry. According to TAAI, Budget 2021 should allow leave travel concession (LTC) benefits, which could not be utilised owing to the pandemic, to be carried forward over the next two years. It also stated that it expects the government to fully exempt income tax for two years for all expenses made for travel, tourism, MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing and exhibitions), adventure, domestic and religious travel, by the taxpayer. In its recommendation to the ministry, TAAI stated that a structured insurance mechanism is required to secure the future of travel agents against principals, viz a viz securing all payments of consumers and travellers. “The proposals on underwriting by the government towards all airline operators to and from India must also be secured in some form of financial security,” said the association. Jay Bhatia, vice president of TAAI stated that travel and tourism trade should be granted an industry status and can be included in the concurrent list across the country which will help to produce high-quality service levels. “We have requested that a single employee benefit or security policy benefit should be adopted under one proviso that will take care of labour welfare, industrial safety and health of self and a maintaining one-wage code across the country with Central and state governments,” Bhatia said.The year 2020 witnessed the unforeseeable impact on the travel and hospitality industry due to the pandemic. The sector was severely hit with restrictions on both international and domestic travel. During the unlock phase, domestic tourism was the first to open up in May 2020. The travel and hospitality industry is one of the largest providers of jobs and has a multi-pier effect on economic growth. Travel portals unanimously said that they are optimistic that the industry will continue to see buoyant growth, driving overall economic growth in the country.“There is a need for greater collaboration between various stakeholders, be it the industry or the government, to create relevant policies and schemes for this sector. To see continued growth in the travel industry, we would like to see better spends to provide necessary infrastructural capabilities, public utilities and more amenities which would promote social distancing norms. Moreover, providing customers with tax incentives and fiscal measures to stimulate demand is critical for the sector. Relief on regulatory aspects on compliances such as TDS and TCS on online players, support to the inbound industry and measures to articulate the government’s plan will provide a roadmap and give clarity to the industry players,” said Dhruv Shringi, co-founder and chief executive officer, Yatra.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/union-budget-2021-travel-industry-hopes-for-tax-exemption-financial-aid-101611943338357.html

The youths, including a relative of a local Congress leader, had filmed the firing and posted it on social media. After the video went viral, police had lodged an FIR against the unidentified accused.In a similar drive in December 2019, the police had cancelled 24 arms licences and also stalled renewal of 57 licences.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said weapons were for self-defence and not for bragging or flaunting. “Such posts on social networking sites can cause panic among people. Police have already banned weapons at marriage palaces,” he said.In February last year, following a central government notification, the police had asked all arms licence holders, who had three weapons against one licence, to surrender one weapon. According to the notification, only two weapons are allowed to one licence holder. Earlier, three weapons were permitted against one licence.Under fireNovember 19, 2019: Punjabi singer Elly Mangat was booked for opening celebratory fire from a rifle at his friend’s birthday party at Darod village in Sahnewal, 20km from Ludhiana, after his video went viralJanuary 22, 2020: The Ludhiana police had issued summons to Punjabi singers Sidhu Moose Wala, alias Shubhdeep Singh, and Mankirt Aulakh over a video promoting gun culture and violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-posing-with-arms-on-social-media-on-ludhiana-police-s-target-101611940157172.html

29-01-2021||City||Jagan govt, AP poll panel at loggerheads as nominations for local election begin||The ongoing cold war between the YSR Congress party government in Andhra Pradesh and state election commissioner (SEC) Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar took a serious turn on Friday with the latter transferring senior IAS officer Praveen Prakash, principal secretary in the chief minister’s office.The order evoked sharp reactions from chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's camp, even as the nomination process for the first phase of elections to 32,504 wards across 3,249 gram panchayats began in the morning.Prakash, considered as the most powerful bureaucrat in the CMO, is also principal secretary (political) in the general administration department, responsible for the transfer of IAS officers as per the instructions from the chief minister.In his letter to chief secretary Adityanath Das, the state SEC said Prakash, being the head of the general administration (political) department, should implement the SEC's orders on the transfers but had deliberately ignored his duty.Also read: We take it seriously, Jaishankar tells Israel after blast near embassy in DelhiThe CMO official was primarily responsible for scuttling the video conference convened on January 23 meant to review the poll preparedness as well as to impart instructions to the collectors, he charged.Ramesh Kumar said Prakash had instructed the collectors, SPs and other officials not to participate in the SEC meetings and not to cooperate with the poll process as well. He reminded that in the past too, there were instances of Prakash disobeying the Election Commission of India when he was the district collector of Visakhapatnam.“Since he is the fulcrum of administration, directly dealing with collectors and SPs and privy to influence their action, the SEC has felt that his continuance is prejudicial to free and fair elections,” Ramesh Kumar said and ordered Prakash's transfer with immediate effect.“He is barred during the course of the elections to have an interaction with district collectors and superintendents of police or any other officers who either directly or indirectly deal with matters relating to the polls," he said.A couple of days ago, the SEC issued orders censuring two senior IAS officers – principal secretary of panchayat raj Gopala Krishna Dwivedi and commissioner M Girija Shankar - for failing in their duties in the revision of electoral rolls in the state which led to the denial of voting rights to over 3 lakh new voters.He even wrote to the department of personnel and training (DoPT) in the Centre, recommending compulsory retirement of these two IAS officers. However, the Jagan government rejected the censure proceeding stating that the SEC had no authority to censure the serving IAS officers as per the All India Services rules. It also wrote to the Centre not to accept the SEC recommendations.Escalating the confrontation further, Ramesh Kumar on Friday wrote a letter to Governor Biswa Bhushan Harichandan, asking for sacking of state panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy and advisor (public affairs) to the state government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy for allegedly making derogatory comments against the SEC.Reacting strongly to a series of orders issued by the SEC, Ramakrishna Reddy said the SEC had crossed all his limits in taking action against the IAS officers. “He lacks basic decency and culture and is behaving like a stooge of Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu. Does he want to conduct the elections with TDP agents?” he asked.YSRC general secretary and parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy alleged that Ramesh Kumar had gone "mentally deranged". "He deserves to be sent to a mental hospital for treatment. He is unfit to be in that constitutional position,” Sai Reddy said while speaking to reporters in Visakhapatnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jagan-govt-ap-poll-panel-at-loggerheads-as-nominations-for-local-election-begin-101611934214719.html
29-01-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand High Court adjourns hearing on Lalu Prasad Yadav's bail plea to Feb 12||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday adjourned hearing on Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's bail plea for February 12, even as the leader filed a supplementary affidavit to highlight the period of custody served by him and the recent developments on his health front as grounds.The former Bihar chief minister has been serving jail term since December 23, 2017, after his conviction in three fodder scam cases in quick succession.Prasad has already secured bail in two cases on the ground of completion of half of the term. He moved a bail application in the third and last case on similar ground in the High Court last year.Filing a supplementary affidavit with the court, Prasad said that he would be completing half of the sentence (42 months) on February 7. Urging the court to grant him bail, he also stated that he was airlifted and moved to the All India institute of medical sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, last week after his health condition deteriorated.Also read: Blast reported near Israel embassy in Delhi, car windscreens damagedThe bench of Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh, however, adjourned the matter for next hearing on February 12, asking the opposite party, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), to file its reply, if any, in the meanwhile."We have received Prasad's supplementary affidavit but nothing new has been disclosed in it to counter our earlier stand that the leader has to serve about eight months more to complete half of the sentence in this case," said assistant solicitor general and CBI's counsel Rajiv Sinha.He added, "According to our calculation, Prasad has only completed 34 months and some days in custody, which is still short of about eight months to complete 3.5 years. His other ground of deteriorating health has nothing to do with bail. An ailing person requires treatment and that is being given to him."However, Prasad's lawyer Prabhat Kumar said, "On the last date of hearing in December 2020, we had sought six weeks to furnish a detailed computation of the period served by Prasad in custody."He added, "We have now filed a supplementary affidavit with a revised chart supported by lower court's certified order sheets to show the details of custody period served by Prasad in this case."According to the revised computation, Prasad would be completing half of the sentence on February 7, Kumar said.The aforesaid fodder scam case against Prasad relates to fraudulent withdrawal of ₹3.76 crore from Dumka treasury during December 1995 to January 1996.A special CBI court, in 2018, had sentenced Prasad to 14 years of imprisonment- seven under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and another seven years under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.It had expressly said both sentences would run consecutively.However, Prasad’s lawyers hope that the High Court will strike down this decision and let the two sentences run concurrently. If that happens, Prasad will have to undergo a seven-year imprisonment in this case.Prasad, who had been undergoing treatment in custody for over two years in Ranchi's Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), was moved to AIIMS, New Delhi, last week after his condition deteriorated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-high-court-adjourns-hearing-on-lalu-prasad-yadav-s-bail-plea-to-feb-12-101611930323483.html
29-01-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow: First to use ultraviolet rays to disinfect metro||The Lucknow Metro has set another record by becoming the first metro project in the country to use ultraviolet (UV) rays to sanitise train coaches, a senior official said on Friday.The UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) has taken inspiration from the New York Metro's experiment to sanitise trains with UV lamp rays, it said.“Passenger safety and comfort has always been our topmost priority and whatever we do is in sync with our objective to provide the safest and the most convenient mode of public transport to the people," UPMRC Managing Director Kumar Keshav said.Lucknow Metro has become the pioneer of metro train sanitisation through UV technology, the UPMRC said."When we started token sanitation by UV radiation, we received overwhelming response and appreciation from our passengers. Now, with train sanitation by ultraviolet rays, we want to assure all our passengers that their Lucknow Metro was, is and will always be the safest mode of transport," Keshav said."We are seeing a significant increase in ridership everyday and it is this confidence of our commuters that pushes us to put in more and more efforts to make their travel enjoyable and hassle-free,” he added.    Keshav said that Lucknow Metro was also the first metro project in the country to have started token sanitisation through 'UV box' which was developed in-house.Giving boost to the Make in India mission, Lucknow Metro in consultation with an Indian firm that deals in tube lights used in sanitation apparatus, has developed a UV sanitisation apparatus which works on ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) disinfection method, the UPMRC said.     It uses short wavelength ultraviolet (Ultraviolet C or UV-C) light of 254 nm UV-C to kill or inactive micro-organisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, it said.The apparatus which was certified by DRDO in October, last year, sanitises the entire coach in seven minutes and as added care, "We are sanitising each coach for 15 minutes", the release said.    The best part of this initiative is that it is very economical, costing 1/40th of the cost involved in sprinkling of manual sanitislsers, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-first-to-use-ultraviolet-rays-to-disinfect-metro-101611925741949.html
29-01-2021||Lucknow||'Big disappointment': Mayawati on President's address to farmers||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national president Mayawati on Friday termed the President Ram Nath Kovind's address to the joint session of Parliament as a "big disappointment" for the farmers and the poor."The Centre is harassing and exploiting the agitating farmers who have launched a stir demanding withdrawal of the three newly enacted agriculture laws. The BSP will raise its voice against the exploitation and injustice meted out to farmers," she said in a tweet.Mayawati’s reaction came after the BSP announced in the morning to boycott President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to the joint session of Parliament at the start of the budget session.Earlier in the day, while expressing solidarity with the agitating farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted in September last year, Mayawati posted a series of tweets, "In protest against not accepting the agitating farmers' demand of the withdrawal of the three disputed laws and adopting a lax attitude in the matters of public interest, the BSP today (Friday) decided to boycott the President’s address to Parliament."Also read: India took short term pain for long time gain - Chief economic adviserShe further said the Centre should take measures to normalise the situation in Delhi and other areas. "The Centre should not make innocent farmers scapegoat under the guise of riots on the Republic Day in Delhi. There is truth in the objections of the BKU and other farmer leaders against the farm laws. The central government should pay attention to their demands," Mayawati added."Farmers, who have made the country self-reliant in agriculture, are agitating for the withdrawal of the three agriculture laws. The government is harassing the farmers and the silence of the government over the issue is sad," the BSP chief said.Communicating her party's stand on the three agriculture laws, Mayawati said, "The BSP has always opposed the new agriculture laws in Parliament and outside which were introduced by the Centre in a very immature way. Along with the poor, the Dalits and the backwards, the BSP will always raise its voice against the exploitation and injustice meted out to farmers."Mayawati's tweets announcing a boycott of the President's address came at 9 am— two hours before the start of the President's address to the joint session of the Parliament. The Akali Dal, the Aam Aadmi Party and 16 opposition political parties led by the Congress on Thursday announced the boycott of the President’s address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/big-disappointment-mayawati-on-president-s-address-to-farmers-101611925681844.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan station premises to get a new look in 3 years under SATIS||If all goes as per plans for the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), the Kalyan station premises will wear a decongested look with better traffic management, parking facilities and flyovers in the next three years.The Smart City Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL), which is planning the project, is now on the verge of planning its design and will soon initiate the ground work.The foundation stone of the Kalyan Station Area Traffic Improvement Scheme (SATIS) was laid down by the Maharashtra state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday.Tarun Juneja, executive engineer, SKDCL, said, “We will first develop a parking facility behind the state transport depot and also design a modernised depot by replacing the existing one. For this, we will require the approval of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). We have got approval to cover the nullah behind the ST depot, where a parking lot will be set up. We have got the nod to do so from IIT Bombay and the work of covering the nullah will be initiated soon.”The KDMC was included in the smart city mission in 2016. Out of the several other projects planned under the smart city mission, the Kalyan station area development is one such. Considering the population growth in the Kalyan-Dombivli, which has crossed 15 lakh, the SKDCL has planned SATIS for both Kalyan and Dombivli stations. The Kalyan railway station has around 4 lakh commuters travelling to Mumbai and other cities daily. This leads to major congestion outside the station.As per the KDMC, the project once implemented will ease congestion for the next 25-30 years.“SATIS includes revamping the old ST depot, improving traffic management with separate flyovers for buses and small vehicles, designated parking lots and hawking zones and auto rickshaw stands. This will completely change the look of the station and ease congestion for another 30 years,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.The SKDCL has appointed three consultants for the work of the SATIS, the estimated cost of which is ₹498Cr.“The station area congestion has been a nightmare for most of the commuters as they get stuck in the traffic every day. This project should be implemented on a fast track mode and not stalled for years like several other projects,” said Smita Poojari, 38, a commuter who boards a local train from Kalyan to her work place in Mumbai daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-station-premises-to-get-a-new-look-in-3-years-under-satis-101611920297839.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Shut colleges brought down narcotics cases in Navi Mumbai’||With the closure of schools and colleges during the lockdown, the narcotic cases in Navi Mumbai have gone down in 2020.Navi Mumbai being an educational hub, most dealings were conducted by youngsters across the campuses in the city. About 99 per cent of the drug movement was stopped during the lockdown due to closure of campuses, claimed the police.However, dealers used web portals and courier services for sale of drugs ordered online in the form of home appliances or groceries, making it difficult to trace.While 153 cases were registered in 2019, a mere 61 were registered in 2020, out of which 35 were registered before March and the remaining 26 from March to December, according to the Anti-Narcotic Cell (ANC).The Navi Mumbai ANC also claimed that the sale of cocaine, heroin and hashish has reduced during the lockdown while consumption of synthetic drugs like LSD, MD, brown sugar and ketamine increased.Deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pravin Patil, said, “We initiated a special drive against narcotics in 2019 and registered 153 cases and seized drugs worth ₹2.80Cr. The drive continued in the early 2020 wherein we registered 35 cases in the first three months. However, during the lockdown, there was a strict vigil at all posts and the movement of the drug peddlers was restricted. In the last two to three months, their movement has again increased after normalcy was beginning to set in. We registered 26 offences in this period.”In 2016, the ANC registered 77 cases in which 142 were arrested. In 2017, the cases were decreased to 54 cases in which 74 accused were arrested. In 2018, 44 cases were registered and 80 arrested.The ANC police inspector Ravindra Budhwant said, “Due to the lockdown, peddlers and consumers were locked in the house. Thus, trafficking was less. Most of the dealing in Navi Mumbai is at the campuses of educational institutions, especially the higher education. Last year, 99 per cent of the dealings in campuses were stopped. However, most shifted online. We got a tip off that their network was activated after June wherein they used mobile applications and online portals. The consumers would order through courier services disguising them as home appliances or groceries.”Budhwant added that the police would work with the cyber cell to know how much of the business was shifted online.Synthetic drugs on the riseA number of synthetic drugs on the market including Ecstasy, LSD and methamphetamine are said to be more effective than the natural ones, and thus more in demand. In most of the consumption cases, police have found the involvement of youngsters more even during the lockdown period. Earlier they used to deal with marijuana, Mephedrone (MD) and hashish (charas), but now they are increasing their network with other drugs. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) paper, heroin, most of the synthetic drugs, which use more chemicals than natural ingredients, are riskier than normal drugs, said an officer.Budhwant said, “These drugs are marketed as being good for concentration or being a herbal product. Most of these messages are made viral through social media. When the schools and colleges were operational, we communicated with the students every month. However, now our spread is limited.”Young dealers on the radarApart from the poor drug addicts and dealers, other main dealers are youngsters, especially students. An officer from ANC said, “We believe these student peddlers belong to a chain of illegal supply of drugs that are brought from outside the district and sold to students by local suppliers, which eventually reach the campuses here. These students act as a link between drug suppliers and campuses. We don’t like to arrest students but if they don’t mend their ways, it leaves us with no choice.”The ANC have asked the volunteer teachers of schools and colleges to keep sending awareness messages on the students’ social media groups. The Navi Mumbai police twitter handle has also posted several awareness messages. The messages include identifying the drug and behaviour of people who are consuming it and also how to approach police if anyone found such activities in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shut-colleges-brought-down-narcotics-cases-in-navi-mumbai-101611919937368.html
29-01-2021||Chandigarh||7 protesters from Bathinda arrested in Delhi for R-Day violence||Delhi Police arrested seven protesters belonging to Bangi Nihal Singh Wala village in Bathinda district on Friday for the violence in the national capital on Republic Day. Lamenting the police action, family members of the seven villagers demanded their immediate release and withdrawal of the cases. Bathinda Range inspector general Jaskaran Singh, however, said he was unaware if any resident of the district had been arrested by Delhi Police. Village sarpanch Rajinder Singh, who headed to Delhi on Thursday night with members of the affected families, said the seven were arrested by police authorities from Paschim Vihar (West). He said all seven were members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) and were protesting at Tikri border. “The families were informed telephonically on Thursday. The seven have been implicated and we demand their release,” he said. All face non-bailable charges: Activist Manjit Singh Buttar, a youth activist from Bangi Nihal Singh Wala, said the villagers were arrested under Section 333 (voluntarily causes grievous hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “All face non-bailable charges. The village stands with their families,” he said. Kulwinder Kaur, whose husband Jagsir Singh, 34, was among those held in Delhi, said a group of 40 villagers had left on January 23 to join the tractor march. “It was his third visit to the Delhi border. Farmers have been fighting to safeguard their interest. The government should release them without delay,” she said. A former panch member Buta Singh said his younger son Gurphinder Singh, 23, were also arrested. “Gurphinder and seven others were part of the tractor march and were caught while returning to Tikri. My son was not part of any criminal activity. We will go by the leadership of Sidhupur faction,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/7-protesters-from-bathinda-arrested-in-delhi-for-r-day-violence-101611918976899.html
29-01-2021||Bangalore||BJP wins Karnataka legislative council deputy chairmanship backed by JD(S)||MK Pranesh from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday was elected as the deputy chairman of the Karnataka legislative council. Pranesh won the election 41 to 24 as the Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), backed the BJP, sealing an alliance that would help the passage of contentious bills, including the anti-cattle slaughter bill.The victory came even as JD(S) chief and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda refused to attend the President’s joint address in protest against the BJP-backed farm laws.The JD(S) and the BJP have shared a tumultuous relationship in the past. But the two sides have also come together to defeat the Congress, who they consider a common rival, on various occasions. Also Read: JD(S) to back BJP’s anti-cattle slaughter bill in KarnatakaThe alliance comes at a time when chief minister BS Yediyurappa has been under pressure over the cabinet reshuffle, non-performance of his government, farm laws and the resurfacing of old and new corruption charges, among other issues. The Congress has hit back at their former allies, calling them a party of convenience whose support is always available to the “highest bidder”. “This will bring more clarity of where they stand and their supporters will also be aware,” said a senior Congress leader. The JD(S) has bargained to get the chairmanship and the front-runner, Basavaraj Horatti, has already issued a statement to help pass the anti-cattle slaughter bill. The council had witnessed unruly scenes on December 15 as the BJP and Congress clashed when the deputy chairman SLDharme Gowda sat in the chairman’s (Pratapchandra Shetty) chair before the latter could enter the House. The Congress believed that Dharme Gowda would take up the no-confidence motion to remove Shetty. Dharme Gowda was found dead on a railway track in Chikmagaluru district on December 20. He is suspected to have died by suicide.Senior JD(S) leaders have spared no opportunity to hit out at the BJP in the past and hold the party responsible for the collapse of the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government.“In solidarity with my farmer brothers fighting against the three #FarmLaws, I have decided, after consulting my party @JanataDal_S units, not to attend the President’s joint address of Parliament today,” Deve Gowda posted on Twitter.The Congress said that the stand of the JD(S) goes against their claims of being a party that represents interests of the farming community. The impact of the BJP-JD(S) alliance, the opposition said, will be felt in the upcoming zila panchayat and other upcoming elections in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-wins-karnataka-legislative-council-deputy-chairmanship-backed-by-jds-101611914596683.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||NGT slams Delhi Jal Board over Yamuna pollution||The National Green Tribunal has slammed the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) over pollution in Yamuna saying water quality remains highly deteriorated as pollutants are still being discharged into the drains.The green panel directed the Delhi Chief Secretary in coordination with the Chief Secretaries of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to personally monitor the progress of Yamuna cleaning by evolving effective administrative mechanism to handle grim situation caused by years of neglect.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said it is clear that major problem of preventing pollution by discharge of sewage, industrial effluents and other pollutants remains unaddressed. There is hardly any improvement in evolving meaningful and effective institutional mechanism for monitoring. Though Integrated Drain Management Cell is reported to have started functioning, tangible results are yet to be shown, as noted in the report of the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC). The tribunal noted that the YMC has particularly found that 147 drains in the catchment of Najafgarh and Shahdara drains have not been tapped.The NGT said that YMC has noted huge gap in generation and treatment of sewage and has rightly recommended that all the drains in which untreated sewage is being discharged need to be intercepted and diverted so that the untreated sewage is not conveyed to the river. “Such gaps need to be bridged in UP and Haryana also. The IDMC and DJB have to ensure this for Delhi. The monitoring by Additional Chief Secretary and Chief Secretary Delhi has yet to take place. “Necessary devices for sewage and effluent treatment have still not been installed to the required extent. Inspite of availability of huge funds, DJB is not working in a professional manner, as observed by the YMC,” the bench said.The tribunal said water quality remains highly deteriorated as pollutants are still being discharged into the drains. “Flood plains are not being made encroachment free, affecting the riverine ecology. Awareness programmes are inadequate. “Biodiversity parks and other measures have also been found to be inadequate. Frothing frequently found is in absence of regulating composition of detergents, which find place in the river through sewage, for which action needs to be taken by DPCC/CPCB/Ministry of Consumer Affairs. E-flow needs to be managed by resolving inter state issues administratively,” the bench said.The tribunal said that accountability needs to be enforced against failure of time lines which are being changed at leisure with no adverse consequences against non-performers. Compensation regime needs to be strictly followed on 'polluter pays' principle which was not happening depicting failure of the regulators, it said.The tribunal also said there is need for continuous and effective working of the IDMC to plan and oversee prevention of untreated sewage being discharged in the drains or the river. Apart from discharge of sewage, there is need to stop industries from discharging effluents by concerned statutory authorities, it said.“The issue of protection of flood plains by the DDA remains to be satisfactorily addressed even though steps are said to have been taken for constitution of a SPV for the purpose. “Encroachment is huge and steps taken are miniscule. Meaningful working of special purpose vehicle by DDA will depend on success to remove encroachment and keeping continuous vigilance,” the bench said.The tribunal said the YMC has functioned for more than two years and contributed in a big way in steering the authorities with a clear road-map by its exhaustive reports on every aspect but the action taken by authorities has been found to be inadequate.“We place on record our appreciation for the contribution of YMC in the last more than two years. With the taking over of the further monitoring by the Chief Secretaries of NCT of Delhi, Haryana and UP, proceedings of the Committee constituted by this Tribunal on the subject will stand concluded,” the bench said.The green panel had directed the Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to take expeditious action on sewage management, industrial pollutants and solid waste being discharged into the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ngt-slams-delhi-jal-board-over-yamuna-pollution-101611910705922.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Three days after R-Day violence, Delhi govt renews support to farmers||Three days after protests against the Centre’s farm laws turned violent in the city, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Delhi government renewed their support to the farmers who are demanding the farm laws be repealed.Kejriwal on Friday morning asked deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and urban development minister Satyendar Jain to visit the agitating farmers at Delhi’s borders and ensure, once again, that they get access to water and sanitation facilities.At the same time, AAP MPs, led by Sanjay Singh, held a sit-in protest at the Parliament demanding the farm laws be withdrawn. The AAP was also among the opposition parties which boycotted the President’s address in the Parliament on Friday morning over the same issue. In his first tweet on the matter ever since the mayhem in Delhi on Republic Day (Tuesday), the chief minister and AAP national convener Kejriwal on Friday assured farmers that he continues to support their demands, which he said are “justified”. Responding to a tweet from an unverified account of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, Kejriwal said in Hindi: “Rakesh ji, we are fully with the farmers. Your demands are valid. It is completely wrong to discredit the farmers’ movement, calling the farmers as traitors and making false cases against the farmer leaders who have been agitating peacefully for so many days.”The number of farmers participating in the sit-in swelled overnight at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur after a video of an appeal made by Tikait in which he said he would not leave the venue went viral. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia who reached Ghazipur at around 11.25am oversaw the arrangements made by the city administration and met Tikait.“Yesterday (Thursday), chief minister Arvind Kejriwal spoke to Tikait who complained that the UP government has removed all arrangements for water from the Ghazipur protest site. Kejriwal assured him that the Delhi government would get it done. So, today, mobile toilets have once again been installed here and water facility has also been provided by us,” said Sisodia while talking to reporters during his visit. He also reiterated that the AAP stands in support of the farmers. “The farmer who has been giving food to the entire nation is being called a traitor. They (farmers) are being abused and called violent. It is for the first time in India’s history that the Sikh community, known for their hardcore nationalism, are being called traitors by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Central government,” he said. Also Read: Tense situation at Singhu border farm protest site, police fire tear gas shellsSisodia, who is also a senior AAP leader, questioned the BJP-led Central government for not withdrawing the three farm laws till now even as the farmers have been protesting for more than two months now. “The BJP and the Central government will have to answer what kind of pressure are they facing from a few big private businessmen that they are refusing to hear the voices of crores of farmers and the public in general,” Sisodia said. At Singhu border, minister Jain and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha said they have not been allowed by the Delhi Police to station the water tankers for the farmers. “The BJP government is not letting us set up even the basic facilities for the protesting farmers here at Singhu. Me, Jain and all other AAP MLAs are here to provide water facility to the farmers. If there is any specific order by the Central government that water should not be provided to the farmers then they should show us the order. They cannot stop us. Delhi government will ensure that sanitation and water facilities are set up at Singhu border today [Friday],” said Chadha. At the Parliament, the AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and Lok Sabha MP Bhagwant Mann alleged that AAP MPs are not being allowed to enter the Parliament. “We have not been allowed entry into the Parliament. They shut the door on us because we are vehemently opposing the three farm laws. The BJP has ensured that only the political parties which support their decisions are allowed entry into the Parliament. We will continue our sit-in here outside the door of the Parliament,” said Mann.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-days-after-r-day-violence-delhi-govt-renews-support-to-farmers-101611910876627.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Tense situation at protest sites, police fire tear gas shells at Singhu||Clashes broke out between farmers who are on a sit-in protest at the Singhu border and a group of people who came to remove farmers from blocking the roads around 1.45pm. The two groups pelted stones at each other. Delhi Police had to fire multiple rounds of tear gas shells to stop the two groups from becoming more violent. At least one person and one police official was injured in the stone-pelting. After the stone-pelting stopped, the situation remained tense.On Thursday a group of people who claimed to be locals from the nearby areas of Bawana had come to the border and asked the farmers on sit-in protest to vacate the roads. The group had left on Thursday but warned that they would return again on Friday. At the Tikri border too , the situation continued to be tense. A group of about 50 persons tried to get near the spot where farmers are protesting. Unlike the situation at the Singhu border, police in Tikri managed to separate the group from the farmers.Ravindra Kumar Chaudhary, a resident of Baba Haridas Colony at Tikri Border, said, “For the last two months we have been tolerating whatever these protesters were doing on the pretext of agitation against farm laws. Whatever they did on January 26 is unacceptable. We will not tolerate the insult of our national flag.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tense-situation-at-singhu-border-farm-protest-site-police-fire-tear-gas-shells-101611909376373.html

The court said there are linkages shown by the prosecution between Kalita and other accused persons and the allegations against her were prima facie true.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat also said all the citizens of the country under the Constitution of India have the right and freedom to protest including the right to oppose any legislation, however, it’s not an absolute right but subject to reasonable restrictions. It said that previous sanction was taken under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and thus, an independent review of the evidence gathered during the investigation has been done by an independent authority after its satisfaction about the evidence.“The contention of the counsel for accused that the sanction was given in haste is not for this court to give an opinion on. What is important is that an independent authority has given its opinion about the applicability of UAPA in the present case,” the court said.It noted that as per the prosecution, there were messages on Delhi Protest Support Group Whatsapp Group, particularly on February 22, 23 and 24 last year, allegedly showing the role of Pinjra Tod.Kalita was arrested for hatching a conspiracy along with the other co-accused to orchestrate the north-east Delhi riots. The specific role for which she has been accused is for calling people to block the roads, thus resulting in the riots.Communal riots had broken out in north-east Delhi in February last year, claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-pinjra-tod-member-devangana-kalita-101611909258425.html

The timings for general public’s use of the local train service will, however, be restricted to avoid crowding, said officials.The suburban train services--the biggest mode of public transport in Mumbai-- was shut since March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, workforce in essential services, women, and some other categories were subsequently allowed to use the service after easing of restrictions in place to contain the disease.According to the new directives, general commuters will be allowed to board locals till 7am in the morning, then between 12 to 4pm in the afternoon and from 9 pm till the last local of the day in the night. This means the general public will not be allowed to travel between 7am and 12 noon and between 4pm and 9 pm, which are considered peak travel hours.The government has also urged offices to go for staggered working hours to ensure less crowding in trains, considered the lifeline of the city.Also Read: Court fails to see plight of Marathis: Sena on border dispute with KarnatakaThe state government has also allowed shops and restaurants in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region to remain open till 11pm and 1am, respectively.Hoteliers and shopkeepers have welcomed the move.

29-01-2021||Chandigarh||'PLA efforts to alter status quo were and are being effectively countered'||The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) agreed to push for “early disengagement” of their frontline troops at friction areas on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh at the ninth round of military talks on Sunday. Lt Gen YK Joshi, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Army’s Northern Command, spoke to Ravi Krishnan Khajuria, about the current situation in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir. Edited excerpts:What is the current situation in eastern Ladakh?The operational advantage achieved by our troops on August 29-30, 2020, has put the PLA on the backfoot in key areas. This gives us the position of equivalence. Necessary measures have been put in place to respond to any threat over the entire spectrum of conflict. Any efforts by the PLA to change the status quo were and are being effectively countered. The 9th Corps Commander-level talks were held on January 24. The focus is to restore the status quo ante pre-May 5, 2020, and the same has been communicated to PLA counterparts. They also want to disengage at the earliest. It is difficult to fix timelines for such a complex issue, yet we are hopeful of an early and amicable resolution.Also read: Jaishankar yellow-cards China for violating pacts, spells out the India wayIn case of a conflict, how prepared are we? We have been relentless from the moment the situation escalated in eastern Ladakh in May 2020. Our troops are equipped with the wherewithal to inhibit any PLA misadventure.Chinese have ramped up border infrastructure along LAC. What about us?In May 2020, the existing infrastructure helped [Indian] forces to effectively counter the PLA threat. The infrastructure has been boosted in terms of roads, bridges, billeting of troops, availability of weapon systems in the tactical battle area. Apart from the civil administration and government machinery, Border Roads Organisation has also pitched in to support the troops. IAF [the Indian Air Force] has also played a major part in ensuring that an air bridge is up and running once the roads close due to snow.Pakistan is using drones and digging cross-border tunnels to push arms, drugs, and terrorists into Jammu & Kashmir. How are we tackling this?A strong counter-infiltration grid, physical domination at multiple tiers, and the latest technology have brought down the intrusion rates to negligible along the LoC [Line of Control]. There is a state of despondence among terror groups which is forcing ISI [Inter-Services Intelligence] and the Pakistan Army to explore alternate methods. ...these [tunnels] are dug up under fields that are invisible due to tall elephant grass on the Pakistan side. BSF [Border Security Force] has launched an anti-tunnel drive across the IB [International Border]. We have ground-penetrating radars that help in the detection of tunnels, anti-tank mines, and IEDs [improvised explosive devices], besides anti-drone systems.On Army Day, you said the internal situation in Jammu & Kashmir is stable and under control but has the potential of flaring up. Can you elaborate?The situation is stable yet the dynamics that are at play are never constant. Our adversaries have left no stone unturned to keep Jammu & Kashmir on the boil. With the actions taken by the administration and measures adopted by security forces, Pakistan Army is facing an existential threat. It will attempt to use all its cards to flare up the situation. The increasing number of unilaterally unprovoked ceasefire violations, Pakistan-based tanzeems [organisations] trying to enhance recruitment, providing financial support to overground workers, and narco-sponsored finances for terror activities are proof of their desperation.How is the situation in the Kashmir Valley? How many terrorists are still active there?In Kashmir, the synergised counter-terrorist grid eliminated 184 terrorists including top commanders, in 2020. Several hideouts were also busted, and large quantities of arms and ammunition were seized. Actions by security forces and intelligence agencies led to arrests of a large number of OGWs [over-ground workers], thereby denting the network of tanzeems. The situation has moved towards peace, but the challenge lies in sustaining it.What is being done to reverse the trend of radicalisation of Kashmiri youth by Pakistan via the internet?ISI, which is spearheading the proxy war in Jammu & Kashmir, is employing a host of social media platforms and technologies for spreading propaganda, pushing radicalisation, and intensifying a false sense of victimhood. The drop in their cadre strength due to a robust counter-infiltration grid has forced Pakistan to create digital tanzeems as proxy fronts to Hizbul Mujhaideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) which are using social media for recruitment. This effort is being countered by a comprehensive multi-agency initiative. The deep monitoring of social media platforms and cyber-surveillance of suspects has been undertaken.How many terror launch pads are active across the LoC?Over the last 30 years, Pakistan has established an extensive terror infrastructure comprising terrorist training camps and launch pads across the LoC. We have confirmed reports of 19 active terrorist camps and over 50 launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. As per reports, around 300 terrorist cadres are ready to infiltrate. Of these, most are of Pakistan-origin terror groups such as LeT, JeM and Al Badr.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pla-on-the-backfoot-want-to-disengage-101611908655560.html
29-01-2021||Kolkata||Teesta Barrage: Former land owners demand jobs, start agitation in north Bengal||At a time when all eyes are on the farmers’ protests in the National Capital Region, hundreds of farmers whose lands were acquired to build the Teesta Barrage in north Bengal have started an agitation in Siliguri demanding jobs. The protesters, under the banner of Jalpaiguri Land Losers Association (JLLA), started an indefinite sit-in demonstration in front of the chief engineer’s office of the Teesta Barrage project and did not allow even the officials to enter the office. The Teesta Barrage project, the largest irrigation project in east India, was sanctioned by the Planning Commission in 1975 and the work started in 1976. Also Read: More politicians likely to join BJP during Amit Shah’s 2-day visit to BengalIt aims to provide irrigation water in various districts of north Bengal including Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur, Malda, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar. Three hydro power projects are also part of this national project. “Though lands were acquired in different phases since 1967 till 2006 with the promise of financial compensation and government jobs to each member of the land-losing families, more than 500 land-losers in Jalpaiguri district itself are yet to get jobs,” said Najrul Rahaman, president of JLLA. Teesta Barrage was declared a national project in 2008-2009. While the Centre was to bear 90% of the project cost, the state was supposed to bear 10%. The project, however, got delayed because of alleged irregularities and some engineers and contractors were arrested. Even after 45 years, the first phase is yet to be completed. “Though the Left Front government kept its promise and gave jobs to many, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government has only given us assurances over the past decade,” said Rahaman. They even held a 26-day hunger strike in 2019 in Jalpaiguri.The agitators said that a meeting was held on December 17, 2019, but the agitators got nothing more than assurances. Ujjawal Roy, secretary of JLLA, said: “There are a few thousand of us waiting for justice. More than 300 people are participating in the sit-in demonstration here.” Raju Bista, BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Darjeeling and the party’s national spokesperson, said: “It is infuriating that those who suffered due to the project are yet to get proper compensation. The cost estimates of the project have gone up several times, yet the project is far from being completed.” Ashim Chowdhury, executive engineer, Mahananda Link Canal Division, Teesta Barrage project, said: “We and members of the local administration held a meeting with the agitators on Thursday afternoon. The agitators are demanding jobs in exempted category.” The meeting, however, failed to solve the deadlock. ”Going by the tardy pace, it would take several years to complete even the first phase,” said a former executive engineer of the project, adding that the project was marred by rampant corruption. Initially, the project cost was ₹69.72 crore and now it has surpassed ₹3,000 crore. Goutam Deb, the state tourism minister and the region’s senior Trinamool Congress leader said: “In 2019, I had arranged a meeting between the agitators, the Jalpaiguri divisional commissioner and the Jalpaiguri district magistrate. They have been demanding jobs even before the TMC came to power. I don’t know about the updates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/teesta-barrage-former-land-owners-demand-jobs-start-agitation-in-north-bengal-101611905896231.html

A historian will take tourists through the main staircase of the building, the heritage dome, courtyard, inner courtyard, the corporation hall, the mayor’s chamber, commissioner’s office, and the standing committee hall. The tour will conclude at the museum, where photos and videos of the building are on display. Khaki Tourism, a city-based heritage tourism firm, has been appointed for curating the tours. Bharat Gothoskar, a history enthusiast and the founder of Khaki Tours, said, “Throughout the tour we will narrate 20 to 25 different stories.”The tours have been named Urbs Prima which means primary city in Latin. There is a statue of an angel with an outstretched arm atop the main entrance of the BMC building. Explaining the significance of the statue, Gothoskar said, “She represents colonial Bombay, and has a phrase carved in stone that reads Urbs Prima in Indis. This line is in Latin, and was coined in 1860s. It means Primary City in India. We have hence named the tour Urbs Prima.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-headquarters-open-to-public-as-part-of-heritage-walk-initiative-101611901696566.html

The reduction in VAT will be effective from January 28, according to the state finance department.A release from the CM’s office, issued late Thursday night, states that despite the negative impact on economic activity due to the pandemic and the subsequent decrease in revenue, the decision to reduce VAT has been taken in the interest of the common man. The reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel will provide relief to commuters as well as to transport, infrastructure, real estate, and other businesses.“With the reduction in VAT rates, the government’s revenue will reduce by approximately ₹1000 crore annually,” said the statement.Gehlot claimed that despite the international crude oil prices staying at the lowest level for some time, inflation was rising in the country due to petrol and diesel prices being at the highest level, causing economic hardship to the common man.He said that the Central government was currently charging an excise duty of ₹32.98 per litre on petrol and ₹31.83 per litre on diesel, which he said was “excessive”.He added that the basic excise duty forms a part of the divisible pool of the Centre's tax revenue, from which, 42% of resources are shared with the states, which has been reduced continuously from ₹9.48 to ₹2.98 for per litre of petrol and ₹11.33 to ₹4.83 for per litre of diesel – causing a huge loss of revenue to all the states including Rajasthan.The CM said that the Centre has been continuously increasing the additional excise duty from ₹8 to ₹18 per litre on petrol and diesel; and special excise duty hike from ₹7 to ₹12 on petrol and up to ₹9 per litre on diesel has been done.Also Read: Robert Vadra gets protection from arrest till Feb 8 in money laundering caseHe continued that due to this Central policy, the states are not benefitting while the common people have to bear the brunt of expensive petrol and diesel.He demanded that following his government’s reduction in VAT, the Central government should also offer relief by reducing Central taxes on petrol and diesel.With a hike of 26 and 38 paise per litre on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, the price of petrol in Sri Ganganagar of Rajasthan had reached ₹98.31 per litre for normal petrol and ₹101.80 per litre for premium petrol.In the capital Jaipur, petrol price had reached ₹93.86 per litre and diesel price reached ₹85.94 per litre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-reduces-2-vat-on-fuel-after-premium-petrol-price-crossed-rs-100mark-101611897324348.html

This visit of Sisodia comes after Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait had requested chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to provide water and other basic facilities to the farmers- who have been camping at the border point against the Centre’s three farm laws for over two months. On the other hand, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairman Raghav Chadha will be visiting the Singhu border to inspect facilities for the protesters.“Rakesh Tikait, farmer leader sitting on Ghazipur border had asked Chief Minister @ArvindKejriwal Ji was to facilitate water etc. for farmers.

I will go to the border this morning to see its arrangement,” Sisodia’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.Delhi CM Kejriwal while terming the Republic Day tractor rally chaos as ‘unfortunate’ said on Thursday that such incidents would not end the farmers’ movement. He added that said that “strictest punishment” must be given to those responsible for the violence.Meanwhile, farmers camping at the Ghazipur border said on Friday that they would not accept the administration notice to vacate the premises and would not leave till the laws are repealed by the Centre. The Ghaziabad district administration had ordered the protesters to vacate the site by Thursday evening adding that they would be forcefully removed if the orders were not followed. However, the farmers refused to vacate and on the contrary, Uttar Pradesh Police and Provincial Armed Constabulary deployed at the site were seen leaving.Speaking to news agency ANI, a protesting farmer said, “We do not accept the notices given by the government. No returning back to the homes until and unless the laws are taken back. We are protesting here peacefully.” Another protester said that the agitation would only end once the farmers’ demands were met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-to-visit-ghazipur-border-to-review-arrangements-for-protesters-101611897928188.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Farmer’s protest: After Tikait’s appeal, more people rush to Ghazipur site||More protesters began arriving at the Ghazipur farmer protest site from Uttarakhand, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi hours after Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait broke down during his address on Thursday and vowed not to leave the venue citing plans to arrest him.“We could not stop ourselves when we saw Rakeshji’s video in which he was crying and saying he will not have water or food. Our group immediately fetched water and started our journey. We drove about 300km and reached ...[the protest site] at 4 am [on Friday]...,” said Gagandeep Singh Guraya, a resident of Punjab’s Fatehgarh Sahib.“There was dense fog in Sonipat and Karnal and we even had to slow down our speed to about 5 kmph. For the rest of the distance, we drove at higher speeds... We will now stay here and will see to it that more people reach here, and the protest continues,” said Love Preet Singh, another member of the group.Also read | Farmers told to vacate protest sites in Haryana, UPAmrita Kundu, 32, said she saw Tikait’s video on Thursday in Delhi’s Nangloi and immediately told her husband that they should rush to Ghazipur. “I came here to offer him water and I was moved by his emotional appeal. I could not see him in tears and I along with my husband reached by 11pm. I offered water to Rakeshji and he had it. My father-in-law and even my 10-year-old son often go to the Singhu and Tikri protest sites as we are from a family of farmers from Kaithal, Haryana,” she said. Kundu added they celebrated her birthday and marriage anniversary at the protest sites this year.Ankit Chaudhary, another protester, said he rushed to the site with a 17-member group on a tractor from Muzaffarnagar after seeing Tikait’s video on social media. “We said enough is enough when we saw our leader in tears. ...he was in pain and trying to save the honour of farmers. So, we rushed in our tractor-trolley and 18 of us reached by 4 am. We will now stay here and will also call up our other friends to the site.”Prem Singh Sobta from Uttarakhand’s Udham Singh Nagar echoed Chaudhary. “We came in two of our cars and reached by midnight. I initially came here to attend the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day and left for home thereafter. But I again rushed back when I saw the video. A lot of people have reached and more will come on Friday. It will motivate the farmers who are continuing with their agitation.”Ranjeet Singh, a resident of Shahjahanpur, said they ran a community kitchen and about 50 of them were camping at the site. “We decided on Thursday to leave for Haridwar where we have another camp as there were apprehensions of police action and also that electricity and water supplies also got affected. But when we saw people coming in after the video went viral, we decided to stay back.”BSU leader Rajbir Singh said Friday will be a vital day as more people will come and join the protest. “There is also a Mahapanchayat call... and people from different districts will attend it.”Authorities issued an ultimatum to the protesting farmers to vacate the Ghazipur site as security forces dug trenches, put up barricades, and bolstered numbers at farmer protest sites on Delhi’s borders on Thursday two days after the violent Republic Day tractor rally. Farmers, primarily from western Uttar Pradesh, have been sitting in Ghazipur for about two months.Tikait was served a notice under section 133 of CrPC (conditional order for removal of the nuisance) for eviction from the site and he was also to be arrested. He remained defiant, saying there was no question of vacating Ghazipur and that police can do whatever they want. Tikait accused the government of trying to destroy farmers and warned if the three farm laws are not repealed, he will commit suicide. He broke down towards the end of his address to the protesters on Thursday.A large police contingent and protesting farmers were positioned on either side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway when Tikait announced a hunger strike. With visuals of Tikait breaking down beamed on television, around 5,000 farmers gathered at his ancestral village of Sisauli, roughly 100km away, and threatened to march to Ghazipur.The number of people at the Ghazipur protest site had decreased to about 1,000-1,200 on Thursday as many people left it following the January 26 violence. Protesters said the declining numbers could have given authorities a chance to get the site vacated easily.The heavy deployment of police was relaxed when three buses carrying the provincial armed constabulary personnel left the site around 2 am on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-after-tikait-s-appeal-more-people-rush-to-ghazipur-site-101611899415809.html

29-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: His night vigil||It’s midnight. This chic south Delhi market is completely quiet—even the barking dogs have gone silent. Arvind Kumar, however, is wide awake. His eyes are cast downwards, towards his shoes, inches away from an electric heater, glowing red. He is sitting on a chair outside the glass door of a boutique. The shop is locked for the night but is dimly lit inside, and one can see the dresses arranged around the mannequins. It is very cold.Mr Kumar is a security guard. “I have been working in Delhi for 25 years,” he says in an alert voice.It is assumed that, on looking back at one’s career, a middle-aged person can easily chart the progress attained over time. “But I see no progress... my line is straight,” Mr Kumar says matter-of-factly. He is 58, and his salary and the nature of his work have remained the same, he mutters. “Everything I earned over the years has gone into supporting my family in Gaya (Bihar) and into the weddings of my four daughters. I’m still supporting my parents and my wife, Anita Devi.” His two sons are farmers in the village, he says.Throwing a glance inside the showroom, Mr Kumar admits that the cost of a single dress is probably more than his entire year’s earnings. “Some people have so much money... what can one do.”A long pause follows. Suddenly a dog starts barking.“This is also the time of the night when Mr Kumar starts to feel hungry.” His shift begins at 7 in the evening. He gets here by walking from his single-room dwelling in Munirka, after a meal of dal and roti he cooks for himself.On finishing his shift in the morning, he walks straight to his room and rustles out a quick breakfast, instead of stopping by a pavement stall for chai and toast “and spend my money unnecessarily.”Since the nature of his night-long job forces him to stay awake, with no one around for a chat, how does he pass his long empty hours? Mr Kumar shrugs his shoulders, saying, “I think about how my life has passed and how it will pass.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-his-night-vigil-101611881922862.html

The new order has kept alive Bharti’s chances to continue as a legislator.Under the Representation of the People’s Act, a legislator stands disqualified upon being sentenced to jail for a minimum of two years.The membership of the house is lost with immediate effect.The legislator then has to obtain a stay on the conviction to remain a member of the house -- a mere suspension of sentence or jail term will not suffice.On Thursday, special judge Vikas Dhull said the appeal hearing, challenging the order of the magistrate court, was going to take time. The judge also directed Bharti to pay a personal bond of ₹20,000 and produce one surety of like amount.“Since the appeal is going to take considerable time for disposal and having regard to grounds set out in the appeal, the application filed by the convict/appellant is allowed and conviction order dated January 22 and sentence order dated January 23 are suspended during the pendency of this appeal…..,’ the judge said in his order.Bharti, through his counsels Mohammad Irshad and Pritish Sabharwal, had filed a plea challenging the conviction and sentence awarded to him for breaking the fencing of a boundary wall of AIIMS with an earthmover on September 9, 2016.He was accompanied by 300 others, according to the complaint to by RS Rawat, chief security officer, AIIMS.The court had convicted Bharti for various offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, including sections 323, 353 and 147. The court, however, had acquitted Bharti’s associates and co-accused - Jagat Saini, Dileep Jha, Sandeep Sonu and Rakesh Pandey — citing lack of evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-suspends-mla-bharti-s-conviction-and-sentencing-in-assault-case-101611881330569.html

Both central and south districts saw highest increase in the number of vaccination centres with four additional sites each.“The sites were increased in places that saw high turnouts – over 90% — for the last couple of days when the number of people getting the shot went up,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department.Thirty four hospitals in the city were able to administer 100 vaccines on Thursday, including 10 hospitals run by the Delhi government, according to government officials. According to city hospitals, the high turnout is the result of a tweak in the government’s CoWIN platform that allows walk-in beneficiaries even if their names are not on the day’s list.A senior doctor from Central government-run Lady Hardinge Medical College said, “Only about 50% of the people who are called in for vaccination each day actually come to the centre for vaccination. Health care workers are still hesitant to get the vaccines but there are also people who are on leave or in quarantine and cannot come. Also, a few people are sent back each day because of contraindication. So, we were able to vaccinate more people by allowing walk in.”On Thursday, south-east Delhi saw the highest turnout with 89.8% of the beneficiaries getting the shot. And, the lowest turnout was in Northeast Delhi where 62.7% people received the jab. This, however, is better than the 53.3% average vaccination that happened across the city on January 16 when the nationwide drive was rolled out. “As more and more people are getting vaccinated, the others are realising that there is no serious side effect of the vaccines and more and more people are turning up. The numbers are expected to improve further,” said the doctor from Lok Nayak hospital.As on Thursday, 47,959 health workers have received the vaccine out of the estimated 300,000 who will get it. Those who have taken the shot will be given a second dose of the vaccine in 28 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/8244-health-workers-get-covid-19-shots-in-capital-101611880836468.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||NGT directs Delhi CS to monitor Yamuna rejuvenation||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Chief Secretary of Delhi, in coordination with other authorities and the Chief Secretaries of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to personally monitor the handling of the grim situation caused by years of neglect in the rejuvenation of Yamuna river by evolving an effective administrative mechanism.The tribunal's order came observing that the satisfactory results are not visible on account of the failure of enforcement and monitoring, as found by the monitoring committee.An NGT bench headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel recommended that the causes of failure of existing mechanism and remedial measures required be addressed in the light of reports of the committee.This needs to be further overseen at the national level by the Central Monitoring Committee, headed by Secretary of Jal Shakti Ministry, which also includes National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in terms of earlier orders of this tribunal, the bench pointed out.The NGT bench further made it clear that non-adherence to timelines must result in adequate and stringent action against accountable persons."Timely completion of projects must be ensured, otherwise for generations the problem will remain untackled, as vested interests will like the projects to remain pending and delayed to the detriment of the public interest," the NGT said."Interim measures like phytoremediation need to employed where a permanent solution is delayed. Earlier directions of the tribunal, which by and large remain uncomplied so far, need to be strictly followed with meaningful coercive measures against the erring officers and the violators," the NGT further said.The NGT said that River Rejuvenation Committees (RRCs) of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh may accordingly monitor execution of the action plans with proper inter-departmental coordination, to remedy the polluted stretches of Yamuna river in their respective jurisdiction subject to oversight of the chief secretaries on quarterly basis, who may thereafter give their quarterly reports to the Central Monitoring Committee (CMC) headed by the Secretary, Jal Shakti in terms of its earlier order dated September 21, 2020.The bench noted, the matter has been dealt with by the Supreme Court for 23 years, before transfer of the matter to this tribunal in the year 2017 and by this tribunal for almost nine years.The bench said that the committee has functioned for more than two years and contributed in a big way in steering the authorities with a clear roadmap by its exhaustive reports on every aspect but the authorities' action has been every time found to be inadequate and continues to be so.This requires the authorities to change their attitude and rise to the occasion to discharge their constitutional obligation to the citizens to provide a clean environment by protecting the scarce sources of water by stringent steps against the erring officers and the violators and by effective monitoring at appropriate higher levels, reviewing/modifying the failed models and failed officers, the bench recommended.The RRCs of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh may accordingly monitor execution of the action plans with proper inter-departmental coordination, to remedy the polluted stretches of river Yamuna in their respective jurisdiction, the bench said.The NGT was hearing a matter relating to rejuvenation of Yamuna river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ngt-directs-delhi-cs-to-monitor-yamuna-rejuvenation-101611880673275.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||AAP amends party rules at council meet||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday passed six amendments in the party constitution in its national council meeting held in Delhi – the first after it won the Delhi assembly elections in February 2020 with a majority of 62 out of 70 seats.Sisodia said, “The amendments would help the party grow across states.”The new amendments allow the party to induct recruits and give them election tickets irrespective of the number of people in their families who have contested elections. They prohibit members of the party to flag concerns and share criticism regarding the party and the leadership in public domain, and allow interim appointment of office bearers by national and state executives in case of sudden vacancies, said Delhi’s deputy chief minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia in a press conference after the meeting.Sharing a list of amendments passed on Thursday, Sisodia said, “District level units of the party will now be considered as its primary units, instead of booth-level units under the old clauses, and MPs and MLAs of the party will by default become members of the national council and the concerned state council, so that they can contribute to the party’s growth without any delay.”He added, “Also, party members will have full permission to take up concerns about the party, behaviour of other members, or criticise the leadership in designated communication forums of the party, but they cannot do that outside those forums or in public domain… We have also decided that from now on the state council or the national council meeting can take place virtually and it will be valid.”“Earlier, there was a clause in the party’s constitution that said two people from the same family cannot fight the election. This rule will be only valid for the existing members of the AAP. But we are witnessing that many new leaders are joining our party whose two family members have contested elections. In such cases, the party has decided to allow such people to join, contest elections and work for the AAP. The amendment would apply to new recruits,” he added.There is a clause in the party’s constitution which says that no member will hold the same post as an office-bearer for more than two consecutive terms of three years each. However, party convener Arvind Kejriwal has held the same position for two terms which ended in April 2019, but it was extended for one year in view of the Lok Sabha and Delhi assembly elections. But in 2020, the national council meeting could not take place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-amends-party-rules-at-council-meet-101611880220030.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||At Tikri border, farmers take out a ‘tiranga rally’||Several farmer unions protesting at the Tikri border took out a “tiranga rally” on Thursday in what they said was an attempt to dispel “myths” allegedly being propagated by the government that protesters at Delhi borders did not respect the Tricolour, while insisting they would not vacate the protest site until their demands were met.On Tuesday, a group of agitating farmers had stormed Red Fort during the tractor rally organised by farm unions against the three new farm laws and hoisted religious flags.At least 394 policemen were injured in violence at different spots in the city during the agitation.One farmer was killed when his tractor rammed into a police barricade and overturned.Unlike the Singhu border, where a group raised slogans against the farmers and accused them of “disrespecting the national flag”, the Tikri border remained relatively peaceful on Thursday even as security was beefed up by the police at the main entry point.Pargat Singh, a protester from Ferozpur, said: “The tiranga rally was taken out by the farmers from Punjab and Haryana to condemn what had happened at the Red Fort on Republic Day. We have been constantly saying that those involved in the incident were infiltrators. Farmers like us, who work day and night to ensure that every citizen in the country gets enough food to eat, can never disrespect the national flag.”Navkiran Natt, another protester at Tikri, alleged: “The government first sent its infiltrators to perform that shameful incident at the Red Fort. Now, it’s trying to stage protests against the farmers and trying to set a narrative that it’s the farmers who had disrespected the national flag. We want to make it clear that we love our national flag and we have nothing to do with what happened at the Red Fort.”The protesters also said that the police were trying to cut off the protest site to discourage the supporters of the farmers’ movement from visiting them.Jagmohan Singh, a farmer leader, said, “Some visitors also complained that police did not allow them to enter the protest site.”A senior police officer, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the police were reacting to the violence on Republic Day and ensuring it was not repeated.Shalini Singh, joint commissioner of police (western range), said that the increased police presence at the Tikri Border was as per an “upgrade” in force deployment.“The inner roads where people can walk to the protest venue or nearby neighborhoods are still open. The situation is peaceful,” said the officer.On whether protesters were going back to their villages, Joginder Singh, president of BKU (Ugrahan), a prominent group of protesting farmers, said, “People are spreading rumours. Only those who had come just to participate in the January 26 tractor parade have left. All the other protesters are still here and we will not leave till our demands are met.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-tikri-border-farmers-take-out-a-tiranga-rally-101611879251661.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Singhu tense amid high security, counter-protest||Increased police presence, freshly dug up trenches, additional concrete barriers separating two protest sites and counter protests demanding immediate removal of the agitating farmers from the highway were witnessed at Singhu border, one of the three major sites of farmers’ protest in the Capital, on Thursday.Farmers said police had installed additional concrete barriers between the two stages, practically cutting one’s access to the other and thus making the group sitting close to the Delhi border vulnerable — an allegation the police sought to play down — and forcing many protesters to use longer routes through inner lanes to enter the main protest area.Ghanshyam Bansal, additional deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), said, “These barricades were present from the early days of the protest. They had been displaced in between and are now being put back in their place.”The protest site at the Singhu border is divided into two parts: the main Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) stage and the Kisaan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) stage, situated 500 metres away. Until Thursday, the farmers could move from one site to another using a narrow passage but now that has been blocked, the farmers alleged.Gurpreet Singh, 25, a farmer from Hoshiarpur in Punjab, said, “Now, protesters at the first (KMSC) stage will face difficulty in coming towards the main stage. Movement between the two stages has been restricted.”Around 12pm, around 50 people gathered near the KMSC stage raising slogans against the farmers and demanding that the protest at Singhu border be cleared.One of them, Mohan Bhardwaj, 42, a resident of Bawana, said, “We had been sympathetic to their cause so far because we too are farmers. But when we saw their actions during Republic Day, when they insulted the tricolour at Red Fort, we knew that they were not farmers. This is why we want them to be removed.”On January 26, a section of farmers had stormed the monument and installed religious flags on its domes.Bhardwaj said, “Today, we came here to talk to them and give a warning. Tomorrow, we will return with people from 50 villages and get the protest site cleared. We are talking to them (the farmers) politely but if they don’t listen, we’ll do what they did.”Sudhir Chauhan, 34, who claimed he was the president of the collective Hindu Yuva Seva Sangh that organised the protest, said, “Locals have suffered due to this (farmers’) protest. The distance that could be covered in 15 minutes took two hours. We won’t tolerate that anymore because these are not farmers. They are anti-nationals.”Along with members of the collective, local workers of Hindu Sena were also present at the spot. “We had not given any call to reach Singhu border but I got to know that some of our workers had reached the spot with local residents. These workers did not like the action of the farmers during Republic Day which is why they went to protest,” said Vishnu Gupta, national president.Members of Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch – a collective of around 50 villages in Delhi – had also reached the area along with their supporters and members. Anup Singh Maan, 78, a resident of Alipur and general secretary of the group, said, “We had extended an invitation to farmers to talk to us but they denied. We will hold meetings among ourselves and decide what to do on Friday,” he said.The protesting group included members of Hindu Sena, and Delhi Dehat Vikas Manch – a collective of around 50 villages in Delhi.The group dispersed at around 2.30 pm – around 30 minutes after SKM started a “sadhbhawna yatra” (goodwill rally) on the Kundli highway covering over 16 kilometres. With tricolour hoisted over their tractors and other vehicles, farmer leaders including Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Darshan Pal, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Jagmohan Singh, Jangbir Singh, Rajinder Singh, Amarjeet Singh and others participated in the yatra aimed at reinforcing feeling of unity among farmers.Reacting to the notices sent to farmer leaders on Wednesday, SKM, in a statement on Thursday, said: “Instead of taking action against the real criminals, the police are arresting farmers who were protesting peacefully.”Meanwhile, due to increased barricading and the presence of trenches, locals also faced problems in commuting with many being forced to take longer routes covering the interiors of villages on foot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/singhu-tense-amid-high-security-counterprotest-101611878619403.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||At Red Fort, crowd tried snatching guns from two cops: FIR||Protesters who ran amok at the Red Fort on Republic Day tried to snatch weapons of two Delhi Police constables, according to a first information report (FIR) filed in connection with a farmers’ demonstration that spun out of control in the national capital.In the FIR — filed on Wednesday — the police registered a case against unidentified protesters for attempt to snatch weapons of security personnel and attempt to murder, theft, dacoity, rioting, and criminal conspiracy, among other charges.It said some of the protesters, who deviated from the route agreed upon with the police and stormed the historic monument, were armed with pistols as well as swords, spears, sickles, sticks and rods. The nine-page FIR added that they also stole the police’s anti-riot gears.They were also booked under the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 (for causing damage to the monument), Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (for vandalism), and the Arms Act 1959 (for illegal possession of arms).Hundreds of farmers climbed the ramparts of Red Fort after storming it, hoisted religious flags, resorted to vandalism, fought a pitched battle with the police, and threw some of them into trenches as dramatic scenes unfolded on Republic Day.The FIR was filed based on the statement of Rituraj, a station house officer at Kotwali police station; Red Fort comes under the jurisdiction of the police station.In his complaint, the police official, who was present during the mayhem, said nearly 1,000 -1,200 protesters reached near Raj Ghat in 30-40 tractors, 125-150 cars, and motorcycles around 12.15pm on Tuesday.According to the complaint, the protesters rammed their tractors into police’s barricades at Nishad Raj Marg on Shanti Van Chowk and made their way towards the fort. It said after entering the fort premises on cars, tractors and motorcycles, they made their way to the ramparts and hoisted various flags, including the Nishan Sahib of Sikhs.When senior police officers ordered the use of force against protesters who were entering the fort from the Meena Bazar side, those who were already inside attacked policemen with swords and sticks, the FIR said.It said the protesters thrashed policemen with spears, swords, sticks and rods, and pushed them into the moat, injuring some of them grievously. The FIR mentioned that one of the constables on duty, 31-year-old Bhawani Singh, said he was carrying an MP5 rifle (a submachine gun), which the protesters tried to take away from him.“When I did not let them take it away, they took out the magazine and stole it with 20 live rounds. I was surrounded by the protesters and they pushed me into the moat. The impact of the fall was such that I fractured my left knee. The protesters continued to pelt stones at me and I had to use a shield of another policeman to cover myself. I was saved by my colleagues who also have sustained injuries,” Singh, who is due for a knee surgery on Friday, told HT over phone from Sushrut Trauma Centre at Kashmere Gate.Protesters also tried to snatch the single loading rifle of another constable but failed, the FIR said. But he lost a magazine that had 20 live cartridges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-red-fort-crowd-tried-snatching-guns-from-two-cops-fir-101611878215659.html
29-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers told to vacate protest sites in Haryana, UP||Police and local administrations started removing farmers from some of the protest sites in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh on Thursday morning and vacated several toll plazas occupied by members of farm bodies demanding repeal of the three new agriculture laws.Farmers across rural Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh held local maha-panchayats to discuss the future course of action on Thursday, deciding to intensify the protest after a few days. They blamed the government for the violence at Red Fort and Delhi’s ITO on Republic Day.Late on Wednesday night, local police used mild force to remove protesting farmers from a highway in Bhagpat in western Uttar Pradesh. Farmer leaders alleged that police were harassing families of farm union leaders and protesting farmers in villages.At Ghazipur on Delhi border, the local administration snapped electricity and water supply to the protesting farmers and asked them to remove the blockade going on for the past two months. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shanker Pandey asked the farm leaders to vacate the site by Thursday night. “The district administration has asked protesters to vacate the dharna site by tonight,” said a district officer.“I will not vacate the place,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait. His supporters in Muzaffarnagar urged him to continue, declaring that thousands of farmers would get themselves arrested if Tikait was taken into custody.A small farmers’ group, which had started a dharna (sit-in) against three new agriculture reform laws at a college ground in the Bajna area of Mathura district on December 2, suspended their agitation on Thursday after talks with Mathura police and district administration officials.“We have suspended our agitation for one month after assurances (were) given to look into our local issues,” said Ram Babu Katelia, the national president of the Bhartiya Kisan Kalyan Samiti.Farmer leaders in Haryana said that the district administration and police were mounting pressure on them to clear the toll plazas and ensure free movement of vehicles.Azad Palwan, a farm leader from Jind, said district officials called them and asked to vacate Khatkar and other toll plazas in the district. “The farmers have refused to vacate the toll plazas in the district until our demands are met,” he said.Balwant Nambardar, head of Phogat Khap, along with four other farmers had a meeting with Bhiwani deputy commissioner, Jaibir Arya, and told him that they will not vacate the Kitlana toll plaza, where hundreds of farmers have been protesting for over a month. “We will clear the toll plazas in the district after our top leaders call,” he said.The farmers protesting at Masani village in Rewari have vacated their protest site and shifted to Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border in the neighbouring state’s territory. Rewari deputy commissioner Yashendra Singh, said they have cleared the National highway 8, which connects Delhi to Jaipur, in their territory. The protest is continuing at Shahjahanpur on the Rajasthan side.Police cleared the Palwal protest site on the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal (KGP) expressway on Thursday morning. “The nearby villagers had requested them to vacate the sites on Wednesday late evening. The protesters had assured them that they will leave early morning and had packed their stuff at night and left on tractors and other vehicles,” said Jangsher, inspector of Gadpuri police station, in whose jurisdiction the protest site falls. The protesters at this site had tried to break police barricades and enter Delhi on January 26, said Deepak Gahlawat, superintendent of police, Palwal.In UP’s Muzaffarnagar, two kisan panchayats held on Thursday reiterated their support to Tikait and said they would intensify their agitation in the coming weeks.At least 12 khap panchayats in Jind and Hisar districts of Haryana reiterated their support to the farmer protests in Delhi. “They (khap panchayats) have unanimously decided to support the ongoing farmer protest. The attack at Red Fort was a government conspiracy,” said Sahil Rukaya, who participated in the meeting in Hisar.On Thursday, mobile internet services in three districts of Haryana – Sonepat, Jhajjar and Palwal – were suspended till 5pm on January 29, a government order said. The services were shut down on the evening of January 26 for 24 hours initially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-told-to-vacate-protest-sites-in-haryana-up-101611873991878.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra home minister warns of action over post against BJP MP Raksha Khadse||Taking note of a screenshot of derogatory remarks against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of Parliament (MP) Raksha Khadse which was shared online, state home minister Anil Deshmukh has warned of stern action by the cyber cell. Khadse, a BJP MP from Raver in Jalgaon district, has lodged a complaint with the police. Late on Wednesday, Deshmukh posted a tweet: “Shocking to see such a derogatory description of Raksha Khadse, BJP MP from Maharashtra on the official site of the BJP. Maha Govt. will not tolerate this disrespectful behaviour towards women. @BJP4India must take action against those responsible or @MahaCyber1will step in.”The home minister retweeted a post by journalist Swati Chaturvedi along with his warning. The screenshot shared with the tweet had objectionable words next to the MP’s name in place of her constituency. While the screenshot indicated that the derogatory comment was made on the party’s website, no such remark was found on BJP.org. Khadse said that it might be the handiwork of some mischievous elements and the viral image seemed like it was doctored. “The screenshots are being made viral from Save Maharashtra From BJP. Somebody is playing mischief to defame me using the Photoshopped image. When I checked the party’s official website there was no such reference found. I have informed party bosses about it and lodged a complaint with the superintendent of police,” Khadse told Marathi news channels.Maharashtra BJP’s media head Vishwas Pathak said, “It is either mischief played by some miscreant or an incorrect Marathi translation of her constituency Raver, mentioned next to her name. It should be thoroughly investigated. Demeaning reference of any woman is not acceptable at any cost. At the same time, by retweeting it, Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has shown insensitivity and apathy towards women.”“After I spoke to the superintendent of police, the post was removed from Save Maharashtra From BJP, website, which is against our party. The Marathi translation of the constituency’s name was misused by the group. I have spoken to party leaders who have discussed strict action and investigation into the entire episode,” said Khadse.The MP said that she was surprised to see that the Maharashtra home minister used the incidence for politics. “The minister should not have retweeted the word which is derogatory and maligning the dignity of any woman. It is sad that he used the post for political gain,” she said. Khadse is the daughter-in-law of former state minister Eknath Khadse who recently defected to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after accusing state BJP leaders of ill-treating him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-home-minister-warns-of-action-over-post-against-bjp-mp-raksha-khadse-101611868093436.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra social outfits demand investigation into Delhi violence, support farmers’ protest||Social outfits in Maharashtra, which have been supporting the farmers’ protest against new farm laws, have condemned the January 26 Delhi violence but reiterated their support to the agitating farmers. They are now demanding a detailed inquiry into what happened on January 26 and want the guilty to be punished. The Jan Aandolanaanchi Sangharsh Samiti (Maharashtra) blamed anti-social elements for indulging in violence. “We demand that there should be a proper investigation regarding this incident. Such anti-social elements need to be identified, and appropriate legal action should be taken,” read a statement issued by the samiti. It said that the farmers have been protesting peacefully from the last two months, and efforts were being made to defame the protests. The Kamgar Sanghatana Samyukta Kruti Samiti (Maharashtra) has called the violence a Central government conspiracy to break the struggle. “How can anyone even enter the Red Fort when the whole area is turned into a fortress on such an important day?” questioned Vishwas Utagi, co-convenor of the samiti. “The whole thing is suspicious as one faction started its march before time, deviated from the given route and then indulged in violence,” said Utagi. The Satyashodhak Shetkari Sabha (SSS) said it does not stand with those farmers who indulged in violence. “It is an attempt to divert attention from the real struggle and spoil the name of a genuine agitation,” said Kishore Dhamale, SSS. “We would not like to associate ourselves with such anti-social elements at any cost,” he added. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at different borders of Delhi since November 26 last year, against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. On January 26, a tractor march was organised by the farmers that got derailed and violence erupted in the Red Fort area. Nandurbar farmer dies on her way back home Sitabai Tadvi, a farm leader from Nandurbar, who was a part of the farmers’ protest at Delhi, died due to the cold in Jaipur. Tadvi, who was at the forefront of the farmers’ agitation, was travelling back to her village from Alwar. She fell ill on the way and was admitted to a hospital at Jaipur where she succumbed to her illness, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-social-outfits-demand-investigation-into-delhi-violence-support-farmers-protest-101611867913789.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||MVA parties slam Karnataka DyCM for demanding Mumbai as Union Territory||Ruling allies in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Thursday slammed Karnataka’s deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi for demanding Mumbai be declared a Union territory. Congress described it as a sinister design of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government to weaken Maharashtra. The Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) also criticised Savadi’s demand, describing it as baseless. BJP’s Maharashtra state unit also dismissed Savadi’s claim. Savadi’s comment came after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had suggested on Wednesday that the Centre should make the Marathi-speaking areas on the Karnataka-Maharashtra border a Union territory since there is an ongoing case in the Supreme Court on this issue. While Maharashtra has staked a claim over these areas, which include Belagavi (also known as Belgaum), Karwar and Nippani, Karnataka has maintained ownership of the area. On Thursday, Savadi said, “Earlier, we were part of the Mumbai region. My demand and the demand of the people in this region is that Mumbai is attached to Karnataka. I demand the Central government ensure Mumbai should be declared a Union territory. The issue will be resolved once we demand Mumbai,” he said. Congress described Savadi’s demand as a conspiracy. “It exposes the sinister plot of the Modi government to weaken Mumbai and also Maharashtra. We have seen how attempts were made to shift the international financial centre and also trade to Gujarat. The Central government has been a silent spectator as its ultimate aim was to make Mumbai a Union territory,” alleged Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, adding that the Centre was using agencies like Enforcement Directorate and Central Bureau of Investigation to “to trouble businessmen and Bollywood” to weaken Mumbai. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said his party was not taking Savadi’s comment seriously. “Savadi should understand history. The boundary dispute with Karnataka is to protect Marathi language and culture,” he said. Raut also said Maharashtra did not discriminate against the Kannada-speaking population in the state, unlike the way Karnataka has done in its Marathi-speaking areas. “The Maharashtra government provides grants to Kannada schools, libraries and cultural organisations in the state. Does this happen in Belgaum?” he asked. Maharashtra deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said Savadi’s claim on Mumbai was “baseless and pointless”. “The demand made by the chief minister [Thackeray] has no connection with what the Karnataka deputy chief minister has said in his response,” he said. “The Karnataka deputy chief minister may have made the demand to please their people. It has no base beyond that. His demand is baseless and pointless,” Pawar said. State BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari also disregarded Savadi’s comment. “In our view, the statement made by the deputy chief minister of Karnataka in Mumbai is not worth taking cognizance of. We don’t want to give importance to it. The relation of Mumbai and Maharashtra is too old and demand cannot make any difference,” Bhandari said. The border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 that brought Belagavi and 10 talukas that were once part of the colonial Bombay Presidency and later part of Mysore, into Karnataka. Maharashtra opposed this on the ground that the population of Belagavi, Nipani and Karwar are mostly Marathi speakers. This dispute is pending in the Supreme Court. At a public event on Wednesday, Thackeray had said, “When the issue is pending in the Apex court, the Karnataka government changed the name of Belgaum [to Belagavi], and set up their second capital there. A Marathi-speaking mayor was booked under sedition for taking the pro-Marathi stand. This is nothing but the oppression of the Marathi-speaking citizens in border areas. This leads to the contempt of court. There is a need to declare the disputed areas as Union Territory to restrain the Karnataka government from this unilateral action.” State NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase asked state BJP leaders to clarify their stand on Karnataka deputy chief minister’s remarks on Mumbai. “We want to know if the demand made by Karnataka deputy chief minister is acceptable to the state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. We want them to clear their stand. If they are with Maharashtra then they are also expected to reply to the demand,” Tapase said in a statement released on Thursday.The Maharashtra Government released a 50 year old documentary on border dispute titled ‘A case for Justice’ which justifies the inclusion of border areas in Maharashtra. The documentary released on YouTube was directed by Kumarsen Samarth. It shows scenes like an NCC placard in Marathi and a teacher teaching languages like Marathi, English and Konkani. The documentary was released on the direction of the Maharashtra chief minister’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-parties-slam-karnataka-dycm-for-demanding-mumbai-as-union-territory-101611867793552.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra-Karnataka border row: Uddhav Thackeray turns aggressive to corner BJP||Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has become aggressive on the issue of the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute over the past two days, leading to political bickering, with claims and counter-claims between the two states. Thackeray’s aggressive stance on the decades-old issue is not new for his party, but it is now aimed at scoring politically over the Shiv Sena’s rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).At the receiving end of the continuous attacks by the BJP over various issues, Thackeray is now relying on Sena’s time-tested issue of Marathi pride to counter his political rivals. It comes in handy for him ahead of the civic polls in several cities, including Mumbai, scheduled to be held in less than a year. For the Shiv Sena, the cause of Marathi “asmita” or pride and safeguarding Mumbai against attempts to “take it away” from Maharashtra have been pet issues over the years, political analysts said. The Marathi pride issue could also help the Sena minimise the division of its votes with Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). For the Sena, retaining power in the Mumbai civic body as well as some other cities such as Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli is important. The Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute has its origin in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. It made Belgaum and 10 talukas of the Bombay State, once part of colonial Bombay Presidency, a part of the then Mysore state. Maharashtra opposed the move, arguing that Belgaum, Nipani and Karwar had a majority of Marathi speaking population and should have been part of the state. Karnataka opposed it. The dispute subsequently went to the Supreme Court (SC) and is pending there. The Marathi speaking people in these areas have been agitating for inclusion in Maharashtra for five decades and have often alleged that the Karnataka government has been trying to suppress their agitation and imposing the Kannada language on them. After Thackeray on Wednesday sought Union Territory status for the disputed areas, Karnataka deputy chief minister Laxman Savadi demanded that Mumbai should be made a Union Territory as it belongs to Karnataka. The statement invited the ire of Shiv Sena and Congress leaders who said that it is the BJP’s ploy to carve Mumbai out of Maharashtra.While Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut asked Savadi to study the history of the issue properly, Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “Mumbai is not a disputed land. It was always a part of Maharashtra. The statement that came from Savadi has exposed the BJP’s plot to take away Mumbai from Maharashtra. Earlier too, there was a ploy to join Mumbai with Gujarat. This has been BJP’s hidden agenda. Till the Shiv Sena is there, it will never let this happen. Uddhavji has clearly said that atrocities on the Marathi-speaking people of Belgaum will not be tolerated any further.”Political analyst Hemant Desai said that Sena’s policy has been to take up emotional issues and issues of identity. Another political analyst, Pratap Asbe said that the Sena is now catering to its constituency on the grounds of Marathi pride.Desai said, “Since the beginning, it has been the policy of the Shiv Sena to take up emotional issues and ones involving identity. Mumbai is an emotional issue for the Shiv Sena. By saying that the BJP wants to take Mumbai away, they want to benefit in BMC election. Besides that, they can corner the BJP on the border dispute as it will not be as aggressive as the ruling alliance here [Karnataka has BJP government]. This is pure politics; these issues will be raked up time and again. Like the Kaveri water dispute [between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu], this border dispute will not be resolved.”Asbe echoed Desai’s views and said that the issue will be kept alive for political gains. “The matter is with the Supreme Court. It will make no difference if Uddhav Thackeray speaks or (Karnataka CM) Yediyurappa speaks on it. The CM has taken up the issues for the Shiv Sena to corner Maharashtra’s BJP leaders. While doing so, the Sena is catering to its constituency which is for Marathi pride,” Asbe said.Desai said that though politicians keep these issues alive, such issues may not resonate with younger generation voters. “It has been so many years, I do not think that the new generation would be interested in such issues,” he said.BJP leader of opposition in the legislative Council Pravin Darekar said that the state BJP stands with the people of the Marathi-speaking areas of Karnataka. “I am not the spokesperson of the Karnataka government. Neither have I heard the statement made by a Karnataka minister. However, the BJP leaders in Maharashtra stand with the people of Belgaum,” Darekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrakarnataka-border-row-uddhav-thackeray-turns-aggressive-to-corner-bjp-101611867555551.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders Maharashtra government to compensate Covid-19 victim’s heirs||Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday directed the Maharashtra government to pay compensation of ₹5 lakh to the legal heirs of 82-year-old Malati Nehete, a Covid-19 patient who had gone missing from the Covid ward of the Government Medical College (GMC) and Hospital at Jalgaon on June 2, 2020, and was found dead in one of the five toilets attached to the ward eight days later.The bench of justice SV Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni was irked to note that for about eight days, the patient was missing and nobody had bothered to take it seriously and did nothing except filing a missing report.“It is evident that neither doctors on duty nor staff nurses were monitoring the patient,” said the bench. “Having regard to the above factual scenario, we have no hesitation to hold that it is because of culpable negligence of doctors, staff nurses and para-medical staff on duty, patient Malati Nehate met with her unfortunate death,” said the bench.Pratibha Shinde, president of Lok Sangharsh Morcha, and two other persons had filed a public interest litigation (PIL), highlighting the apathetic approach of doctors and other staff at the GMC at Jalgaon, in treating Covid-19 patients.They contended that apart from lack of adequate doctors and para-medical staff, the authorities at the hospital had turned a blind eye towards the guidelines and protocols issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Their counsel, senior advocate Gayatri Singh, highlighted the case of Malati Nehete, who was shifted to the government medical college from Railway Hospital in Bhusawal on June 1, 2020. Her swabs were taken for Covid-19 testing, however, initially, she was admitted to the non-Covid ward. The 82-year-old, who required support for all her movements, was shifted to Covid ward after her rest report showed her positive for the deadly virus. On June 2, she went “missing” and was found dead in one of the five toilets attached to the Covid ward after eight days.Additional government pleader PS Patil had opposed their prayer for compensation of ₹50 lakh to the kin of the 82-year-old on the grounds that her family members are educated and could avail appropriate legal remedy.As regards other prayers for inquiry and action for negligence and dereliction of duty, Patil pointed out that inquiry was already initiated and an offence was registered with the local police station in connection with the incident.The bench, however, overruled the objection, saying the HC, being the protector of civil liberties of citizens, has not only the power and jurisdiction but also an obligation to grant relief to the victims or heirs of the victim whose fundamental rights are flagrantly infringed and call upon the state to repair the damage, irrespective of individual remedy available to them.HC has also directed the state to take appropriate action against the erring hospital staff, based on the report of a three-member committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-orders-maharashtra-government-to-compensate-covid-19-victim-s-heirs-101611867193638.html
29-01-2021||Bhopal||‘Liberty has to be balanced with duty’: HC denies bail to comedian Faruqui||The Madhya Pradesh high court on Thursday refused to release stand-up comic Munawar Faruqui on bail, holding that he was prima facie (on the first impression) guilty of hurting others’ religious sentiments “under the garb of stand-up comedy” during a public show staged in Indore on January 1.In his 10-page order dismissing Faruqui’s bail plea, justice Rohit Arya also urged the states to strive to ensure that the “ecosystem and sustenance of coexistence in our welfare society is not polluted by negative forces”.The court emphasised that “liberty of an individual has to be balanced with his duties and obligations towards his fellow citizens”, adding that “mutual respect, faith and trust amongst all citizens of India are basic tenets of coexistence, in a welfare society governed by the principles of rule of law”.The court brushed aside Faruqui’s defence that although he was present at the show in Indore, he did not say anything that day.He had also contended that there was no need for him to remain behind bars because the alleged offences of hurting religious sentiments and violating Covid-19 protocol were punishable with a maximum jail term of only three years.Opining on the merit of the case, the high court held: “The evidence/material collected so far suggest that in an organised public show under the garb of standup comedy at a public place on commercial lines, prima facie; scurrilous, disparaging utterances, outraging religious feelings of a class of citizens of India with deliberate intendment, were made by the applicant.”By a common order, the court also dismissed the bail plea of Nalin, a co-accused in the case. Apart from Faruqui and Nalin, three others named as accused in the first information report (FIR) are Edwin Anthony, Prakhar Vyas and Priyam Vyas.Commenting on the high court’s order, senior advocate Vivek Tankha, who represented Faruqui, said: “I am disappointed with the order, to say the least.” About the prospect of filing an appeal before the Supreme Court, Tankha said that a decision would be taken by the parties soon.Faruqui was arrested on January 1 on the complaint of Hindu Rakshak Sangathan convener Eklavya Singh Gaud, who is also a son of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Malini Singh Gaud, in Indore, just before he was about to start his performance at a restaurant. He has been in jail since.The high court, in its order, held that Faruqui’s was not a case of “no evidence”; nor can the stand-up comedian’s complacency be ruled out at this stage, especially when a similar FIR had been registered against him in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh too.Justice Arya also referred to the accusations made by complainant in this case, Gaud, that Faruqui had been cracking “filthy jokes against Hindu Gods, Lord Shri Ram and Goddess Seeta” in the social media for the last 18 months.On this, the judge said that “there is nothing on record to the contrary”, pointing out that Faruqui had not countered Gaud’s allegations about his jokes on Hindu Gods in social media.In the order, the judge cited Article 51A of the Constitution on the Fundamental Duties to emphasise that “every right is coupled with duty” and that the duties and obligations are inherent thereunder. “Intensity of crime and degree of involvement with an element of mens rea (criminal intent) adjudge impact of crime in the society,” said the court, adding that what is punishable under Section 295A (hurting religious beliefs and sentiments) of the Indian Penal Code was the intention and the manner in which statements were made. “Before parting with the case, it is considered apposite to observe that our country is a beautiful country and sets an example of coexistence amid diversities; be it religion, language, culture, geographical locations etc., to the world at large,” justice Arya said in his order. .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/liberty-has-to-be-balanced-with-duty-hc-denies-bail-to-comedian-faruqui-101611865551969.html
29-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic budget 2021-22 may not have any new taxes||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) budget for 2021-22, which will be presented before the standing committee in the first week of February by municipal commissioner IS Chahal, is unlikely to introduce new taxes for Mumbaiites. However, the civic body revises property tax every five years, and a revision is due in 2021 through a special sitting of the standing committee of the civic body, according to the civic official. The hike will not be announced in the budget document 2021, but a few months later. The outlay is likely to be higher than the previous year, according to a senior civic official. At a time when the BMC, the country’s richest civic body, is facing a cash crunch, the budget will prioritise expenditure on key departments such as health, education, and infrastructure-related developments such as roads and coastal road. Funds will be allotted for at least one new infrastructure project that has been on the cards in 2020. A senior civic official said, “Every year, usually there is an 8% to 10% increase in the budget. Our budget will be larger this year as well, and the capital expenditure will also be more. Moreover, important departments such as health, education, and infrastructure projects will not see a cut in the budgetary allocation, or a reduction in the budget outlay in comparison to last year.” The coastal road project is likely to receive substantial amount of funds. Moreover, the BMC’s plan to come up with a desalination plant at Manori in Mumbai that was approved by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in November will also receive a budgetary allocation. “We are not increasing any new taxes this year in the budget. However, during the year, a revision in the property tax is due,” the officer added. The BMC budget 2020-21 was pegged at ₹33,441.02 crore, which was 8.95% more than the previous year’s budget. The budget for 2019-20 was pegged at ₹30,692.59 crore. The senior civic official quoted above said, “The civic body plans to increase its capital expenditure. On the revenue expenditure side, pensions and salaries will not be touched, but the BMC is looking to bring down administration related revenue expenditure.” Another senior civic official from the property tax department said, “There are several components of the property tax. For homes below 500sqft, only general tax has been waived. In 2021, when we look at revision of the property tax, we are not going to increase general tax or factor component. So the increase will be minimal. But the civic body’s kitty is likely to see an increase in revenue by up to 17%.” Anandini Thakoor, trustee, H-West Citizens’ Federation, said, “Among the top priorities should be better civic amenities for citizens, primarily water supply and better roads. There are many more, but these two areas need work on priority. The BMC should beef up their conservancy staff.” The BJP on Thursday alleged that the municipal corporation is heading toward bankruptcy, and has manipulated figures of income. The BJP claimed the BMC has received only 25% of the estimated income in 2020-21. The BJP said while the property tax department earned only ₹734.34 crore instead of the estimated income of ₹6768.58 crore, and the development plan department earned only ₹708.28 crore instead of the estimated ₹3879.51 crore. Yet expenditure on Covid-19 relief work has been ₹2,100 crore so far. While the BMC showed a surplus of ₹6.52 crore in February, this increased to ₹2,579.33 crore in August, which the BJP claimed is manipulation of numbers, alleging the following budget 2021 will also show manipulated figures. A senior civic official said, “All accurate details have been submitted to the standing committee. Moreover our expenditure, for example the Covid-related expenditure, amounts to ₹1,533 crore.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-budget-2021-22-may-not-have-any-new-taxes-101611863413643.html

In total, around 40 cases of minor adverse effects have been reported in HCWs.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “The turnout probably went down due to it being mid-week, but we cannot confirm the fall to any particular reason.”Dr Gomare added, “However, we are anticipating the turnout to go up during the weekend i.e. Friday and Saturday. We are also going to add the NESCO Covid-19 centre, which will act as 12th vaccination centre.”On the first three days of the drive — on January 16, 19,and 20 — Mumbai’s turnout was between 50% and 52%, which increased to 92% on the fourth day (January 22), and 90% on the fifth day (January 23). On the sixth day, Mumbai saw a 77% turnout, followed by 68% on Wednesday, but it went down to 58% on Thursday.In the coming days, the BMC will also add more vaccination centres, including the jumbo Covid-19 facilities at Dahisar, Mulund, and the jumbo facility at Richarson and Cruddas (RC) in Byculla.

The incident took place when Ajay, a Class 10 student studying in a school in Mount Abu, was trying to retrieve his footwear which fell on a scaffolding while playing. He stepped on a plastic sheet, which was there as part of the scaffolding cover to let sunlight in. But it broke owing to his weight and he fell. A cycle parked outside the building broke his fall. Hearing the commotion, society members rushed to the spot. “We first took him to a local hospital but later shifted him to Tungha Hospital in Mira Road where he is undergoing treatment,” said Ajay’s father Laxman, 48.The teenager lives with his family consisting his father, mother and elder brother at Anand Nagar in Vasai (West). Laxman said after the plastic tore, Ajay fell 35 feet. “He fell on a cycle parked in the society premises and hence was saved. He has received injuries to his chin and hand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/15yearold-survives-35-foot-fall-from-terrace-near-mumbai-101611862513102.html
29-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s active Covid-19 cases remain below 1% for 10 days in a row||A significant dip has been witnessed in the infection spread as the Covid-19 active case ratio in Chandigarh has remained below 1% in the last 10 days.Only 232 cases have been reported in the past one week, even though the testing levels have remained largely constant. The fatalities linked to infection have almost been halved as only 17 deaths have been reported in last one month as compared to 39 in December last year. However, the fatality ratio with respect to the total cases remains constant at 1.6%.“It is a significant improvement for us from what we were observing during September when the positivity rate was around 22%. The test positivity rate remaining below 3% from the last three to four weeks is certainly a good news,” UT’s health department director Dr Amandeep Kang said. “People are following appropriate behaviour and they should definitely not lower the guard at this critical juncture,” he added. While a similar trend continues to be witnessed in major parts of the country, experts suggest that to sustain this flattening of the curve, the current situation needs to be dealt with continued urgency like the one shown when cases were at the peak and infection was widespread. “Suggesting that we have reached a stage of herd immunity against this virus will require proper study and scientific process. However, it is a fact that a huge chunk of population has been exposed to the virus and was never detected. The majority of these were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic who did not report to medical facilities. So, they have brief immunity against the virus,” Professor Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday also said that India has flattened its Covid-19 graph as 146 districts recorded no new cases in the last seven days. The small union territories in the country have also shown a similar trend with the recovery rates remaining above 95%. The average seven-day growth of cases has also been below 1%, while the ratio of the active case has been below 1% as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-active-covid-19-cases-remain-below-1-for-10-days-in-a-row-101611862333127.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Nagpur medical college opts for online classes for first-year batch||Days before first-year undergraduate medical and dental batches across state institutes were scheduled to start physical classes, authorities of the Government Medical College (GMC) Nagpur announced their decision to continue online classes for the first-year batch instead of onsite classes in view of increasing Covid-19 cases in Nagpur city.“The present Covid-19 scenario in Nagpur is not very stable as Covid-19 cases are being admitted in government institutions. It is not feasible and safe to conduct onsite theory classes for first-year MBBS [Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery] students, especially after positive cases were revealed in some institutes in the city recently,” stated a letter addressed to the National Medical Commission (NMC) by the management of GMC Nagpur. The management of GMC Nagpur is now planning a combination of online and onsite classes for the first-year batch. Onsite classes are being considered only for practical which is a minor part of the first-year medical course. “Looking at the present scenario, as a precautionary measure, it has been decided to conduct online theory classes and offline small group practical classes for the time being for first-year MBBS batch beginning from February 2, 2021,” stated a circular released by the institute.Earlier this month, in a circular, the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS) clarified that classes for super speciality courses including Doctor of Medicine (DM), Master of General Surgery as well as Diplomate of National Board will begin from January 19. Similarly, first-year MBBS and Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) courses should start their academic session from February 2. The delay in starting the classes was keeping in mind the delay in BDS admissions that will take place till January 31 this year.The scenario in Mumbai, however, remains unchanged for most medical institutes. Varsha Phadke, dean of KJ Somaiya Medical College, said, “Our classes will begin on schedule on February 2 in the offline mode. Proper arrangements have been made to ensure safety of staff and students.” Several institutes in Mumbai and Pune plan to insist on a seven-day compulsory quarantine for their first-year batch before starting classes. “We might have to opt for online classes for the first week of February while our students remain in hostels for the compulsory quarantine. Once that is over, we plan to start physical classes,” said an official from the admissions office of a Pune-based medical institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nagpur-medical-college-opts-for-online-classes-for-first-year-batch-101611861853079.html
29-01-2021||Delhi||Shameful to call me a traitor: On the run, Sidhu releases video||Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who was seen at Red Fort during a violent farmers’ protest, is likely to figure prominently in the list of people the Delhi Police will probe in connection with the mayhem on Republic Day, according to officials aware of the matter.“He will be probed in two cases by two different units. The crime branch will probe him for the violence at Red Fort. The special cell will probe him for the alleged conspiracy and plans to embarrass the government and the country at an international platform for doing what he did on Tuesday,” one of the officials said.The officials said they were yet to approach Sidhu, who allegedly led the mob that laid siege to the historic Red Fort, resorted to vandalism, and fought a pitched battle with the police after the protest by farmers against three agricultural laws plunged into chaos.A video purportedly showing Sidhu at Red Fort has been circulating on social media.The officials privy to the investigation said Sidhu may not be in Delhi and could have already fled to Punjab or Haryana. Officials posted at the borders have informed the police’s top brass that Sidhu, who was in Singhu (on the Haryana border) on January 26 morning, has not been spotted since that night.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella group that is organising the ongoing farmers’ protest, at Singhu and Tikri borders, blames Sidhu for the violence and for insulting the national flag at Red Fort.The SKM is holding meetings with the government on the farm laws that they want scrapped, and agreed to follow certain routes specified by the Delhi Police during their rally on Republic Day. Trouble began after some protesters deviated from the routes agreed upon.On Thursday, Sidhu denied the charges through a Facebook post. “...We all were peaceful and were exercising our democratic rights to protest peacefully, we were under the leadership of our farmer union leaders. We did not damage property... everything was peaceful nobody disrespected our national flag.

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon: What are your apprehensions if Varavara Rao is granted bail, HC asks NIA||Stressing on the need of striking a balance between fundamental rights of a prisoner to have a healthy life and the facilities available for treating ailing prisoners in jails, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday has sought to know from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on their apprehensions in the event 82-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao is released on bail on medical grounds.The court’s query was based on the fact that while Rao was deemed fit to be discharged from Nanavati Hospital, his family has opposed the proposal of the NIA and state to shift him to Sir JJ Hospital to monitor his condition, stating that there was every chance of him suffering a relapse and having to be shifted back to the private hospital, hence he should be either shifted to Taloja jail or allowed to go home to Hyderabad.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale was hearing a petition filed by Rao’s wife seeking bail for him on medical grounds when the court was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh that the state had made arrangements to take care of prisoners above the age of 60 years lodged in various jails across the state.While referring to Rao’s latest medical report by Nanavati Hospital, Singh said the report reiterated that Rao’s condition was stable moving him to Sir JJ Hospital was only aimed at ensuring that he was provided with the medical regimen prescribed by Nanavati doctors and his condition was monitored.However, justice Pitale sought to know from Singh as to what was the apprehension of the agency if Rao was allowed to go home on bail on medical grounds and his advanced age, Singh said that accusations against Rao were serious and as there were orders of other courts wherein an under-trial who was 85-year-old and had multiple health problems was denied bail on the medical ground due to the serious charges against him, Rao who is booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, he should also not be given bail. When justice Pitale suggested that Rao could be enlarged on bail with stringent conditions, Singh sought to know whether the court was doubting the capabilities of the doctors at JJ Hospital. Justice Shinde then said, “We have to strike a balance after the concerns of the accused’s family as well that of the state and agency is taken into consideration. While the family says that the prisoner has a fundamental right to a healthy life and the state and agency are bound to provide the same, the state and agency say they are willing to provide it, but then again there is the fact that Rao had to be shifted from JJ Hospital to Nanavati Hospital. This is a dialogue but we are expected to go beyond the existing procedure in light of the age of the accused and his medical condition.”Singh then said that it would be appropriate that the court impose conditions on the state and the agency to ensure that Rao’s condition was properly monitored and all medical help was extended to him in case of any medical emergency. The court has now posted the hearing on February 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-what-are-your-apprehensions-if-varavara-rao-is-granted-bail-hc-asks-nia-101611861612963.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 impact: Jobs of 66% affected, 28% got pay cut, finds survey||A recent survey found that the jobs of around 66% of the respondents were severely impacted due to lockdown owing to Covid-19. Around 17% said they lost jobs, 28% said they their salary was reduced and 25% said they worked during lockdown without any pay. The survey was conducted jointly by NGO Praja Foundation and Hansa Research in December 2020. The results of the survey stated that 47% of the respondents said they had to rely on their savings during the lockdown for daily expenses. It also revealed that despite being under metal distress, 84% respondents did not speak to anyone.According to NGO Praja Foundation, a total of 2,087 households were interviewed for the survey, which includes 791 households which were interviewed for livelihood, housing and transport related issued, 527 samples for education, and 769 for health-related issues. The aim of the survey was to understand the impact of the pandemic on key sectors in Mumbai.While some said they had to leave their jobs, or worked with reduced salaries, many also said that they had to work extra hours or were overburdened. It also revealed that 71% of the respondents were not able to save money during lockdown. In addition, 44% unskilled workers said they lost their jobs in the lockdown.Milind Mhaske, director of Praja Foundation, said, “Livelihood and employment across sectors have been the worst hit. Two of every three respondents said their livelihood was adversely impacted, of which 36% had leave-without-pay, 28% worked with reduced salary, 25% worked without salary and 13% had extra working hours or were otherwise overburdened.”The survey also covered the aspect of migration due to lockdown. Around 23% respondents said they have to leave Mumbai during lockdown citing reasons such as losing jobs and not being able to afford rent among others. “The survey also highlighted some lifestyle changes and preferences which can be adopted for future planning of the city. Of those working from home, 63% said they would like to continue to work from home (70% female, 59% male) in the future. In terms of travel to work, preference for walking and buses has increased as compared to what it was before the pandemic,” added Mhaske.For those working from office, the demand for travelling via bus increased marginally, resulting in a fall of demand for trains. Of the total respondents, 2% had Covid-19, of which 77% were admitted to a hospital. Of them, 39% respondents received free treatment for Covid-19. Of the 61% who spent money on Covid-19 treatment, the majority (50%) spent less than ₹10,000, revealed the survey.Further, 48% respondents said they managed the treatment cost with help from family/relatives/friends, 27% sourced it from their regular income, while 23% sourced it from insurance. On the mental health end, the survey reveals that in spite of the majority respondents facing stress, 84% did not speak to anyone about their mental state.The survey also spoke with parents on how they and their children managed education during the lockdown. It found that 97% students attended school through online classes, 62% parent respondents favoured offline education, 63% said online classes made children physically inactive in spite of schools having extra-curricular activities, while 43% said their child faced eyesight problems. Around 65% respondents also said that their children were irritable due to online classes.Meanwhile, in case of more than one child needing a device for education wherein there is only one device available, 6% said they gave priority to their male child’s education in case of a clash in lecture timings, followed by 19% who said parents or children decide internally who will attend the class at that time. The remaining 75% said lecture timings did not clash, which reflects that schools managed online classes considering these needs.Concluding the survey, Nitai Mehta, founder of NGO Praja Foundation, said, “The survey has highlighted the urgency for better policy-making and planning for future. The focus, in the immediate term, needs to be on creating avenues and securing livelihoods of the lowest socio-economic sections of the city as they were most affected by the pandemic. For the future, this experience provides cues for better planning of the city and strengthening of public infrastructure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-impact-jobs-of-66-affected-28-got-pay-cut-finds-survey-101611861433086.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses to quash FIR in matrimonial discord citing serious allegations||The Bombay high court (HC), while rejecting a petition seeking quashing of a first information report (FIR) filed by a woman against her husband, brother-in-law and mother-in-law, has held that when serious allegations are levelled against the accused in a matrimonial dispute, the court cannot exercise its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The woman had complained the three after they ill-treated her as she failed to comply with their demand for dowry.The complaint states that the husband indulged in forced unnatural sex with her and she was told that her husband’s behaviour would change for the better only if she complied with their dowry demand.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the petition of the 33-year-old husband, his 29-year-old brother and 60-year-old mother was informed that they sought quashing of the FIR filed against them at the Vile Parle police station on November 29, 2019. The three had been booked for offences punishable under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. According to the complaint lodged by the woman, she had met her husband through a matrimonial website in 2016. Both the families agreed and the two were engaged. The man established forcible physical relations with the woman and then left for his service on a cruise. After returning, the two were married in April 2017. The complaint states that after marriage the three accused started ill-treating her and demanded that she arrange for dowry from her parents. The husband forcibly indulged in unnatural sex to force her to comply with their demand for dowry. The woman also made some other serious allegations against the husband. Advocate Aniket Vagal for the petitioners submitted that it was a fit case for the court to exercise its power under Article 226 of the Constitution to quash the FIR. However, advocate Jayshree Tripathi for the woman drew the attention of the court to the seriousness of the allegations made by the woman against the three more-so the husband and suggested that the court should not quash the FIR. After hearing the submissions the court observed, “Having perused the material on record, considering the seriousness of the allegations levelled against the petitioners and the fact that prima facie the ingredients of the said offences can be found in the said complaint lodged by respondent no.2 (woman), we are of the opinion that the petitioners have failed to make out a case for exercise of jurisdiction of this court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and inherent powers under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” Thus, the court dismissed the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-quash-fir-in-matrimonial-discord-citing-serious-allegations-101611860952206.html

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Quality of treatment suffers at civic-run tertiary hospitals as doctors continue to be deputed to Covid-19 centres||While there has been a gradual fall in the number of Covid-19 patients at civic-run tertiary hospitals, the footfall of non-Covid patients has increased by almost 80%. However, a large number of resident doctors continue to be stationed at Covid-19 jumbo centres and Seven Hills Hospital, where almost 90% of the beds are vacant. Medical students say this is leading to a severe shortage of doctors at major civic-run hospitals and affecting the quality of treatment. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, hundreds of resident doctors King Edward Memorial (KEM), BYL Nair, Dr RN Cooper and Lokmanya Tilak General hospitals were deputed at Covid-19 jumbo centres and Seven Hills Hospital. During the early months of the pandemic, the footfall of non-Covid-19 patients had reduced to almost 10%. Consequently, the distribution of manpower didn’t pose any problems. However, 10 months down the line and with the state announcing measures to gradually lessen restrictions on public movement, major hospitals have started receiving a large number of non-Covid patients. As a result, resident doctors are working extra-long hours, leading to exhaustion. “With relaxation in the lockdown, we are getting many serious patients who couldn’t reach hospitals earlier. They need more attention. But due to shortage of staff, we aren’t able to provide timely treatment,” said Dr Arun Ghule, president of KEM Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). Parel-based KEM Hospital, the biggest civic-run hospital, presently gets around 4,000 patients in its out-patient department (OPD) daily. Under instructions of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the hospital has stationed almost 50 of its resident doctors at Nesco Covid Jumbo centre, in Goregaon, and Seven Hills Hospital, in Marol. Similarly, Sion Hospital, which received around 1,500 OPD patients daily before March, has stationed almost 100 of its resident doctors at various jumbo centres. Resident doctors said they are no longer required at the Covid-19 centres since the number of patients has come down significantly in recent months. They also said their medical practice and education is being affected. “Now, the number of patients to outside hospitals has reduced to a locally-manageable level, and the workload at KEM Hospital has increased to more than the pre-pandemic situation. Due to this, we aren’t able to perform our basic educational activities which is the main purpose of our PG course,” reads the letter sent by MARD KEM on Thursday to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). Sion Hospital has also approached its management to address the same issue. “There has been an almost 80% rise in the footfall of non-Covid patients. We are working 14-24 hours daily for their treatment. Earlier, if we could attend to a patient within an hour, it now takes us almost two hours due to the manpower crunch,” said a member of MARD, Sion Hospital. When asked about the students stationed at Covid-19 centres, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “All the students are made to work for around 15-30 days. Also, they should also gain experience of treating Covid-19 patients. It will help them to gain first-hand experience as a doctor.” The civic-run tertiary hospitals are likely to face a further shortfall of doctors as many final years postgraduate students will go on study leave from February. “We really hope that the hospitals solve this issue before we go on our study leaves as our final exam is scheduled in May,” said another doctor from Nair Hospital which has stationed 10 doctors at Seven Hills Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/quality-of-treatment-suffers-at-civic-run-tertiary-hospitals-as-doctors-continue-to-be-deputed-to-covid-19-centres-101611860593059.html

However, a revision of property tax in 2021, done every five years, is likely, according to civic officials.The hike in property tax will not be announced in the budget document 2021, but in the months following the beginning of financial year 2021-22.Budget 2021 outlay is likely to be larger than the previous year, according to a senior civic official.At a time when the BMC, the country's richest civic body, is facing a cash crunch, its budget 2021 will prioritise expenditure in key areas such as health, education, and infrastructure-related developments such as roads. Funds will be allotted for at least one new infrastructure project."Every year, usually there is an 8% to 10% increase in the budget. Our budget will be larger this year as well, than last year, and the capital expenditure will also be more. Moreover, the important departments such as health, education, and infrastructure will not see a cut in the budgetary allocation or a reduction in the budget outlay in comparison to last year," said a senior civic officer.The Mumbai coastal road project is likely to receive a substantial amount of funds."We are not introducing new taxes this year in the budget. However, during the year, a revision in the property tax is due," the officer added.The BMC budget 2020 was pegged at ₹33,441.02 crores, which was 8.95% more than the previous year's budget. The budget 2019 was pegged at ₹30,692.59 crores.The senior civic officer quoted above said, "The civic body is planning to increase its capital expenditure in the budget 2021. On the revenue expenditure side, the pensions and salaries will of course not be touched, but BMC is looking to bring down administration-related revenue expenditure.Also Read: Mumbai: 1st rake for Metro-2A arrives; CM to unveil it on FridayAnother senior civic official of the property tax department said, "There are several components of the property tax. For homes below 500 sq feet, only general tax has been waived off. This year in 2021, when we will look at a revision of the property tax, we are not going to increase the general tax or the factor component. So the increase that citizens will feel is very minimal. But the civic body's kitty is likely to see an increase in revenue by up to 17%."Everyone owning a property in Mumbai has to pay property tax to the civic body.For those who own a flat in a building, the property tax is mostly collected by housing society as part of the monthly or annual maintenance charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-budget-2021-new-taxes-unlikely-but-property-tax-to-be-revised-later-101611818710723.html

China will pick up another 2 million tons in this round of purchases, taking it over the WTO quota, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.China is scooping up American crops to feed a hog herd that’s recovering from a deadly pig disease faster than most traders expected. Earlier this week, the boss of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., one of the world’s largest agricultural commodity traders, said the Asian nation will import 25 million tons of corn from all countries. Ukraine is another big supplier of corn to China.“We think that the inventories, reserves are much lower than what the market is reporting there,” CEO Juan Luciano said, commenting on Chinese stockpiles. “They are trying to rebuild their herd, but also by the professionalization of the feeding that has included much more of all these grains in the ration, so we think that we will continue to see multi-year increases in China’s appetite for all these commodities.”The US was already scheduled to ship another 5.9 million tons of corn to China this season before the 6 million-ton purchase this week, USDA data showed. That’s higher than the WTO quota of 7.2 million tons for a calendar year.China imported 11.3 million tons of corn last year, exceeding the WTO level for the first time, customs data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-exceed-wto-quota-in-biggest-us-corn-buying-spree-101611938360976.html

Al Arabiya reported Macron's comments in Arabic.The Islamic Republic began breaching the deal's limits on uranium enrichment activity in response to a U.S. withdrawal from the pact in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, who then reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Tehran.The new administration of US President Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin the deal but only after Tehran resumes full compliance with its terms.On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran would not reverse an acceleration of its nuclear programme before Washington lifts sanctions.Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates have said that Gulf Arab states should be involved in any talks this time which they say should also address Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for proxies around the Middle East.Macron stressed the need to avoid what he called the mistake of excluding other countries in the region when the 2015 deal was negotiated, according to Al Arabiya.Saudi Arabia, which is locked in several proxy wars in the region with Tehran including in Yemen, supported Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frances-macron-says-any-new-nuclear-talks-with-iran-to-be-strict-101611938388530.html
29-01-2021||World||South Korea rebukes opposition over report on nuclear plant in North Korea||South Korea's presidential office on Friday issued a rebuke to an opposition leader who accused it of "abetting the enemy" after a news report that Seoul had planned to build a nuclear plant in North Korea.Local broadcaster SBS unveiled a prosecution indictment listing more than a dozen documents from the energy ministry that suggested a previously unknown project to set up a nuclear plant in North Korea.The documents were among 530 files that prosecutors say the ministry had illegally deleted to conceal that it had distorted feasibility studies to shut down a reactor in South Korea, the report said.Kim Chong-in, leader of the main opposition People Power Party, called the potential plan a "shocking and appalling act that abets the enemy".President Moon Jae-in's spokesman, Kang Min-seok, accused Kim of making "irresponsible" remarks to stoke ideological strife and "deceive people" ahead of a key by-election in April.But he declined to comment when asked about whether such plans had existed, or whether Moon's office had ordered the energy ministry to delete the documents."Kim should take responsibility for his comment," Kang told a briefing, adding the office would pursue legal action.Prosecutors last month indicted three energy ministry officials on charges of violating the Criminal Act by damaging public records following a state auditor investigation.The government had decided in 2018 to decommission the South Korean reactor, the Wolsong No.1, earlier than scheduled citing the ministry feasibility studies, in line with liberal President Moon's pledge to phase out nuclear power, which the conservative opposition opposed.Some of the files were titled "A plan to build a nuclear plant in North Korea" and "Tasks for phased cooperation to establish electricity infrastructure in North Korea", according to the SBS report.Others included lists of energy experts with experience in inter-Korean economic projects, as well as officials who were dispatched to a failed international consortium aimed at building two reactors in the reclusive North in the early 2000s.At least six documents were dated to May 2018, a month after Moon held his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, SBS said.Reuters could not verify the list and the individual documents.The prosecutors' office was not reachable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-rebukes-opposition-over-report-on-nuclear-plant-in-north-korea-101611923884433.html
29-01-2021||World||Not bound by treaty on prohibition of nuclear weapons: Pakistan||Pakistan on Friday said it was not bound by the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons as it failed to take into account the interests of all stakeholders.The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons entered into force on January 22, culminating a decades-long campaign aimed at preventing a repetition of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.Though hailed as a historic step by several nations, the treaty was opposed by the world's nuclear-armed countries, including the US, China, Russia, the UK and India. Japan also didn't support the pact.The treaty, which was adopted in July 2017, was "negotiated outside the established UN disarmament negotiating forums," Pakistan's Foreign Office said in a statement.“Accordingly, Pakistan does not consider itself bound by any of the obligations enshrined in this treaty. Pakistan stresses that this treaty neither forms a part of, nor contributes to the development of customary international law in any manner,” it said.The statement noted that none of the nuclear armed states, including Pakistan, took part in the negotiations of the treaty which "failed to take on board the legitimate interests of all the stakeholders" and many non-nuclear armed states have also refrained from becoming parties to the agreement.The foreign ministry underlined that the UN General Assembly at its first special session devoted to nuclear disarmament in 1978 had agreed by consensus that in the adoption of disarmament measures, the right of each state to security should be kept in mind.It also agreed that at each stage of the disarmament process the objective would be undiminished security for all states at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces, the ministry said.This objective, it said, can only be achieved as a cooperative and universally agreed undertaking, through a consensus-based process involving all the relevant stakeholders, which results in equal and undiminished security for all states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-bound-by-treaty-on-prohibition-of-nuclear-weapons-pakistan-101611939606980.html
29-01-2021||World||Italy opposition right calls for elections to solve political crisis||Italy's rightist opposition parties called for early elections on Friday as the way to solve the country's political crisis, following the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.Conte, now acting as caretaker, was unseated when former premier Matteo Renzi withdrew his Italia Viva party from the coalition, depriving it of a parliamentary majority and throwing Italy into political limbo during the coronavirus crisis."We confirmed to the president our request that he consider the option of dissolving parliament and calling elections," League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters after formal consultations with the head of state Sergio Mattarella.Mattarella will complete three days of consultations with parties later on Friday, with Italians waiting to hear what kind of solution he may have found.Conte, still backed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party, is hoping to get a fresh mandate, but the prospect is far from certain unless he patches up his rupture with Renzi.Conte's attempts to lure unaligned and opposition senators to the government's ranks to restore his majority have so far had little apparent success.Salvini, representing a right-wing alliance of parties, hinted at a risk of a future split in the bloc, saying if Mattarella should try to install a government without elections each party would take its own decision on how to respond.Mattarella could ask a new candidate with more parliamentary backing than Conte to try to form a government or meet Salvini's request for snap elections two years ahead of schedule. Most analysts believe he will only do this as a last resort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-opposition-right-calls-for-elections-to-solve-political-crisis-101611938255382.html

Lin Wood, a lawyer who played a key role in Donald Trump's attempts to overturn his election defeat, to undergo a mental health evaluation.Wood said on the app Telegram on Thursday that the State Bar of Georgia had told him he needed to submit to the evaluation to keep his law license."My mind is sound. I have broken no rules. I asked what I had done wrong. I was only told it was about my social media comments. My speech," he wrote.Wood did not immediately respond to a request for comment.State Bar of Georgia chief operating officer Sarah Coole confirmed that Wood had been asked to undergo a mental health evaluation but declined to comment further.The development comes weeks after Wood, an Atlanta-based defamation litigator, was banned from Twitter, where he regularly embraced conspiracy theories.A Delaware state judge earlier this month blocked Wood from representing former Trump adviser Carter Page, calling claims Wood made on Twitter about US Chief Justice John Roberts "too disgusting and outrageous to repeat."Wood was also fired in January by a Kentucky teenager who sued media outlets over their portrayal of his viral stand-off with a Native American activist in Washington in 2019.It is unusual but legal for a state bar to ask a lawyer to submit to such an evaluation, said Brian Faughnan, a lawyer in Tennessee who advises lawyers on ethics matters. Such requests are kept confidential, but in this case Wood "waived" that right to confidentiality by posting on social media, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protrump-lawyer-lin-wood-asked-to-undergo-mental-health-evaluation-101611938528407.html

Sharma Oli, demanding he explain why he mocked lawyers challenging his decision to dissolve parliament and call early polls.The contempt of court suits are the latest challenges for the beleaguered leader after being expelled from his party earlier this week.The Supreme Court has ordered Oli to "present his written replies within seven days," Devendra Dhakal, a Supreme Court official told Reuters.The Supreme Court judges are dealing with more than a dozen petitions against Oli's surprise move in December last year to dissolve the parliament and call fresh elections a year ahead of schedule, a move that has triggered nation wide protests amid the coronavirus pandemic and plunged the young Himalayan republic into a political crisis.Despite protests, Oli at a public function last week, questioned the involvement of a 94-year-old lawyer Krishna Prasad Bhandari in petitions filed against his political decision.Bhandari had earlier stated before the court that the leader (Oli) had no prerogative to dissolve the parliament and had acted unconstitutionally.This week two lawyers filed contempt cases against Oli for making statements which they deemed were "a direct insult" to the legal fraternity.Oli's lawyer Ramesh Badal said the leader was yet to get a communication from the court."Once the formal letter comes he (Oli) will reply accordingly," Badal told Reuters.Oli has justified the dissolution saying the ruling Nepal Communist Party had not cooperated with the government in policy decisions, while his opponents say he had ignored the party decision and abruptly dissolved the parliament instead of sorting out differences with party colleagues.The court is expected to give its verdict in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-top-court-serves-contempt-notices-to-beleaguered-pm-oli-101611910363121.html
29-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s trade deal with China is ‘under review,’ White House says||The Biden administration has former President Donald Trump’s so-called phase-one trade deal with China “under review” along with the rest of the US posture toward Beijing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Friday.“Everything that the past administration has put in place is under review,” Psaki said in response to questions about whether President Joe Biden considers Trump’s agreement to still be in effect.The trade deal Trump signed a year ago was one of his proudest accomplishments until the novel coronavirus spread from China to the US. After that, then-presidential candidate Biden was able to cast the agreement as a sign Trump was too focused on his own political achievements, even as the world was on the brink of a deadly pandemic.Under the deal, Beijing agreed to escalate purchases of American agricultural goods and other products in exchange for relief from US tariffs. Psaki didn’t answer a question about whether the US still expects China to meet its commitments under the agreement.“We are focused on approaching that relationship from a position of strength and that means coordinating and communicating with our allies and partners about how we are going to work with China,” she said. “It means strengthening our economy at home and it means determining the best path forward to address a range of issues, not just economic, but strategic and also security.”Asked again whether the deal was still in effect, she added: “I would not assume that things are moving forward.” The administration is “coordinating with our allies, members of Congress, and making a determination before we engage further.”Biden isn’t known to have spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping since assuming office earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-trade-deal-with-china-is-under-review-white-house-says-101611936873606.html

Armed and ready to deploy" and "It's time to unleash some violence."Florea had been previously convicted on a New York state weapons possession charge, prosecutors said. He was arrested on January 12 and detained without bail.The Proud Boys are a far-right group that has supported violence and had endorsed former US President Donald Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-boys-supporter-who-had-ammunition-cache-made-threats-pleads-not-guilty-101611935688159.html
29-01-2021||World||Hungary becomes first EU nation to buy Chinese Covid-19 shot||Hungary reached an agreement to buy 5 million doses of coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinopharm, becoming the first European Union member to approve and buy the shot.The country will receive the doses that are enough to inoculate 2.5 million people in four monthly installments, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Facebook Friday, without saying when the first deliveries would be made.The approval followed a government decree that gives an automatic green light for vaccines already used on at least 1 million people abroad, Chief Medical Officer Cecilia Muller said at a briefing earlier in the day.Hungary signed a similar deal for 2 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V last week that was also a first for the bloc. It has also registered a shot made by AstraZeneca Plc earlier than the EU regulator.Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been looking to alternative vaccine sources to speed up efforts to tame the coronavirus pandemic amid delays in EU-mandated deliveries, of which Hungary is also a beneficiary.Hungary is set to use all the Pfizer Inc. shots it has received via the EU by the end of this week after having inoculated 175,283 as of Thursday. Hungary will receive some additional Moderna vaccines on Sunday and a new tranche of Pfizer shots early next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-becomes-first-eu-nation-to-buy-chinese-covid-19-shot-101611935171087.html
29-01-2021||World||EU approves AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine for all adults amid shortfall||Regulators authorized AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine for use in adults throughout the European Union on Friday, amid criticism the bloc is not moving fast enough to vaccinate its population.The European Medicines Agency's expert committee unanimously recommended the vaccine to be used in people 18 and over, though concerns had been raised this week that not enough data exist to prove it works in older people, and some countries indicated they may not give it to the elderly.The shot is the third COVID-19 vaccine given the green light by the European Medicines Agency after ones by Pfizer and Moderna. The EMA's decision requires final approval from the European Commission, a process that occurred swiftly with the other vaccines.With trials showing about 60% efficacy, the vaccine appears to offer less protection than ones already authorized, but experts have said any vaccine with an efficacy rate of over 50% could help stop outbreaks.The agency recommended the vaccine's use in older people, despite limited data regarding its efficacy in people over 55, citing the immune responses seen and experience with other vaccines.“At least some protection is expected,” Bruno Sepodes, of the EMA’s expert committee, said Friday at a news briefing. He acknowledged that "the exact level of protection cannot be estimated for the time being.”Many countries on the continent have been struggling to vaccinate people as quickly as Britain, Israel, the U.S. and elsewhere, and it was long hoped that the AstraZeneca shot would help speed things up at a time when countries face surging cases in a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 400,000 people in the 27-nation bloc.The EU bet heavily on the shot, which is cheaper and easier to handle than some other vaccines, with orders for 300 million doses to be delivered after authorization and options for another 100 million doses.“None of them is a magic wand on its own, but together they provide tools and options to prevent different aspects of the disease,” said Emer Cooke, the head of the EMA.The AstraZeneca vaccine has been authorized for use in all adults in other countries, even though only 12% of the participants in its research were over 55 and they were enrolled later, so there hasn’t been enough time to get results.EMA’s decision authorizes AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be used across the bloc, but individual countries can still decide how and to whom they will give the doses they receive.Lithuania, for instance, will not use the vaccine in older people, the country’s deputy Health Minister Zivile Simonaityte said, according to the Baltic News Service. It was not clear, however, what age groups would be given the shot, but Simonaityte noted that trials in people 55 and over were not “comprehensive.”Germany has indicated it could follow a similar path. The country's independent vaccine advisory committee recommended Friday that the shot only be given to people under 65. The committee, known by its German acronym STIKO, said that “there currently isn’t sufficient data to assess the vaccine effectiveness from the age of 65.” The final decision rests with the government, but they are likely to follow this advice.Cooke, EMA’s executive director, declined to say whether the regulator saw a problem with such an approach.Julian Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester, said he thought any recommendation to limit the vaccine’s use to people under 65 would be understandable but “overly cautious.”The authorization Friday is “the best decision in the current situation, where the EU is in desperate need of a useable vaccine.”The agency assessed four trials in the U.K., Brazil and South Africa and said the research showed the vaccine proved to be about 60% effective by reducing the number of people who got sick. The trials have not yet shown whether the vaccine can stop disease transmission.A separate study testing the AstraZeneca vaccine in the U.S. is still underway.Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group that developed the shot together with AstraZeneca, welcomed the decision.“The recommendation by the European Medicines Agency is an important milestone in extending access to the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine in our region and providing further endorsement that, after the rigorous scrutiny of regulators, the vaccine can be used to help protect populations from the coronavirus pandemic,” he said in a statement.As the EU has struggled to roll out the vaccine, politicians have blamed supply problems, but other factors, like onerous paperwork and poor planning, have also played a role. The EU has particularly lashed out at AstraZeneca after the drugmaker said it would initially supply less vaccine than originally anticipated. Exacerbating concerns about supplies to the bloc, which is home to some 450 million people, Moderna told countries including Italy and Denmark the company would be delivering fewer vaccines than originally expected.Spahn, the German health minister, said Friday he understood many were waiting impatiently for the vaccine, but cautioned that “several hard weeks of vaccine shortage still lie before us.”Two more vaccine makers also recently announced results, with Novavax saying this week that its shot appears 89% effective based on early findings and Johnson & Johnson saying its long-awaited single-shot vaccine was 66% effective at preventing moderate to severe illness. If those vaccines are eventually licensed, that could help alleviate the pressure on the world's huge demand for the limited shots currently available.The authorization of the AstraZeneca vaccine comes amid a bitter dispute between the drugmaker and the bloc after the company said it would sharply reduce initial deliveries from 80 million doses to 31 million. Amid fears doses from AstraZeneca could be diverted outside the bloc, EU officials are expected to propose measures Friday that could be used to block vaccine shipments to non-EU countries.The AstraZeneca vaccine has already been authorized in more than 40 countries, including Britain, India, Argentina and Mexico. The World Health Organization is also reviewing it; a recommendation from the U.N. health agency would allow its purchase and distribution to developing countries from a global program known as COVAX.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-approves-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-for-all-adults-amid-shortfall-101611933749178.html

In September, Facebook as well as YouTube and Twitter signed a deal with big advertisers to curb harmful content online.Facebook said in a blog post on Friday the controls would help advertisers define how their ads show on Facebook News Feed, adding that it would start testing out the controls with a small group of advertisers, a process which could take about a year to complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-develop-tools-for-advertisers-to-tackle-harmful-content-101611928927604.html
29-01-2021||World||'Just shocked': A town reckons with charges in Capitol riot||In this don't blink-or-you'll-miss-it, one-stoplight town, dozens of residents still fly “Trump 2020” and “Make America Great Again” flags.But it's a now-shuttered bar that brought the FBI and other investigators to Woodstock, Ohio, around 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Columbus, this month. Bedsheets and drapes cover the windows of The Jolly Roger Bar and Grill, except for a sliver where an “OPEN” sign flickers in red, white and blue.It is here, federal authorities allege, that Army veteran Jessica Watkins tended bar and recruited members for a local militia group she has said in social media posts that she founded in 2019 and affiliated it with the Oath Keepers — an extremist, militaristic group believed to have thousands of members nationally.In a criminal complaint filed Jan. 19 and a federal indictment Wednesday, Watkins and a member of her militia, ex-Marine Donovan Ray Crowl, are charged, along with a Virginia man, with helping to plan and coordinate the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol.While many of the initial images from the Capitol assault included colorful characters such as the horns-wearing self-proclaimed “QAnon Shaman,'' other, more disturbing images emerged, showing military-like formations of rioters dressed in olive drab, wearing helmets, goggles and items ready for an assault.“We have a good group,” federal authorities say Watkins transmitted that day. “We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan.”A couple blocks from the Jolly Roger, congregants at the Free Will Baptist Church have been trying to wrap their heads around it, said Keith Pack, a church deacon.“Just shocked that it would be in the small town of Woodstock,” said Pack, who lives near the town of fewer than 300 people.Freddy Cruz, a Southern Poverty Law Center research analyst, agreed “it's shocking” that people from a place such as Woodstock would emerge into the spotlight through a bold insurrection that claimed five lives while hoping to overturn Republican Donald Trump's election loss.While shocking, Cruz added, it shouldn't have been.“It’s quite concerning. I think the general media and the federal institutions have dropped the ball in taking these groups seriously,” Cruz said. He said many anti-government groups have been very active for years, carrying out military-like training for a second Civil War in apocalyptic fantasies fueled by conspiracy narratives that Trump did little to discourage.In November, Watkins sent a text message to several people interested in joining her local militia group, encouraging them to participate in “a week-long basic Basic Training class,” in early January, according to court records. The classes were to be held an hour north of Columbus, Watkins said, presumably in Woodstock, or a nearby town.“I need you fighting fit by innaugeration,” the 38-year-old told another interested member. “It's a military style basic, here in Ohio, with a Marine Drill Sergeant running it.”In the indictment Wednesday that includes charges of conspiracy and obstructing Congress that carry up to 20 years in prison with conviction, federal authorities cite social media comments and photos allegedly from Watkins that crowed about the “Historical Events we created today.”Another voice is heard exhorting her: “Get it, Jess ... everything we (expletive) trained for.”Records show Watkins served honorably in the Army under a different name, including duty in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2003. Court records in Rochester, New York, showed she changed her name to Jessica Marie Watkins in 2004. She also lived in Fayetteville, North Carolina, serving as a first responder with emergency medical training, before settling in Woodstock about three years ago.She and her boyfriend Montana Siniff owned the two-story building where they lived and started the Jolly Roger. A Facebook page for the Jerry Morgan & Certified Outlaw Band indicates they played the Jolly Roger in 2019. The Jolly Roger's own Facebook page has been suspended.Phil Garland, president of Woodstock’s village council and a resident for some 20 years, was blindsided by the news.“It’s a small town, but if you weren’t necessarily born and raised there, there is a lot going on and you’re not going to know about it,” Garland said.The Champaign County village, settled by New Englanders in the early 19th century and named after Woodstock, Vermont, used to be dominated by mostly retired, lifelong residents. But around 10 years ago, things began to change as elders died off and younger people moved in for affordability and convenience to Columbus and Dayton. Census figures show it's nearly 98% white, and a solidly conservative town where putting out a lawn sign for a Democratic candidate could result in it being stolen or destroyed.But Garland said the village is friendly “for the most part.”Pack, the church deacon, said there is a lot of speculation about Watkins and Crowl, but to him, it's mainly rumors and he didn't want repeat rumors.Watkins' boyfriend didn't return a call for comment this week.Her militia group is believed to be small. At least three members peacefully protested the presidential election outside Ohio's Statehouse in November.“While we were made aware of this group, we are unaware of any criminal allegations or investigations regarding their activity while at the Ohio Statehouse,” said Kristen Castle, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Public Safety. She said she couldn't comment about any ongoing investigation or intelligence gathering.Rick Campbell, who served in the Vietnam War, has had a hard time processing what took place some 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from their Marysville, Ohio, Veterans of Foreign Wars post.“This isn’t patriotism, what they did,” Campbell, 73, said. “Those radicals don’t represent what I represented in the military.”The FBI said a search of Watkins’ home found personal protection equipment and communication devices, homemade weapons and instructions for making plastic explosives.US Magistrate Sharon Ovington in Dayton denied bail for Crowl, 50, citing information that he wanted to go to a home with nine firearms and said she didn’t see a way to ensure public safety with him at large. Crowl’s court-appointed attorney didn’t respond to two messages for comment.Both remain jailed in Dayton. No attorney for Watkins was listed in court filings.The Dayton Daily News reported that when asked in her initial court appearance whether she understood the charges against her, Watkins replied: “I understand them but I don’t understand how I got them.”Just five days before the Capitol riot, Watkins posted on social media photos of herself in the Jolly Roger, complaining it was empty on a Saturday and, referring to Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s anti-pandemic restrictions on bars, said “Thanks for nothing DeWine.”She added: “Guess I am going to pack for DC. See you there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-shocked-a-town-reckons-with-charges-in-capitol-riot-101611930021168.html
29-01-2021||World||Prosecutors weigh pro-Trump mob’s ideology in sedition probe||Prosecutors probing the January 6 riot at the US Capitol are building complex conspiracy cases that take aim at far-right activists, zeroing in on the motives and ideologies of the extremist groups that participated in the siege.After arresting more than 150 Donald Trump rioters for relatively minor offenses like trespassing and disorderly conduct, law-enforcement officials said on Tuesday they are poised to file more serious charges under the rarely used federal sedition statute. That would raise the stakes of the investigation for both prosecutors and accused rioters: The law doesn’t lend itself to easy convictions, but it carries a prison sentence of as long as 20 years.In the initial scramble to arrest the most visible perpetrators of the siege, US prosecutors built cases largely using photos and videos culled from social media. Now they are relying on more traditional law-enforcement tools, including over 500 grand-jury subpoenas and search warrants, to probe the origins of the insurrection and the motives of the rioters.The sedition statute criminalizes any attempt by two or more people to overthrow the government, take control of its property or disrupt the execution of US laws. Members of right-wing groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers would be the likely targets of a sedition charge, which could force courts to reckon with the role of extremist militias in American society.Prosecutors “will put those ideologies on trial,” said Alan Rozenshtein, a former legal adviser in the Justice Department’s national security division who now teaches at the University of Minnesota’s law school. “If there’s a conviction, the message will be that to be a boogaloo boy or an Oath Keeper is to believe in seditious conspiracy.”Much will depend on which part of the statute the prosecutors focus on. Under a broad interpretation of the law, two people who worked together to steal a podium or some other piece of government property from the Capitol could be charged with sedition.But prosecutors may actually be planning to charge rioters under the part of the statute that criminalizes attempts to overthrow the government, which would mark a turning point in the probe as lawmakers and civil rights advocates debate how best to hold domestic extremists accountable for their crimes.“The statute suggests that proving seditious conspiracy can either require a lot or not a lot depending on which part of the statute prosecutors charge,” said David Sklansky, the faculty co-director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. “Charging people with conspiring to overthrow the government is taking on a big burden.”Proving such a charge would present challenges that US prosecutors have not had to navigate in the initial wave of cases, which have focused largely on clear instances of law-breaking inside the Capitol. Investigators would have to show that the rioters communicated in the days leading up to the siege and find evidence of intent to subvert democracy.“That’s not going to show up in the video, and probably is not going to be a thing that people are admitting to spontaneously on Facebook,” said Jeffrey Bellin, a criminal justice expert at William & Mary Law School. “Those will become much more serious cases and take a long time.”Signs of that kind of intensive investigative work have begun appearing in FBI affidavits in some of the cases. Agents have cited testimony from informants and cooperating witnesses, as well as private emails and text exchanges. Prosecutors are almost certainly deploying those and other investigative tools as they pursue another long-term target of the probe: a possible felony murder charge related to the death of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was reportedly bludgeoned with a fire extinguisher during the riot.In the highest-profile cases so far, the US accused three members of the Oath Keepers of conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding. As part of that investigation, law enforcement officials obtained audio recordings of the rioters communicating via the Zello app, as well as records from private Facebook conversations.But prosecutors stopped short of charging the trio with sedition, at least for now. Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney for the District of Columbia, has hinted that some of the people who have been arrested on minor charges like disorderly conduct could face more serious accusations as the investigation progresses. In a court filing on January 24, prosecutors said that Eric Munchel, who was photographed holding white plastic handcuffs at the Capitol, could eventually face a sedition charge.“Part of the reason they brought charges that some people have characterized as not as serious as they would’ve expected is to make sure people know the law is coming,” said Harry Sandick, a former US prosecutor in New York. “To put people into the criminal justice system before they strike again.”The seditious conspiracy charge has a long and vexed history. In the 1950s, a group of Puerto Rican nationalists were convicted of seditious conspiracy for storming into the Capitol and shooting members of Congress -- an attack eerily similar to the siege on January 6. Federal prosecutors also won sedition convictions against the group of terrorists that masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center attack, including Omar Abdel-Rahman, better known as the blind Muslim cleric.But sedition charges brought in 1987 against a group of White supremacists were rejected by a jury. And a sedition case in 2010 against members of a militia group in Michigan was dismissed when a judge ruled that prosecutors failed to show the defendants opposed a “positive assertion of authority” by the US government.Free-speech advocates have long feared that the government could use the broad language in the sedition statute to paint legitimate anti-government protests as insurrection. In September, former Attorney General William Barr raised the prospect of charging Black Lives Matter protesters with sedition, though it was not clear which element of the law he thought would apply.“There’s a danger in using charges that have such a politicized history and come very close to criminalizing dissent,” said Shirin Sinnar, a law professor at Stanford who studies political violence. “The more you lower standards in this sort of situation, the more you lower standards related to protest and other First Amendment activity generally.”The long-term precedent that a prosecution might set is one reason that the Justice Department may be taking its time to build sedition cases stemming from the Capitol riot, said Rozenshtein of the University of Minnesota.“If the government does bring seditious conspiracy charges, that’ll make it easier for the next government to do so,” he said. “But DoJ can minimize that chance by being very careful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prosecutors-weigh-pro-trump-mob-s-ideology-in-sedition-probe-101611930572439.html

29-01-2021||World||J&J vaccine provides strong shield against severe Covid-19||Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine generated strong protection against Covid-19 in a large, late-stage trial, raising hopes that it can rapidly reshape a stumbling immunization campaign.In the more than 44,000-person study, the vaccine prevented 66% of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19, according to a company statement on Friday. And it was particularly effective at stopping severe disease, preventing 85% of severe infections and 100% of hospitalizations and deaths.“If you can prevent severe disease in a high percentage of individuals, that will alleviate so much of the stress and human suffering” of the pandemic, said Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, at a briefing on the results with company and government officials.Based on the result, J&J plans to file for an emergency-use authorization in the US next week. The drug giant’s top scientist said this month that he expects a clearance in March, and that it would have product ready to ship then. The company didn’t specify how much of the vaccine would be available immediately, though it reaffirmed that the US would receive 100 million doses in the first half of the year.Shares of J&J declined 4% to $162.52 in premarket trading on Friday.If cleared, J&J’s vaccine could go a long way toward ending the pandemic. Competing vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. have generated stronger overall efficacy rates, but require two shots to be given before their full benefits take hold. J&J’s shot also can be kept in a refrigerator for three months, while those from Pfizer and Moderna must be kept frozen.“This is a single shot that can be given easily, it protects completely from that which we fear, having to go to the emergency room or a hospital,” said Mathai Mammen, head of global research and development for J&J’s pharmaceutical division, in an interview. “It’s going to change the nature of the disease.”Concerns about keeping second doses of the current shots on hand have complicated the push to get as many people as possible inoculated. Some countries have chosen to spread out the time between doses to address the problem, at the risk of diminishing their effectiveness.The rise of new coronavirus variants has added to the pressure to get immunizations moving faster. The J&J trial was conducted around the globe, including at dozens of clinical-trial sites in hot spots such as South Africa and Brazil where new variants have caused infections to rise.J&J’s results produced more evidence that the variants will be harder to ward off. In the US, where mutations aren’t thought to be as widespread, the vaccine was 72% effective. But in South Africa, where a variant called B.1.351 is circulating widely, it was only 57% effective. And the shot was 66% effective in Latin America.Nonetheless, J&J’s vaccine is likely to give countries around the world a powerful new tool to fight a virus that has infected more than 101 million people and killed 2.2 million worldwide.If confirmed, the results suggest people could get one dose of the vaccine to provide initial protection against severe consequences, allowing them to return to their pre-pandemic lives. Then, if needed, they could later take a booster shot J&J is testing in other large, late-stage trials that could produce results before year-end.J&J said a review by a monitoring board identified no significant safety concerns. While 9% of people who took the shot developed a fever, there were no severe allergic reactions.Different TechnologyJ&J’s vaccine is different from the messenger RNA-based shots made by Moderna and partners Pfizer and BioNTech SE, which each were shown to be more than 90% effective.It is based on an adenovirus, or cold germ modified to make copies of the coronavirus spike protein, which the pathogen uses to force its way into cells. The altered virus can’t replicate in humans, but it triggers an immune response that prepares the body to defend itself against the coronavirus. J&J uses the same technology in a vaccine to fight Ebola.J&J’s R&D head said the company’s trial, conducted at the height of the pandemic, had to deal with resistant variants that arose mainly after Moderna’s and Pfizer’s trials were completed. When counting cases, it also focused on somewhat sicker patients than other trials, Mammen said.“If those vaccine programs accrued cases at the same time as us, when viral infections were so much higher, incidents were higher, and variants were all around us, they would have gotten different numbers,” he said. “The fact that we could do this level of efficacy with a single shot, people don’t have to come back for another, and it’s conveniently stored, well that makes this the vaccine of choice.”At the outset of the pandemic, US government officials said any vaccine showing greater than 50% efficacy would be considered a success.Like Pfizer and Moderna, Mammen said J&J is working on next-generation versions of the shot that could provide protection specifically against certain variants. Other vaccines have seen mixed results against the newer forms of the virus.On Thursday, Novavax Inc. reported that a large late-stage study in the U.K. found its Covid vaccine was 89% effective. However, it was just 60% effective in South Africa in people who were HIV negative, and 49.4% effective when HIV positive patients were included. Most cases of the virus seen in the trial had the new South Africa mutation, the company said.J&J “is already testing and creating vaccines with the ability to respond quickly to the South African strain,” Mammen said.Gaining ClearanceJ&J aims to have a total of seven manufacturing facilities running by the end of the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said Jan. 26. The company says it remains on track to hit the goal of producing 1 billion doses globally before year-end, even as production has been slow to scale up throughout the winter.J&J’s candidate was among six vaccines tapped for the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed program, receiving some $1.5 billion in backing from the US government. The company intends to price the vaccine on a not-for-profit basis, defined by a Gates Foundation model and determined in conjunction with independent auditors, according to Wolk. The price per shot will not exceed $10, he said.While the trial readout marks the start of a new phase in the pandemic response, it also is the close of an anxious chapter in the lives of those who developed it. Mammen said he was in his basement office in his home in New Hope, Pennslvania, when he learned the results.“I’ve been at this for about a year, every day, morning through night,” he said. “When it was unblinded, there was this massive, I mean massive, sense of relief. And great joy. I could finally sleep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-vaccine-provides-strong-shield-against-severe-covid19-101611928806564.html
29-01-2021||World||US consumer spending fell 0.2% in December in face of virus||US consumers slowed their spending by 0.2% in December, cutting back for a second straight month in a worrisome sign for an economy struggling under the weight of a still out-of-control pandemic.The decline reported Friday by the Commerce Department followed a seasonally adjusted 0.7% drop in November. It was the latest sign that consumers, whose spending is the primary driver of the US economy, are hunkered down and avoiding traveling, shopping and dining out. Since making a brief bounce-back from the viral pandemic last spring, consumer spending has barely grown. Sales at retailers have declined for three straight months.Friday's report from the government also showed that personal incomes, which provide the fuel for spending, rose a modest 0.6% after two months of declines. Yet Americans who have been fortunate enough to keep their jobs have been largely stockpiling savings rather than spending.The latest figures reflect a shaky economy. On Thursday, the government estimated that the economy grew at a 4% annual rate in the final three months of 2020 but shrank last year by the largest amount in 74 years. At the same time, the job market is faltering, with nearly 10 million jobs still lost to the pandemic, which erupted 10 months ago. Hiring has slowed for six straight months, and employers shed jobs in December for the first time since April.The outlook for 2021 remains uncertain. Economists warn that a sustained recovery won’t likely take hold until vaccines are successfully distributed and administered nationwide and government-enacted rescue aid spreads through the economy, which could take months. In the meantime, millions of individuals and businesses continue to struggle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-consumer-spending-fell-0-2-in-december-in-face-of-virus-101611927763359.html
29-01-2021||World||Biden just linked climate and security, next comes military money||With warming temperature playing a role in everything from mass migrations to civil war, climate change has been a factor in national security for decades.This week the US finally got with the program. Among the many climate-related executive orders President Joe Biden signed on Wednesday was one directing the federal government to make climate change an integral part of its foreign and national security policy.What does that mean, exactly? Among other things, the order called for the preparation of a National Intelligence Estimate on the threat climate change poses to US security. NIEs are formal, classified assessments of major security questions, incorporating intelligence from 18 agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency and the year-old Space Force. These are compiled several times a year to answer such questions as how much to worry about transnational organized crime and whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction.There’s been at least one climate-related NIE done before, ordered by Congress. “This is not something novel, except at the high level it is being requested,” said Rod Schoonover, former director of environment and natural resources at the National Intelligence Council, the government body that produces the NIE. “Quite honestly,” he added, “it is well past time we got beyond a couple sentences in the worldwide threat assessment done every year for Congress.”The power of the NIE is in how it’s used, said John Morton, a former senior director for energy and climate change on President Obama’s National Security Council. “When climate change is seen purely through an environmental lens you get one audience,” he said. “When you add a national security lens that draws in a further groups of policy makers who may not care at all about the environmental imperative but clearly see the long-term national security implications to act.”It also has legs. “Once that assessment gets done, it is the basis for policy-making for a good chunk of time,” Morton said. Smaller climate assessments done for the Department of Defense are already playing a role in deciding whether to fortify naval bases at risk from rising seas and informing policing strategy in the Arctic now that warming has made it more attractive to US adversaries including China and Russia.If the NIE concludes that climate change presents a grave security risk, vast agency resources could be mobilized—national security-related budget items can be huge. It’s this awesome power that troubles some climate activists, who worry that nationalizing a global problem would leave poorer countries once again with the short end of the stick.“In the US, national security is most often defined as what threatens US homeland, US economic partners, US allies, but most of all US military, economic, or geopolitical power,” said Nick Buxton, author of The Secure and the Dispossessed, a book about the security state’s contributions to climate change. Vulnerable populations and communities may find their concerns deprioritized against, say, the needs of military and security installations.“National security bodies talk in foreboding terms of waves of migration that could overwhelm nation states saying that the military will need to be prepared,” Buxton added. “In this way the most vulnerable in the world are not only victims of climate change, but now threats too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-just-linked-climate-and-security-next-comes-military-money-101611926239605.html
29-01-2021||World||What’s next if Pakistan frees man in Daniel Pearl murder case||Pakistan is scrambling to manage the fallout from a decision by the country's Supreme Court to free the Pakistani-British man accused in the 2002 beheading of American journalist Daniel Pearl.The Sindh provincial government on Friday filed a review petition, asking the same court to revisit its decision.But even the lawyer for the Pearl family has said a review petition has a slim chance of succeeding because it is heard by the same judges who voted to free Ahmad Saeed Omar Sheikh. The case appears to have fallen apart because of the contradictory evidence produced during Sheikh's original trial in 2002 and the decision by the prosecution at the time to try him and three other accused co-conspirators together. According to the Pearl family lawyer, Faisal Siddiqi, this means that doubt about the guilt of one translates into a doubt about all.Washington has expressed outrage, promising to pursue extradition of Sheikh on two separate U.S. indictments against him. For its part, Pakistan's government has thrown up every legal hurdle it could to keep Sheikh in jail following his acquittal last April by a lower court.WHAT LEGAL OPTIONS REMAIN FOR PAKISTAN?The provincial Sindh government has taken the last remaining legal step by filing a review petition Friday with the Supreme Court. It's unlikely to change the outcome, but it could give the provincial government legal cover to keep Sheikh in jail in the port city of Karachi, the capital of the southern Sindh province.Defying the Supreme Court order to free Sheikh could again leave the Sindh government facing contempt charges. It already defended itself against earlier charges of contempt for previously refusing to release him, ignoring an order from a lower court.Pakistan also might consider charging him in connection with allegations that he possessed nine different SIM cards for phones he used to contact friends, including some in Britain, in 2009 while on death row. There have been suggestions in the local media in Pakistan that he used the SIM cards to call for assistance to break him out of the Hyderabad jail where he'd been on death row since his 2002 conviction. He was moved to a Karachi jail after his April acquittal.WHAT OPTIONS ARE OPEN FOR THE US?U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said Washington was ready to extradite Sheikh to answer two indictments against him in U.S. courts — one for his involvement in the beheading of Pearl and the other for his involvement in the kidnapping of an American in Indian-ruled Kashmir in 1994, alongside three British tourists. All four were eventually freed unhurt.There are a couple of hurdles to extradition: Pakistan, like the United States, has a double jeopardy rule that prevents a person from being tried for the same offense twice. The U.S. also does not have an extradition treaty with Pakistan, although Islamabad has in the past bypassed legalities to send suspects to the U.S., including Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Mohammed has been in U.S. custody on Guantanamo Bay since his arrest in Pakistan in March 2003. He also confessed that he killed Pearl himself, but has not been charged in the Wall Street Journal reporter's death. The most recent example of Pakistan allowing someone accused of a crime to leave for the U.S. was in 2011, when Raymond Davis, an American contractor at the U.S. Embassy, returned home after gunning down two people in the eastern city of Lahore. He said he opened fire because he felt threatened.HOW MIGHT THIS CASE IMPACT US-PAKISTAN RELATIONS?The case could be one of the first major tests for President Joe Biden and U.S.-Pakistan relations have historically been tumultuous. Pakistan likely will play a crucial role in the Biden administration's attempts to navigate the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Pakistan was seen as key to getting the Taliban into negotiations with the Kabul government, even if those talks have been excruciatingly slow and until now have garnered little success, even as violence has spiked.Mohammad Amir Rana, executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, said Sheikh's acquittal has created a conundrum for both countries. Until now, Pakistan has taken every legal step to keep Sheikh in jail but sending him to America could rile up opposition at home, Rana explained. For America, snubbing Pakistan just when the two have agreed on exchanging intelligence on terror financing and the road to a political settlement in Afghanistan is at a critical juncture, could result in setbacks on both fronts.WHO IS AHMAD SAEED OMAR SHEIKH?A British national of Pakistani heritage, Sheikh lived a relatively privileged life in Britain, where he attended the prestigious London School of Economics. It appears he was inspired to jihad by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, relentless attacks on Muslims in Bosnia at the time, their treatment in Bosnian Serb camps and what Sheikh perceived as Western indifference to their plight.He traveled to Bosnia and later joined Harakat-a-Ansar, a Pakistan-based militant group that was declared a terrorist group by the U.S. in 1997 and later became known as Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen. He also travelled to the Indian-ruled section of Kashmir to wage war against India in the Muslim-majority region. The disputed Himalayan region is split between India and Pakistan and claimed by both in its entirety.Sheikh's strength seemed to be his ability to use his British upbringing to entice foreigners to trust him. That ability led to the kidnapping of the American tourist in 1994, and according to some evidence, eased any concerns Pearl might have had as he sought to track militants in Pakistan.Sheikh was arrested by India after the 1994 kidnappings but was among terror suspects freed by India on Dec. 31, 1999 in exchange for the hostages on an Indian Airlines aircraft that was hijacked and taken from Nepal to then Taliban-controlled Afghan city of Kandahar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whats-next-if-pakistan-frees-man-in-daniel-pearl-murder-case-101611926476507.html
29-01-2021||World||WHO team in Wuhan visits first hospital to treat Covid-19 patients||The WHO-led team of experts began their probe into the origins of the Covid-19 virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan by meeting Chinese scientists and visiting the hospital that treated the first patients suspected to have been infected in December, 2019.“Extremely important 1st site visit. We are in the hospital that treated some of the first known cases of Covid-19, meeting with the actual clinicians & staff who did this work, having open discussion about the details of their work,” Peter Daszak, a member of the team led by World Health Organization, tweeted on Friday.The itinerary of the expert team has not been announced, though the UN agency has said it plans to visit the seafood market linked to the first cases in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which conducts research on pathogens.Speaking to state media, team leader Peter Ben Embarek, said: “[We hope to] understand the setting, see the places where cases were linked, reconstruct the initial event there, search for records of animals, products traded there. And possibly talking to some of the merchants who were there (Huanan seafood market) at that time.”“My understanding is that there will be no restrictions or limitations in working with our Chinese colleagues or in visiting places the joint team deem of interest,” Ben Embarek told the tabloid, Global Times.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Friday that WHO and Chinese experts were working together to trace the origin of the virus, but stressed that the mission was not a probe.“It is part of a global research, not an investigation,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing.“It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources,” Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday.“No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-team-in-wuhan-visits-first-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patients-101611924317026.html
29-01-2021||World||Nationalism over Covid shots could disrupt global supplies: Japan vaccine chief||Japan's vaccine rollout chief said on Friday that growing nationalism over supplies of Covid-19 shots could lead to retaliation and disruptions to global supplies.Taro Kono said he was concerned about a European Union announcement that it may block exports of vaccines produced there until sufficient supplies are provided to the European people."It is understandable to put their own people first," Kono said during an online panel hosted by the World Economic Forum. "But we are living on the same planet, and the supply chain now goes global.""It is time for the leaders of the states to sit down and have an online conversation" to address the issue, he added.Japan is trailing most major economies in starting Co-19 inoculations due to its dependence on overseas makers and a requirement that the vaccines go through domestic trials. The government plans to begin its vaccine push in late February using imported doses of Pfizer Inc's formula.AstraZeneca Plc will file for Japanese approval of its Covid-19 vaccine as early as mid-February, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, making it the second vaccine maker to seek approval in Japan after Pfizer.It aims to license Japanese biotechnology company JCR Pharmaceutical to produce some 90 million doses of its vaccine in Japan to help the country avoid shortages and delays, the Nikkei reported separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nationalism-over-covid-shots-could-disrupt-global-supplies-japan-vaccine-chief-101611923802581.html
29-01-2021||World||EU poised to ban Covid-19 vaccine exports as shortage crisis mounts||The European Union is poised to ban Covid-19 vaccine exports if drugmakers fail to meet delivery targets within the bloc, stepping up its battle for doses as governments warn of shortages in the weeks ahead.The crisis is showing little sign of being resolved a week after AstraZeneca Plc warned that issues at a plant in Belgium mean deliveries this quarter will be less than half that initially planned. Countries are being forced to slow the rollout of inoculations, aggravating an already-sluggish pace across the EU.“We still have some difficult weeks of vaccine shortages ahead of us,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in Berlin on Friday.Also on Friday, Astra bowed to EU pressure and released its vaccine contract with the bloc. The document suggests that U.K. manufacturing sites can be used to meet EU deliveries, which has been a part of the dispute. But it also says that the company is only subject to “best reasonable efforts,” and details on doses and delivery dates were redacted.Earlier on Friday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a fresh demand that Astra fulfill its obligations.“It’s perfectly understandable that they had difficulties at the start,” von der Leyen said on Germany’s DLF radio. “But what we want is a plausible explanation of why these problems are there and then we’ll work together to solve them.”In Spain, Madrid’s regional administration is halting vaccinations for at least two weeks after receiving less doses than expected, while Ireland’s first-quarter deliveries from Astra will be about half of what it expected.France said about 5% of appointments for first jabs will have to be delayed by a few days, although none would be canceled. Italy has also slowed its campaign, blaming Pfizer Inc. for sending fewer doses than expected in recent weeks.The bloc’s Covid-19 vaccine push started at the end of December, later than the U.S. and Britain. As of Friday, 2.5 doses had been administered per 100 people in the EU, compared with 8.3 in the U.S. and 11.9 in the U.K., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The commission’s proposal will allow EU states to block exports if a set of pre-defined criteria haven’t been met, according to officials in Brussels. The main condition will be meeting agreed delivery targets within the EU.EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said the measures aren’t bans, but only relate to advance purchase agreements.“Not all pharmaceutical companies have acted in the spirit of full transparency,’ he said. “We must of course ensure that companies are meeting their contractual obligations.”The measures are due to be published in the afternoon. Around the same time, the European Medicines Agency is expected to announce its approval of the Astra shot for use in the EU.But anger over the chaotic situation continues to mount. European Council President Charles Michel raised the prospect of effectively seizing control of vaccine production if the commission’s measures fail to get the inoculation program back on track.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-poised-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-exports-as-shortage-crisis-mounts-101611923608719.html
29-01-2021||World||US vaccine hopeful of using Gates Foundation cash to prepare for human trial||Scientists who normally focus on fixing defective genes said on Friday that up to $2.1 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will help them move their Covid-19 vaccine candidate toward 2021 human trials.Harvard University scientist Luk Vandenberghe and University of Pennsylvania gene therapy head James Wilson said primate safety and efficacy tests have proven promising for their single-dose candidate, targeted for room-temperature storage."We believe there is real potential," Vandenberghe said in an interview. "That being said, we're not naive. There's 300 vaccines racing towards the door and biology is complex."Their candidate relies on an adeno-associated virus (AAV), deemed harmless to humans, to deliver DNA fragments from the new coronavirus, telling human cells to make a protein that provokes an immune response.AAVs are already used in gene therapies sold by Novartis, including its $2.1 million-per-patient Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy. The Swiss company's gene therapy unit is backing the project with technical assistance and supply.Other Covid-19 vaccines use viral vectors, too, though AstraZeneca and Oxford University's shot, Russia's Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson's one-dose candidate rely on so-called adenoviruses to transport coronavirus DNA.Gates Foundation money will support more pre-clinical tests ahead of a overseas safety trial in a still-undisclosed location where vaccines are not broadly available, Vandenberghe, who runs Mass General Brigham hospital's Grousbeck Gene Therapy Center in Boston, said.Though previously unused in approved vaccines, he is optimistic AAVs will be safe, since only tiny amounts are needed compared to what is required for gene therapies that have been given to many patients.While he predicts every approved Covid-19 vaccine dose available through 2022 will see use, Vandenberghe acknowledged his group's success also hinges on finding a deep-pocketed partner with vaccine experience to bankroll large-scale production."We've already invested more than $10 million," he said. "If indeed we want to meet the time lines we were just talking about, this needs a commercial larger vaccine player to be accelerated, like an AstraZeneca for Oxford's."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vaccine-hopeful-of-using-gates-foundation-cash-to-prepare-for-human-trial-101611923204744.html
29-01-2021||World||EU agrees 'dark red' Covid-19 zones with stricter travel limits||Hotspots of Covid-19 infection in the European Union will be labelled "dark red" zones to discourage all but essential travel, EU governments agreed on Friday.The EU has already set up a "traffic light" system to designate the seriousness of the spread of the novel coronavirus in each of its 27 states and to try to limit travel.But with infections rising and contagious variants spreading most of the bloc is already red, so new dark red zones would help to distinguish very high-risk areas and also help uphold rules requiring testing on departure and quarantine.EU ambassadors agreed the new measure, proposed by the European Commission, at a meeting in Brussels, EU diplomats told Reuters. The new colour will indicate regions with more than 500 coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants over two weeks.At the same time, Germany and other countries announced they intended to take additional travel measures to curb the spread of the virus, one EU diplomat said. Current EU presidency chair Portugal, which is running EU meetings from January to June, said that any new travel measures were up to individual states.Germany is preparing entry bans for travellers from Britain, Portugal, Brazil and South Africa to limit the spread of the more contagious variants of the coronavirus raging in these countries, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Thursday.Belgium has barred residents from taking vacations abroad until March to fight the spread of the more infectious virus variants. However, the EU executive Commission insists that essential workers and goods must be able to cross borders smoothly, part of EU rules guaranteeing free movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agrees-dark-red-covid-19-zones-with-stricter-travel-limits-101611920692835.html

In the week beginning Feb. 7, only 132,000 doses will arrive, 20% less than agreed," Domenico Arcuri said.Italy, the country with the second highest toll of Covid-19 deaths in Europe after Britain, is also grappling with delays in vaccine deliveries by the U.S. firm Pfizer, to which Rome has already sent a formal warning letter."As of today, we are missing 300,000 vaccine doses. Every day there is worse news than the day before.

29-01-2021||World||Ukraine bans use of Russian Covid-19 vaccines||Ukraine's parliament on Friday approved a bill intended to speed up the approval of Covid-19 vaccines, which also bans the approval of vaccines made in Russia.The government has said it expects to receive 100,000 to 200,000 doses of the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc and Germany's BioNTech under the global COVAX scheme in February.No vaccine has yet been approved in Ukraine but authorities have repeatedly said Kyiv will not approve or use vaccines from Russia, with which Ukraine's ties are strained."One political force just created some hysteria over the registration of the Russian vaccine," Ukraine's Health Minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing."I can say at once: You can be hysterical for a very long time, no one will register the Russian vaccine in the country."Biolik, a Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent Russia-leaning opposition figure, said earlier this month it had applied for state approval to make Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, a sensitive move given the poor relations between Kyiv and Moscow.The two countries have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-bans-use-of-russian-covid-19-vaccines-101611918477439.html
29-01-2021||World||Delink border clash from bilateral ties, China to India||The India-China border problem should not be linked to bilateral ties, Beijing said on Friday, responding to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s statement that last year’s events at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh had “profoundly disturbed” bilateral ties.The Chinese foreign ministry said Beijing hoped that bilateral relations could be put back on track through pragmatic cooperation.Speaking at an online conference on Thursday, Jaishankar had put forward “eight principles” and three “mutuals” – respect, sensitivity, and interests – as part of the Sino-India framework for bilateral ties.The Indian minister emphasised that mutual respect, sensitivity and interests could not be brushed aside as the two neighbours continue protracted attempts to resolve the ongoing military standoff in Ladakh. The Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said China had taken note of Jaishankar’s comments.“Foreign minister Jaishankar emphasised the importance of China-India relations and demonstrated the importance that India attaches to China-India relations. China affirms this,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing.“At the same time, I also want to emphasise that border issues should not be linked to bilateral relations. This is an important experience in the continuous development of bilateral relations over the past years,” Zhao said.The spokesperson added: “It is hoped that India and China will move in the same way, properly manage differences, promote pragmatic cooperation, and push bilateral relations back on track.”Not too long ago, New Delhi might have at least partially agreed with Zhao’s assertion of delinking the disputed border and the progress of overall bilateral ties.In January 2020, external affairs ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said that as talks continued to settle the border dispute, the two sides should ensure the issue does not “cloud the overall relationship”.Kumar was speaking after the December, 2019 meeting of the two Special Representatives on the border issue – National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and State Councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi – in New Delhi.“There was a feeling it (border issue) should be addressed from a strategic perspective of India-China relations. While discussions continue under the Special Representatives framework, there should be peace and tranquillity on the border,” Kumar had said on the meeting between Doval and Wang.Officials from both countries have also earlier spoken about respecting each other’s core interests.The ongoing military standoff since May and the death of 20 Indian soldiers during the Galwan Valley clash have brought in darker clouds over the ties. (China is yet to reveal People’s Liberation Army’s casualty figures from the deadly clash.)That Jaishankar mentioned mutual respect, sensitivity, and interests – at an online conference organised by the New Delhi-based Institute of Chinese Studies – means that New Delhi feels that Beijing isn’t really concerned about the three parametres in its ties with India.“Any expectation that [the three mutuals] can be brushed aside and that life can carry on undisturbed despite the situation at the border, that is simply not realistic,” Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delink-border-clash-from-bilateral-ties-china-to-india-101611918796636.html
29-01-2021||World||Worried about power of social media companies: UN chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said he is "worried” about the power of social media companies and called for creating a global mechanism to regulate them.Guterres, addressing a press conference on Thursday following his informal briefing to the UN member states on ‘Priorities for 2021’, said he does not think “we can live in a world where too much power is given to a reduced number of companies"“Well, I think that the question is not the right question, if I may. The right question should be a company, the entity, that has the power decision on these issues, or should we create a mechanism in which there is a regulatory framework with rules that allow for that to be done in line with law? And my clear answer is the second,” Guterres said.He was responding to a question on whether Twitter made the right move in closing down the account of former US President Donald Trump.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said that banning Trump from posting messages after the violence at the US Capitol on January 6 was the “right decision". Facebook also banned Trump."I must say that I'm particularly worried about the power that they already have," Guterres said.“I mean, the volume of information that is being gathered about each one of us, the lack of control we have about our own"... the data related to ourselves, the fact that that data can be used not only for commercial purposes to sell to advertising companies but also to change our behaviour, and the risks of that to be used also from a political point of view for the control of citizens in countries, he said.Guterres said this “requires a serious discussion”."And one of the objectives of our road map for digital cooperation is exactly to put these things on the table," he said.In response to another question on if he believes China is driving an “authoritarian agenda” at the UN, Guterres said in relation to the United Nations, he can guarantee that “we are very strongly committed to make sure that the UN is a beacon of all the values related to peace, security, development, and human rights.”He underlined that he hopes “we will see a reset in the relations between the United States and China with different dimensions"."It is clear that, in human rights, there are two completely different views, and it is clear that, in human rights, there is no scope for an agreement or a common vision,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worried-about-power-of-social-media-companies-un-chief-101611917760762.html
29-01-2021||World||UK offers Hong Kong residents a route to citizenship, angering China||Britain on Friday hailed a new visa offering Hong Kong citizens a route to citizenship after China's crackdown but Beijing said it would no longer recognise special British passports offered to residents of the former colony.Britain and China have been bickering for months about what London and Washington say is an attempt to silence dissent in Hong Kong, though Beijing says the West's views are clouded by misinformation and an imperial hangover.Britain says it is fulfilling a historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong after China imposed a tough new security law on the city that Britain says breaches the terms of agreements to hand the colony back in 1997."I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, referring to a special British National Overseas (BNO) passport."In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy – values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear."But China hit back by saying it would not recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document from Jan. 31."Britain is trying to turn large numbers of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens. This has completely changed the original nature of BNO," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing.Beijing's decision not to recognise the travel document is largely symbolic as Hong Kong residents would not normally use their BNO passports to travel to the mainland.Beijing's imposition of a national security law in the former British colony in June last year prompted Britain to offer refuge to almost 3 million Hong Kong residents eligible for the BNO passport from Jan. 31.The scheme, first announced last year, opens on Sunday and allows those with "British National (Overseas)" status to live, study and work in Britain for five years and eventually apply for citizenship.BN(O) is a special status created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong.The new 250 pound ($340) visa could attract more than 300,000 people and their dependents to Britain and generate up to 2.9 billion pounds net benefit to the British economy over the next five years, according to government forecasts.From around midday on Sunday, eligible applicants can apply online and book an appointment to register their fingerprints at a visa application centre. From Feb. 23 some will be able to make the application via a smartphone app.It is still highly uncertain how many people will actually take up the offer. Government estimates show that 2.9 million people and a further 2.3 million dependents will be eligible to come to Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-offers-hong-kong-residents-a-route-to-citizenship-angering-china-101611917895063.html

29-01-2021||World||Alexei Navalny's 'Putin palace' film pushes past 100 million YouTube views||An online video made by jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny alleging that President Vladimir Putin is the ultimate owner of an opulent palace, something Putin has denied, has been viewed more than 100 million times, YouTube data showed on Friday.Navalny, who is serving a 30-day jail stint for parole violations he calls trumped up, released the video last week in an effort to encourage people to take to the streets to demand his freedom, something tens of thousands did last weekend.Navalny's allies are still promoting the video to try to encourage people to protest, this time on Sunday, something the authorities have warned would be illegal under Russian law, which requires such events to be pre-authorised. The authorities have said such mass events are unsafe amid a pandemic.Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for over two decades and has traditionally avoided even uttering Navalny's name publicly, has said the palace, in southern Russia, does not belong to him or his family.His public denial on state TV was unusual. Some critics saw it as a sign that he was rattled, an idea the Kremlin has laughed off.Navalny's video said the property, built in the Italian palazzo style, had its own underground ice rink, casino, swimming pool, theatre and something called an aqua-disco.The latter inspired a pop music track and video titled "Akvadiskoteka" that has since gained over three million YouTube views.Navalny rose to prominence in Russia during anti-Kremlin protests in 2011-12 and carved out a following online, particularly among younger Russians in big cities, by airing allegations about official graft.He was arrested earlier this month after flying back to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in August.Navalny has accused Putin of ordering his poisoning. Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison him and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-s-putin-palace-film-pushes-past-100-million-youtube-views-101611914425966.html

29-01-2021||World||As EU faces shortage, AstraZeneca offers 8 mln extra doses of Covid-19 vaccines||AstraZeneca has offered the European Union 8 million more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine this quarter, which the EU has deemed inadequate because it would still leave a large shortfall from what was originally expected, an EU official told Reuters.Last week the Anglo-Swedish firm unexpectedly announced cuts in supplies to the EU, citing production problems at a Belgian factory. EU officials said that meant a 60% cut to 31 million doses in the period to end-March.The EU official directly involved in talks with the company said that AstraZeneca had later offered to increase deliveries to possibly 39 million doses in the first quarter, which the EU considered insufficient.Under a contract agreed in August the company should have supplied at least 80 million doses to the EU in that period, the official said, and possibly even 120 million "depending on how you read the contract".A second EU official said in a media briefing on Wednesday that the company had proposed to supply a quarter of the agreed volume of doses through March, which in the contract amounted to a "three-digit" figure - which is consistent with the nearly 40 million out of a total of 120 million mentioned by the first source.AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot told newspapers on Tuesday the company had no legal requirement to deliver to the EU on a precise timetable, because it had only committed to supplying vaccines under a best-effort clause.At a meeting on Wednesday with EU officials, Soriot repeated this argument and made no new offer of extra doses from the 39 millions pledged earlier in the week, the first EU official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-eu-faces-shortage-astrazeneca-offers-8-mln-extra-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-101611910372882.html
29-01-2021||World||China derecognizes British National Overseas passport||China said Friday it will no longer recognize the British National Overseas passport as a valid travel document or form of identification amid a bitter feud with London over a plan to allow millions of Hong Kong residents a route to residency and eventual citizenship.The announcement by Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Friday throws up new uncertainty around the plan just hours after the U.K. said it would begin taking applications for what are called BNO visas beginning late Sunday.Under the plan, as many as 5.4 million Hong Kong residents could be eligible to live and work in the U.K. for five years then apply for citizenship. Demand soared after Beijing last year imposed a sweeping new national security law on the former British colony following months of pro-democracy protests.“The British side’s attempt to turn a large number of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens has completely changed the nature of the two sides’ original understanding of BNO,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.“This move seriously infringes on China’s sovereignty, grossly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs, and seriously violates international law and the basic norms of international relations,” he said. “China will no longer recognize the so-called BNO passport as a travel document and proof of identity starting from Jan 31st, and reserves the right to take further measures.”Many Hong Kongers carry multiple passports and it is unclear what if anything the Chinese government could do to prevent people entering the U.K. through the BNO visa plan. As a further protection of personal privacy, a cellphone app will allow applicants to download their biometric information without having to been seen visiting the British visa office.The BNO passport was originally a disappointment for Hong Kongers when it was first offered ahead of Hong Kong’s handover to Chinese rule in 1997. At the time, it offered only the right to visit for six months with no right to work or become a full citizen. Applicants had to have been born before the handover date.However, pressure grew to expand such privileges as China increasingly cracked down on civil and political life in Hong Kong in what critics say violates China’s commitment to maintain the city’s separate way of life for 50 years after the handover. China first declared the 1984 Sino-British Declaration setting out the handover arrangements null and void despite its recognition by the United Nations, then imposed the national security law on the territory after the city’s legislature was unable to pass it on its own.“I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BNOs to live, work and make their home in our country,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.“In doing so we have honored our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy – values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-derecognizes-british-national-overseas-passport-101611910862015.html

29-01-2021||World||US officials to press Taiwan, TSMC to resolve auto chip crunch||Biden administration officials have called an ad-hoc meeting next week with Taiwan government and industry officials, during which they’re expected to pressure Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and its peers to ramp up the supply of vital chips to US automakers.Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matt Murray and Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce Richard Steffens are scheduled to attend a virtual meeting Thursday US time with Taiwan Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua, people familiar with the matter said. Executives from the island’s largest chipmakers including TSMC and MediaTek Inc. will also attend a discussion centered on resolving a global shortage of auto chips, they said. The meeting is intended to forge closer ties between the two sides, the ministry said in a statement to Bloomberg News, without elaborating on the agenda or final attendance list.Global carmakers such as General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. face potentially $61 billion of lost revenue for the year because they can’t secure enough of the chips that go into a plethora of vehicle parts. TSMC and other Taiwanese firms are among the world’s most sophisticated chipmakers and produce a significant portion of the semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops.This week, TSMC vowed to reallocate capacity to support the global automotive industry. Some industry observers say the shortage stemmed from near-sighted planning and under-estimation of a post-Covid rebound in automobile demand, while others argue chipmakers are prioritizing higher-volume and more lucrative consumer electronics such as smartphones.The quagmire reveals the risks for automakers like Ford and Volkswagen AG as vehicles become smarter and technologically more complex. Carmakers with more software and chip expertise are set to face a smoother ride, while those whose traditional strength in metal-bending are potentially more prone to supply hiccups.The people familiar with the meeting details asked not to be identified talking about a private arrangement that has yet to be made public. A spokesperson for the US State department declined to comment. Representatives for the US Commerce Department, TSMC and MediaTek didn’t respond to requests for comment.“We continue to engage with government officials as this remains a critical issue,” said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, the lobbyist for the Detroit-based automakers GM and Ford as well as the US operations of Stellantis NV (formerly Fiat Chrysler). “We are grateful for the Biden administration’s ongoing assistance and hope it can continue as more key positions are filled.”The meeting will take place as Biden’s administration signals strong backing for an island China claims as its own. The US State Department this week urged China to engage in a dialogue with Taiwan and halt military pressure on the island, in an early nod of support for Taipei.Disputes over Taiwan, which has been one of the biggest flash points between the US and China since the Cold War, have returned to the fore as Washington steps up support for Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-to-press-taiwan-tsmc-to-resolve-auto-chip-crunch-101611911702700.html
29-01-2021||World||Three key issues in Pacific theatre to shape Joe Biden's China policy||US President Joe Biden's China policy would be shaped on three key issues in the Pacific Ocean, viz - South China Sea, Taiwan, and Taiwan Strait and Japan and a system of alliances and partners, reported CNN.These three constitute the Pacific military flashpoints between the US and China.In the South China Sea region, China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square miles of the South China Sea. Since 2014 it has built up tiny reefs and sandbars into man-made artificial islands, fortified with missiles, runways and weapons systems -- antagonising governments with overlapping claims, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan, reported CNN.Washington doesn't recognise those claims and regularly sends US warships and military aircraft through the region.The US Navy performed ten freedom of navigation operations (FONOPS) in 2020 under the Trump administration, equaling the record number of FONOPS in 2019, according to the US Navy's 7th Fleet, reported CNN.It follows other such high-profile developments in 2020, including the rare decision to deploy two carrier strike groups for exercises in the waterway at the same time.That both sides have increased their activity in the waterway has alarmed analysts, who point out that the greater volume of traffic, the greater the possibility of inadvertent confrontation, reported CNN.The US' increased presence in the region is unlikely to change, however. During his run for the presidency last year, Biden recalled how as vice president he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping how the US military would deal with Beijing's self-declared air defence identification zones in the region. "I said we're going to fly through them ... We're not going to pay attention."Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region is a source of a tussle between the US and China owing to Washington's support of Taiwan.Taiwan had split from mainland China in the wake of civil war and the US has remained a decades-long ally of Taiwan since then.Taiwan returned to the forefront of US-China tensions last weekend when Beijing sent more than two dozen warplanes into the self-governing island's air defence identification zone in a 48-hour period.While the frequency of such drills has increased in recent years, the timing and the composition of the latest formations -- mostly fighter jets and bombers -- appeared intended to send a message to the new administration in Washington, reported CNN.In recent years, President Xi Jinping, China has reasserted its perceived claims to the island, threatening military action and even "war" in response to what it considers to be growing calls for formal independence.US warships transited the waterway 13 times in 2020, according to the US 7th Fleet. Recent statements from the new Biden administration suggest there will be no pullback on these actions."There's been a strong and long bipartisan commitment to Taiwan," new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his confirmation hearing last week. "Part of that commitment is making sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself against aggression. And that is a commitment that will absolutely endure in a Biden administration."The third military flashpoint of the Pacific is Japan and a system of alliances and partners of the US. The US alliance with Japan is arguably it's most important. Meanwhile, the Philippines have a mutual defence treaty with the US, and alliances with other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei in the Indo-Pacific region have deeply enraged China.Japan has been regularly training with its US counterparts and it is centred on defending some of Japan's far-flung island possessions, the most high-profile being the Senkakus, an uninhabited rocky island chain.Japan has administered the islands since 1972, China also claims sovereignty over them. Washington has repeatedly reaffirmed Japan's claims to the islands. In a call with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday, Biden pledged his ongoing commitment to defending the Senkakus under the US-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty, reported CNN.Biden's comments have taken on additional importance in light of newly passed Chinese legislation that, in theory, would allow its coast guard ships to fire on foreign vessels that are perceived as posing a threat to territory claimed by Beijing.Chinese coast guard vessels are regularly in the vicinity of Philippine-controlled islands in the South China Sea that China also claims as its territory. But, the Philippines too has a Mutual Defense Treaty, that was reaffirmed by US Secretary of State Blinken on Wednesday, reported CNN.Japan and the Philippines face the same kind of Chinese threat, while allied with the US, illustrates the web of alliances and partners Washington has established around the Indo-Pacific."The rise of China and its disruptive impact on the regional order has pushed the two US allies closer to each other than ever," analyst Richard Javad Heydarian wrote for the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative in 2019.US, Japanese and Philippine forces have conducted joint exercises, and the Philippines last year became Japan's first major military export customer, signing a deal to buy advanced air surveillance radars.Other countries that have been involved to some degree with the US and, or Japanese militaries in the past few years include Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.And in 2021, analysts expect the Biden administration to be leaning on that system of alliances, reported CNN."Trump acted and decided quickly, then sought partners. Biden first will seek partners, then act," said Schuster, an analyst at Hawaii Pacific University.Analysts say such moves are likely only the beginning of what is expected to be a potentially uneasy initial relationship between the new Biden administration and Beijing, reported CNN."China often uses a series of 'tests' to determine a competitor's intentions or willingness to respond to China's actions," said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command's Joint Intelligence Center.Next steps from Beijing could include large-scale military exercises near Taiwan or in the South China Sea, or stopping foreign vessels in the name of enforcing Chinese maritime regulations, said Schuster.Beijing will be trying to determine where the Biden administration's "red lines" are, added Schuster.But incoming Biden Cabinet secretaries have made clear where his administration will stand on Chinese territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific."I think China is our most challenging, our most significant challenge going forward," new Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told his confirmation hearing last week.The Defence Department would focus on convincing China, or any adversary, that taking on the US military would be "a very bad idea," said Austin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-key-issues-in-pacific-theatre-to-shape-joe-biden-s-china-policy-101611911684576.html

Relations between the two nations soured under former US President Donald Trump's administration over trade tariffs and Trump's criticism of China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic."It cannot possibly be too late for the US and China to reset the tone of their interactions, and avert a clash between them," said Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong."The new US administration is an opportunity to steer the relationship towards safer waters," he said, adding the US-China relationship should become a key strategic priority for Biden.Neither China or the United States have said whether they will send officials to the meeting due to be held from May 25-28, over which there remains uncertainty given the pandemic still raging across many parts of the world.Lee said Singapore would work with the forum to ensure the health and safety of all."I welcome all of you to Singapore in May...and forge a new path forward together," Lee said in prepared remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/update-2-u-s-and-china-may-meet-at-singapore-s-davos-wef-says-101611911266533.html

29-01-2021||World||EU raises pressure on AstraZeneca over Covid-19 vaccine shortage||European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen demanded that AstraZeneca Plc fulfill its contractual obligations for the coronavirus vaccine as the mounting shortage crisis forces countries to slow delivery of shots.Von der Leyen said Astra’s deal with the bloc should be made public to provide transparency and give the EU planning security for its vaccine campaign. The dispute over deliveries was triggered by Astra’s decision to prioritize Britain over the EU following a Belgian production glitch, in what Brussels claims is a breach of terms.“What irritated us was that, unlike the other companies, AstraZeneca very suddenly announced that it was drastically reducing its agreed deliveries for the first quarter and did not provide understandable reasons why,” von der Leyen said Friday in an interview with Germany’s DLF radio. “Now we want clarity on that.”As the EU struggles to resolve the situation, governments across the bloc are dealing with the fallout. Madrid’s regional administration is halting vaccinations for at least two weeks after receiving less doses than expected, and Ireland has cautioned that its first-quarter target will depend on Astra deliveries.Italy has slowed its rollout, blaming Pfizer Inc. for sending fewer doses than expected in recent weeks. The campaign for the elderly will be delayed by about four weeks, and by six to eight weeks for the rest of the population, according to acting deputy health minister Pierpaolo Sileri.The EU is preparing to escalate its response, and will announce tighter restrictions on the export of Covid-19 vaccines on Friday. That’s aimed at helping the bloc accelerate an inoculation pace that’s so far proved embarrassingly slow.Astra Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot has pledged that the company will deliver more vaccine to EU member states as early as February, Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported Thursday.The commission signed an advance purchase agreement with Astra for as many as 400 million Covid-19 vaccine doses -- part of a total 2.3 billion secured for the EU. The Astra jab is expected get the green light from the European Medicines Agency later on Friday following the bloc’s approval of vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc.“It’s perfectly understandable that they had difficulties at the start, that was the same with all the companies,” von der Leyen said on DLF. “That’s fine, but what we want is a plausible explanation of why these problems are there and then we’ll work together to solve them. There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear.”Von der Leyen will hold a video conference with the CEOs of Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers on Sunday afternoon, Politico reported Friday, citing a list of confirmed participants.The EU’s planned new export regulations will require companies to obtain prior authorization before shipping doses outside the bloc.That will allow EU states to block exports if a set of pre-defined criteria haven’t been met, according to officials in Brussels. The main condition will be that companies have already delivered a sufficient number of dosages to EU members, as set out in purchase agreements.European Council President Charles Michel raised the prospect of effectively seizing control of vaccine production if the commission’s measures fail to get the inoculation program back on track.The bloc’s Covid-19 vaccine push started at the end of December, several weeks after the U.S. and Britain. As of Friday, 2.5 doses had been administered per 100 people in the EU, compared with 8.3 in the U.S. and 11.9 in the U.K., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-raises-pressure-on-astrazeneca-over-covid-vaccine-shortage-101611907999257.html
29-01-2021||World||US dials up pressure over Omar Sheikh but will Pak end its ties with jihadis?||If the Pakistan government had plans to initiate a reset of its relationship with the US under the Biden administration, those have been virtually scuppered by the country’s Supreme Court acquitting Omar Saeed Sheikh, the mastermind behind the 2002 kidnapping of reporter Daniel Pearl. Pakistan’s policy-makers would have woken on Friday to two strong statements from the White House and the US state department expressing outrage and strong concern about the Supreme Court’s ruling that could pave the way for Sheikh and three other men convicted of the 2002 abduction and murder to walk free. Underlining the gravity of the situation, the statement from the US state department wasn’t issued by a spokesperson, but by the new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and even before he had made an introductory call to his Pakistani counterpart. Blinken also offered to prosecute Sheikh in the US “for his horrific crimes against an American citizen” – in effect, asking Pakistan to hand over Sheikh. Also Read: United States ‘outraged’ as Pak court upholds acquittal in Daniel Pearl murderThe timing of the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order was also inopportune because it came weeks before the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) holds its first plenary meeting of 2021, at which the multilateral watchdog will review Pakistan’s efforts to fight terror financing. The court verdict will only lead to greater scrutiny of Pakistan’s efforts to crack down on terrorism and the long-standing problem of links between terrorists and the military establishment. It is widely known that Sheikh had turned himself in to Pakistan’s intelligence agencies after Pearl’s murder in 2002, a week before his formal arrest by police. It is also known that Sheikh had surrendered to former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer Ijaz Shah, who was then the home secretary of Punjab province and till last month, the interior minister of Pakistan. Sheikh, who studied at the London School of Economic, came to prominence in India after he was arrested in 1994 for the kidnapping of an American and three Britons. He was then linked to the Harkat-ul-Ansar. Five years later, he was taken from an Indian prison and released along with Jaish-e-Mohammed founder Masood Azhar and terrorist Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar in exchange for the passengers of an Indian Airlines flight that was hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar in Afghanistan, which was then controlled by the Taliban. At the height of tensions between India and Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks by the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Sheikh made hoax calls from a Pakistani prison to then president Asif Ali Zardari, pretending to be Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and threatening retaliatory actions for the carnage in Mumbai. The resultant tensions were defused only through a flurry of phone calls between leaders in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washington. Pakistan-US ties suffered a body blow when former US president Donald Trump cut off all security assistance to Pakistan through a New Year’s day tweet in 2018, accusing the country of “lies and deceit” despite getting $33 billion in aid. Though the US has leaned on Pakistan to get the Taliban to the negotiating table, the overall relationship has not been repaired. In recent weeks, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has spoken of efforts to reset his country’s relationship with the US, saying the Biden administration should engage with Pakistan and India on the basis of changes that have occurred in recent years. Qureshi even wrote a letter to Blinken, highlighting what he said was a “big shift” in Pakistan’s policies and looking forward to more talks on the issue. The reality is Pakistan’s powerful military has shown no signs of giving up its policy of “good and bad” terrorists, or cutting its ties with terrorists in the second camp such as Sheikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-dials-up-pressure-over-omar-sheikh-but-will-pak-end-its-ties-with-jihadis-101611908116352.html
29-01-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi wants security money to face 'enemy' within House||Lawmakers face threats of violence from an “enemy” within Congress, and more money is needed to protect them, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says, a startling acknowledgment of escalating internal tensions over safety since this month's Capitol attack by supporters of former President Donald Trump.The California Democrat's remarks Thursday came as the acting chief of the Capitol Police said separately that “vast improvements" are needed to protect the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, including permanent fencing. Such barricades have ringed the complex since the deadly Jan. 6 riot, but many lawmakers have long resisted giving the nation's symbol of democracy the look of a besieged compound, and leaders were noncommittal about the idea.Pelosi focused her comments on the anxiety and partisan frictions that have persisted in Congress since Trump supporters’ assault on the Capitol, which led to five deaths. She told reporters she thinks Congress will need to provide money “for more security for members, when the enemy is within the House of Representatives, a threat that members are concerned about.”Asked to clarify what she meant, Pelosi said, “It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.”She did not suggest how much money might be needed.Some lawmakers who voted for this month’s House impeachment of Trump have reported receiving threats, and initial moves to enhance safety procedures have taken on clear partisan undertones. Some Republicans have loudly objected to having to pass through newly installed metal detectors before entering the House chamber, while Pelosi has proposed fining lawmakers who bypass the devices.Pelosi did not say whom she meant by her reference to an “enemy" within the House, and a spokesperson provided no examples when asked.First-term Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who has expressed support for baseless QAnon conspiracy theories, has liked Facebook posts that advocated for violence against Democrats and the FBI. One post suggested shooting Pelosi in the head.Asked to comment, Greene sent a written statement accusing Democrats and journalists of attacking her because she is “a threat to their goal of Socialism" and supports Trump and conservative values.Earlier this month, the HuffPost website reported that Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., set off a newly installed metal detector while trying to enter the House chamber and was found to be carrying a concealed gun. Other Republicans have also talked about carrying firearms, which lawmakers are permitted to do, though not on the House or Senate floors.Since the attack, the Capitol grounds have been surrounded by barrier fences and patrolled by National Guard troops. Yogananda D. Pittman, acting chief of the Capitol Police, said in a statement that based on security assessments by her agency and others, some changes should be lasting.“In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol," said Pittman, whose agency provides security for Congress.Pelosi took no immediate stance about Pittman's proposal for permanent fencing. Drew Hammill, the speaker's spokesperson, said she would await a Capitol security review led by retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré “to understand what infrastructure changes are necessary.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took the same approach, telling reporters he would “defer to the experts.”Others panned the permanent fencing suggestion. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said she was “adamantly opposed” and had heard no justification for its need. First-term Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., a former Marine, said it would be wrong to turn the Capitol into a ”fortress."Pelosi met with Honoré but revealed little about what she learned. His review is expected to be completed no earlier than March 5, she said.Pelosi said he was examining ways to protect lawmakers “in terms of their service here, their service home, their transportation in between.” Lawmakers have already been told they can tap accounts they use for office expenses for some security steps, and Pelosi mentioned the possibility of air marshals but provided no detail.Prosecutors have charged more than 200 people for their roles in the riot, and others have been arrested after posting threats against members of Congress.The public is barred from carrying firearms on Capitol grounds. Members of Congress can keep guns in their offices or transport them on the campus if they’re unloaded and securely wrapped.On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a national terrorism bulletin warning of the possibility of more violence from people motivated by antigovernment sentiment after President Joe Biden’s election. The department did not cite any specific plots.A Senate trial on whether to punish Trump is set to begin next month, following his House impeachment on a charge of inciting the insurrection at the Capitol.Trump made incendiary remarks to a throng of supporters that day, urging them to march to the building. Lawmakers at the time were formally certifying Biden’s election victory, which Trump has repeatedly and falsely attributed to fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-wants-security-money-to-face-enemy-within-house-101611904071148.html

Correction: face mask to face mask given the medical restrictions. Discussing our visiting program," Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tweeted on Friday."China team-leader prof Wannian joking about some technical glitches. Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy zoom meetings," she said.Also read| Vaccine safe for people on blood thinners: ICMRThe group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak. It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.The WHO has sought to manage expectations. "There are no guarantees of answers," its emergency chief, Mike Ryan, said earlier this month.The mission has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research."It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources," Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday."No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China," she said.The origin of Covid-19 has been highly politicised.Also read| India witnesses sharp spike in new Covid-19 cases; 18,855 infections recordedThe investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former US President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric".China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a U.S. army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic."At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating," said Yang You, a 30-year-old Wuhan resident.

29-01-2021||World||World’s most vaccinated nation struggles with new coronavirus variants||With more than 30% of its population vaccinated, Israel leads the fight against Covid-19. Yet the emergence of more infectious variants is overwhelming its hospitals, showing the long road ahead for the rest of the world.After inoculating 82% of Israelis aged 60 and more, going into a nearly month-long lockdown and shutting down the national airport this week, Israel is indicating the end of the tunnel may be further away. That dents hopes for a rapid vaccine-driven global recovery after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge at Davos to make Israel a test case for how quickly Covid shots can help reopen economies.“We see a wave of infection that refuses to decline, apparently because of the mutation,” Health Minister Yuli Edelstein said at a press conference on Thursday.As the European Union fights to get adequate supplies of vaccines and the U.S. pushes to get more shots into arms, the Israeli situation is evidence of the difficulty of fighting a virus whose ability to quickly mutate keeps it a step ahead of efforts to contain it.The so-called British variant, 50% more infectious and possibly more virulent than the original virus, is to blame for the failure so far of the vaccination campaign and the lockdown to curb the spread, Israeli health ministry officials said.While the rate of infections in Israel has declined slightly to about 9% and people seriously or critically ill has stabilized at about 1,100, the number of patients on respirators has hit a record, Corona Commissioner Nachman Ash has said. More than 4,600 people in Israel have died from the virus, and more than 7,600 people are being diagnosed with it daily.Although the vaccine is believed to work against the British variant, the mutation’s more contagious nature means higher infections and hence more hospitalizations. The health ministry’s main goal now is to bring down the numbers of the seriously ill who are overwhelming hospital wards and exhausting medical teams.That said, the vaccine does seem to be working. People who have gone through the complete vaccination cycle made up 2% or less of those hospitalized, said Head of Public Health Sharon Alroy-Preis, adding that “they were definitely more protected.” Netanyahu has set a target of inoculating all Israelis older than 16 by the end of March.More time is needed to draw conclusions about the efficacy of the vaccine, Ran Balicer, head of the Covid-19 National Experts Team, said on Ynet television, adding that it would likely take another 10 days before the country sees critical cases decline, allowing the economy to begin to return to normal.“The faster we vaccinate and the faster the population goes to get vaccinated, the faster we can bring the spread under control,” said Hezi Levi, Health Ministry director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-coronavirus-variants-101611898396486.html
29-01-2021||World||Former Obama aide Rob Malley likely to be named as US envoy to Iran||A top national security aide to former President Barack Obama will be tapped as U.S. envoy for Iran, a senior State Department official said late Thursday.The senior official and several other people familiar with the decision said Secretary of State Antony Blinken will name Rob Malley as the Biden administration’s point person on Iran. The appointment is to be formally announced Friday. The official and the others were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.The official said Malley would head “a dedicated team” of “clear-eyed experts with a diversity of views.” The official added that Malley has “a track record of success negotiating constraints on Iran’s nuclear program” and that Blinken is confident he “will be able to do that once again.”Rumors of Malley’s potential new post have roiled the insular but highly polarized community of Iran experts in recent days.Malley currently runs the International Crisis Group. Iran hawks are aghast, believing Malley to be a key architect of the 2015 nuclear deal that former President Donald Trump withdrew from. They fear President Joe Biden wants to rejoin the Iran deal at any cost and may be willing to sacrifice the security of Israel and the Gulf Arab states to do so. The hawks regard Malley as less than fully supportive of Israel.Iran deal supporters have praised Malley for his expertise and have sprung to Malley's defense, praising him as a measured, longtime Middle East hand who has served multiple presidents and who has significant expertise in the region. Malley was one of several senior national security council officials involved in both the 2000 Camp David peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians and the 2014-15 Iran deal negotiations.Blinken, to whom Malley would directly report, has been coy about how he will pursue any engagement with Iran and has refused to discuss specific personnel he would want to lead such an effort. Others have noted that several previously named Biden administration officials — Wendy Sherman, the nominee for deputy secretary of state, and Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser — played major roles in the Iran negotiations.Like Biden, Blinken has said repeatedly that the U.S. would resume its obligations under the Iran deal by easing sanctions if Iran returns to full compliance with the accord. Only at such a point would the administration return to the deal or embark on an effort to lengthen and strengthen it.“If Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the (deal), the United States would do the same thing and then we would use that as a platform to build, with our allies and partners, what we call a longer and stronger agreement and to deal with a number of other issues that are deeply problematic in the relationship with Iran," Blinken said Wednesday. “But we are a long ways from that point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-obama-aide-rob-malley-likely-to-be-named-as-us-envoy-to-iran-101611891393169.html
29-01-2021||World||UK bans direct flights from UAE, shutting world's busiest international route||Britain is banning direct passenger flights to and from the United Arab Emirates from Friday, shutting down the world's busiest international airline route from Dubai to London.Britain said it was adding the United Arab Emirates, Burundi and Rwanda to its coronavirus travel ban list because of worries over the spread of a more contagious and potentially vaccine resistant COVID-19 variant first identified in South Africa."This means people who have been in or transited through these countries will be denied entry, except British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights who must self-isolate for ten days at home," U.K. Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter on Thursday.Emirates and Etihad Airways said on their websites they would suspend all U.K. passenger flights from 1300 GMT on Friday when the ban takes effect.The U.K. transport department advised British nationals currently in the United Arab Emirates to make use of indirect commercial airline routes if they wished to return to Britain.Dubai to London was the world's busiest international route in January with 190,365 scheduled seats over the month, according to airline data provider OAG.Emirates and Etihad normally carry large numbers of passengers connecting from Britain to destinations like Australia through their airport hubs, meaning the decision to cancel those flights will have far-reaching implications.The Australian government said it will add more charter flights from Britain if needed as a result of the Emirates and Etihad cancellations.Eran Ben-Avraham, an Australian stranded in Britain due to strict limits on the number of arrivals in Australia, said his options for getting home were continually shrinking."At the moment it is only giving us three options of flying Qatar, ANA or Singapore Airlines," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "Every day it is making it more difficult to get home. The flights back are anywhere from like 4,000 pounds ($5,487)."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-bans-direct-flights-from-uae-shutting-world-s-busiest-international-route-101611891110166.html
29-01-2021||World||Donald Trump team hires 2 ex-prosecutors with ethics experience||Donald Trump has added two more former federal prosecutors from South Carolina to his impeachment legal team, according to one of the lawyers.“It is confirmed,” Greg Harris, an attorney in the capital city of Columbia, told The Associated Press on Thursday when asked if he and former acting U.S. Attorney Johnny Gasser had been added to the team that will craft a defense for Trump's unprecedented second impeachment trial, set for the week of Feb. 8.Harris is a former county and federal prosecutor with expertise in white-collar cases. He's currently in private practice with Gasser, who has also been a prosecutor at the local and federal levels, serving as South Carolina's acting U.S. Attorney for more than a year. He went into private practice with Harris.Both attorneys have experience in public corruption cases, with both representing Republican state Rep. Rick Quinn on charges of misconduct in office. Quinn ultimately resigned in a 2017 deal that resulted in the termination of conspiracy and illegal lobbying charges against his father, GOP consultant Richard Quinn — who had at times counted former President Ronald Reagan and Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham among his clients.They also both represented South Carolina Lt. Gov. Ken Ard, who resigned in 2012 after pleading guilty to ethics violations.Harris and Gasser join a team that includes Butch Bowers, a noted South Carolina ethics and elections lawyer called an “anchor tenant” of the team by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.It's in part on the advice of Graham that Trump is turning to the South Carolina team after other legal allies passed on the case. It’s a notable departure from his 2020 impeachment trial, when Trump had a stable of nationally known attorneys, including Alan Dershowitz, Jay Sekulow and Kenneth Starr.Bowers has years of experience representing elected officials and political candidates, including former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford. Bowers represented Sanford when state lawmakers mulled impeaching the governor after revelations Sanford had disappeared from the state, leaving no chain of command for five days, to see his lover in Argentina in 2009. The impeachment effort never made it out of committee.Bowers also successfully guided another former governor, Nikki Haley, through an investigation into whether she had violated state ethics law.Another Trump hire, Deborah Barbier, spent more than a decade as a federal prosecutor and now, in private practice, specializes in white-collar defense. She also represented Richard Quinn in his illegal lobbying case.The House officially transmitted the article of impeachment — accusing Trump of inciting the mob that rampaged through the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 — to the Senate on Monday. The trial could have officially begun Tuesday, but Republicans pushed to delay it to give Trump a chance to organize his legal team and prepare a defense.If convicted, Trump could be barred from holding public office again, ending any hopes of mounting another White House bid in 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-team-hires-2-ex-prosecutors-with-ethics-experience-101611888368302.html
29-01-2021||World||United States 'outraged' as Pak court upholds acquittal in Daniel Pearl murder||The White House said it was "outraged" Thursday after Pakistan's top court upheld the acquittal and ordered the release of the militant convicted of masterminding the 2002 beheading of US journalist Daniel Pearl.Joe Biden's administration is "outraged by the Pakistani Supreme Court's decision," his chief spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters, underscoring the uneasy alliance between Washington and Islamabad, which has fractured many times over Islamist militancy.She called the ruling "an affront to terrorism victims everywhere" and demanded the Pakistani government "review its legal options."The White House statement came after Pakistan's Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been convicted of masterminding the brutal murder of Pearl, the South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal, by jihadists.Pearl's killing -- which was filmed -- caused international shock and outrage."The court has come out to say that there is no offense that he (Sheikh) has committed in this case," Mahmood Sheikh, who represented the accused, told AFP.A court order said that Sheikh along with three accomplices connected to the case should "be released forthwith," though it was not clear when that would happen.Pearl was researching a story about Islamist militants when he was abducted in the southern port megacity of Karachi in Sindh province in January 2002.Nearly a month later, after a string of ransom demands, a graphic video showing his decapitation was given to officials.Sheikh, a British-born jihadist who once studied at the London School of Economics and had been involved in previous kidnappings of foreigners, was arrested days after Pearl's abduction.He was later sentenced to death by hanging after telling a Karachi court that Pearl had already been killed days before the gruesome video of the journalist's beheading had been released.Pearl's family on Thursday called the decision to free him "a travesty of justice" and pleaded for US intervention in the case."The release of these killers puts in danger journalists everywhere and the people of Pakistan. We urge the US government to take all necessary actions under the law to correct this injustice," the family said in a statement.'Impunity' Reporters Without Borders also slammed the ruling, saying that it "will remain as a symbol of the absolute impunity surrounding crimes of violence against journalists in this country."The ruling follows an outcry last year when a lower court acquitted the 47-year-old Sheikh of murder and reduced his conviction to a lesser charge of kidnapping -- overturning his death sentence and ordering him freed after almost two decades in prison.That sparked a series of petitions, including from Pearl's family, but the Supreme Court rejected them in the split decision Thursday, upholding the acquittal.For years Sheikh had denied personally killing Pearl, but the top court heard earlier this week that he had admitted in a handwritten letter from 2019 that was sent to a provincial court to having had a "minor role" .Lawyers for Pearl's family have argued that Sheikh played a crucial role in organizing the abduction and detention of the journalist, before ordering his captors to kill him.Defense lawyers, however, say he was a scapegoat and sentenced on insufficient evidence.Sheikh and the three other men have been held under emergency orders by the Sindh provincial government, which says they are a danger to the public.Late Thursday the Sindh government said it would file a review petition against the Supreme Court verdict.It was not clear how long that might take, but Pakistan's attorney general said in a statement that the federal government "is extending full support" to the provincial government in the matter.- US 'ready to take custody' -Last month the then-US acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Washington "stands ready to take custody of Omar Sheikh to stand trial here."Psaki on Thursday said the United States recognizes "past Pakistani actions to try to hold Mr Pearl's murderers accountable and we do note that as of right now Omar Sheikh remains in detention.""We call on the Pakistani government to expeditiously review its legal options, including allowing the United States to prosecute Sheikh for the brutal murder of an American citizen and journalist."In January 2011, following an investigation into the killing, a report released by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University made chilling revelations, claiming that the wrong men were convicted for Pearl's murder.The investigation claimed the reporter was murdered by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks.The report also provided granular details about Sheikh's alleged role in orchestrating the kidnapping of Pearl.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-outraged-as-pak-court-upholds-acquittal-in-daniel-pearl-murder-101611888118546.html
29-01-2021||World||United States dismisses China's war threat against Taiwan||Washington [US], January 29 (ANI): A senior Pentagon official on Thursday dismissed China's war threat against Taiwan and reaffirmed Washington's commitment to supporting Taipei's defense capability under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).The TRA, which was passed when Washington switched its diplomatic recognition to China in 1979, outlines America's commitment to defend Taiwan, the South China Morning Post reported."Nothing has changed in relation to our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act. This is something that has been supported in a bipartisan way for decades. The department of defence will continue that same support. We have an obligation to assist Taiwan with their self-defense and that will continue," Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters.This comes after Chinese defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian threatened that "Taiwan secession means war," adding that recent military drills by the People's Liberation Army in the Taiwan region were aimed at "provocations" by the latter.Earlier this month, the United States expressed plans to strengthen ties with Taiwan under the Biden administration. Taipei had later thanked the US for its commitment of "rock-solid support" against China's coercion."We sincerely thank US State Department for its rock-solid support of democratic of Taiwan in the face of Beijing's ongoing coercion. Based on shared values and interests, we are committed to our partnership with the United States in furthering peace and stability in the Indo Pacific," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan said in a tweet amid Beijing's growing belligerence.Hours after several Chinese warplanes intruded into Taiwan's air defence identification zone, the US noted with concern the pattern of ongoing Chinese attempts to intimidate its neighbours and urged Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taipei.The US State Department last week had said that Washington will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in the Indo-Pacific region.The flight by the Chinese bombers and fighters last week came just days after Joe Biden assumed the US presidency. Taiwan Defense Ministry said that Taiwan's Air Force scrambled fighter jets as 13 Chinese warplanes intruded into Taiwan's southwest air defence identification zone (ADIZ), Focus Taiwan reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-dismisses-china-s-war-threat-against-taiwan-101611887590295.html
29-01-2021||World||India's vaccine production capacity is best asset world has today, says UN chief||Calling for India to play a major role in global vaccination campaign, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday termed the vaccine production capacity of India as the "best asset" that the world has today.Addressing reporters here, the UN chief said, "I know that in India there is a very high level of production of Indian developed vaccines. We are in contact with Indian institutions for that. We strongly hope that India will have all the instruments that are necessary to play a major role in making sure that a global vaccination is campaign is made possible.""I think that the production capacity of India is the best asset that the world has today. I hope the world understands that it must be fully used," he added.On the need to democratize access to medicines, Guterres said, "I would say a very important element on the democratization of access to medicines all over the world. I appealed once again today for the licenses to be made available in order for companies around the world to be able to produce some of the vaccines that already exist."UN chief's statement comes as India has gifted over 55 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccine to neighbouring countries.Addressing a weekly briefing, External Affairs Ministry (EAM) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said India plans to gift vaccines doses to Oman, CARICOM countries, Nicaragua, Pacific Island states.Srivastava said New Delhi plans to supply 1 crore or 10 million vaccine doses to Africa and 10 lakh to United Nations health workers under GAVI's (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) COVAX facility."There is interest in many countries to access vaccine from India. In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement that India sees international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic. We have played the role of the first responder in the neighbourhood," Srivastava said."From 20th January 2021 onward, we have gifted over 55 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines to our neighbouring countries and in the extended neighbourhood--1.5 lakh to Bhutan, 1 lakh to Maldives, Mauritius and Bahrain, 10 lakhs to Nepal, 20 lakhs to Bangladesh, 15 lakhs to Myanmar, 50,000 to Seychelles, 5 lakh to Sri Lanka. In the coming days, We plan to gift further quantity to Oman that is of 1 lakh doses, 5 lakh doses to CARICOM countries. 2 lakh to Nicaragua, 2 lakh doses to the Pacific island state," he added.India, Srivastava said, plans to commercially export coronavirus vaccine to Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Canada, Mongolia and other countries."On a commercial level, the export has taken place for Brazil Morocco and Bangladesh. Further supplies to countries on commercial bases are likely to take place to Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Canada Mongolia and other countries. We plan to supply 1 crore or 10 million vaccine doses to Africa and 10 lakh to United Nations health workers under GAVI," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-vaccine-production-capacity-is-best-asset-world-has-today-says-un-chief-101611886527685.html
29-01-2021||World||WHO-led team in Wuhan probing Covid-19 origins to begin field work||A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic was due to meet with Chinese scientists on Friday, and plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals in Wuhan, the WHO said.On Thursday, the team completed two weeks of quarantine following its arrival in China, moving to a lakeside hotel in the central Chinese city where the deadly virus emerged in late 2019.The group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak. It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.The mission has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research."It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources," Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday."No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China," she said.The origin of Covid-19 has been highly politicised.The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being "China-centric".China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a U.S. army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic."At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating," said Yang You, a 30-year-old Wuhan resident. "If it could be traced to the source clearly, in my opinion, it could clear either China's or Wuhan's name."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wholed-team-in-wuhan-probing-covid-19-origins-to-begin-field-work-101611884929356.html
29-01-2021||World||Biden signs healthcare executive orders, says undoing damage Trump has done||US President Joe Biden has signed two healthcare executive orders which he said were to undo the damage done by his predecessor Donald Trump.The first executive order was about restoring the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid to the way they were before Trump became president.Biden alleged that under his predecessor, they were more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items.The second executive order was about protecting women's health at home and abroad.“It reinstates the changes that were made to Title 10 and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable healthcare as it relates to their reproductive rights,” he told reporters at the White House on Thursday.“It has been a busy week, and I have signed executive orders tackling COVID-19, the economic and climate crises, as well as advancing racial equity. But, today, I'm about to sign two executive orders that are basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done,” Biden said.“There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became President, which by fiat he changed -- made more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items: the Affordable Care Act or Medicaid,” he said.Responding to a question, Biden said that the first thing his administration has got to do is get the COVID-19 package passed by Congress.The White House said that the Biden-Harris administration will re-open enrolment to the Health Insurance Marketplace, take additional steps to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and protect women’s health.“These actions demonstrate a strong commitment by the Biden-Harris administration to protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, meet the healthcare needs created by the pandemic, reduce healthcare costs, protect access to reproductive healthcare and make our health care system easier to navigate and more equitable,” it said.“For Biden, this is personal. He believes that every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care,” the White House said.Because of the Affordable Care Act, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition.Roughly 20 million additional Americans obtained the security that comes with health insurance, and young people transitioning from school to a job can stay covered by their parents’ plan until age 26, it said.Through his second presidential order, Biden aimed at protecting and expanding access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare.The memorandum reflects the policy of the Biden-Harris administration to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States, as well as globally.Like memoranda issued by previous presidents Bill Clinton and president Barack Obama before him, it immediately rescinds the global gag rule, also referred to as the Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-profits that provide abortion counselling or referrals from receiving US funding.In recognition of the additional work necessary to protect access to reproductive healthcare, President Biden’s memorandum also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action to consider whether to rescind regulations under its Title X family planning programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-signs-healthcare-executive-orders-says-undoing-damage-trump-has-done-101611882027450.html
29-01-2021||World||UN chief calls vaccine distribution 'emergency'||The United Nations chief is calling the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines a “global emergency,” saying more that 70 million doses have been administered but fewer than 20,000 vaccinations were on the African continent.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday that while every country has the duty to protect its own people “no country can afford to neglect the rest of the world.”He called “vaccine nationalism” both a moral and economic failure and said: “We need a global vaccination campaign to deal with a global pandemic.”If Covid-19 continues circulating in the global south, it will inevitably mutate, Guterres told a news conference. New variants could be more deadly and more transmissible and threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines, “prolonging or risking to prolong the pandemic significantly.”Research by the International Chamber of Commerce showed that without support to the developing world, “this crisis could cost the global economy up to $9.2 trillion –- almost half, including in the wealthiest countries,’’ the secretary-general said.___THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:The U.S. reports first case of South Africa virus variant found in South Carolina. More than 90 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine will be produced in Japan. No respite for UK hospital workers facing record number of patients. EXPLAINER: Why it’s hard to make vaccines and boost supplies.___HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:HARTFORD, Conn. - Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday he’s considering easing some Covid-19 restrictions in Connecticut, including for places of worship, possibly as early as next week.Under the state’s rules, indoor church services are currently limited to 50% capacity, capped at 100 people. Worshipers must wear masks and social distance.“Let’s lift that numerical cap. Let’s do it now,” the Democrat told reporters during his Covid-19 briefing. “But if you haven’t been vaccinated, probably it’s better stay home for a little bit longer if you are of a certain age.”As of Thursday, about 35% of state residents 75 years and older have received the vaccine. There have been a total of 364,255 vaccinations, which includes 299,876 first doses and 64.379 second doses administered.The Connecticut Catholic Conference welcomed the news that Lamont planned to ease the state’s restrictions, saying in a written statement that multiple steps have already been taken by clergy and parishioners to reduce the spread of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.___WASHINGTON — The Pentagon says it is reviewing a request from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for military troops to help set up vaccination sites, as the Biden administration vows to speed up deliveries of the Covid-19 vaccine over the next few weeks.Pentagon chief spokesman John Kirby told reporters Thursday that the military will help as aggressively as it can, and it will likely require a mix of active-duty troops as well as National Guard and Reserves to meet FEMA’s needs.According to a draft of the request, FEMA wants the military to set up 100 teams that will help operate vaccination centers across the country. Kirby and other Pentagon officials said Thursday that talks are still ongoing to determine how many service members it will take and who they will be.FEMA initially asked for as many as 10,000 troops, but defense officials say it may not require that many.Since a key job will be to actually give shots to the public, officials have to determine what military personnel can do that without taking key capabilities from other units, including some that may be deployed. In addition, many health care professionals who are in the Guard and Reserves are already working at critical medical jobs, and may not be available for the vaccination centers.___SANTA FE, N.M. -- New Mexico health officials have reported an additional 678 confirmed Covid-19 infections, bringing the statewide total since the pandemic began to nearly 172,000 cases.The latest figures include 20 inmates at three of the state’s prisons. Overall, confirmed cases and related deaths have been trending downward along with hospitalizations.Meanwhile, vaccinations are underway for the oldest New Mexicans as well as those who have pre-existing conditions that put them at higher risk.More than 86% of the 276,850 doses that have been shipped to New Mexico have been administered. More than 530,000 residents have registered to receive the vaccine.___BATON ROUGE, La — Louisiana’s work to vaccinate nursing home residents and employees against Covid-19 is moving slowly.Data released Thursday from the state’s chief public health adviser indicates fewer than one-third of the doses set aside for the effort have been used and a slim percentage of workers at the facilities showing interest so far.Dr. Joe Kanter says 93,600 Moderna vaccine doses have been allocated to a program administered by CVS and Walgreens to vaccinate people who live and work at long-term care facilities. Only 28,000 have reached arms.Kanter says 69% of residents at the facilities that have been visited have wanted the immunization while only 26% of the staff have been interested.____LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine last week, after spending several days assisting health care workers at a large coronavirus vaccination center at Dodger Stadium.The 49-year-old mayor made clear in December that he would wait his turn to receive the vaccine, echoing county policy that nursing home residents, people 65 and older and medical workers will be first in line.However, his office said medical personnel strongly recommended he be vaccinated because he was interacting with hundreds of people daily at the stadium while assisting health care workers.___SACRAMENTO -- California reported its second-highest number of Covid-19 deaths — while the rates of new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations continue to drop.The state Department of Public Health says the total of 737 new deaths Thursday is second to the record 764 reported Jan. 22.California’s death toll since the start of the pandemic rose to nearly 39,000, while total cases topped 3.1 million. The number of people in the hospital with Covid-19 has slipped more than 20% in two weeks.The positivity rate for people being tested has been falling for weeks, which means fewer people will end up in hospitals.___TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida’s program to vaccinate residents and staff members at long-term care facilities is complete, the state’s director of emergency management told lawmakers Thursday, freeing up resources — and possibly more vaccines — for the state’s broader inoculation strategy against the coronavirus.During an appearance before a legislative select committee on the response to the pandemic, the director, Jared Moskowitz, echoed Gov. Ron DeSantis’s concern over inadequate deliveries of life-saving vaccines to meet the intense demand.Moskowitz said the bottleneck in vaccinations is not because of a lack of a distribution infrastructure. The onus, he said, is on the federal officials to speed up the delivery of vaccines to states like his.Moskowitz conceded that some areas of the state, particularly communities of color, may not be getting equal access to vaccines. He also acknowledged that the state would have to do better on that score — particularly on the public relations front as DeSantis travels to the state to announce vaccination center openings in communities mostly populated by affluent white Floridians.___ALBANY, N.Y. — New York may have undercounted Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents by thousands. That’s according to a new report from the state attorney general that dealt a blow to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s claims that his state is doing better than others in protecting its most vulnerable.Attorney General Letitia James has, for months, been examining discrepancies between the number of deaths being reported by the state’s Department of Health, and the number of deaths reported by the homes themselves. Her investigators looked at a sample of 62 of the state’s roughly 600 nursing homes. They reported 1,914 deaths of residents from Covid-19, while the state Department of Health logged only 1,229 deaths at those same facilitiesThe report backed up the findings of an Associated Press investigation last year. The official 8,711 nursing home toll could actually be more than 13,000, highest in the nation.___LAS VEGAS — The fifth-largest school district in the U.S. has announced its youngest students are scheduled to return to in-person education on March 1 on a voluntary basis, with employees returning a week earlier.The Clark County School District, which includes Las Vegas-area schools, said in a statement Wednesday that prekindergarten through third grade students whose parents complete a questionnaire will return to a hybrid education model.School Board President Linda Cavazos said there are concerns about the return to school plan that she hopes will be resolved as more details are announced.___MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has only shared a photo of himself since testing positive for the coronavirus.His aides say little more than the leader is in good spirits, experiencing mild symptoms and working. But the country has grown accustomed to waking to the 67-year-old López Obrador as he conducts marathon news conferences each morning.His public absence since the weekend announcement of his illness is spurring calls that the president who touts the transparency of his administration to share more about his health.López Obrador played down the coronavirus threat early, has rarely been seen wearing a mask in public and at times contradicted his own health officials’ recommendations. The president is a heart attack survivor who has high blood pressure.Michelle Varela, an economist, says she hopes after his illness, López Obrador will take precautions to set an example. Mexico has 1.8 million confirmed cases and more than 153,000 confirmed deaths, the fourth-highest death toll in the world.___MADRID — Spain’s coronavirus infection rate dropped slightly for the first time in nearly a month, while the influx of patients into intensive care units keeps rising.Spain’s Health Ministry logged 34,899 new infections and 515 confirmed deaths Thursday, bringing the total tally to 2.6 million cases and 57,800 confirmed deaths.The 14-day average cases per 100,000 inhabitants dropped slightly from 899 cases on Wednesday to 889 on Thursday.Nearly one in four hospital beds are currently occupied by Covid-19 patients. The situation is far worse in intensive care units. Although the official occupation rate by coronavirus patients there is 42%, the share includes many ICU beds that have been installed temporarily in surgery rooms and other hospital areas.___COLUMBIA, S.C. — A new coronavirus variant identified in South Africa has been found in the United States for the first time.South Carolina officials say two such cases have been diagnosed in the state. The two cases don’t appear to be connected, nor do the people have a history of recent travel, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.Viruses mutate constantly and many variants of the coronavirus are circulating around the globe. However, scientists are primarily concerned with three that appear to spread more easily.Other variants first reported in the United Kingdom and Brazil were already confirmed in the U.S. Researchers predicted it was only a matter of time before the variant identified in South Africa reached the United States as well.President Joe Biden on Monday reinstated Covid-19 travel restrictions on most non-U.S. travelers from Brazil, the U.K. and South Africa. The CDC is currently recommending Americans not travel.___AMSTERDAM — The European Medicines Agency has updated its recommendation for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, clarifying that the second dose should be given three weeks after the first dose.That’s in line with what the drugmakers and some other regulatory agencies recommend.In a statement on Thursday, the EU’s medicines regulator says there is no data on the efficacy of the vaccine when the second dose is given after 21 days. Previously, the EMA said the time between administering the two doses of Pfizer’s vaccine should be “at least 21 days.”The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine be given after 21 days, in line with what the company itself recommends based on its research.In Britain, officials have decided to delay giving people the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine for 12 weeks so that as many people as possible can get at least some protection from one shot. Numerous scientists have questioned the U.K. decision and called for an evaluation to investigate the effects of prolonging the gap between doses.___ROME — Prosecutors have traveled to Rome again to question the health minister and others as part of an investigation into any possible criminal charges for Italy’s coronavirus death toll.The Bergamo criminal investigation has expanded amid questions about Italy’s preparedness ahead of the pandemic. Bergamo became Italy’s Covid-19 epicenter, the first in Europe, registering a 571% excess mortality rate in March compared to the average in the previous five years.A scandal over a spiked World Health Organization report into Italy’s response has revealed the country’s influenza pandemic plan hadn’t been updated since 2006. Bergamo investigators say they are looking more into why the 2006 plan was never put into effect, contributing to what the WHO called Italy’s chaotic response to the thousands of sick who overwhelmed Lombardy’s hospitals.In June, Bergamo prosecutors questioned Premier Giuseppe Conte, Health Minister Roberto Speranza and other top officials about the delayed lockdown in the two Bergamo towns where early infections were reported.___TOKYO — More than 90 million doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine will be produced in Japan by a Japanese pharmaceutical company through a licensing agreement.It will cover three quarters of the supply the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company has pledged to provide to the country, officials said Thursday. Many believe vaccination would be key for Japan to hold the postponed Olympics this summer, but prospects are still uncertain in a country known for cautious decision-making process and a public wary of vaccines.The plan is part of 120 million doses that AstraZeneca promised to supply to Japan under a deal the two sides already agreed upon, says Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, adding: “It is very important to establish vaccine production system in the country.”AstraZeneca has signed a licensing agreement with JCR Pharmaceuticals, based in the Hyogo prefecture in western Japan, the companies say.The announcement comes as officials are preparing for inoculation in late February, when Japan’s health ministry is expected to approve the Pfizer vaccine. Japan is also getting a vaccine supply from Moderna. Japan says it has secured vaccines from the three suppliers for more than the population of 127 million.Of the 120 million doses AstraZeneca will provide, the remaining 30 million are expected to be imported by March, officials say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-calls-vaccine-distribution-emergency-101611880484407.html
29-01-2021||World||UK says upholding 'freedom and autonomy' with new Hong Kong visas||Britain's government on Friday vowed to stand by the people of its former colony Hong Kong against a Chinese crackdown as it prepared to launch a new visa scheme potentially benefiting millions.Holders of British National (Overseas) status -- a legacy of UK rule over Hong Kong up to 1997 -- will from Sunday be able to apply to live and work in the UK for up to five years, and eventually seek citizenship.Before the change, BN(O) passport holders have had only limited rights to visit the UK for up to six months, and not to work or settle.The UK says it is acting in response to a National Security Law imposed by China last year which has devastated Hong Kong's democracy movement and shredded freedoms meant to last 50 years under the 1997 handover accord."I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement."In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy -- values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear."Any Hong Kong resident born before 1997 is eligible for BN(O) status. The new visa path opens up entry to the UK to an estimated 2.9 million adults in Hong Kong and another 2.3 million of their dependants.In practice, London projects that up to 322,400 of Hong Kong's 7.5 million population will take up the visa over five years, benefiting the UK economy by up to £2.9 billion ($4 billion).The new pathway will not come cheap.A five-year visa will cost a relatively moderate £250 per person. But a mandatory surcharge to access Britain's state-run health service will run to £3,120 per adult, and £2,350 for those under 18.Shorter, cheaper visas for 30 months will also be available."We have been clear we won't look the other way when it comes to Hong Kong. We will live up to our historic responsibility to its people," Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said."China's imposition of the National Security Law in Hong Kong constitutes a clear and serious breach of the (pre-handover) Sino-British Joint Declaration contrary to international law."The security law was imposed on Hong Kong last June in response to 2019 protests, targeting acts Beijing deems to be secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.Mass arrests of pro-democracy figures have followed. Some have fled Hong Kong for the West, including to Britain.Between July and this month, about 7,000 people with BN(O) status and their dependants have already been given exceptional leave to live in the UK.China, furious at Britain's new visa pathway, has in turn accused London of flouting the handover agreement and demanded Western countries stay out of Hong Kong's affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-upholding-freedom-and-autonomy-with-new-hong-kong-visas-101611880531371.html

He didn’t comment further on the GAO report.The company was expected to have doses available in the single-digit millions by the second half of February, Moncef Slaoui, the top scientific adviser to the Trump administration’s vaccine development effort, said earlier this month.“We’re trying to make that number get as close to a double digit number as possible,” Slaoui said at a briefing at the time.J&J is expected to report clinical-trial data on the experimental shot’s efficacy by early next week, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told Bloomberg in a Jan. 26 interview. The company aims to have seven manufacturing facilities running by the end of the second quarter to ramp up supply, Wolk said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jj-covid-vaccine-supply-to-start-at-2-million-doses-gao-says-101611879026369.html

The slow inoculation campaign is weighing on the country’s economic prospects as a second wave of the virus strains the public health system, forcing authorities to reimpose restrictions on commerce and mobility.With the rise in virus cases, calls for another round of cash handouts to poor Brazilians have been growing, leading the Economy Ministry to start working on alternatives to finance the additional spending.Bolsonaro repeated, however, that the government’s ability to take on debt to provide more emergency payments “has reached its limit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-says-covid-will-last-forever-isolation-leads-nowhere-101611879100552.html
29-01-2021||World||Novavax Covid vaccine highly effective, but not against South Africa variant||US biotech firm Novavax said Thursday its two-shot Covid-19 vaccine showed an overall efficacy of 89.3 percent in a major Phase 3 clinical trial in Britain, and remained highly effective against a variant first identified there.But the positive news was offset by other results that showed it offered significantly less protection against a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus first identified in South Africa, which is spreading rapidly around the world.Novavax said it began working on new vaccines against emerging strains in early January and expects to select ideal candidates in the coming days, then begin clinical testing in the second quarter of the year."NVX-CoV2373 has the potential to play an important role in solving this global public health crisis," said the company's president and CEO Stanley Erck, using Novavax's name for the vaccine."We look forward to continuing to work with our partners, collaborators, investigators and regulators around the world to make the vaccine available as quickly as possible."British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the results were "good news.""Our medicines regulator will now assess the vaccine, which will be made in Teesside. If approved, we have 60m doses on order," he added.The vaccine was one of six candidates backed by a US government project formerly known as Operation Warp Speed, which has provided the company $1.75 billion. It's also being tested in a trial in the US and Mexico, which has recruited 16,000 of 30,000 participants.Unlike the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, which deliver the genetic instructions to make a protein of the virus to human cells, the Novavax shot injects the same molecules directly into the body to evoke an immune response.- S. Africa variant reinfection worry -The British trial involved 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, including 27 percent who were over the age of 65.The first interim analysis was based on 62 cases, of which 56 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus six cases among people who received NVX-CoV2373.The company's preliminary analysis indicated the variant first identified in Britain, B.1.1.7, was detected in more than 50 percent of the confirmed cases.Efficacy by strain was calculated at 95.6 percent against the original Covid strain, and 85.6 percent against B.1.1.7.But the efficacy was much lower in a smaller, mid-stage trial conducted in South Africa.This study enrolled just over 4,400 patients from September to mid-January, during which time the B.1.351 variant, which contains critical mutations along the virus' spike protein, was spreading rapidly through the country.Overall efficacy was 49.4 percent in this trial, but the figure rose to 60 percent among the 94 percent of trial participants who were HIV-negative.Worryingly, Novavax said about a third of participants in the South Africa trial had been previously infected with the original form of the virus, while the subsequent infections during the study were largely from the variant.The studies are the first to assess how vaccines performed against both the UK and South Africa variants in the real world.Pfizer and Moderna have previously said their vaccines remain effective against the variants, but their studies were based on lab research.The US said Thursday it had found its first two cases of the B.1.351 variant on American soil, leading to concern it could reignite the national infection rate, which is currently in decline.Novavax's announcement puts pressure on another vaccine maker, Johnson & Johnson, which is expected to announce its phase 3 trial results next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-covid-vaccine-highly-effective-but-not-against-south-africa-variant-101611877476414.html
29-01-2021||World||Biden opens sign-up window for uninsured as Covid-19 rages||President Joe Biden on Thursday ordered government health insurance markets to reopen for a special sign-up window, offering uninsured Americans a haven as the spread of Covid-19 remains dangerously high and vaccines aren't yet widely available.Biden signed an executive order directing the HealthCare.gov insurance markets to take new applications for subsidized benefits, something Donald Trump's administration had refused to do. He also instructed his administration to consider reversing other Trump health care policies, including curbs on abortion counseling and the imposition of work requirements for low-income people getting Medicaid.“There’s nothing new that we’re doing here other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president,” Biden said as he signed the directives in the Oval Office. He declared he was reversing “my predecessor’s attack on women’s health."The actions were only the first steps by Biden, who has promised to build out former President Barack Obama’s health care law to achieve a goal of coverage for all. While Biden rejects the idea of a government-run system that Sen. Bernie Sanders has pushed for in his “Medicare for All” proposal, his more centrist approach will require congressional buy-in. But opposition to “Obamacare” runs deep among Republicans.The most concrete short-term impact of Biden's orders will come from reopening HealthCare.gov insurance markets as coverage has shrunk in the economic turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic. That's an executive action and no legislation is required.The new “special enrollment period” will begin Feb. 15 and run through May 15, the White House said. It will be coupled with a promotional campaign and a call for states that run their own insurance markets to match the federal sign-up opportunity.The Biden administration has ample resources for marketing, said Karen Pollitz, a health insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation estimates that the Trump administration left unspent about $1.2 billion in user fees collected from insurers to help pay for running the marketplaces.“The reason it wasn’t spent is the Trump administration spent its time in office cutting services that support consumer enrollment,” Pollitz said. “All the while the user fee revenue was coming in, (but) they were not allowed to spend it on anything other than marketplace operations.”Created under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, the marketplaces offer taxpayer-subsidized coverage regardless of a person’s medical history or preexisting conditions, including Covid-19.Biden also ordered the immediate reversal of a federal policy that bars taxpayer funding for international health care nonprofits that promote or provide abortions. Known as the Mexico City Policy, it can be switched on or off depending on whether Democrats or Republicans control the White House. Abortion rights supporters call it the “global gag rule.”The new president's signing of a growing stack of executive orders is bringing increasing criticism from Republicans and also from some of his allies, especially after Democrats lambasted Trump when he acted on his own. Biden's team says he's looking to Congress for major legislation but feels that certain actions are crucial in the meantime.Some directives he issued Thursday could take months to carry out.He instructed the Department of Health and Human Services to consider rescinding Trump regulations that bar federally funded family planning clinics from referring women for abortions.HHS will also reexamine a Trump administration policy that allows states to impose work requirements as a condition for low-income people to get Medicaid health insurance. Work requirements have been blocked by federal courts, which found that they led to thousands of people losing coverage and violated Medicaid's legal charge to provide medical services. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the issue.And Biden directed HHS to review Trump policies that could undermine protections for people with health problems, such as a rule that facilitated the sale of short-term health insurance plans that don't have to cover preexisting medical conditions.Such changes cannot happen overnight. Rescinding a federal regulation requires a new regulation, which has to follow an established legal process that involves considering different sides of an issue.Former Trump health policy adviser Brian Blase said the Biden administration has to take care it doesn't throw out some policies intended to help solidly middle-class people who don't qualify for financial assistance under Obama's law.“Obamacare plans are generally only attractive to people who receive large subsidies to buy them,” said Blase. He cited a Trump policy that allows employers to provide tax-free money for workers to buy individual plans.The abortion-related actions brought Biden immediate praise from women's rights groups, as well as condemnation from social and religious conservatives. Under President Trump, abortion opponents had free rein to try to rewrite federal policy, but now the political pendulum has swung back. Trump's abortion counseling restrictions led Planned Parenthood affiliates to leave the federal family planning program.Biden campaigned on repealing longstanding federal prohibitions against taxpayer funding for most abortions, but that was not part of Thursday's orders. A change of that magnitude to a group of laws known as the Hyde Amendment would require congressional approval.Biden's nominee for health secretary, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, but the White House said that will not stop health agencies from immediately going to work on the president's directives.The idea of reopening Obamacare's health insurance markets in the pandemic has had broad support from consumer, medical, and business organizations. The main insurer trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans, applauded Biden's move.As the number of uninsured Americans grew because of job losses in the pandemic, the Trump administration resisted calls to reopen HealthCare.gov. Failure to repeal and replace Obamacare was one of the former president's most bitter disappointments. His administration continued trying to find ways to limit the program or unravel it entirely. A Supreme Court decision on Trump’s final legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act is expected this year.Experts agree that number of uninsured people has risen because of layoffs in the coronavirus economy, but authoritative estimates await government studies due later this year. While some estimates cite 5 million to 10 million newly uninsured people, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says its analysis suggests a smaller number.Nonetheless, the CBO projects that nearly 32 million Americans are uninsured and of those, about 2 in 3 are eligible for some kind of subsidized coverage.The Obama-era health care law covers more than 23 million people through a mix of subsidized private insurance sold in all states, and expanded Medicaid adopted by 38 states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-opens-sign-up-window-for-uninsured-as-covid-19-rages-101611877522369.html

He was also carrying two duffel bags.Dr Narumanchi had visited the CMG office a week before and applied for a volunteer’s position. Other than his recent visit to the office, there did not appear to be any relationship or other contact between Dr Narumanchi and Dr Dodson, police said.He was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and had been told that had just weeks to live, Greenwalt told reporters on Wednesday.“So we feel like his terminal cancer probably played a large part in whatever it was that occurred in his life and what was||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-shoots-doctor-kills-self-101611863306405.html

He said the budget presentation on Monday will be a continuation of the “mini budgets” that were announced by the government in 2020 to help revive sectors reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.“This is a budget session. This has probably happened for the first time in the history of India that 4-5 mini budgets were presented in 2020. It was a year of mini budgets and this (Budget presentation) will be seen in sequence of those mini budgets,” he said.The Prime Minister was referring to the ₹20 lakh crore economic stimulus package that was announced in five tranches in May as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.Addressing the media ahead of the President’s address, which was boycotted by as many as 19 opposition parties, the PM said the coming decade is crucial for the country’s future and this should be kept in mind while holding discussions in Parliament.“... This is the first session of the decade and for the bright future of India, this decade is crucial. Therefore, from the start, there should be efforts made to ensure the realisation of the aspirations of those who dreamt of a free India,” he said.The PM went on to say, “This is a golden opportunity. We should make the most of this decade and there should be discussions and presentations of all kinds of ideas.”Urging the MPs to fulfil their responsibilities, he said they have been sent to Parliament by the people and they should make the most of being here while abiding by the propriety of democracy. He expressed hope that MPs will not hold back from discharging their duties of fulfilling the aspirations of the people.Senior ministers criticised the opposition parties for staying away from the president’s address. A Congress MP, Ravneet Singh Bittu also raised slogans inside the house during the address.Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said raising slogans in Parliament during the President‘s address was very painful. He said the President is above political differences and the opposition boycotting his speech was unfortunate. The minister also said that despite many “scams in the Congress-led UPA government” the BJP had never boycotted the President‘s address.Union minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, “Congress party's existence over last 5-6 years, is based on false narrative that the Modi Govt is against constitutional institution & values.

29-01-2021||India||India and Bangladesh discuss development cooperation, defence line of credit||India and Bangladesh on Thursday discussed ways to speed up development cooperation and operationalise a $500-million line of credit for defence ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Dhaka in March.The matters figured in foreign office consultations that were co-chaired by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and his Bangladesh counterpart Masud Bin Momen in New Delhi. The two sides focused on deliverables that could be implemented by the time of PM Modi’s visit to participate in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Bangladesh, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Bangladesh is perceived as a key pillar of India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy and has benefited from development cooperation worth about $9 billion, including $7.8 billion in lines of credit at concessional rates. India provided seven million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, including two million doses as a grant, to Bangladesh this month.“A lot of the India-funded projects are at the planning stage on the Bangladesh side and the consultations focused on ways to expedite them. We have a list of deliverables and five to six MoUs are expected to be signed during the prime minister’s visit, besides the inauguration of key projects,” one of the people cited above said.Also read: ‘Will spare no effort' - India promises Israel after blast near embassy in DelhiThe two sides also discussed the operationalisation of the line of credit of $500 million for Bangladesh to procure defence equipment from India. The agreement for this was signed last year and the two sides are exploring the supply of “kinetic and non-kinetic equipment,” the people said.India provided 18 120mm mortars and ammunition to Bangladesh last December – the first supply of kinetic equipment – and a 122-member Bangladeshi tri-services contingent participated in the Republic Day parade this year, reflecting the burgeoning defence ties between the two countries.The sharing of waters of the Teesta river, a long-standing demand of the Bangladeshi side, figured in Friday’s talks, the people said. Though the Indian side remains committed to an agreement on this issue, the people said the two sides should forge ahead with an agreement on six other rivers, for which data has already been shared.The Bangladeshi side also raised repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, another long-standing issue for which Bangladesh has sought India’s help in view of its good ties with Myanmar.The people said the Indian side is ready to play the role of a facilitator for the safe and sustainable repatriation of Rohingyas and pointed to development projects being implemented in Rakhine state. “India has built 250 houses in Rakhine and is currently identifying projects for the third phase of a project in Myanmar. It is also developing Sittwe port in Rakhine to boost economic development despite security challenges,” the person cited above said.The two sides also renewed an air bubble arrangement to facilitate essential travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-and-bangladesh-discuss-development-cooperation-defence-line-of-credit-101611941355860.html

Earlier, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to defence minister Rajnath Singh and US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, with the two sides committing themselves to enhanced cooperation on defence and security issues and in the Indo-Pacific region.Jaishankar and Blinken “expressed their commitment to consolidate and expand the multi-faceted strategic partnership”, the external affairs ministry said.They appreciated the “robust defence and security ties, growing economic engagement, productive healthcare collaboration and strong people-to-people linkages”, which are important pillars of this partnership.They also discussed the challenges of a post-Covid-19 world and agreed to work together to address global issues, including safe and affordable vaccine supply.“They also reiterated their commitment to peace and security, especially in the Indo-Pacific region,” the ministry said.Jaishankar tweeted: “Warm conversation with Secretary of State @SecBlinken. Congratulated him on his appointment. Look forward to working with him again. Agreed that we could build further on the solid foundation of our partnership. Also discussed our efforts at combating the Covid-19 pandemic.”In his confirmation hearing in the US Senate earlier this month, Blinken had said China presents the “most significant challenge” to the US whereas India has been a “bipartisan success story” with which the Biden administration can deepen cooperation in many ways.Blinken, a career diplomat who served as deputy national security advisor and deputy secretary of state under former president Barack Obama, had also said the Obama administration deepened cooperation with India, particularly in defence procurement and information-sharing.He added that the Trump administration had carried forward the cooperation, including “with this concept of an Indo-Pacific and to make sure that we were working with India so that no country in the region, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warm-conversation-jaishankar-on-introductory-phone-call-with-antony-blinken-101611940655869.html

The party also expelled a functionary from Tirunelveli for putting up a poster welcoming Sasikala on the day of her release from Bengaluru prison. But in the past few days, voices outside but linked to the AIADMK have not played by their rulebook.AIADMK's coordinator O Paneerselvam's son, VP Jayapradeep tweeted a note wishing Sasikala a speedy recovery adding a caveat that his expression is humane and not political. Though Paneerselvam resigned as chief minister to make way for Sasikala and she, in turn, handpicked Palanswami to be chief minister while she served her jail term - they both rebelled against each other and against Sasikala at different stages. After several negotiations, Palaniswami and Paneerselvam merged their factions and expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran from AIADMK in September 2017.Also read: We take it seriously, Jaishankar tells Israel after blast near embassy in DelhiAIADMK's ally the DMDK’s party treasurer Premalatha Vijayakanth said she welcomes Sasikala's entry into active politics. “As a woman, she has my support,” said Premalatha, who has been the face of the party since her husband and actor-turned-party founder Vijayakanth’s has been ailing. Premalatha has asked the AIADMK to allot 41 seats to them as they did in 2011 when the DMDK was at its peak but has since fallen with no elected member currently.Another actor-turned-politician S Karunas, an MLA elected on the AIADMK symbol, said that Sasikala made Palaniswami chief minister by thwarting Prime Minister Narendra’s Modi interests after supremo Jayalalithaa's death and those speaking against her should have a conscience. Karunas said that he will support the AIADMK government as Jayalalithaa and Sasiaka supported his political-caste outfit, Mukkulathor Pulipadai.A section of the AIADMK doesn’t want to rock the status quo of the dual leadership of Palaniswami-Paneeerselvam. Sasikala’s supporters within the party differ. “Any party will have dissidents and even if some unhappy members join her, it will not impact us,” said a senior AIADMK leader. A few days ago, Palaniswami announced after meeting PM Modi in Delhi that Sasikala ceased to be an AIADMK member and she won’t be reinducted.The ruling party’s ally, the BJP has not publicly commented on Sasikala’s release. At least three senior leaders have said that her induction into the party is the AIADMK’s decision. “We are not calling any shots as perceived,” said a BJP leader in the state, not willing to be named. “We are only looking to strengthen our party and defeat the DMK. For that goal, we have no objection to whoever wants to join our alliance.”“Paneerselvam has silently accepted what Palaniswami has openly said,” says political commentator Ravindran Duraisamy. “They will not allow her into the party because they will be sidelined and it will be detrimental to their leadership. When Congress’ K Kamaraj contested, 30 per cent MLAs supported C Subramaniam. When Modi became chief minister, Keshubai Patel and others were against him. But when Sasikala became the AIADMK chief, almost all legislators supported her. She and Dhinakaran will have to take an anti-Modi stance for the benefit of their political interest.” On Paneerselvam’s son’s support, he says, “it is the Mukkulathor community sympathising with her.”Dhinakaran’s party, the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), floated with Sasikala’s supporters celebrated in Bengaluru and across Tamil Nadu when she was released and are planning an elaborate welcome for her. AMMK cadres want her to regain control of the AIADMK and unite their factions. There is no clarity on Sasikala's political intentions as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-s-ruling-alliance-uneasy-ahead-of-vk-sasikala-s-return-101611940891852.html
29-01-2021||India||Karnataka govt seeks Centre's nod for priority vaccination for teachers||Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar on Friday appealed to the Centre to treat teachers as frontline workers and include them in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive for the priority sector. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, he said the staff of the education department, especially teachers, played a huge role in containing the pandemic through their on-field work, including maintenance of containment zones. "It would be the best recognition of their services if teachers are declared as frontline workers, in terms of getting a vaccine for Covid-19," the minister said in the letter, enclosing a copy of the state Chief Secretary's proposal in this regard. Suresh Kumar said the government had utilised the services of the teachers for door-to-door collection of data, propagating the importance of social distancing, assisting the health staff like never before and for many other allied activities. "Approving the proposal submitted by the Chief Secretary of Karnataka would go a long way in instilling the much needed faith of this community in our system," he said in the letter, a copy of which was released to media here. The vaccination drive started in the state on January 16 and at present covers the medical and paramedical staff in the priority sector. As of Thursday, a total of 2,84,385 people have been vaccinated in the state in the ongoing phase. The government has said after covering the frontline workers, people with co-morbidities and above 50 years would be given the vaccine. The state government's proposal comes at a time when schools and colleges have started functioning, especially for the classes 10, PUC second year and final year degree students in the state since early this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-seeks-centre-s-nod-for-priority-vaccination-for-teachers-101611923357408.html
29-01-2021||India||‘Not asking for the moon’: Amarinder Singh nudges Centre to repeal 3 farm laws||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh spoke to Vinod Sharma about the violent incidents that marred the Republic Day tractor rally by farmers, and his support to the movement against the contentious new laws.Edited excerpts:Q. The violence during the January 26 tractor rally has sullied the struggle for the repeal of the farm laws. What could be the way forward now?A. This vilification campaign against farmers, and the attempt to undermine their fight by using words like “sullied” has to end. There is a conspiracy to use the violence of R-Day as an excuse to destroy the farmers’ agitation, and also to vilify me and my government. The Red Fort violence was clearly the act of some antisocial elements who wanted to undermine the stir. The denigration of farmers is not right, nor are the cases filed against them and the lookout notices against their leaders. These cases should be immediately withdrawn. The Punjabis are a peaceful people; the farmers have been agitating for months without resorting to any lawlessness. So stop blaming them for the violence. There is a conspiracy to use the violence of R-Day as an excuse to destroy the agitation. The farmers’ struggle is genuine. They are fighting for their lives, with their lives. The only way to end the impasse is talks, and more talks. Peaceful negotiations have resolved all imbroglios in the past and will do so again. The talks held between the farmers and the Centre saw significant headway, with the latter eventually offering to put the farm laws in abeyance. The talks should resume.Q. You seem to be asking for the moon by insisting that the Centre take back the laws. It didn’t agree to the demand when the unions were talking from a position of strength -- the climate has since changed, given the outrage over the raising of the Sikh flag at Red Fort.A. Nobody is asking for the moon. What the farmers are fighting for, and what I and my government is supporting, is their right. That is where the farmers’ position of strength came from. The central government recognised that strength when they decided to engage with farmers. That position remains unchanged notwithstanding the unfortunate and shameful incidents of January 26. Nobody should make the mistake of underestimating the strength of our farmers. They have carried the burden of feeding a billion-plus people for all these years, and continue to do so. The farm laws are simply not in the interest of the farmers, or the agriculture sector, or my state. Let’s not forget that they really are bad in terms of the constitutional spirit of federalism. They were brought in violation of Schedule 7 of the Constitution, under which agriculture is categorically defined as a state subject. So why should the Centre intrude into a state subject? Why stand on ego? What’s wrong with scrapping the laws that aren’t acceptable to the people for whom they are designed? Why can’t the Centre start afresh on a clean slate? Revoke these laws, sit with farmers and other stakeholders, including states, and bring laws that can be truly said to be in the interest of farmers; that can reform the sector without destroying its essence.Q. The Centre offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months and take the dialogue forward through a bipartisan panel. Won’t it be prudent to accept the proposal if it’s still on the table?A. The farmers are not begging for alms, they are fighting for their right. The decision on what is or isn’t acceptable rests with the farm unions. No political party has a say in the matter, and, contrary to the lies that have been spread, nobody can dictate to the farmers. They know what’s good for them and what isn’t. It’s not a question of ego or honour, but of survival.Q. But do you see a more proactive role for yourself and other leaders from Punjab and Haryana, besides UP and Maharashtra, in resolving the logjam? There could be security implications in Punjab and elsewhere since Delhi Police has lodged cases under stringent laws against the farm leaders.A. It is the farmers whose interests are hurt - no political leader, no party, can intervene or mediate unless the farmers want them to. My government and I stand firmly with the farmers. We have already passed our state amendment laws to negate the impact of the central laws; we are supporting the families of the agitating farmers back home in every way. As for the security implications of the cases registered by the Delhi Police, I am sure the farmers will not create any problems in Punjab over that. They are well aware that Punjab has no role to play in those cases. We allowed them to agitate peacefully for nearly three months in the state.I hope that the Centre will direct Delhi Police not to target or harass the farm leaders unless there is concrete proof of their involvement in the Jan 26 incidents. The violence is totally condemnable and the culprits should be punished. But let not the incidents of that day become an excuse for disrupting the farmers’ peaceful agitation. As I mentioned earlier, the cases against the farm leaders need to be withdrawn immediately if an amicable solution is to be found in national interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-is-a-conspiracy-to-destroy-farmers-agitation-says-amarinder-singh-101611938370202.html
29-01-2021||India||Economists divided over Economic Survey's growth projections||Economists are divided over the growth projections in the latest Economic Survey, with some saying that the assumptions are realistic while others holding that a big capital expenditure (capex) by the government will be needed to realise the forecasts.Earlier in the day, Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian projected an 11% growth for 2021-22, aided by V-shaped recovery and a 7.7% contraction for the current year. It also projects a lower 6.8% growth in 2022-23.The last growth contraction of 5.2% was seen in the financial year 1980.The Survey said the agriculture sector is the only silver lining, while services, manufacturing and construction sectors are the most hit by the lockdown due to the pandemic."After an estimated 7.7% pandemic-driven contraction in 2020-21, real GDP is projected to grow 11% in 2021-22 and the nominal GDP to grow by 15.4%."These conservative estimates reflect the upside potential that can manifest due to the continued normalisation in economic activities as the roll-out of the pandemic vaccine gathers traction," the Survey said.However, Icra Rating Principal Economist Aditi Nayar feels that the numbers are a bit too optimistic and need real heavy-lifting by the Centre and the states."The survey forecasts on real and nominal GDP will require a substantial push from Central and state spending as private sector capacity expansion is anticipated to be intermittent, and sector-specific in the next couple of quarters," she said.Nayar added that private consumption is likely to chart a differentiated recovery across income and age groups.Based on the comments made in the Survey, she expects the Union Budget to incorporate a growth in gross tax revenue of 15%-16%. It, in conjunction with a stiff target for the divestment proceeds, would allow the government to project a considerable expansion in spending, especially on capex, she added.If gross domestic product (GDP) grows higher as projected, it will help government finances to revert to a sustainable fiscal trajectory over the medium term, Nayar noted.She expects the Union Budget to target a fiscal deficit of 5% for 2021-22 and a gross gross borrowing of ₹11.7 lakh crore.However, PwC India Leader (Economic Advisory Services) Ranen Banerjee said the projected growth targets are achievable, given the lower base of a 7.7% projected contraction in 2020-21.Grant Thornton National Managing Partner (Tax) Vikas Vasal said the Survey challenges the status quo on many things and calls for bold policy measures, to achieve long-term sustainable growth.It also sets the tone for the Budget to go aggressive on reforms, simplify tax and regulatory laws and ease of doing business, he added.CBRE India Chairman Anshuman Magazine said that if infrastructure and industrial sectors get revived as projected, they will prove to be pivotal to the overall growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/economists-divided-over-economic-survey-s-growth-projections-101611937490205.html
29-01-2021||India||New definition of reform, democracy: Chidambaram slams Economic Survey||Hours after the government tabled the Economic Survey 2020-2021, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram slammed the report saying the terms defined in it as reforms have all been rejected by the people of the country. In a series of tweets, Chidambaram said while the Economic Survey is “witnessing a V-shaped recovery”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has that the Indian economy "will reach the pre-Covid level only in 2025!"“According to the Survey, the top three ‘structural reforms’ were the (1) anti farmer laws (2) the new MSME definition and (3) the four Labour Codes. The farmers have rejected the three Farm laws. The MSMEs have said that they had got no relief at all. The Trade Unions have rejected the four Labour Codes. What is reform is what the people have rejected. It is the new definition of ‘reform’ and ‘democracy’,” the former Union finance minister said in one of his tweets.The farmers have rejected the three Farm laws. The MSMEs have said that they had got norelief at all. The Trade Unions have rejected the four Labour Codes! What is reform is what the people have rejected. It is the new definition of ‘reform’ and ‘democracy’Chidambaram also pointed out the "best decision" of the Centre. "The best decision taken by the government is the decision not to print the Economic Survey. Once upon a time, the Survey was the vehicle to communicate to the people in simple language the state of the economy and the prospects in the coming year," he said. "The most frequently used word in the Economic Survey is “regression”. The current government has taught us the meaning of “recession”. When you learn the meaning of “recession” and “regression”, you will qualify to be included in the team to write the next Economic Survey," he added.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Economic Survey 2020-21 in Parliament on Friday, ushering the Budget session. The Budget will be presented on February 1. The government's pre-Budget state of economy document hailed the three contentious farm laws, stating that they will give freedom to the markets as well as help in raising incomes of small and marginal farmers. "The newly introduced farm laws herald a new era of market freedom which can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India," the survey said.The document also added that the reforms in agriculture markets will enable the creation of 'one India one market' for agri-products, yield innumerable opportunities for farmers to move up the value chain, create jobs and increase incomes."The reforms in the agricultural sector were more overdue than even the labour reforms as the existing laws kept the Indian farmer enslaved to the local mandi and their rent-seeking intermediaries. While every other category of producer in India had the freedom to decide where to sell his/ her produce, the Indian farmer did not," the document observed.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various borders of the national capital seeking repeal of the three bills. They have expressed concerns that the laws are pro-corporate and could weaken government-regulated mandis, also called Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-definition-of-reform-democracy-chidambaram-slams-economic-survey-101611936795835.html
29-01-2021||India||‘Never before….a political leader calling for violence’: Irani on Rahul Gandhi||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of causing political strife and instigating violence.Union minister Smriti Irani said the former Congress president does not want a peaceful resolution of the ongoing farmers’ stir. She also said the Congress has a history of dividing people in the country for political gain.“Today the country witnessed a call for violence by Rahul Gandhi, the former president of the Congress. Exploring the fact...enunciating that he has 15 years of political experience Mr Gandhi gave a clarion call for violence across various cities so much so he included slums where the poor of our country live,” she said.Speaking on the farm agitation, Gandhi addressed a press conference on Friday where he said that the government must not think that the farmers are going back and this situation is going to spread.Reacting to his comments, Irani who is also an MP from Amethi said, “Never before in our democratic history have we witnessed a political leader asking for the fire of violence to spread, instead of seeking peace, instead of promoting peace.”The BJP leader said Gandhi by speaking about violence spreading to cities had “declared war on the Indian people”. She said, “... he said if his political stand is not supported by the PM of our country then cities will burn.”The BJP leader added thathe Gandhi scion has not uttered a word of support or consolation for the police personnel and mediapersons who were injured in the violence that erupted on January 26.“As a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party and citizen of this country I appeal to every Indian citizen to ensure that Rahul Gandhi’s call for violence is met with sustained peace; that his intentions to politically benefit from strife is defeated,” she said.The BJP leader alleged that Gandhi is perplexed about the restrain shown by the police in dealing with the protesters.“I reiterate though he will call for violence...we as citizens of India seek your support to ensure peace. He is insistent on creating political strife but we know that the citizens of India under one flag will ensure that law and order is maintained in our country,” Irani said.She also lashed out at Gandhi for getting the name of Singhu border wrong, where the agitation is on.“He has such lack of information that he does not even know the name of the border....what he said today was very childish and his intention is only to spread violence in the country.”Irani said Gandhi has shown that he stands with anarchic forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-before-a-political-leader-calling-for-violence-irani-on-rahul-gandhi-101611936460714.html
29-01-2021||India||2 BSF officers dismissed, 6 transferred for involvement in cattle smuggling||The Border Security Force have dismissed at least two of its personnel and transferred six others for their alleged involvement in cattle smuggling across the India-Bangladesh international border in West Bengal.“At least two personnel, including a second-in-command and an inspector, have been dismissed in the past 10 days. They were posted in Malda district in 2017–18,” said a top official.In September 2020, the Central Bureau of Investigation had registered a case and arrested two BSF commandants and one local businessman who were allegedly involved in cattle smuggling along south Bengal.The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress had recently lodged a complaint with the Election Commission alleging that a section of BSF personnel were threatening people living along the border areas and asking them to vote for a particular political party.While the ECI has already said the ruling party’s remarks were unfortunate, the BSF have said that it should be provided with specific instances so that actions could be taken.“Someone went to the EC. I have just one simple question. If you let me know the instance, place or the person, we can take all possible actions. But that has not been told to us till now. BSF is a professional force and would never indulge in such activities and in case anybody does he won’t be spared,” said Pankaj Kumar Singh, additional director general of the BSF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-bsf-officers-dismissed-6-transferred-for-involvement-in-cattle-smuggling-101611935703089.html
29-01-2021||India||SC issues notice on plea to fill vacancies at PMLA Tribunal||The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice on a petition to fill up vacancies in the Appellate Tribunal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The petition filed by a lawyer, Amit Sahni, pointed out that pendency of cases at the Appellate Tribunal were causing immense hardship to litigants as the post of the tribunal’s Chairman has been vacant since September 2019. Three members on the bench of the tribunal had retired and presently the appellate body had a single member to adjudicate sensitive and crucial cases arising out of appeals under Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA), the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), and the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, besides PMLA.A three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan noted the hardship pointed out by the petitioner and posted the matter after four weeks. The bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah even sought the response of the Centre on the petition and allowed the petitioner to serve his plea directly to the office of the Solicitor General.The Delhi-based lawyer in his petition said, “The tribunal is struggling to dispense justice particularly in the absence of its Chairman and three members out of sanctioned strength of four and acute shortage of administrative staff.” He made the Ministry of Finance the sole respondent in the petition.In November 2020, the petitioner sought information from the government under the Right to Information Act on total pendency of cases and vacancies in the Tribunal.As per the reply received, the post of one Member fell vacant in 2018 followed by that of the Chairman and two other Members in 2019. “The Tribunal is constrained to function with its sole member and therefore sufficient number of matters cannot be taken up in absence of Presiding Officers,” the petitioner said. About 20 administrative posts at the Tribunal also need to be filled up.Presently, over 5000 cases are pending with the Tribunal of which the bulk of matters arise out of proceedings under PMLA. Before filing the petition, Sahni filed a representation before the government in December 2020 for taking adequate steps to fill the pending vacancies. However, no action has been taken on his request till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-issues-notice-on-plea-to-fill-vacancies-at-pmla-tribunal-101611934634478.html

I have decided to suspend my proposed indefinite fast starting from Saturday, Hazare said.While announcing the hunger strike, Hazare had said, "I have been demanding reforms in the agriculture sector, but the Centre doesn't seem to be taking the right decisions.""The Centre has no sensitivity left for farmers, which is why I am starting my indefinite fast at my village from January 30," he had said and appealed to his supporters not to flock to his village district in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Hazare, who was at the forefront of the anti- corruption movement in 2011, had recalled that when he went on a hunger strike at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, the then UPA government had called a special session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hazare-announces-indefinite-fast-calls-it-off-hours-later-101611934121854.html

29-01-2021||India||Allahabad HC stays arrest of ‘Mirzapur’ makers Farhan Akhtar, Ritesh Sidhwani||Allahabad High Court on Friday stayed the arrest of producers of Mirzapur web series, Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani, in connection with the first information report (FIR) registered against them in Mirzapur district of Uttar Pradesh. However, the court directed the petitioners to offer full cooperation in the investigation while granting relief.Hearing the writ petition filed by Akhtar and Sidhwani, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Subhash Chand also issued a notice to the state government and the complainant in the matter seeking their respective replies in counter-affidavits. The court has listed this case in the first week of March 2021.The FIR was registered against Akhtar and Sidhwani and they were accused of the improper and indecent portrayal of the town of Mirzapur and outraging religious beliefs. The two run a production company and are producers of the web series. Akhtar and Sidhwani have been accused of hurting the religious, social and regional sentiments of the first informant and being instrumental in advancing ill feelings and animosity. The FIR was registered against the petitioners under section 295-A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and other sections of IPC and 67-A of Information Technology Act.Voicing his discontentment with the web series, the complainant said that such shows must be produced by such a big production house after due deliberations. The complainant alleged that the show has impacted society so much that his friends have started calling him 'Kaaleen Bhaiya', the main protagonist in the said web series.The counsels for Akhtar and Sidhwani argued that even if all the allegations in the FIR were taken to be correct, no offence was made out against the petitioners. They were represented by senior advocate GS Chaturvedi and senior advocate Manish Tiwari and were assisted by advocate Syed Imran Ibrahim. They said there was no allegation that the web series was produced with any deliberate or malicious intention of outraging the religious and social feelings of the citizens of India or to insult the religious and social feelings of the people of any particular class.Reasoning why no action should be taken against the makers, the counsels said that the web series was a work of fiction and that every act which tantamounts to insult or attempts to insult the religious feelings of any class of citizens would not come within the purview of IPC's Section 295-A unless the said act was perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class of citizens.The state counsel submitted that there was a specific allegation that the web series had hurt the social and religious feelings of the first informant. He also alleged that the web series promotes illicit relationships and incites religious disharmony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allahabad-hc-stays-arrest-of-mirzapur-makers-farhan-akhtar-ritesh-sidhwani-101611931392304.html

The active caseload is 72,239 and 48 health workers are among those infected. Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts reported the maximum number of virus cases, the health ministry said.Most of those infected contracted the disease locally and it clearly indicates community transmission is quite rampant in the state, statistics show. The number of critically ill patients being treated in ICUs in various hospitals across the state is 809.The worried government had launched a campaign called “Back to Basics” on Thursday to encourage people to revert to the initial days of the pandemic when they were more cautious about the outbreak and followed rules in letter and spirit.Going by the latest statistics about 40 per cent of the country’s total viral caseload is from the southern state and the TPR is more than four times of the national average. In the wake of the unusual surge, the government has also decided to increase the number of tests and give more preference to RT-PCR tests. Statistics show more than 60 per cent of the total tests are antigen. So far the state has done 95,18,036 tests but the number is low when compared to neighbouring states where it crossed 15 million.With Covid-19 cases surging, the opposition has trained its gun on the government. “Health Minister K K Shailaja should quit owning responsibility. She was giving a wrong picture throughout and now she blames the density of population for the surge,” said Congress leader Benny Behnan MP.

29-01-2021||India||‘Will spare no effort’: India promises Israel after blast near embassy in Delhi||Hours after a “very low intensity” explosive device went off near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi, India promised the “fullest protection” for Israel’s mission and diplomats and pledged to spare no effort to trace the perpetrators.“We take this very seriously,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, announcing his phone call about the explosion outside the Israeli embassy to his counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi.“Assured him of the fullest protection for the Embassy and Israeli diplomats. Matter is under investigation and no effort will be spared to find the culprits,” Jaishankar said after security personnel cordoned off the road leading to the embassy and placed airports on alert.Spoke just now to Israeli FM @Gabi_Ashkenazi about the explosion outside the Israeli Embassy. We take this very seriously. Assured him of the fullest protection for the Embassy and Israeli diplomats. Matter is under investigation and no effort will be spared to find the culprits.No one was injured but window panes of three cars parked near the embassy were shattered, witnesses said.The explosion coincided with the anniversary of India and Israel establishing full diplomatic relations on January 29, 1992.The Indian FM assured me that the Indian authorities are committed to the security of all Israeli diplomatic staff and will continue to act resolutely to locate all those involved in the explosion.I thanked him and promised full cooperation and any help required from Israel.Besides Jaishankar’s phone call to his counterpart, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla spoke to Israeli foreign secretary Alon Ushpitz, while secretary Sanjay Bhattacharyya, who oversees relations with West Asia, spoke to Israeli ambassador Ron Malka.In a brief video message issued late on Friday, Malka confirmed there were no casualties due to the blast. “There has been an explosion just outside the Israeli embassy in New Delhi. Fortunately, nobody is hurt, all the diplomats and their families are safe,” he said.“This explosion happens exactly when we mark 29 years [of] the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and India, and especially in these days, the strong and warm friendship between Israel and India reflects itself,” he said.“We get full cooperation and support from the local police, from the Indian authorities, the ministry of external affairs, the secretary of external affairs, the NSA – they all called their counterparts in Israel, offered their support,” Malka added.The Israeli embassy said in a statement that the blast occurred at around 5 pm. “We are working with Indian authorities to find the perpetrators and the motive behind this attack,” the statement said.Jaishankar had assured his counterpart Ashkenazi that “Indian authorities are committed to the security of all Israeli diplomatic staff and will continue to act resolutely to locate those involved in the explosion”, it said.Ashkenazi thanked Jaishankar and promised full cooperation and any help required from Israel.Also Read: What we know so far about the blast near Israeli embassyReuters quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying that although there were no casualties, “India and all elements in Israel regard the explosion as a terrorist incident".Delhi Police initially indicated the blast could be mischief. “Initial impressions suggest a mischievous attempt to create a sensation,” a police statement said minutes after the explosion at 5.05 pm on APJ Abdul Kalam Road, often referred to by its previous name Aurangzeb Road.Quoting a police officer, news agency ANI said the explosive device could have been dropped in a flower pot on the pavement close to the embassy from a moving car.A senior home ministry official said authorities hadn’t ruled out anything, including a terror attack or mischief.“...considering the blast has taken place in the VVIP (high security) zone, all agencies are coordinating to probe the incident,” said an officer.Union home minister Amit Shah and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval were briefed about the incident.The last attack on an Israeli diplomat in the Indian capital was in February 2012, when a bomb, placed on diplomat Tal Yehoshua Koren’s car, went off when she was on her way to pick up her children from school. She sustained injuries in the attack.The explosive device in that attack was described by the police as a sticky bomb that was attached to the car using a magnet, allegedly by suspects travelling on a motorcycle.Delhi Police, which had filed charges in this case, had claimed to have identified four Iranians in the plot. A probe team was sent to Tehran for investigations but could not make headway in this case.Only one person, an Indian journalist, was arrested for helping the Iranian nationals and was later released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-take-it-seriously-jaishankar-tells-israel-after-blast-near-embassy-in-delhi-101611933121390.html
29-01-2021||India||Goa govt told to recover illegal luxury tax exemptions given to 7 hotels||The Goa government has granted luxury tax exemptions to seven hoteliers to the tune of ₹1.45 crore despite them being “ineligible” for the same, said the Comptroller and Auditor General, recommending that the state recover the difference.In its report tabled before the Goa assembly, the CAG found that seven hotels were granted exemptions in luxury tax between December 2017 and November 2018, resulting in a short levy of luxury tax of ₹1.45 crore by irregular grant of exemptions.The government has been granting exemptions in luxury tax for luxuries provided in a hotel during the months from June to September every year since April 2013. The exemptions are granted provided the hotelier holds a valid registration certificate, files the returns within the specified time, pays all taxes within the time prescribed under the Act and should not have tax arrears or other dues.“Scrutiny of assessment records of two luxury tax offices revealed that though the payment of tax was delayed by five hoteliers and there were undisputed arrears in respect of two hoteliers [the] Luxury Tax Offices allowed the luxury tax exemptions while finalising the assessments.

29-01-2021||India||POCSO Act never intended to treat adolescent boy as offender: Madras HC||The Madras High Court has said the POCSO Act does not intend to punish an adolescent boy for entering into a relationship with a minor girl and batted for parental and societal support for the couple "in the grips of biological changes." Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that while the Act was brought in to protect children from sexual offences, a large array of cases were arising on the basis of complaints being filed by families of adolescents and teenagers involved in romantic relationships. Therefore,the "legislature has to keep pace with changing societal needs" and bring amendments to the Act, he said while quashing criminal proceedings against an autorickshaw driver facing charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for marrying a minor. "The scheme of the Act clearly shows that it did not intend to bring within its scope or ambit, cases of the nature where adolescents or teenagers involved in romantic relationships are concerned," the judge said. He observed that the provisions of the POCSO Act, as it stands today, would surely make the acts of the boy an offence due to its stringent nature. Punishing an adolescent boy who enters into a relationship with a minor girl by treating him as an offender was never the objective of the POCSO Act, he said. "An adolescent boy and girl who are in the grips of their hormones and biological changes and whose decision-making ability is yet to fully develop, should essentially receive the support and guidance of their parents and the society at large," the court observed. An adolescent boy caught in a situation like this will surely have no defense if the criminal case is taken to its logical end, the judge added. Referring to the victim girl's earlier statement, he said she "has clearly stated that she was the one who insisted that the 2nd Respondent take her away from her home and marry her due to the pressure exerted by her parents." With the parents of the girl or the family subsequently lodging a complaint, the accused is booked under the POCSO Act, the judge said. Invariably the boy gets arrested and thereafter, "his youthful life comes to a grinding halt." Such a person who is sent to prison in a case of this nature will be persecuted throughout his life. "It is high time that the legislature takes into consideration cases of this nature involving adolescents involved in relationships and swiftly bring in necessary amendments under the Act." The judge said the legislature has to keep pace with the changing societal needs and bring about necessary changes in law and more particularly, in a stringent law like the POCSO Act. He pointed out at the de facto complainant, mother of the girl, as well as the latter jointly seeking for quashing of the proceedings against the man, also facing charges of kidnap under the IPC, was "peculiar." The mother had insisted that "let bygones be bygones" and had wanted her daughter to settle down, the court observed. The judge said there can be no second thought as to the seriousness of offences under the POCSO Act and the object it seeks to achieve. However, it was also imperative for the Court to draw the thin line that demarcates the nature of acts that should not be made to fall within the scope of the Act. "...for such is the severity of the sentences provided under the Act, justifiably so, that if acted upon hastily or irresponsibly, it could lead to irreparable damage to the reputation and livelihood of youth whose actions would have been only innocuous," he said. "What came to be a law to protect and render justice to victims and survivors of child abuse, can become a tool in the hands of certain sections of the society to abuse the process of law," the judge noted. Referring to studies, he said adolescence is associated with many psychosocial and developmental challenges, including the processing of intense emotions and "first loves". Regarding the present case, the court said "the offences are purely individual/personal in nature" and involved the persons concerned and their families only. The court said the second respondent was working as an autorickshaw driver to eke out his livelihood and quashing the proceedings would not affect any overriding public interest in the case. It would in fact pave the way for both of them to settle down in their life and look for better future prospects, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pocso-act-never-intended-to-treat-adolescent-boy-as-offender-madras-hc-101611931842909.html

While the farmers insist on camping at Delhi's northern border seeking the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, local residents have lodged their discontentment over the clogging of roads in the area due to the farmers' protest.The group claiming to be locals demanded that the farmers vacate the Singhu border, one of the main protest sites around the national capital, alleging that they had "insulted" the national flag during their tractor parade on Republic Day, reported news agency PTI.Here is what you need to know about Friday's development at the Singhu border:Why are the farmers protesting:The protests, the longest such demonstration in decades of Independent India, entered their third month and show no signs of abating as the farmers have refused to halt them. They are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September which essentially change the way farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has tried to allay these fears, saying that it is ready to discuss changes to the laws and has made it clear that it won’t scrap them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policeman-stabbed-tear-gas-fired-what-we-know-so-far-about-singhu-border-chaos-101611921802686.html

29-01-2021||India||Randeep Hothi: The Indian American who sued Elon Musk||In a surprising reversal of fortune, millionaire Elon Musk failed to stop a defamation lawsuit filed by Indian American graduate student Randeep Hothi. Hothi is a stringent critic of Musk and Tesla and was under the billionaire's scanner for two incidents -- a confrontation with a security guard at the company's Fremont plant and for posting photos of a Tesla car that Hothi claimed was following him around California.Who is Randeep Hothi?Randeep Hothi is a doctoral candidate in Asian languages and cultures at the University of Michigan and a frequent critic of Tesla. Hothi is interested in Sikh Studies, specifically on how the Sikh diaspora interacts with the world around them. He describes himself as “Investigating/Reporting on corporate fraud. Currently focusing on Tesla. DMs open for fellow travelers, reporters, whistleblowers, etc” on his Twitter profile.Hothi is a 2009 graduate of t University of California, Berkeley, and his parents live in Fremont, where Tesla also has its auto plant. Hothi is part of a global group that has vehemently criticised Elon Musk and Tesla, this often leads to Twitter wars and online trolling. This group made up of ex-Tesla employees, students like Hothi, and other professionals tag themselves with the hashtag $TSLAQ.Members of the TSLAQ tweet from anonymous accounts under pseudonyms. Hothi tweeted under the alias ‘@skabooshka’, but in 2018 his and his brother’s identities were revealed online by another anonymous account, which since the revelation hasn’t tweeted anything. His brother worked at Tesla’s rival firm Volkswagen reported Bloomberg but is no longer associated with them.In 2019, Musk tweeted to Volkswagen about Hothi’s brother’s connection to the company, inviting speculation and racist attacks against Hothi and his family. After Musk's tweet to Volkswagen about Hothi’s brother’s connections to the company, Hothi too took to Twitter. “This is my promise. Tesla is a zero. @Elon Musk will go to prison,” he tweeted on April 20, 2019.What does this win mean for Hothi?Hothi hadn’t tweeted about Tesla since April last year due to the litigation. “The pendency of Tesla’s lawsuit against me makes it prudent for me to say little on Twitter at present,” he tweeted to his followers. After Judge Julia Spain’s judgment upheld his defamation suit against Musk, a possible return to Twitter might be on the cards for Hothi. He has demystified a lot of Tesla’s claims. He once flew a drone by a Tesla assembly tent to show that cars were being assembled inside by hand and not through automation as Musk had originally said. For Hothi and many others in the TSLAQ alliance, who have been crowdfunding to cover his legal fees, this win is no small suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/randeep-hothi-the-indian-american-who-sued-elon-musk-101611929119927.html
29-01-2021||India||Customs to question Kerala Speaker for alleged role in dollar smuggling case||The Customs department will question Kerala legislative assembly Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan next week in connection with his alleged role in dollar smuggling and his investment in some educational institutions in a West Asian country, a senior customs official said.Initially, he will be sent a questionnaire and later he will be summoned based on his replies. He said Customs had earlier sought legal opinion on this and got the go-ahead and the investigation was at a crucial stage. In January first week, his personal secretary K Ayyappan was questioned by the Customs for more than 10 hours.The alleged dollar smuggling and other irregularities came to light when central agencies were probing the gold smuggling case through the United Arab Emirates consulate in the state capital in July last year.But the Speaker said in Malappuram that he hadn’t got any information in this regard and he will be happy to share any information with any agency. He said he was least bothered as his hands were clean. Last week the Customs had also questioned two of his friends.After the gold smuggling case surfaced, there were reports allegedly linking the main accused Swapna Suresh with the Speaker. He later admitted that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and attended some functions where she had invited him. But, the opposition Congress and BJP alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and that Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to certain West Asian countries.They also alleged the accused smuggled US dollars to Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. They also alleged that a major portion of the smuggled US dollars was commission obtained from various government projects including the Life Mission Project. The Speaker denied these allegations and said he was ready for any probe. There are reports that in her statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC she reportedly took his name and claimed that he had invested in an educational group in the UAE.When the Customs busted the gold smuggling racket, Suresh was working as a consultant with the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she worked at the UAE consulate at the state capital in the public relations department. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, her degree was also found to be fake. The state police had registered a case against her for this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-to-question-kerala-speaker-for-alleged-role-in-dollar-smuggling-case-101611925419017.html

29-01-2021||India||'Repeal farm laws, put them in a wastebasket': Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi reiterated his demand that the three farm laws be repealed and extended his support to the farmers protesting in the national capital."We all should understand the three farm laws. The first law destroys the mandi system, the second law allows unlimited storage of grains and other material and will make it impossible to negotiate prices and the third one says that if the farmers have grievances they can't go to court," Rahul Gandhi said.Accusing the government of destroying the livelihoods of the farmers, he said that it is obvious why the farmers are agitating. "The laws are going to give the middle class a shock because the prices of food are going to go up," he said, adding that what is being done to the farmers is absolutely criminal as they are being beaten up, threatened and discredited by the government.The Congress leader further said that the only way forward was to repeal the laws. "The only solution is to repeal the laws and put them in a wastepaper basket. The government must not think that the farmers are going to go home because they are not. This situation is going to spread. We need a conversation with the farmers and we need a solution," he said.  Responding to a question about the incident that took place on January 26, Rahul Gandhi said we should think about how the farmers were able to reach the Red Fort.As part of their tractor rally organised in protest against the farm laws, hundreds of farmers reached the ramparts of the Red Fort on Republic Day."Was it not the job of the home ministry to ensure that they didn't enter the fort? What was the reason behind allowing them inside the Red Fort? We should ask these questions to the home minister," he said.The leader also encouraged the farmers to carry on the agitation and assured them of his support. "Do not step back even one inch. Fight for your rights. Do not let these people steal away your future. We are with you," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-farm-laws-put-them-in-a-wastebasket-rahul-gandhi-101611921789329.html
29-01-2021||India||Telangana now has its own brand of drinking water, calls it Mission Bhagiratha||Branded drinking water bottles – be it Kinley or Bisleri or Bailey or Himalayan – are now passé at all official meetings in Telangana.For the past one week, the Telangana government has been using its own brand of drinking water, which is nothing but piped drinking water being supplied to every household in the state.The packaged drinking water under the brand name of “Mission Bhagiratha” has now been made compulsory in all government meetings. On Friday, state minister for Panchayat Raj Errabelli Dayakar Rao formally launched this new brand at an official programme in Palakurthy in Jangaon district.“This is not like any other brand of drinking water purified and packed in factories. This is the same water which everybody is getting through their drinking water pipeline. We are only promoting it as our own Telangana brand,” Dayakar Rao said.Mission Bhagiratha, a flagship programme of the Telangana government, is aimed at providing safe drinking water to every household. “We have achieved 100 per cent target of providing drinking water connections to all households in the state. It was acknowledged by Union minister for Jal Sakthi Gajendra Singh Shekhawat last week,” Mission Bhagiratha engineer-in-chief G Krupakar Reddy said.In a bid to encourage people to drink only tap water, instead of running after branded and packaged drinking water, the Telangana government has come up with this unique idea of creating its own brand and calling it “Mission Bhagiratha.”Reddy said his department has designed a unique bottle, which is different from other packaged drinking water brands, so that people could recognise it. The department doesn’t have a separate bottling unit, but it has procured PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles, lids and labels.“However, we are not going to sell our brand of drinking water in the market like any other brand. Our Mission Bhagiratha water bottles are supplied free of cost, in all government offices, from gram panchayats to the chief minister’s office and also at all public meetings,” he said.He said the intention of the government was not to make money out of this project, but to convey the message to the people that the drinking water being supplied to their homes through pipes was absolutely safe and pure. “If officials and leaders use the packaged Mission Bhagiratha water, it will give confidence to the people,” he said.Reddy said the drinking water being supplied under Mission Bhagiratha was totally tested in the laboratories before being released through pipes to the households in the city. “We have around 75 government labs across the state where chemists and microbiologists conduct regular testing of water samples, before it is released through pipelines,” he said.The official further said unlike other drinking water brands, which are processed through reverse osmosis (RO) plants, the Mission Bhagiratha brand of water is only ultra-violet light processed. “The RO plants take away all minerals, whereas UV-processed water just kills bacteria and retains essential minerals,” he said.What is more, most of the brands use PET bottles which have to be discarded after use as each of them weigh around 12 grams. However, bottles used in Mission Bhagiratha brand are reusable as they weigh 19 grams each and the water can be preserved up to one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-now-has-its-own-brand-of-drinking-water-calls-it-mission-bhagiratha-101611921497138.html

It has amassed collected donations of about ₹5 crore in the state."I've been living in the cave for over half a century. As a seer, I live on donations from the devotees visiting the cave. When I came to know about the VHP campaign, I decided to donate the amount for Ram Mandir for which we all have been dreaming for long," said Swami Shankar Das while speaking to the media.The bank officials expressed surprise when the seer offered the cheque for ₹1 crore. Upon checking, they found that his account had the requisite balance. The officials then contacted the local RSS functionaries who reached the bank and helped Das donate the amount in the Ram Mandir Trust.Randeep Pokhriya, in-charge of VHP's Ram Mandir donation campaign in Uttarakhand, hailed Das's act and said, "More than collecting donations, the motive of the campaign is to generate a feeling of harmony and service among the Ram Bhakts like Das.""We have so far collected donations worth about ₹5 crore which is three times the target we had in mind. However, it is not about the amount collected but the number of people coming forward through their devotion for Lord Ram to help in building his temple in Ayodhya," said Pokhriya.He said they have been receiving donations from a cross section of society.A 10-year-old girl in Nainital donated ₹2,500 for the temple from savings in her piggy bank.The VHP had earlier said that they would visit 24 lakh families in 14,526 villages and 73 towns in Uttarakhand under the campaign to collect donations for Ram Temple.The Hindu body has formed various committees to look after the donations to be collected in the campaign. Under this, a team visiting a village would have to deposit the donation money collected to the specified bank account of VHP within 48 hours.It is providing coupons of ₹10, 100, 1000 and 2000 against the donations made of the same denomination. If the donor is willing to donate more than ₹2000 than it would provide him/her receipts for the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/83yearold-cave-dwelling-seer-donates-rs-1-crore-for-ram-temple-construction-101611921704895.html

The President, who is also the supreme commander of the armed forces, during his address to a joint session of Parliament, specifically mentioned the clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley last June that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers, and said the government is committed to safeguard the interests of the country. “During the Coronavirus pandemic, when the country was grappling with crisis, attempts were made to challenge the country’s capability at the border. Efforts were made to disrupt the peace at LAC in utter disregard of bilateral relations and agreements,” Kovind said. Also read | Full speech text: Prez Kovind’s address to Parliament as Budget session starts“However, our security forces not only responded to these machinations with promptitude, force and courage, but also foiled all attempts to change the status quo at the border.” The “restraint, valour and courage” of India’s soldiers “deserve utmost praise”, Kovind said, pointing out that 20 soldiers “made the supreme sacrifice and laid down their lives defending the country at Galwan Valley” in June 2020. “Every citizen is deeply indebted to these martyrs,” he added. Kovind said the government is “vigilant and fully committed to safeguard the interests of the country”, and additional forces have been deployed at the LAC to protect India’s sovereignty. The President’s remarks came a day after external affairs minister S Jaishankar outlined eight principles, including adhering to agreements on the border issue and the unacceptability of any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo at the LAC, to repair India-China ties that were “profoundly disturbed” by the events in Ladakh sector last year. Jaishankar also referred to the sudden amassing of Chinese troops on the LAC last year in violation of bilateral agreements and Beijing’s failure to provide a credible explanation for the change in its stance. China’s foreign ministry responded to the foreign minister’s remarks on Friday by saying that border issues should not be linked to bilateral ties. “This is an important experience in the continuous development of bilateral relations over the past years,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said. “It is hoped that India and China will meet each other halfway, properly manage differences, promote pragmatic cooperation, and push bilateral relations back on track,” Zhao added. Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have dug in for the harsh winter along the LAC in Ladakh sector after several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failed to lead to a breakthrough in disengagement. A clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Naku La in Sikkim sector on January 20, which resulted in injuries on both sides, has added to concerns about possible expansion of the dragging standoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-forces-foiled-all-attempts-to-alter-status-quo-on-lac-president-kovind-101611918978075.html

Pakistan rangers have confirmed to the Border Security Force (BSF) that Gemararam is in the custody of Sindh police. Though efforts are on for his return, however, when he will be allowed to return, is not yet clear.Jain’s letter says Bhagu Singh of Gohad Ka Tala, Teelaram of Bheelon ka Tala and Sahuram of Sarupe ka Tala villages of Chohtan block in Barmer and one Jamalddin from Ramgarh village in Jaisalmer are “missing” since the 1980s and are believed to have crossed over to Pakistan by mistake while grazing cattle.At that time, there was no fencing at this section of the Indo-Pak border, the letter says. The number of such missing people was earlier 10 but six of them were released by Pakistan in 2010.A survey in villages bordering Pakistan, conducted in Barmer and Jaisalmer in 1996, by social activist Bhuvnesh Jain, gathered details about ‘missing’ residents believed to have strayed into Pakistan.Later, Jain’s RTI applications revealed that about ten people from Barmer and Jaisalmer were lodged in Pakistani jails. Jain launched a movement for the release of these prisoners and his efforts resulted in freedom for six persons in 2010.However, there is no clue about the whereabouts of Bhagu Singh, Teelaram, Sahu Ram and Jamaluddin. Their families claimed that they initially received letters by the missing members, written from inside Pakistani jails. Bhagu Singh’s family claims to have received his last letter in 2011, showing his presence in Kot Lakhpat jail in Karachi.“Government should take up the case of Gemararam and others on humanitarian grounds. Bhagu Singh, Teelaram, Sahuram and Jamalddin have lost their whole lives while perishing in Pak jails, it should not be repeated in Gemararam’s case, Jain pleaded in his letter.”Also Read: United States 'outraged' as Pak court upholds acquittal in Daniel Pearl murderRevenue minister Harish Choudhary told HT that he had raised the issue of these men perishing in Pak jails on several occasions in the Parliament.Choudhary said his continuous efforts had resulted in the release of six prisoners and he had himself welcomed their return at the Wagah border."In the recent episode of Gemararam, his family members met me for his release. I will write to the Central government to take up this issue. I will also request the government to take up the issue of the rest of the Barmer men, perishing in Pak jails since decades,” Choudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barmer-man-s-arrest-in-pakistan-brings-focus-on-locals-languishing-in-pak-jails-101611916815479.html

The air show will be staged at Yelahanka, outside Bengaluru, from February 3-5. “HAL will showcase its prowess in defence and aerospace centered on the theme ‘Conceive. Indigenise. Collaborate’,” the state-owned plane maker said in a statement. The “Aatmanirbhar Formation Flight” in the trainer segment will feature the light combat aircraft (LCA) trainer, Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) jets, the intermediate jet trainer, advanced Hawk Mk-132 aircraft (Hawk-i) and the Dornier-228 transport plane, the statement said. Also Read: PLA on the backfoot, wants to disengage: Northern Command GOC-in-CMore than 600 exhibitors are taking part in the biennial show, including 78 foreign exhibitors. A ₹48,000 crore deal for 83 advanced LCA aircraft for the Indian Air Force could be signed during the air show, officials familiar with the development said. “Sukhoi 30 MKI, advanced light helicopter (ALH) Dhruv, light combat helicopter (LCH), light utility helicopter (LUH) will also take part in the flying display,” HAL said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the government has taken various steps to boost self-reliance in the defence sector and India will be known as a producer of military equipment, instead of being a market. India has set a target of $5 billion worth of defence exports by 2024. On January 13, India’s Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS), headed by the Prime Minister, approved a much-awaited ₹48,000 crore proposal to buy 83 advanced Tejas jets to bolster the IAF’s combat potential. The aircraft to be ordered include 73 Mk-1A fighter jets and 10 LCA Mk-1 trainer aircraft. The deal could be signed at the show next week, the officials said. HAL is expected to provide the first Mk-1A deliveries to the IAF three years after the deal is signed, with all the aircraft likely to be delivered by 2028-29. The Mk-1A programme is expected to generate thousands of jobs and will involve the participation of more than 500 Indian companies. The deal for the 83 Mk-1A jets will take the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by the IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far. The Mk-1A variant will come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability. In August, the defence ministry gave its go-ahead for the purchase of military equipment worth ₹8,722 crore, including 106 locally made HTT-40 basic trainer aircraft for the IAF to provide a push to the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement).

The violence that followed the tractor rally on Republic Day in the national Capital has caused a rift among farmer organisations backing the protest. Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat announced their split from Sanyukt Morcha but said they will continue their protest. “Those who instigated the farmers on Republic Day [during tractor rally] have not been arrested. This shows that the conspiracy was hatched by the government,” he alleged. Meanwhile, All India Kissan Sabha national vice-president Amra Ram said those who hoisted a flag at Lal Qila were not a part of the Sanyuk Morcha. “The government has adopted policy to suppress farmers – they disconnected water and electricity...We will observe a day-long fast on Saturday. Our dharna will continue till the demands are met,” he said.

We are 65% of the population of the country, and are capable of teaching a lesson to the government,” he said. BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said some people are trying to highjack the movement. The real farmers are not in support of the agitation, he said.He said when the laws were introduced in Parliament, Beniwal did not oppose them. It’s hard to understand why he is protesting now. “The Centre is ready and open to have dialogue with the farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-bodies-continue-protests-in-rajasthan-101611912496957.html

Poonawalla had earlier mentioned that SII will also start stockpiling Novavax’s vaccine candidate from April like it did with Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, which is currently being used in India as Covishield for its mass Covid-19 vaccination drive.SII has also received funding from GAVI- The Vaccine Alliance, for pre-producing at risk the two vaccine candidates.Meanwhile, Novavax has announced that NVX-CoV2373, its protein-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate had the efficacy of 89.3%, in its Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom (UK).The study assessed efficacy during a period with high transmission and with a new UK variant strain of the virus emerging and circulating widely. “With today’s results from our UK Phase 3 and South Africa Phase 2b clinical trials, we have now reported data on our Covid-19 vaccine from Phase 1, 2 and 3 trials involving over 20,000 participants.

He added if the court believes he has crossed a line and wants to shut down his Internet indefinitely, then he too will “write Happy Independence Day postcards every August 15 just like his Kashmiri friends”.Kamra was issued a notice of contempt on December 18 for allegedly denigrating the judiciary and judges through his social media posts after Attorney General KK Venugopal gave his consent for initiation of the contempt proceedings.ALSO WATCH | ‘Witnessing assault on freedom of speech’: Kunal Kamra defends tweets in SC﻿Kamra has filed his affidavit in response to the notice maintaining that even judges know no protection from jokes and that the public faith in the judiciary is founded on the institution’s own actions and not on any criticism or commentary about it.Also Read: ‘Hurts Hindus, anti-Dalit’: BJP leaders want Saif Ali Khan’s Tandav banned“We are witnessing an assault on the freedom of speech and expression, with comedians like Munawar Faruqui being jailed for jokes that they have not even made, and school students being interrogated for sedition.”The affidavit is replete with satire. “To believe any institution of power in a democracy is beyond criticism is like saying migrants need to find their way back home during an ill-planned, nationwide lockdown...the suggestion that my tweets could shake the foundation of the most powerful court in the world is an over-estimation of my abilities,” it said.“These jokes are not reality, and do not claim to be so. Most people do not react to jokes that don’t make them laugh; they ignore them like our political leaders ignore their critics. That is where the life of a joke must end...I do not believe that any high authority, including judges, would find themselves unable to discharge their duties only on account of being the subjects of satire or comedy.”A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah will take up the case around 12pm on Friday.The bench will also hear a separate show-cause notice issued to another comedian, Rachita Taneja, over similar allegations of deriding the judiciary and judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kunal-kamra-refuses-to-apologise-for-tweet-against-supreme-court-101611899775716.html

Sisauli, a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district, is the headquarters of BKU and the native village of Rakesh Tikait and his brother Naresh Tikait, who heads the union.BKU, which is demanding the withdrawal of the cases against farmer leaders, has now decided to hold a mahapanchayat at the government inter college ground in Muzaffarnagar, on Friday, to decide the strategy of the movement going forward, Latiyan said.About 50 kilometres from Sisauli, farmers held a panchayat at Baraut in Baghpat district of western UP earlier in the day on Thursday and constituted a nine-member committee to take a decision about the ongoing farmers’ movement. They claimed that the police used force to chase away farmers who were sleeping at a protest site on Wednesday night. The police have denied the allegations of a crackdown.The farmers' protest had been continuing on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway in Baghpat since December 17 last against the Centre's three contentious agriculture reform laws.The protesters alleged that police personnel entered their tents late on Wednesday night and resorted to a lathi-charge on the sleeping farmers. The police, however, claimed that the matter was resolved through deliberations and the protesting farmers were sent home on Wednesday night.Chaudhary Brijpal Singh, thambedar (local chief) of the Desh khap, who was leading the indefinite sit-in on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway since December 17, claimed that at least 15 farmers sustained injuries in the lathi-charge and five farmers were missing.Watch: Rakesh Tikait reacts to police order of vacating Ghazipur protest siteHe alleged the police lathi-charged even elderly farmers who were sleeping and took away their belongings. He said the committee formed at the panchayat would take a decision after consulting the people of the area.In a video, additional district magistrate (Baghpat) Amit Kumar said, “We removed farmers on the request of NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) which wanted to restart the work on the road that was hampered due to the farmers’ agitation.”He further claimed that there were four or five farmers at the protest site at the time and they were sent home.The office of the superintendent of police (SP) in Baghpat said a case against farmers was registered on the complaint of NHAI officials. Abhishek Kumar, public relations officer to the SP, said no farmer was arrested.However, Chaudhary Brijpal Singh claimed that he was taken to a police station and released from custody late in the night.Refuting the charge, circle officer Alok Singh said police did not resort to lathi-charge on the protesters. Whatever happened was in agreement with those present there, he said, adding that the protesting farmers returned home peacefully.In Sisauli, BKU's Muzaffarnagar district chief said it was indeed painful for farmers to watch Rakesh Tikait breaking down in front of TV cameras.Latiyan said farmers were carrying Ransingha (a traditional instrument that is blown before a march) and shouted slogans supporting the BKU and the Tikait brothers. He claimed that thousands of farmers would gather at Friday’s mahapanchayat.In a statement, Rakesh Tikait has blamed BJP for hatching a conspiracy to disgrace the farmers’ movement.Earlier in the day, another meeting was held at Sisauli under the leadership of BKU chief Naresh Tikait. At that meeting, the situation after the Delhi violence on Republic Day and cases registered against farmer leaders were discussed.BKU had called for a symbolic protest at the police stations in Muzaffarnagar against the cases lodged against farmer leaders. Latiyan said a memorandum was given at the Muzaffarnagar tehsil and at the Chartgawal, Bhopa and Purkazi police stations. Security was beefed up at all the police stations of the Muzaffarnagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5000-farmers-gather-to-support-rakesh-tikait-after-he-wept-on-national-tv-101611890707445.html

29-01-2021||India||In Goa’s water row with Karnataka, Sawant vows not to bow to any pressure||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant has assured the legislative assembly that he will not buckle under any pressure including that from his own party on the issue of the state's long-standing water dispute with neighbouring Karnataka, also governed by a BJP government.Replying to a calling attention motion moved jointly by members of the opposition benches, who alleged the Goa government had adopted a “lethargic approach” in dealing with the matter, Sawant insisted that party affiliations and considerations came secondary and the state’s interest would always be primary.“I will not come under any pressure from anybody. The party's and my government's interest is not more important than the state's interest. Even if we have to meet the PM in a delegation, we will not stay back,” Sawant told the House.Earlier, during the discussion on the motion, opposition members including the Leader of Opposition (LoP) Digambar Kamat and lawmakers Vijai Sardesai and Rohan Khaunte accused the government of doing nothing while Karnataka was diverting Goa’s share of water from Mahadayi river.In response the government said that the water was diverted “illegally” in violation of the Supreme Court’s and the tribunal’s directions; and a contempt petition had been filed by the state to challenge it.“There is no question that it has been diverted. But we have not defeated our purpose before. So far, we have not lost the case legally. We have not lost the legal battle. What we have lost is the quantity of water which they have diverted illegally. And that came to the notice of this government in 2018. And we had gone to the court to stop the construction,” water resources minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues said.“The SC is not taking up the case and it is being delayed because of Covid-19. We have told the SC it cannot be held virtually. We have been asking for a physical hearing because we have to show a lot of documentary evidence,” he added.Sawant too concurred.“The Mahadayi water has been diverted. I can say it on record. It has been illegally diverted -- in violation of the Supreme Court order and in violation of the Mhadei Dispute Tribunal order,” he said.Also Read: Goa CM, Leader of Opposition spar over 'unparliamentary protest' in AssemblyGoa has opposed any diversion of waters of the River Mahadayi which originates in the Western Ghats in Karnataka, takes a detour via Maharashtra and enters Goa as the Mandovi. The Mahadayi river basin drains an area of 2032 sq.km., out of which an area of 375 sq.km.lies in Karnataka, 77 sq.km. in Maharashtra and the rest in Goa.Both the Goa and Karnataka governments have, for very different reasons, challenged the final award granted by the Mahadayi Interstate Water Disputes Tribunal which, in a verdict in August 2018, granted Karnataka a total of 13.42 Thousand Million Cubic Feet (TMC) of water against their claim on 36.558 TMC of water.While Goa has approached the Supreme Court arguing that Karnataka shouldn’t be allowed to divert any water since the Mahadayi is a water deficient river, Karnataka is arguing before the SC that the tribunal erred in granting it only 13.42 TMC of water. Besides, the Goa government has also filed a contempt petition accusing Karnataka of violation of the Supreme Court’s orders by going ahead with the diversion while the case is ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-s-water-row-with-karnataka-sawant-vows-not-to-bow-to-any-pressure-101611886617173.html
29-01-2021||India||Mumbai locals: More trains from today, but not for general public||From Friday, more local trains are available for daily passengers in Mumbai, but only passengers who have been allowed to travel by local trains under past directives will be allowed. Local trains are not yet open to the general public, the railway authorities have reiterated.How many additional trains will run from today?Instead of 2,781 trains, there will be 2,985 services on Mumbai Suburban network starting from today. The existing number is 2,781. Central Railway will increase the suburban services from the existing 1,580 to 1,685 services and Western Railway will increase the existing 1,201 suburban services to 1,300 services.Who are eligible to travel?There has been no change in the list of passengers who are eligible to travel in Mumbai locals. Emergency staff, practising lawyers, women, teachers, non-teaching school staff are allowed to travel in Mumbai locals. Disabled, cancer patients are also allowed.Are students allowed?No, despite the demand to make locals open to students as schools are reopening, students are not yet allowed to travel in local trains.Can people who are getting vaccines travel in local trains?As only health care staff are getting vaccinated at present and as all of them fall under the emergency staff category, they can travel in local trains.When will local trains be available for all?No decision in this regard has been taken yet. But as the Maharashtra government is unlocking gradually, it is likely that the services will be open to the general public in the next step after the government reviews the Covid-19 situation of the city following the increase of the number of trains.Why is the number of trains being increased while no additional passengers are being allowed to travel?Though no additional category of passengers is allowed to travel in local trains, the footfall has gone up in the past few months as all establishments are on their way to reopening. The number is being ramped up to ensure there is no crowding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-locals-more-trains-from-today-but-not-for-general-public-101611885671539.html
29-01-2021||India||Judge of ‘skin-to-skin contact’ case acquitted two others too||Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court, whose controversial January 19 ruling that groping a minor without removing her clothes was not sexual assault but molestation was stayed by the Supreme Court on Wednesday, acquitted two more people in cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) on January 14 and 15, it has emerged.In the judgment on January 15, she held that holding the hands of a minor and unzipping one’s trousers in front of her does not amount to “sexual assault,” acquitting a 50-year-old labourer from Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district of the charge of “aggravated sexual assault” for doing so.In the verdict on January 14, she reversed a lower court order convicting a 23-year-old accused of rape of a minor on the grounds that the testimony did not “inspire confidence” and wasn’t of “sterling quality”. She also said the birth certificate of the minor was not verified.The judgments have raised questions about the judge’s handling of POCSO cases. In all three cases, accused convicted under the POCSO Act were acquitted by her. Pradeep Nandrajog, a former chief justice of Bombay HC, told news agency PTI the judgments were “flawed”.On January 19, the judge acquitted a Nagpur resident of the charge of sexual assault under POCSO, interpreting the term “physical contact” in the law to mean “skin-to-skin” contact. The man was acquitted of sexual assault under the POCSO Act for groping the breast of a 12-year-old. The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the verdict.In the January 15 ruling, justice Ganediwala ruled that the act of holding the hands of a minor “prosecutrix”, or unzipping trousers in front of her, an act witnessed by PW-1 (prosecution witness 1), in the opinion of the court, did not fit in with the definition of aggravated sexual assault. She reversed the conviction of the man, Libnus Kujur, for aggravated sexual assault, a charge brought against him because the child was younger than 12 years of age.The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and the National Commission for Women (NCW) took a serious note of the January 19 ruling by the HC judge. NCW expressed a desire to challenge the judgment before the Supreme Court and NCPCR wrote to the Maharashtra chief secretary to seek a review of the ruling. “It has been observed by the Commission (NCPCR) that the prosecution has failed in representing the case of the victim properly,” said NCPCR in a letter to the chief secretary. “If the prosecution had made the submissions as per spirit of the POCSO Act, the accused would not have been acquitted of the serious offence against the minor,” it added.“Further, the remark “skin-to-skin... with sexual intention, without penetration” also needs to be reviewed and the State should take note of this, as it seems to be derogatory to the minor victim,” the letter added.On Wednesday, the apex court took suo motu note of the January 19 judgment and stayed the acquittal, after attorney general KK Venugopal pointed out that the judgment was likely to set a dangerous precedent.So far as the case of the 50-year-old labourer was concerned, the incident took place on February 11, 2018. The complainant went to work, leaving her minor daughters alone at home. In the afternoon, when she returned, she saw Kujur was sitting in her house, holding the hands of her elder daughter, aged 5.Shocked to seen an unknown man sitting in her house, the complainant shouted and questioned him. The man set the daughter free only when the mother shouted at him again. The woman noticed that the man’s trouser zip was open and the child was pulling up her knickers. After the man ran away, the child told her mother that the man had exposed himself to her and was about to take her to “sleep”.Kujur was arrested and prosecuted for various offences under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.On October 5, 2020, a special POCSO court in Gadchiroli convicted the labourer for having committed an offence punishable under sections 354-A(1)(i) (sexual harassment) and 448 (house trespass) of the IPC and sections 8 (punishment for sexual assault), 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) and 12 (punishment for sexual harassment) read with section 9(m) (sexual assault of a child below 12 years of age) and 11(i) (sexual harassment) of the POCSO Act.He was sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for aggravated sexual assault.The Nagpur bench of the HC, on his appeal, set aside the conviction for the aggravated sexual assault. The judge said at the most, the offence was punishable under Section 354-A(1)(i) of the IPC r/w section 12 of the POCSO Act. She let him off with a prison term of 5 months that he has already served for the offence of sexual harassment.The case involving the 23-year-old man dates back to 2017, and he was convicted under provisions of POCSO Act in November 2019 and sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ₹5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/judge-of-skin-to-skin-contact-case-acquitted-two-others-too-101611882295061.html

He did not. It was BJP and AAP men who did that," he said, adding that Rahul had promptly condemned the violence and made it clear that violence was no solution to the crisis."These allegations are nothing but a cover-up attempt by the BJP leader for his own party's role in the violence, and, in fact, for their utter failure to manage the situation, which they had created in the first place with the unilateral implementation of the black farm laws," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-trying-to-shift-blame-for-violence-by-protestors-in-delhi-punjab-cm-101611880484193.html
29-01-2021||India||Tandav makers can approach HCs for relief: SC||HTThe Supreme Court on Thursday clarified that its refusal to quash the seven FIRs lodged against the actors and makers of web series Tandav, and streaming platform Amazon Prime’s head across the country, for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, will not come in the way of their approaching the respective high courts for relief.Following a request by senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, the top court agreed to modify its Wednesday’s order to clarify that the petitions were dismissed only under Article 32 (for violation of fundamental rights) and not on merits.Luthra was appearing for Tandav director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Himanshu Kishan Mehra and writer Gaurav Solanki.On Wednesday, a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had declined to grant interim protection from arrest to Luthra’s clients, besides Bollywood actor Zeeshan Ayyub and Amazon Prime (India) creative head Aparna Purohit. The top court had said that all of them may seek bail from courts concerned in the FIRs lodged in connection with the web series.Luthra said that had the bench not mentioned that the dismissal of the plea was only under Article 32, the petitioners would not be able to secure relief from any high court in the country.“Which high court will entertain our petitions either under Article 226 (a writ petition) or under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (quashing of FIRs) if this court doesn’t clarify that our petitions were not entertained under Article 32 and not otherwise? If the clarification doesn’t come through, our reliefs will be foreclosed,” Luthra submitted before the bench, which also included justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tandav-makers-can-approach-hcs-for-relief-sc-101611877247147.html
29-01-2021||India||Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: Guv may decide on convict’s pardon plea today||A decision on the release of AG Perarivalan, one of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, is expected to be taken by Tamil Nadu governor Banwarilal Purohit by Friday, when a week’s time according to the Centre’s submission in the Supreme Court ends.On January 21, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the apex court that the governor would take a decision in three or four days on Perarivalan’s plea but the court in its short order stated that it shall be considered in four weeks. On January 22, the court altered its order noting that Mehta submitted that Perarivalan’s application, which he filed with the governor in 2015, will be considered within a week.In 2018, the Supreme Court said that the governor was at liberty to decide on Perarivalan’s remission as he “deemed fit”. Following that, the Tamil Nadu cabinet unanimously passed a resolution for the premature release of the seven convicts in the 1991 case-- Perarivalan, Nalini Sriharan and her husband V Sriharan alias Murugan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran who have been in prison for close to three decades. This has been pending with the governor since. The recommendation, including that of Perarivalan, is under Article 161 which empowers the governor to remit the sentence of a convict.Perarivalan’s hopes were revived when the CBI in one of its affidavits told the top court last November that his release had nothing to do with the agency-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MMDA) probing the larger conspiracy into the case. The governor was said to be waiting for an MMDA report. “There doesn’t seem to be room for any more delays now,” says one of Perarvialan’s counsel’s K Sivakumar. “We had come so close to finding closure in this case before but it didn’t happen, dashing the hopes of his family. Now when Friday has been decided as the final day, it seems like we are reaching a final conclusion and we hope the Governor signs to release them.” On January 22, the court had listed the matter after two weeks.Perarivalan’s mother Arputham Ammal who has valiantly fought for her son as well as the other convicts’ release and advocated against the death penalty is unwell. The family’s supporters, including activists, politicians and legal aides have been trying to protect her from being disappointed.“The governor is only left with options to accept or reject the pardon,” says VCK MP D Ravikumar who accompanied Arputham to meet home minister Amit Shah in 2019 to secure their release.“He is likely to accept Perarivalan’s plea along with Nalini’s also keeping in mind the political situation. We don’t know what may happen with the other five who are Sri Lankan nationals,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-guv-may-decide-on-convict-s-pardon-plea-today-101611876715215.html
29-01-2021||India||Govt appears blind to issue of news channels inciting riots: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday lamented that the Centre appeared “blind” to the growing problem of some news channels inciting riots and violence, underscoring the need for a strong regulatory regime for a crackdown on violators.“They (TV anchors) can shout anything, in any tenor. We don’t mind that. But we are concerned about broadcasts that can instigate people to riots and violence. There are situations which can take away lives of people and can lead to violence and destruction of public properties. We don’t know why you are blind to this problem,” an SC bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde told solicitor general Tushar Mehta.“Ensuring law and order is an important part of governance. Preventing a particular kind of news at a particular point of time is a part of that (law and order). It is as important as providing lathis to policemen. It is as important as any other tool. But you, as a government, do nothing about it. That worries us,” observed the court.Mehta was representing the Centre on a clutch of petitions that complained against the alleged demonisation of Muslims by some TV channels. Petitioner Jamiat Ulama I Hind and others had, in particular, referred to a section of news channels that allegedly sought to spread communal hatred against the community over the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Jamaat meeting ended up being a super-spreader event, one of the first in the country, but it also resulted in skewed coverage on some TV channels.While Mehta admitted that the regulatory regime was not satisfactory with regard to news channels, the bench was unequivocal that certain news items had the propensity of triggering violence and unrest, and that the government was not doing much. “By saying you (government) are blind, we don’t mean anything offensive but the fact is that you are not doing anything about it. The government’s power to control a particular kind of news at a particular point of time is very important,” the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told Mehta.The law officer conceded that the penalty of ₹1 lakh for violation of the broadcasting code was not sufficient, and that the government is considering creating an independent tribunal for dealing with complaints against news channels.The court also referred to how the police had to shut down the Internet in some areas of the National Capital Region after the farmers’ tractor rally on January 26 took a violent turn. “Yesterday, you shut down the Internet because of the farmers’ visit to Delhi. We are using a non-controversial term. You had to shut down Internet. These are problems that can arise anywhere. We don’t mind fair and truthful reporting. The problem arises when it is projected in a way to agitate others,” observed the bench.Advocate Nisha Bhambhani, who appeared for the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), submitted that it acted as an independent body for self–regulation of 24×7 news channels that are members of the News BroadThe Supreme Court on Thursday lamented that the Centre appeared “blind” to the growing problem of some news channels inciting riots and violence, underscoring the need for a strong regulatory regime for a crackdown on violators.“They (TV anchors) can shout anything, in any tenor.

She pointed out that NBSA has its own limitations and that there were certain channels which would gladly cough up ₹1 lakh, which was the maximum penalty for violations, instead of issuing an apology.To this, the bench responded: “But here the problem also will be when someone will be willing to issue an apology after telecasting whatever he feels like. This is why it is important to prevent these things.”Solicitor general Mehta requested the bench to give him some time to bring on record all pertinent laws and rules in this regard. The court adjourned the matter for three weeks, asking all the parties to submit their responses and suggestions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-appears-blind-to-issue-of-news-channels-inciting-riots-sc-101611874671934.html
29-01-2021||India||‘Hostility between govt, Opposition hampers House’: Ex-vice president Ansari||Boycott of the President’s address by Opposition parties may be a symbolic move but the hostility between the ruling party and the opposition is becoming “ugly”, former vice-president of India Hamid Ansari said after leaders of 17 political parties on Thursday said they will boycott President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to Parliament to express protest over the new agriculture laws.Open communication between the government and the Opposition is the prerequisite of parliamentary democracy, Ansari said, adding, “If there is hostility (between the two sides), communication breaks down. And then it (democracy) cannot work.”Ansari said: “Every five years, sides change...Parliamentary democracy requires the observance of certain etiquette or procedures and unless those are observed, the system cannot work.” He said the government of the day has to exercise persuasion as a critical skill for democratic functioning and talk to people on the other side.In his soon-to-be-released memoir, By Many a Happy Accident, Ansari said he never allowed the passage of a bill in the event of a commotion in the House. He didn’t comment on the manner in which the farm laws were passed, with the Opposition walking out but upheld the importance of standing and select committees, the panels the Opposition demanded should scrutinise the bills. “It takes a little time but every step has been carefully calibrated,’’ he said.“We have had a derailment in our system of Parliamentary governance. In the 50s and 60s, the Parliament used to sit for 90-100 days in a year. Now, it is 60 days. How can you finish the work in this time, unless you make undue haste? And undue haste is embodied in these kinds of exercises.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hostility-between-govt-opposition-hampers-house-ex-vice-president-ansari-101611873302417.html
29-01-2021||India||Farmers deny to leave protest site at UP Gate, 'excess police force' removed||Hundreds of Bharatiya Kisan Union members stayed put on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway early on Friday, notwithstanding the Ghaziabad administration’s ultimatum to vacate the UP Gate protest site.A confrontation was building up at the UP Gate in Ghazipur even as frequent power cuts were witnessed in the evening at the protest site, where BKU members, led by Rakesh Tikait, are staying put since November 28.In a post-midnight review of situation, Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey and Senior Superintendent of Police Kalanidhi Naithani visited the protest site even as hundreds of security personnel in anti-riot gears were deployed since Thursday.Flanked by supporters at 1 am, Tikait remained at the centre stage of the protest site -- the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which has been barricaded from both the sides, prohibiting regular traffic movement.Around 500 protestors stayed put at UP Gate with more pouring in from western Uttar Pradesh in the night on the call of the BKU, an influential farmers’ union in North India."Excess security force from the protest site has been withdrawn and only a minimal deployment of personnel remains there," a Ghaziabad police officer told PTI on the condition of anonymity."The tension was building at UP Gate due to excessive deployment of force since Thursday evening," the officer added.Several protestors waved the tricolour with some waving flags of farmer unions like Kisan Ekta Manch amid a continuous sloganeering of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", while many were lying down on mattresses covered in blankets as they braved bone-chilling cold and wind."Zaroorat padi to khade rehke dharna denge, tum dharne pe baithe rehne ki baat karte ho (I can protest while standing up and you are asking whether I am going to continue my sit-in protest)," Jagat Singh Rathi, 78, said.With a muffler tied around his head and a stick in his hand for support while walking, the septuagenarian from Meerut said that he has been at the BKU's protest since its beginning on November 28.Asked if he would vacate the protest site following the administration's communication, he said, "(UP Gate) khaali nahi karenge. We have not seen any such order to vacate the protest site. When the Supreme Court has said that farmers have a right to protest then what? We will do it."The "verbal" communication from the district administration to the BKU on Thursday came close on the heels of three farmer unions withdrawing their protest against the three farm laws over the violence in Delhi on Republic Day."Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey has communicated to the protestors camping at the UP Gate at Delhi border to vacate the spot by tonight or the administration will remove them," a district official had told PTI.Thousands of protesting farmers have been protesting at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-deny-to-leave-protest-site-at-up-gate-excess-police-force-removed-101611870095961.html
29-01-2021||India||Eviction notice, high drama at Ghazipur||Tension hung in the air at a key protest site on the Delhi-Ghaziabad border on Thursday after authorities gave an eviction notice to farmers who have been protesting there since November-end, while they refused to leave the site and alleged a conspiracy to crush their movement.High drama unfolded at the Ghazipur border, where rumour mills were abuzz throughout the day, and a large number of security personnel were deployed with authorities moving to bring an end to the demonstration at the key intersection.Farmers protesting there against three central agricultural laws said that power was disconnected in the area on Wednesday night. They feared that police will use force to evict the demonstrators in the cover of the night.On Thursday morning, they also said that water supply was discontinued, prompting a group of farmers to leave their empty tents behind at UP Gate — as the place is known — and return home.In the evening, hectic parleys began between officials and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, whose Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU)-Tikait group is spearheading the protests there. There were indications that farmers were planning to court arrest peacefully in the evening.But Tikait later said he would fight the “conspiracy” to silence his movement.“We received a notice from the officers and we are ready to surrender and get ourselves peacefully arrested. But now it seems that it’s a larger conspiracy to attack us. Now, we are not moving from here (the protest site) and ready to face bullets. If they (police) will force us, I will hang myself on the stage. Our agitation will now continue and we will remain here only,” Tikait told the gathering in the evening.Tikait broke down on the dais and alleged that the district administration was taking help of some “unruly elements”, who he said were brought to attack farmers after he courted arrest.“So, I have decided that I will not court arrest and will continue the dharna at the site...Police asked me to court arrest, but people owing allegiance to the Bharatiya Janata Party were sent by some local MLAs, and those persons were armed with sticks...,” he said.Tikait is among the farmers’ leaders named in one of the first information reports (FIRs) filed by the Delhi Police in connection with a violent farmers’ protest on Republic Day. BKU-Tikait says the government is “misusing” its powers by registering FIRs against farmers and farm leaders.The Ghazipur border is one of the four border points near Delhi fully or partially blocked by thousands of agitating farmers since their protests began in the last week of November.On Tuesday, groups of farmers deviated from the route agreed upon with authorities for their Republic Day protest and drove their tractors till Delhi’s ITO, where they were involved in a clash with the police.While a smaller protest at the Chilla border nearby ended on Wednesday in the aftermath of the violence, a majority of the protesters at the Ghazipur stayed put.By Thursday morning, a large number of police and paramilitary personnel arrived at the venue and occupied the pavement of the carriageway on the opposite side of the one occupied by the farmers. They brought water cannons and vehicles used for firing tear gas.The turn of events — from seemingly courting arrest to staying put -- at the Ghazipur border caught the district officials by surprise. They eventually walked out of the protest site, and marched to the other side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, where a huge contingent of civil police, Provincial Armed Constabulary jawans and personnel of the Rapid Action Force were deployed.“We served him (Tikait) the notice...for eviction from the site and he was also to be arrested. But he seems to have played a ploy and unexpected events unfolded, in which he refused to leave the site. We have deployed sufficient police and other security personnel at the site and are also in talks with other farmer leaders,” said Ghaziabad additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh, who went to the protest site to serve the notice.By night, the ripples of Thursday’s developments were felt at Muzaffarnagar’s Sisauli village in Uttar Pradesh, where over 5,000 farmers gathered in support of Tikait after his breakdown in front of television cameras.Before officials arrived at the Ghazipur border with a huge contingent of armed police, some people came in groups and began raising slogans against Tikait and demanded complete eviction of protesters from the site.“Tikait is lying since the beginning to farmers and brought them here for the protest. Many of these protesters went to Delhi on Republic Day and clashed with police...He is just trying to evade arrest and making unwanted statements against the BJP and even the BJP MLAs,” said Sunil Sharma, the party legislator from Sahibabad. The area on the Uttar Pradesh side falls under his constituency.“None of the people who arrived near the UP Gate site were BJP supporters; they were local people furious after the incidents at the Red Fort and in Delhi,” Sharma, who was not present at the border on Thursday, said.As tension spiralled, the Delhi Traffic Police closed off entry and exit from Ghazipur border on Thursday evening. Till afternoon, vehicles going from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh were allowed, while the opposite carriageway was closed. The action led to long traffic snarls in the national capital, with commuters getting stuck for several hours amid unannounced diversions and high traffic volume. Snarls were reported on the Noida Link Road, Ashram crossing, Vikas Marg, ITO intersection, Sarai Kale Khan, Barapullah, Pragati Maidan, Bhairon Marg and Lajpat Nagar.Satpal Singh, a farmer from Rampur, said many protesters left the site after panic set in. “It was a trick that the police used to intimidate farmers,” he said, referring to allegations that power and water connections were disrupted at the site.Sompal Singh, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar, said, “Since it was dark, we switched on lights of our tractors and lit log fires at many places,” he said.The standoff continued till the time of going to print.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eviction-notice-high-drama-at-ghazipur-101611868796538.html
29-01-2021||India||An overview of justice delivery across all states||The second edition of the India Justice Report by Tata Trusts, compiled in collaboration with civil society organisations to assess the capacity of various states to deliver justice, was released on Thursday. The report uses statistics compiled by states to rank 18 large and mid-sized states, and seven small states, and compares their performance based on parameters across what it calls the four pillars of the justice delivery system: judiciary, police, prisons, and legal aid. Using a quantitative measurement of budgets, vacancies in human resources, diversity in gender, workload, and infrastructure, the report uses 87 indicators to rank a state against other states, many of them over the last five years as well as since the previous report. Here’s a look at the highlights on how states performed in 2019-2020.1. Toppers, low performing statesIn both reports — the first edition corresponded to the year 2019; the second corresponds to 2020 — the topper remains Maharashtra, while Uttar Pradesh ranks the last among large and mid-sized states. Two other states, Punjab and Uttarakhand, remain at the same rank as before: 4th and 15th, respectively. But across the categories, two states have shown a remarkable jump in rankings: Telangana and Jharkhand, now at the 3rd and 8th positions respectively, have shown a concomitant rise of eight spots each. Karnataka and MP, on the other hand, recorded the biggest drop in ranking, by eight and seven spots respectively.Among the small states, Tripura has shot right up to the top from the bottom of the pile. Sikkim maintained its second position in these seven states. Among all states, southern and western ones, in general, ranked better. The report has not ranked the UTs and four states where the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is enforced (Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur and Nagaland).2. A closer look reveals wide disparityThe overall rankings, though a composite measure of a state’s standing in the country, do not mean that a state actually has the best or the worst overall justice delivery systems in place. The overall ranking is a result of a state’s ranking across the four pillars of justice delivery system. To understand what a state lacks or is good at, one needs to look at these subcategories. There is only one state, Jharkhand, whose rank has improved across the four pillars. Only two states, Bihar and Telangana, have got better at three pillars, while 12 states have ranked better in one or two pillars. On the contrary, three states have recorded a drop in their ranks across all four pillars. These include Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and Haryana. Three other states have recorded a drop in their ranks across three pillars. These are Kerala, Maharashtra, and Gujarat. To be sure, a drop in ranking does not necessarily mean that the state of affairs in a state has got worse in absolute terms but that the other states have improved more than it, making them rank better. In fact, every state has shown improvement in at least some of the indicators across the four pillars.3. Here's how states got better﻿Maharashtra, the state that has ranked first overall, actually ranks first in only one pillar, legal aid, while it is a laggard in terms of police, where it is behind 12 other states. Chhattisgarh has made big gains in judiciary (an eight-spot jump) primarily due to increased number of high court judges and decreased pendency in subordinate courts. The state has also made an eight-spot jump — the biggest among all states — in terms of police. This is primarily because of an increase in the total number of officers and a more diverse police force in terms of gender and caste representation other than decreased vacancies. Rajasthan has made big gains in prisons (ranking 1st in 2020 compared to 12th in 2019), according to the report because of better budget utilisation, more officers and cadre staff, reduced overcrowding and an increase in women prison staff. In terms of legal aid, Bihar has made the biggest gain (ranking 2nd in 2020 compared to 16th in 2019). This, the report said, is because of better utilisation of funds, more legal clinics, and an increase in the number of women in paralegal services.Spotting the lackAlthough the report primarily ranks states for the sense of competitiveness, it also highlights several shortcomings in the justice delivery system at the national level. This includes a lack of diversity in the police force and judiciary, high vacancies across pillars, high prison occupancy rates, high proportion of undertrial prisoners, case pendency in high courts and subordinate courts, and access to justice delivery institutions being skewed against rural populations.Source: Bureau of Police Research and Development, Prison Statistics India, National Judicial Data Grid, websites of high courts, department of justice, National Legal Services Authority||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-overview-of-justice-delivery-across-all-states-101611867639836.html

West Bengal has five per cent of tribal population, he reminded.“This is the launch of our party's poll campaign; I will come again,” said Hemant Soren.The JMM had contested 22 assembly seats in the 2016 state polls in West Bengal. This time the party is eyeing 25 to 30 seats in the neighbouring state.Slamming the Centre he said the new farm laws were against the interest of the farmers. He also mentioned that the Centre was also planning land reforms.The Jharkhand chief minister observed that everything was on sale be it railways, airlines, airports and wondered if blood would be cheaper than water in the future.He said that polls are the stepping stone to democracy and appealed to the people to vote. Every vote counts, he stressed.Jharkhand minister Champai Soren, JMM legislators Samir Mahanty and Ramdas Soren, West Bengal state unit secretary Bittu Murmu, party general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya and veteran leader Hidayat Khan also addressed the gathering.Reacting on the JMM rally, Trinamool Congress president and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said it was unfair.“What is this? I was the first person to attend his swearing-in ceremony and offer my full support to him and his party. And today he has come to Bengal to contest elections. He wants to field candidates. This is unfair.”Addressing members of various non-Bengali communities at the Trinamool Congress headquarters on Thursday afternoon she said a large number of Bengalis are based in Jharkhand.“Should we go there to contest polls? Maybe we should do that,” said Banerjee while appealing to the non-Bengali community to support the TMC and campaign against the BJP.(With Inputs from Kolkata Bureau)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-cm-hemant-soren-launches-jmm-poll-campaign-in-bengal-mamata-fumes-101611861077319.html

29-01-2021||India||2 Congress legislators from Puducherry join BJP after quitting key posts||In a setback to the ruling Congress in Puducherry, its former legislators who were expelled from the party and resigned on Monday have joined the BJP in Delhi on Thursday.Puducherry’s Congress unit sacked its public works minister, A Namassivayam for ‘anti-party’ activities after he made statements regarding quitting. Subsequently, he resigned from the cabinet and MLA’s post along with another Congress MLA and his supporter E Theepaindan. The duo called on senior BJP leaders in Delhi and vowed to bring the BJP to power in the poll-bound union territory. Union home minister Amit Shah tweeted a photo with the new members along with party president JP Nadda.Nadda is scheduled to arrive in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai on Friday night to hold high level meetings and also give a public speech on January 30 in the district. On the following day, he will be in Puducherry. The BJP which barely has a presence in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry is on a recruiting spree.“Those who join BJP in Puducherry or Tamil Nadu will be lost,” Puducherry chief minister N Narayanasamy had said earlier this week. With the exit of the two MLAs, the strength of the Congress in the Puducherry assembly has come down to 12 where its ally DMK has three seats. Congress and DMK are also facing trouble though Rahul Gandhi said that he has faith in the relationship during his visit to Tamil Nadu earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-congress-legislators-from-puducherry-join-bjp-after-quitting-key-posts-101611859098632.html
29-01-2021||India||BJYM leader in Madhya Pradesh among 20 booked for smuggling cows to Maharashtra||Twenty people including a local leader of the Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) were booked in Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh for allegedly smuggling of cows and oxen to slaughter houses of Maharashtra, police said Thursday.The police rescued 165 cows and oxen from a forest area of Balaghat which were being herded to a village near the Maharashtra border, said Raghunath Khatarkar, town inspector Lalpur police station, Balaghat.An FIR has been registered against 20 people including the main accused Manoj Pardhi and Arvind Pathak and 18 others under section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of IPC and under relevant sections of Madhya Pradesh Gau Vansh Pratishedh Adhiniyam 2004, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and MP Krishak Pashu Parikshan Adhiniyam, said the officer. Police arrested 10 people while Manoj and Arvind with eight others are absconding.Manoj Pardhi is said to be a general secretary of BJYM.The police officer said, “The main accused Manoj and Arvind used to purchase cows and other cattle from Maubazar, a cattle fair in Balaghat. Later, they used to hire herders to drive away the cattle to Bodalkasa village located on Maharashtra border. From Bodalkasa village, a trader used to supply cattle to slaughter houses of Maharashtra.”Acting on tip off that cows were being smuggled for slaughter, a police team raided in the forest area of Balaghat from where they rescued at least 165 bovines in 10 hours.Balaghat superintendent of police Abhishek Tiwari said, “We are investigating the matter. It is an organised gang involved in smuggling of cows. Police are trying to nab the accused."BJP Balaghat district president Gajendra Bhardwaj said, "We just came to know about it. We are looking into the matter."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjym-leader-in-madhya-pradesh-among-20-booked-for-smuggling-cows-to-maharashtra-101611858860226.html
29-01-2021||India||Tension at farm protest sites as forces build up||Security forces dug trenches, put up barricades, and bolstered numbers at farmer protest sites on Delhi’s borders on Thursday, as tensions simmering since a violent Republic Day tractor rally threatened to boil over at Ghazipur on the eastern fringe of the Capital, where authorities issued an ultimatum to defiant cultivators, who refused to budge.Cracks have started to appear in the 64-day-old protest, which has lost momentum after the deadly turn of events on January 26 when farmer groups broke through barricades, clashed violently with police, ran riot on the Capital’s streets, and stormed the Red Fort, hoisting the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, on its ramparts.Thursday’s standoff began in the afternoon when Ghaziabad additional district magistrate (city) Shailendra Kumar Singh asked protesters at UP Gate to end their two-month-long stir and vacate the spot at the earliest, or face penal action.The order came hours after protesters said power and water supply to the site were cut off, and hundreds of policemen streamedinto the site. Police also diverted traffic on arterial roads connecting Delhi to UP and Haryana, and closed several checkpoints, such as Auchandi and Piau.“We served him (Rakesh Tikait) the notice under section 133 of CrPC (conditional order for removal of nuisance) for eviction from the site and he was also to be arrested later on. But he seems to have played a ploy and unexpected events unfolded in which he refused to leave the site,” said Singh.But the farmers refused to move, with Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait saying he may approach the Supreme Court.“There is no question of vacating Ghazipur. Police can do whatever they want,” he said, as small groups of people shouted anti-farmer slogans. “The government wants to destroy farmers. If the farm laws are not repealed, Rakesh Tikait will commit suicide,” he told the agitators late evening, breaking down towards the end of the address.As night fell, a large police contingent and protesting farmers were positioned on either side of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, and Tikait announced a hunger strike. With visuals of Tikait breaking down beamed on television, around 5,000 farmers gathered at his ancestral village of Sisauli, roughly 100km away, and threatened to march to UP Gate.At the time of going to print, the standoff continued.Farmers, primarily from western UP, have been sitting in Ghazipur for about two months. Tikait’s brother, Naresh Tikait, announced in Muzaffarnagar that the agitation will be withdrawn. On Wednesday, at least two other unions had pulled out of the protests and the farm unions called off a march to Parliament on February 1, the day the Union budget will be presented. The unions lost more momentum on Thursday when another union, BKU (Lokshakti), which was camped at Noida, pulled out.Tension has been building at Delhi’s borders since the January 26 violence. Police and the government have accused farm leaders of betraying their trust, vandalising property worth crores, and threatening lives. Farm unions have taken responsibility for the violence, but blamed fringe elements led by Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu.At Singhu, on the Capital’s northwestern border, the biggest of the four sites for farmer mobilisation, police increased security, blocked major entry points to the site, installed more concrete barriers using cranes and dug trenches using a JCB machine.At around 12pm, nearly 50 people gathered and demanded that the protest be cleared. “We had been sympathetic to their cause so far because we too are farmers. But when we saw their actions during Republic Day, when they insulted the Tricolour at Red Fort, we knew that they were not farmers,” said Mohan Bhardwaj, 42, a resident of Bawana.The farm unions dismissed this demand and said they will continue their movement against three recently passed laws that they claim will erode their bargaining power and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by corporate giants.“The protests are not about sites but issues of farmers’ livelihoods. We will atone for the violence with a fast and whoever doesn’t agree with our peaceful goals are free to leave but the protests will continue as they are. They will only expand,” said Avik Saha, the national secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a farmers’ organisation that plays a key role in the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body leading the protests.Farm unions have called for a day-long fast on January 30, Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, as a step towards “atonement” and taking moral responsibility for Tuesday’s violence.Delhi Police have already named senior leaders in their first information reports, including Yogendra Yadav, Balbeer Singh Rajewal, Buta Singh, SS Pannu, and Darshan Pal. Farm unions said they were prepared to face jail but won’t retreat. “When we began the agitation, we expected repression from the government. We didn’t expect cakes,” Saha said.The protesters also received political support from Opposition leaders. “Time to pick a side. My decision is clear. I am with democracy, farmers and their peaceful movement,” tweeted former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh spoke to the Tikait brothers over phone, announced Singh’s son Jayant Chaudhary. “Don’t worry. This is a do or die situation for the farmers. We need to remain together and united,” Singh told the farm leaders, according to a tweet by Chaudhary.Late in the evening, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar announced that members of BKU (Lok Shakti), which wasn’t a part of SKM, met him and announced their withdrawal from the stir. “BKU (Lok Shakti) condemns the way some elements spread havoc in Delhi,” read a letter to Tomar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-at-farm-protest-sites-as-forces-build-up-101611858252881.html

Bahrain is home to 350,000 Indians, the largest expatriate community, and New Delhi had facilitated the travel of Indian medical professionals to Manama last year to cope with the pandemic.Indian high commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay offered prayers at Gangaramaya Temple for the well-being of the people of Sri Lanka and handed over the vaccines to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Rajapaksa said on Twitter: “Received 500,000 #COVID-19 vaccines provided by #peopleofindia at #BIA today (28). Thank you! PM Shri @narendramodi & #peopleofindia for the generosity shown towards #PeopleofSriLanka at this time in need.”Since the launch of the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative on January 20, India has gifted vaccines to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Seychelles, and Mauritius. “We plan to gift further quantities to Oman (100,000 doses), CARICOM countries (500,000 doses), Nicaragua (200,000 doses) and Pacific Island states (200,000 doses),” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sends-600k-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-bahrain-sri-lanka-101611857651867.html

29-01-2021||India||Vaccine safe for people on blood thinners: ICMR||Using blood thinners may not be a possible risk factor for coronavirus vaccines and the government is considering allowing companies to drop it as a contraindication from the product fact-sheet, top officials said on Thursday.“The relative contraindication regarding the blood thinners is mentioned in the fact-sheet of both the vaccines and both the companies have written to the drugs controller general of India (DCGI) regarding changing this point in the fact-sheet,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“Blood thinners are of two categories- one is antiplatelets that are aspirin, or Clopidogrel and these are not a problem at all; the second is anticoagulants which are drugs like heparin etc. and those patients on these drugs have a much higher tendency to bleed. The only worry is that there can be a local haematoma (blood clot) or local swelling can occur where the injection site is. It is a very relative contraindication,” he said.The fact-sheets put out by both the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers had listed use of blood thinners as one of the contraindications for use of Covid-19 vaccine, which experts believe could have led to a huge chunk of Indians choosing to avoid getting the shots. A family of drugs that fall loosely under the umbrella are widely in use in the country due to rising numbers of people with cardiovascular diseases.“The anticoagulant can be stopped for one or two days prior to giving the vaccine for those on this drug. For other blood thinners like aspirin or Clopidogrel, there are no contraindications, and that will be corrected and rectified in the fact-sheet as soon as the drugs control gives permission for the same,” Dr Bhargava explained.Doctors say use of blood thinners is not a big concern in people lined up for vaccination. “It is like the annual flu shot, and people on blood thinners also take the flu shot. This is not a major concern,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former, head of pulmonology and sleep medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Science, Delhi.India has set a target of vaccinating an estimated 300 million high risk population by August. In the first phase, 20 million health care and frontline workers will be vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccination drive began on January 16 in the country with health care workers getting vaccinated.“As on today 9,000 vaccination sessions are held across the country in a day, which had started with 3,374 on the day of the launch. We track number of sessions scheduled, conducted and beneficiaries vaccinated. And what is the target and what has been the success rate,” said Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Union health and family welfare ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-safe-for-people-on-blood-thinners-icmr-101611857471941.html
29-01-2021||India||5,000 doses wasted in five states so far: Data||Close to 5,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines have been wasted in some states since the vaccination drive began on January 16, data from five states suggests, with at least one – Tripura – reporting the losses to be more than the 10% threshold that the government has identified as possibly unavoidable due to the scale of the drive.The wastage have largely been due to vaccinators not finding enough recipients after opening vials, which need to be used up within four hours. The problem is particularly hard to avoid since the two vaccines approved in India for use come in vials of 10 or 20 doses.“So far, 1,623 or 11% of the total vaccine doses were wasted as many beneficiaries were not available during vaccination and droplets fall while shifting it to syringes. Another thing is that we need to use one vial within four hours after which it is of no use,” said Dr Kallol Roy, Tripura’s immunisation officer.Authorities addressed the problem of wastage to some degree by allowing vaccinators to call in people who were not scheduled to get doses on a particular day, helping increase turnout to compensate for hesitancy. But, since January 16, only about 55 people have turned up for every 100 selected and invited for a dose during every session.On Thursday, this number was – on an average – 49 out of every 100 in the close 500,000 vaccinations that took place.“When we started the Covid-19 vaccination programme, we had factored in a 10% wastage across the country. We have issued very detailed guidelines to the states and UTs about how to avoid wastage of vaccines. We have made our digital platform more flexible and we have permitted that apart from the scheduled hundred people, the person who is handling the vaccination session at a particular site can add additional people as long as they are part of the database,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan while responding to a question on how much wastage was occurring, during the government’s Covid-19 briefing Thursday. He did not give a number for the losses but said the data will be shared once the ministry analyses it.In Punjab, this number was 1,200 doses, as per the state’s nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. He said the overall number was well below the permissible limit of 10%. “As one vial of the Covishield contains 10 doses, vaccinators have been asked try to give shots of vaccine when there are ten receivers together,” he said. The state conducts vaccination four days a week and no shots were given on Wednesday.Health officials in Bihar too said the wastage was with within the 10% limit till now. However, wastage of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was more because of its larger vial size as compared to Serum Institute’s Covishield, an official said.In the Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), where the wastage was as high as 25% last week, fewer doses are now being lost. “In case of Covaxin, it is difficult to mobilise 20 health care workers at a time, given that hospital functioning should not be interrupted,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna. Covshield was being administered at 295 of the total 301 session sites in Bihar.Dr Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, Uttarakhand’s immunization officer, said 4.1% doses of close to 14,500 got wasted. “We have issued instructions to minimise wastage,” he said.Of the 194,048 vaccines given till January 28, Odisha lost 0.58% — or 1,125 doses, said director of family welfate, DR BK Panigrahy.Health officials in Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala and Chhattisgarh said there was no wastage.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5000-doses-wasted-in-five-states-so-far-data-101611857411912.html

29-01-2021||Today's||What went wrong on Republic Day?||It was meant to be the moment in the sun for Indian farmers. After two months of protesting in the freezing winter cold, this was a chance to celebrate their identity in a truly unique manner. The tractor was the farmers’ badge of pride, their version of the mighty tanks that would roll down Rajpath on Republic Day. As one of them, furiously waving the tricolour, told us: If jawans can march at Rajpath, why can’t we kisans also have our tractor parade? Every jawan is after all also a kisan!”It didn’t take long for the reverie to be shaken. By forenoon, it was clear that there were a section of the farmers who had turned a potentially momentous occasion into a recipe for violent confrontation. Breaking police barricades, changing the agreed route, and heading straight towards central Delhi, the farmer-protester was now transformed into an ugly street thug. It wasn’t as if every farmer was part of the mob. There were enough farmers who, dressed in their colourful shirts and striking headgear, were still determined to make this a joyful occasion. Some were being showered with flowers along the route even as others more menacingly wielded lathis and swords. Whereas some adhered to the great Sikh tradition of offering langar food to those passing by, others were driving their tractors straight at the police pickets.So why would farmer groups, all seemingly driven by the same goal of a repeal in farm laws, react so differently? Why did some groups turn rogue, break all rules, eventually pushing their way into the hallowed Red Fort area? Only a transparent inquiry will reveal the truth, but it is increasingly apparent that to treat farm protestors as a monolithic entity which would act in perfect unison was always a misreading of the ground situation. The farmers, after all, represent more than 30 small and large unions, different jathas, and come from varied groups across different regions. A call for repealing farm laws may have united them, but their political ideologies stretched across the spectrum. Like with any large movement, this was akin to a Shivji ki baarat, a real disparate gathering of just about anyone who wished to join the bandwagon. What, for example, did a psephologist-turned-activist neta like Yogendra Yadav have in common with actor, Sunny Deol groupie and a Khalistani sloganeer such as Deep Sidhu? Just where did a dyed-in-the-wool Leftist such as Hannan Mollah fit in with an aggressively ambitious political farm entrepreneur like Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union? To have then expected thousands of tractors to conform to a rigid plan of action was always being unrealistic. Why the Delhi Police, despite their better judgment, allowed the political leadership to overrule their objections to a tractor rally of this magnitude is still a mystery. The Delhi Police, to its credit, acted with professionalism and showed extreme restraint in the face of grave provocation by an unruly mob. But facing the dual task of manning capital security and dealing with an unprecedented tractor rally, an over-stretched police force was out-numbered. If the police perhaps underestimated the tractor rally, the farm leaders overestimated their ability to rein in such a large and diverse grouping. For two months, the farmers, quite remarkably, kept their peace, perhaps hoping that the sheer symbolism of their peaceful protest would force an all powerful Centre to relent. They almost succeeded — in the last week, it was apparent that the government was under pressure to concede to most of the farmer demands. Perhaps carried away with their success, farm unions overplayed their hand. In a sense, farm leaders must accept moral responsibility for the violence that has de facto delegitimised their unique protest. This farm movement was driven by an ethical code until now, a wider public acceptance that the “kisan as anna-datta” (food provider) cannot be taken for granted. But the deeply troubling images of the protesters forcibly entering Red Fort, attacking the police at various places and threatening mediapersons have shaken the romantic illusion of the hardworking farmer as men and women of honour. By breaking the law, the tractor became a weapon of self-destruction.The Centre, too, needs to course correct. For the longest time, the government has been trapped in hubris, a state of mind which views any street protest as “anti-national” and a challenge to its dominance. A directionless Opposition, too, has fished in troubled waters while piggybacking on the protests. Had there been greater trust and goodwill on all sides, there would have been less reason to push the agitation to breaking point. Even now, it is not too late for a resolution if only this is not seen as a prestige issue. For now, the violence has seriously dented the credibility of a protest movement that seemed genuine and spontaneous while the majesty of the Indian State has also taken a hit. Republic Day 2021 will go down as the day when the inspirational “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” slogan lost a bit of its sheen. Post-script: The death of one farmer on January 26 when a tractor overturned while attempting to ram into a police barricade has made headlines and become a symbol of the anarchic few hours in central Delhi. But what of the 60-odd farmers who have died in the extreme cold during the protests over the last two months? Who will mourn for them?Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/what-went-wrong-on-republic-day-101611843311646.html
29-01-2021||Today's||From State policies to actions, how Trump is being held accountable||In the first three days of his new administration, United States (US) President Joe Biden signed a total of 30 executive actions aimed at stopping or reversing Donald Trump’s policies. They include executive orders to terminate the construction of a nearly 2,000-mile long wall on the US-Mexican border; end the Muslim ban that restricted entry of citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries; return the US to the World Health Organization; rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change; and, halt the crackdown on immigration to the US.Biden has moved fast to unveil a stimulus package to kickstart the US economy. The damage done by the former president, who came to power promising to “put Americans back to work” is reflected in a simple data point — more Americans were in the workforce when he entered the Oval Office on January 20, 2017, than when he left on January 20. But the immediate priority for Biden is tackling Covid-19 on a war-footing. Under Trump’s watch, more than 400,000 Americans lost their lives to a virus that he constantly downplayed. Before the failed insurrection he inspired on January 6, few had expected Trump to fade away quietly. The conventional wisdom was that he was going to travel across the country addressing tens of thousands of adoring supporters, getting his loyalists elected to various local, state and federal races, and remaining relevant in national politics to make another potential presidential run in 2024.In addition to these political activities, which would freeze the 2024 GOP primary field, there was another equally pressing matter — rescuing his business, which has been losing money every year since his presidential bid in 2015. January 6 changed all of those calculations, and turned much of the country, except for Trump loyalists and committed Republican supporters, against him. Trump ran the country for four years without being held accountable by anyone. The defeat on November 3 and Trump’s subsequent incendiary actions, culminating in the insurrection of January 6, has changed all that. Because of those failures, Trump has entered the accountability zone. After being impeached by the House of Representatives for the second time, the first president to suffer that fate twice, he could be convicted by the US Senate in a trial to begin in the week of February 8.To some extent, the likelihood of conviction will depend on the quality of the case made during the trial. To a greater extent, it will depend on what direction former Senate Majority Leader and now Minority Leader Mitch McConnell decides to take the Republican Senate establishment.If the Republican establishment senators conclude that Trump is guilty and that it is in the country and the party’s best interest to convict him, they will vote to do so. They understand that if Trump is not convicted, he will be a major disruptive and destructive force and the Republican Party will remain a Trump party. On the other hand, if he is gone, the Republican leadership will have a chance to refocus the party away from Trumpism. The Senate trial is just the first of many landmines Trump will have to navigate going forward. He is also likely to face an array of civil and criminal lawsuits at the federal and state levels, on issues ranging from financial illegalities, to abuse of power, and insurrection-related charges.Even before the Capitol riots, several of Trump’s businesses were under water. He needs to come up with more than $400 million in the next few years to pay back various lenders. His ability to raise that kind of money seems unlikely due to the fact that Trump’s businesses have been built around the Trump brand. The value of that brand had diminished significantly for many in the US before the January 6 insurrection. That event made the brand almost toxic. What a difference an election can make. In 2016, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats learned the hard way that votes indeed have consequences. Now it’s Trump’s and the GOP’s turn to learn that.Frank F Islam is an entrepreneur, civic leader, and thought leader based in Washington DC.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-state-policies-to-actions-how-trump-is-being-held-accountable-101611842773681.html
29-01-2021||Today's||How the Covid-19 reset can help firms build a sustainable future||The onset of the pandemic has led to the creation of large quantities of untreated medical waste in the form of disinfectants, masks, personal protective equipment and gloves. The disposal of such waste will pose a threat to the environment. The positive news during the pandemic was, of course, the significant improvement in air quality, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and less water pollution, all of which help in restoring ecological systems. Many learnings have emerged out of our dealing with the unforeseen situation, which includes increased focus on stable, sustainable economies, clean and green environment and above all, quality of life. It has put a spotlight on the need to create an equitable society, with aligned benefits. These critical life lessons must be turned into concrete actions.The pandemic has been a cautious reminder for the world to rethink and re-imagine new possibilities of doing business in order to build a sustainable world. It has been widely affirmed and established now that tackling global challenges like economic stability, climate risks and resource availability, among other things, needs a collaborative approach. Therefore, we must begin by incorporating systemic changes into our systems and process, combined with the power of technology and digitalisation. Sustainability should be fed into the root of everything that we do. The pandemic has specifically elevated the significance of social factors in the current moment, and environmental factors in the long-term. According to a study by the University of Oxford, there is a positive correlation between the average environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores of organisations and their countries’ macro-economic performance.A sustainable economy that promotes equality, facilitates self-reliance and prosperity and is environmentally sound is what all nations should aspire to. Transitioning to such a global economy is indeed a challenging task. Investors are increasingly looking for concrete evidence that organisations are incorporating sustainability into their functioning. As business leaders, we must take care to define corporate purpose in alignment to socio-environmental benefit. Businesses must mitigate risk and drive profitable growth by investing in sustainable innovations that positively impact the world. We must continue to put our bets on e-fuels and other efficient inventions that reduce effort and risk. Leveraging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Analytics and Blockchain will help resolve sustainability issues. Sustainability remains a top priority for deﬁning long-term resilience as it is a critical aspect of all business strategies and bets for the new future. Today’s leaders are faced with an incredible opportunity to carve out a new future for their businesses by importing the principles of sustainability into their strategy. The onus now lies with us to strike the right balance and build businesses which are profitable and sustainable in the new normal of a post-Covid world.

29-01-2021||Editorials||A productive budget session||On Friday, Parliament convened for its Budget Session. The pandemic shortened the Budget Session last year, and the winter session was not held at all. This makes the current session even more significant, for it is not just the Union Budget 2021-22 which needs to be tabled, discussed and passed, but a range of other issues which merit greater deliberation in the space which symbolises the expression of popular sovereignty. Unfortunately, the Budget Session has started off with a note of discord — with most Opposition parties boycotting the President’s address to register their resistance to the farm laws and the Centre’s handling of the protests. Instead of the government skirting a debate or the Opposition walking out, it is crucial to have a structured discussion on agriculture, reforms, protests and what happened on January 26 in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Remember, it was because the legislative process was fast-tracked that apprehensions about the laws deepened. An open discussion — with both supportive and critical points of views being expressed freely — will help send a signal that the appetite for debate is alive, and assure farmers that their concerns are being articulated in Parliament. India has faced a national security, public health and economic crisis over the past year. And each of these elements needs greater deliberation too. The standoff with China has persisted — and a lot has happened since raksha mantri Rajnath Singh last briefed Parliament. The government would do well to put out a detailed statement on the exact state of play both in the western and eastern sectors, and what it plans to do to oust China from Indian territory. The pandemic has abated — but there is no room for complacency. As the vaccination drive intensifies, Parliament should see a discussion on India’s record in handling the pandemic so far. And, of course, given that this is the Budget Session, there must be a comprehensive discussion on each element of India’s economic story, from the macro- economic indicators and revival in select sectors to the persistence of high unemployment and entrenchment of structural inequalities. All of this is possible only if both the Treasury and Opposition benches recognise that they differ, but the expression of these differences must happen on the floor of the House. The government must shed any unilateralism, and the Opposition must shed any plans of disruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-productive-budget-session-101611926662444.html
29-01-2021||Editorials||Rebooting the vaccine plan||Ten days into its large-scale campaign to equip citizens against Covid-19, India completed two million vaccinations. The government has hailed it as the fastest at the outset for any country, a feat that was almost inevitable due to India’s unique position — it has the world’s largest pharma-manufacturing capacities and experience of immunising people at scale. It is no surprise then that the country inoculated close to 200,000 people on average over the last week — a threshold few have surpassed. But it is also crucial to remember that except for China, no other country has as many people as India does. In fact, the number of people on India’s priority list for vaccinations — 300 million — is close to the population of the United States, where experts have called for three million vaccinations a day to cover the entire country by July.Within days of the launch, authorities across India encountered initial challenges. There were glitches in the digital platform to track the factory-to-injection process and there was an unexpectedly high level of hesitancy. The glitches were soon ironed out, and a massive awareness campaign to target vaccine sceptics was launched. But these have led to little improvement in daily vaccination rates. On average, across the country, roughly 55 people have turned up for every 100 invited for a vaccination session. Altogether, only 0.15 doses have been given per 100 people. And this challenge is going to become starker come February 13, when people who have received their first shots will need to be given their second doses.To accelerate the campaign, India needs to take urgent steps soon. This newspaper had called for a million Covid-19 tests to tackle the pandemic — it is now time to aim for a million vaccinations every day, which will help touch 100 million people by April. The first step can be kickstarting immunisation of frontline workers such as police and sanitation staff now — a group of 20 million who are next on the priority list. They can also be catered to at pop-up centres or close to their workplaces, which will help expand visibility and possibly even help address some of the hesitancy. The pandemic may have abated in India, but that is exactly why this is the time to go full steam ahead with an ambitious logistical drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/rebooting-the-vaccine-plan-101611843131404.html
