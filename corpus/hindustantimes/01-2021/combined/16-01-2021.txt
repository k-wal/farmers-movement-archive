Majority of beneficiaries showed reluctance to receive shots of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which is still in phase 3 trials.As many as 18,122 beneficiaries out of a target of 29,240 across 301 session sites got the first dose of the vaccine in Bihar on Saturday.However, only 49 per cent of those enrolled turned up at the six session sites (vaccination centres) where Covaxin was being administered. As against 600 beneficiaries, only 265 turned up to receive the Covaxin shots.AIIMS-Patna, Patna Medical College College, Nalanda Medical College, Sri Krishna Medical College (Muzaffarpur), Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (Bhagalpur) and Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College in Gaya were among the six session sites selected to administer Covaxin.AIIMS-Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh was among those to have taken the Covaxin shot, said a communique from the institute.At NMCH, for instance, 31 out of 100 beneficiaries turned up to take the Covaxin shot.Also read: Maharashtra suspends Covid-19 vaccine drive till Jan 18 due to CoWIN app glitchThe response to Serum Institute’s Covishield was better with 17,857 of the targeted 28,640 beneficiaries taking it on day one — an acceptance of 62 per cent. Serum Institute’s Covishield was administered to beneficiaries at 295 session sites in Bihar.“There is no question of forcing anyone to take the vaccine shots. Taking the vaccine is desirable, not mandatory,” said Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit.The state had planned to vaccinate 100 beneficiaries across each session site. However, it could not cobble up the required number as some session sites at private health facilities had less than 100 beneficiaries, said executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar (SHSB), Manoj Kumar, who is also the nodal officer for vaccination in the state.In the case of both vaccines, recipients will get two doses four weeks apart and the effects will start showing 14 days after the second dose.Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, excluding holidays, have been identified as vaccination days in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/62-turnout-on-day-1-of-vaccination-drive-in-bihar-tepid-response-to-covaxin-101610820552982.html

It was the 12th case related to the murders in Nithari village of Noida and Koli faced capital punishment in all the cases. On Friday, the CBI court had held Koli guilty but acquitted his employer Moninder Singh Pandher in the case.The victim in the case was a domestic help who was lured by Koli at his employer’s house on November 12, 2006 and he later strangled her before attempting rape, said a public prosecutor. “The court termed the crime as the rarest of rare and pronounced death penalty for Koli. In all twelve cases, we demanded maximum punishment and capital punishment was awarded to him in all cases at Ghaziabad. Now, four more cases are pending trial. Three of these are in advanced stages of evidence while statements of witnesses are getting recorded in one other,” said JP Sharma, special public prosecutor for CBI. Koli was facing trial in the case for IPC sections 302 (murder), 364 (abduction), 376/511 (attempted rape) and 201 (destruction of evidence). The court on Saturday awarded him death penalty under IPC section 302, life imprisonment under section 364, five years rigorous punishment under section 376/511 and seven years imprisonment under section 201. “Besides, the court also levied penalties under different sections which amount to ₹1.10 lakh. During the arguments for sentencing, we said that the act was a barbaric and the accused does not deserve any sympathy,” Sharma added. Koli’s employer Pandher was also a co-accused in the case. However, Pandher was acquitted of all charges in the case by the court. The infamous Nithari murders were believed to be committed between 2005 and 2006. In December 2006, skeletons were found in a drain near to a house in Nithari, which led to the discovery of the crime. Pandher is the owner of the house and Koli was his domestic help.The CBI, which investigated the case from 2007, registered 16 cases, charge sheeting Koli in all of them for murder, abduction, rape, besides destruction of evidence, and Pandher in one for immoral trafficking. The Ghaziabad court, however, summoned Pandher in five other cases after several victims’ families approached it.In 11 previous cases, the court had found Koli guilty in all and had awarded the death sentence all of which are now pending appeal in higher courts. With Friday’s ruling, Pandher has been acquitted in two cases.The first case related to the Nithari killings was decided at Ghaziabad on February 13, 2009, when both Koli and Pandher were awarded death penalty. Following an appeal, the Allahabad high court acquitted Pandher of all charges while Koli’s punishment was upheld. Following a petition later, Koli’s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the high court in January, 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/koli-gets-twelfth-death-penalty-in-another-nithari-killing-case-101610820111187.html

The driver was on his way back with seven silver ingots, of which one was stolen allegedly by the suspects, claiming an “official investigation” of the goods. A case of cheating had been registered at the Sector 39 police station in this regard.The suspects were identified as Vikrant Singh, Shaukinder Kumar and Dharmendra, residents of Bulandshahr, Meerut and Ghaziabad, respectively. Police officers said that Vikrant, a home guard jawan, was deployed with the Sector 20 police station but had been away from work for the past five to six months. Shaukinder was a jeweller who was allegedly going to buy the stolen silver, while Dharmendra was allegedly the mediator between the robbers and the jeweller, and worked on commission. They had all allegedly known each other for the past few years, said the police.“Vikrant, along with another person, who is also a home guard jawan and is currently absconding, had intercepted the driver on January 13. They pretended to be from a government department and while claiming that the silver should be collected from a police station, they fled the spot with the goods,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), Zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police traced the suspects to a jeweller in Meerut where the precious metal was allegedly about to be sold.“All three suspects were apprehended from the jewellery shop along with the stolen goods which they were about to sell. The KTM motorcycle used in the incident was also recovered,” said the ADCP.Police, however, did not reveal how the suspects were traced.Officers said the suspects were allegedly small-time extortionists who used to extort money from auto drivers on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway. They said police are looking at other cases in which they may have been involved. A search is on for the other home guard jawan involved in the incident.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-including-home-guard-jawan-held-in-connection-with-30kg-silver-robbery-101610819995450.html

Who can forget controversy’s children, Donald Trump to Kangana Ranaut? Ah, but have you spotted Pandemic’s populace putting the mouth in the foot? If you’ve been at the receiving end of the Battle of the Mask VS Mouthful of Morsel, you’ll have an inkling of the drift of things.Masks may have spawned species and subtle artistry that could give Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s ‘Art of Living’ stiff (oops, stuff) competition – Art of Licking.The Vaccine may make masks a thing of history, but masks ‘breathe’ their last not without teaching us a thing or two about tweaking the geography of anatomy. Whilst the Vax has injected sure-shot sense of security among the populace, the wait for it has been ‘driving’ new challenges – masked misadventures on the go. The big challenge for those riding to work and elsewhere is how to get a meal-on-the-go into the masked mouth. The catch – without being caught on CCTV cameras at crossings and inviting challans.Some lessons in New Normal’s ‘Art of Licking’.Battle of Mask Vs MorselIn pandemic times, even as not only drugs but also dregs of news are often hard to swallow, masked life’s morsels on the go dish out their own food for thought. By virtue of being tossed unceremoniously left, right and centre, anywhere but into the mouth. The other day, a friend’s mother fished out her water bottle to savour a sip. Her parched throat behind the stifling mask heaved with relief as if it was a whiff of fresh air. Only to realise that the whiff of air flowed from the lowered car window, wherein peered a potbellied pasha of Haryana constabulary at the crossing, looking cross. And full of airs. Like a belligerent bulldog who’s spied a spaniel crunching on a coveted bone in his territory.“Yo toh challan banta hai, madamji”.“Look, I’m wearing it, just slipped it down to have water …” she stuttered sundry explanations for that fraction of a mask-less moment, flailing the mask dangling from her chin as detached from the ‘muh’ as most Netas profess to be from Moh ‘n’ Maya (or Mayawati).“Art of Licking” Lesson One – This episode served to spotlight simple tricks for Masked Life’s Eat, Drink and Be Ferry.First, train the throat to survive without hydrogen oxide till you are off the road. Better still, carry straws that can be thrust into the mouth under the mask without dislodging the latter. Best is, take the road less travelled – carry hookahs that serve as stylised straws and also lend a look of ‘Arabian Nights’ exotica, like Pandemic’s variant of ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’!The curious case of surviving the long arm of the law by hook(ah) or crook.Tu Cheese Badi Hai Mask MaskAnother time, Yours Truly was trying to smuggle in bites of breakfast on the go behind the partially dismantled mask when the gulping met grunting from the driver’s seat, “Mask, mask”.Realising that traffic lights with CCTVs were being navigated, I ducked out of view.

His active involvement in fighting the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, such as testing people since the first case arrived in March in the district, put him and his family at a greater risk.On Saturday, he was the first person at the Dasna CHC to receive the vaccine against the virus.Ram said he was eager to get the shot in order to carry on the fight against the coronavirus. “People here were apprehensive and also afraid. So I decided to take the first vaccine shot. Once I came out after spending 30 minutes in the observation room, my colleagues surrounded me to know how I felt. Later, they also took the vaccine as they saw that I was okay,” he said. “I know how it feels when I, as well as my family members, was down with the coronavirus. Having gone through something like that, I had no fear left now in taking the vaccine. Our scientists worked so hard to ready the vaccine and I had a positive mindset about it,” he added. Shameem Saifi, a 43-year-old Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) worker with the Dasna CHC, was ecstatic about getting the vaccine shot, saying she has set an example for others in her village, Bhikkhanpur.“My family did not listen to any critics or rumours about the vaccine. In fact, my husband Ishtiyak Ahmad came to drop me to the CHC when he came to know that I will get the vaccine shot. I felt very normal after the vaccine and shared my experience with other colleagues,” she said.“He was also happy and asked me to see if he too can get the shot. I told him that beneficiaries will be selected as per specified category. Hum gareeb parivar se hain, par ghar pe sab sehmat hain (I am from a poor family but everyone at home has shown acceptance to the vaccine),” she added.About 10 kms away, 65-year-old Dr Tripta Bhagat, vice chancellor of Santosh University, was present throughout the day at her college’s vaccination centre at Santosh Hospital in Vijay Nagar. “Being a senior citizen, I got the shot in the morning. Initially, there was some anxiety factor in everybody’s mind. So I came forward and took the shot. There were no physical reactions in anybody after getting the shot and I was present at our centre the entire day. Even my son who is a cardiologist took the vaccine,” she said. “During the morning hours, the turnout was less and we had to counsel people. Thereafter, the listed beneficiaries arrived and took shots. The inaugural event went on smoothly,” she added.In all, the inaugural vaccination drive was taken up at four centres in Ghaziabad, where a list of 100 beneficiaries each were to take the shots on Saturday.The Ghaziabad district had received a batch of 2,741 vials of the Covishield vaccine, each having 10 doses. These had been delivered to the four vaccination centres on Friday. “I was the first to take the vaccine at our centre and thereafter, I was in the observation room for 30 minutes. I faced no issues and I felt normal. Before I arrived to get the vaccine, there was a lot of discussion in my family about it. There was a sense of fear even among the staff at the hospital. So I took rounds of different departments and tried to clear doubts of my staff,” said Dr Sangita Goel, chief medical superintendent of the district women’s hospital. Under directions from the Uttar Pradesh government, the staff and doctors in the healthcare sector are to get the vaccine shots first. At the fourth centre in Ghaziabad – Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi – Dr RK Mani, director of the hospital’s Covid-19 management and strategy wing, registered first and was given the first vaccine shot. “We are now taking final steps to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. I am doing my duty by getting the vaccine first of all, as doctors have to lead the society by examples. When we doctors get vaccinated, people around us will feel safe in doing the same,” Dr Mani said in a statement issued by the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-ghaziabad-first-beneficiaries-lead-by-example-motivate-others-for-covid-vaccine-101610819931641.html
16-01-2021||Other||Random Forays: Test Cricket is a reflection of life||The highs and lows of life are eminently encapsulated in cricket Test matches, if one follows them with a keen eye. Of course it is fashionable nowadays to denigrate five day cricket as being far too slow and excessively stretched. But then, life too is a long journey, even if it seems like a short sojourn in some ways.The razzmatazz of modern day life and the fleeting nature of jobs, relationships, conversations and pursuits often give us the inherent impression that life is meant to be lived in a state of tizzy. We unwittingly chase intangible dreams all year long, seldom pausing to reflect and ponder.In this era of T20 Cricket and even T10 cricket, as well as short feature films and speed dating apps, one could be forgiven for believing that one has to somehow ‘take off’ in each moment of life and propel oneself into the unfathomable unknown!Yet, when one looks carefully at the growth pattern of a tree, or the unhurried sleepiness of a dog basking in the sun, or at the testing war of attrition that Test cricket usually is, one realises that such bastions of stability are still in evidence around us.Life throws up challenges at us all the time and we require a certain amount of doughtiness within to extricate ourselves from the quagmire that such situations present before us. Hanuma Vihari and Ravi Ashwin were the unlikely saviours for Team India at Sydney in the third Test Match versus Australia. The sheer grit, guts and resilience that they displayed while stonewalling everything thrown at them by an impressive bowling attack, was utterly remarkable. Both were injured and in pain while batting. Both had hitherto been underwhelming with the bat in the series. Yet, they hung on like leeches and refused to budge even in the face of a daunting, highly charged up opposition, thirsty for their blood in their own backyard.Test cricket has, over the decades, brought to light the toughest of customers like Rahul Dravid, Jacques Kallis, Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Cheteshwar Pujara, who have eschewed their considerable repertoire of strokes for the sake of the nation and their team, to grind their way to century after century. Yet, when the occasion has demanded that they unleash their armoury of shots, they have never been found wanting.Great batsmen like Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Steve Smith and Virat Kohli have, for long periods, refused to be tied down by any opposition, and we admire them more for their all- conquering ways, than for playing a ‘wall’ like innings, most supremely exemplified by the likes of Dravid. But it takes all kinds of batsmen to win a Test match. Dashers like Virender Sehwag and Adam Gilchrist are needed too. It is the potent combination of artists, diehards and blasters that makes for a winning cocktail in a Test team. And if we somehow imaginatively transpose these attributes to the qualities which each individual needs to succeed in life itself, we get some answers to the quandaries we perennially face.Each of us has to possess and reflect such all round qualities to find some degree of success and inner peace in this earthly journey of ours. And not just cricket, if we seek inspiration from any sport: Athletics, soccer, tennis, badminton, or golf, we will find plenty of motivational ammunition to keep us surging ahead.A WhatsApp group, titled Glorious Cricket, comprises of former cricketers, writers, experts and afficionados, and I am forever amazed at the passion and depth of understanding that the members have for the game.Many a discussion on the group showcases not only what is right and wrong with cricket and other sports, but also highlights the fantastic diversity of human personas in a microcosm.So, there’s much to learn from sports, dear friends. One learns to take the rough with the smooth, and to ride the tide. One also learns from heroes like Ashwin and Vihari that the limits of human fortitude should never be underestimated.By backing our own inner strength to the core and by taking bouncers on the chest at times, we can win most of life’s battles.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/random-forays-test-cricket-is-a-reflection-of-life-101610819931314.html
16-01-2021||Other||Roundabout: Daughters of the soil challenge stereotypes at farmers’ protests||One of the pictures going viral during the farmers’ protest was that of feisty rural woman Manjit Kaur, all of 62, in her usual village attire, dupatta covering her head, driving a jeep, taking her female friends from Patiala to the Singhu border to participate in the farmers’ protests. Pictures of several women driving tractors to reach the protest sites followed.Gender benderThere has been no dearth of stories from Punjab and Haryana about rural and urban women, old and young as well as lettered and unlettered, assuming leadership roles during the ongoing season of dissent against the contentious farm laws. Not only have they defied the voyeuristic male gaze in popular culture that denigrates them as sex objects, they have also shown exceptional skills in management, activism and resilience. This may come as a surprise in a society used to feudal prejudices of a patriarchal society which led to killing the girl child in the foetus, with modern age ushering in sex-determination tests to carry out the murders. In these times when these regions still have a dismal sex ratio; there is this tremendous evidence of the strength of the second sex, not just for mere survival but as a show of endurance in the harshest of conditions.Heartwarming presenceIt was heartwarming indeed to see pictures and news reports of male farmers of Haryana summoning drivers to give lessons to women drive tractors on the national highway on Republic Day, reportedly involving 500 women who will lead a tractor procession which is likely to be a never-seen-before spectacle in the country. Women have also taken the responsibility of farming and looking after their families while their men remain at the protest sites. Not just this, as many as 100 protest sites in the state are being managed by women to keep the momentum alive.Mention of these facts are now being made by not just women writers but men too reporting from the Delhi borders. Writer-journalist Sukant Deepak, who has been virtually camping at the protest sites for days, says: “It has been an amazing experience to see young women in command like the petite Kanupriya, the 24-year-old who broke the male bastion to be the first woman president of the Panjab University Campus Students Council two years ago. Now just farmers twice and even thrice her age listen to her intently”.At the Tikri border one finds Navkiran Natt, 29, a dentist by profession and daughter of well-known left-wing activists, who has founded the Bhagat Singh Library at the protest site and also happens to be the curator of the much talked-about newspaper of the protest tellingly called the Trolley Times as tractor trolleys have also been the makeshift homes of the protesting farmers and families during the agitation.A note was made in the newspaper of the female-male role reversal when a farmer serving langar to the young women volunteers exclaimed that it was a ‘revolution’ of sorts as men were running the kitchen and serving food to women. It was Mata Khivi, wife of Guru Angad Dev, who carried the tenet of Guru Nanak of ‘sanjha jhakko’ (share and eat) by establishing the tradition of Guru da langar or community kitchen in which both men and women cooked and served meals. In many homes even now, however, women are still keepers of the hearth with men taking care of the fields. Only time will tell if the visibility of empowerment of women will continue after the protest. But for the moment it is something to look at with joy. However, one must not forget that the women’s movement for gender equality which spread all over the country, starting in the International Women’s Year in 1975 had not taken root in Punjab or for that matter in the interiors of Haryana. I recall going to a Punjab village not too far away from Chandigarh with a photographer working on a story on violence against women at home. Trying to talk to women had proved to be a no-no because they literally shooed us away asking us how we dared to try and find out what was going on in their homes. This had reminded me of the classic ‘Ik Chaadar Maili Si’ (Translated by Khushwant Singh as ‘I Take This Woman’) in which the protagonist Rano is being beaten up by her husband and when a neighbour intervenes, Rano chides him. Well, he is beating his own wife, not yours, so stay away, says Rano.Making a difference“This is not the first time that women have been in prominence in a movement,” says historian Kamlesh Mohan, who has done extensive research on the role of women in the freedom struggle against British colonial rule. Mohan says that Punjabi women played a major and visible role in the Kirti Kisan movement of 1928 as well as the struggle for freedom which led to Independence in 1947.That, however, did not lead to role assignment and empowerment for the women, Mohan says, adding that in an interview with Congress freedom fighter Savitri Krishan, wife of Ram Kishan, a former chief minister of Punjab in the 1960s, she was told that while men draw women in protests and struggles they rarely share power with them. True, some of the well-known names of the times are referred to as the forgotten women of the struggle of Independence. However, the journey to empowerment is a long and slow process but every step forward does make a difference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roundabout-daughters-of-the-soil-challenge-stereotypes-at-farmers-protests-101610819871987.html
16-01-2021||Gurugram||Three held for murder of husband of sarpanch||The police arrested three suspected criminals, who had allegedly shot dead a 37-year-old man, who was the husband of the sarpanch of Alipur village, in Sohna on July 15, 2020. The police said they have confessed to killing the victim to avenge the murder of their close aide Ashok Rathi — a dreaded gangster, who was shot dead in his village on November 15, 2019. The police allegedly recovered five pistols, four countrymade pistols, 36 live cartridges, two mobile phones and one Wi-Fi dongle from their possession. The police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for any information leading to arrest of each of the suspects, said the police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that these they had formed three crime teams to investigate the case. On early Saturday morning, they received a tip-off and raided a few locations on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway, leading to their arrests. “The suspects revealed that they suspected the role of the victim, Manoj Kumar Dagar, in Ashok Rathi’s murder. They wanted to take revenge. They followed Dagar and shot him dead,” he said. The suspects were identified as Bharat Kumar (20) of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, Mohit Singh (27) of Faridabad and Puneet Singh (24) of Farukhnagar in Gurugram. Sangwan said Bharat Kumar was the one who had fired bullets, following which the victim had collapsed. The other two were present with him at the spot. They were ready with loaded guns so that the could shoot at the victim, if he tried to escape, The suspects are involved in more than two dozen cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, kidnapping, loot, robbery and snatching in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi, said the police. The police said suspects had helped Rathi escape from the UP police custody while they were on their way to produce him before the Gururgam court in 2014. Earlier, the police had arrested four suspects, who were also members of this gang, in connection of the murder. The shooting took place on July 15, around 4pm. Manoj Dagar was shot dead when he had gone to a private hospital with his nine-year-old daughter, who was suffering from mild fever. He had parked his SUV outside the hospital in Sohna. The police said after the check-up, he and his daughter got back into the car, when the suspect shot at him through the car’s window pane from the driver’s side. Dagar, who was seated behind the wheel, was shot in the neck while his daughter was unharmed. Dagar died while undergoing treatment at a private hospital on August 12 night, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-held-for-murder-of-husband-of-sarpanch-101610819691602.html
16-01-2021||Gurugram||Some health workers reluctant of getting vaccines, claim pressure from superiors||Even as most healthcare workers were elated following inoculations on Saturday, some of them struck a slightly discordant note, with a section refusing to take the jabs and others claiming pressure from superiors to undergo vaccinations. A female anganwadi worker, at the session site at government primary school in Daulatabad, requesting anonymity, said, “They are forcing us to get the vaccine dose. I don’t want to get the vaccine. Will they ensure that our treatment costs are taken care of if something happens to us? We are poor people. No one will take any guarantee and get us treated if there is any fallout due to the vaccine,” said the woman. While some of them eventually refused the vaccine on health grounds, some others returned without getting the jabs. A health worker from the ESIC dispensary in Daulatabad, who got the vaccine shot, said that her colleague came to the session site but returned without taking the shot. “Scientists have worked on the vaccine for a long time and I trust their expertise. However, some people still have doubts. One of my colleagues went back because she was wary of getting the vaccine,” she said. A health worker, who recovered from a bacterial infection nearly 10 days ago, said that she was not taking the vaccine on account of weakness incurred from the illness.Speaking on condition of anonymity, she said, “I am still recovering from an illness. There is a lot of weakness. I told my senior that I was sick but she insisted that I visit the site. I would have taken the vaccine if I was healthy.”At the Bhangrola primary health centre (PHC), one computer assistant refused to take the vaccine jab, but officials said that people could opt out and are under no pressure. Doctors at the facility said that while they had set a target of 100, they were able to inoculate 53 people till 5pm. “Some women were lactating, others had fever or allergies. One worker, a computer operator, refused to get the vaccine. We tried to counsel him and explain the importance of the vaccine but he didn’t get vaccinated. We didn’t force him,” said Dr Shalu Vashisht, medical officer in charge of the session site at Bhangrola PHC. She said that beneficiaries were within their right to decline a vaccine and there was no pressure to get vaccinated. “It’s their right to not get vaccinated if they are not willing. We cannot force them,” said Vashisht. She added that some people might have had apprehensions since it was the first day and confidence in the vaccine would greatly increase by next week. “By Monday, people will get reports about the efficacy of the vaccine. I’m sure all their doubts will be put to rest since the drive went well today. Vaccine hesitancy should refuse in the coming days,” said Vashisht.Besides those who had reservations, there were those who got vaccinated but were not aware of the name of the vaccine or the next steps involved in the process. Ruby, 35, an anganwadi worker, who goes only by her first name, said, “I got the vaccine and faced no issues whatsoever. I don’t know the name of the vaccine but there were no issues and I didn’t experience any pain.” She said she was unaware of the timeline of the next dose of the vaccine. Vimla, a health worker, who goes by her first name, said that she had received the first dose of the vaccine but didn’t know the name. “I am feeling well. When the madam calls us again, we will get the second dose,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/some-health-workers-reluctant-of-getting-vaccines-claim-pressure-from-superiors-101610819691080.html
16-01-2021||Gurugram||Technical glitches hamper functioning of Co-WIN application||Technical glitches somewhat hampered the functioning of Co-WIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) — an application developed by the Central government to monitor and track inoculation — on the first day of the nationwide mass vaccination programme in the district. The digital platform has been developed by the Union health ministry and will be used by the government to facilitate real-time information of vaccine stocks, storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries.Due to initial technical hiccups, however, the data-feeding process was affected on Saturday at some places. Health department workers helming the Co-WIN platform faced delays in corroborating and marking the vaccination status of registered beneficiaries due to technical glitches. Further, data recorded manually will have to be uploaded separately, said health workers. Ajay Chauhan, information assistant at the session site at a government primary school in Daulatabad, said that the Co-WIN platform was not showing the list of beneficiaries due to a technical glitch. “The list of beneficiaries could not be accessed. It was not visible. At 10:30am, when the vaccination started, I saw the list for three seconds, after which it stopped working,” said Chauhan. He said that the platform started working around 2pm. He said that it took 5-10 minutes to find and corroborate information on the platform and 3-5 minutes to check things physically as the platform was down. “We don’t know the exact reason behind the glitch. The verification process was a little delayed but we were able to carry out the vaccination process since we had printouts of the details of the beneficiaries,” said Chauhan. Monika, data entry operator at Wazirabad site, said, “The Co-WIN platform has been down since the vaccination started. Therefore, the data is being maintained manually. Those who received the first dose of vaccine were not shown as partially vaccinated on the Co-WIN portal. Based on the status, an SMS for the second dose after 28 days is supposed to be delivered to the beneficiary. If the portal had worked, the status of those who were inoculated with the first dose would have appeared as partially vaccinated. A black dot beside their name would have changed into orange colour which did not happen due to the glitch. Once the digital platform gets active, we will immediately feed the data.” Likewise, at the Chauma centre in Palam Vihar, the platform was non-functional until 3pm. Dr Shalu Vashisht, in-charge of the session site at Bhangrola PHC, said that the Co-WIN platform had some issues in the morning but recovered by 12:30pm. “Towards the afternoon, the platform was working fine for us. We were able to see the vaccination status of the beneficiaries in the afternoon,” said Vashisht. The platform had faced issues for a short duration on Friday as well due to which the message delivery system was affected. As a result, some registered health workers received information about their vaccination centre and timing only around 2am on Saturday. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, said that due to issues on Co-WIN on Friday, messages couldn’t reach some health workers during the day. However, most of them had received messages late at night on Friday. “The technical aspects of Co-WIN is not being handled by the health department. All the issues will be resolved by the technical team soon,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/technical-glitches-hamper-functioning-of-co-win-application-101610819631998.html
16-01-2021||Noida||393 people vaccinated on Day 1 in Noida||Lok Sabha member from Gautam Budh Nagar Dr Mahesh Sharma was among the first parliamentarians to be vaccinated on Saturday, even as a little more than half (393) of the 600 people scheduled to get their jabs on Day One turned up at vaccination centres . “I have received the vaccine as a health worker and not as an MP,” said the parliamentarian who is also a qualified doctor and owner of Kailash Group of hospitals. “Everybody should get the vaccine as responsible citizens. The vaccine has been developed by seasoned scientists after sufficient trials and it is safe for use. It has been around one hour after I got vaccinated and I have not faced any side effects. I am continuing work as per my routine.” The district chief medical officer (CMO) said the people who missed Saturday’s inoculation did not give a reason for their absence, but they would be given another chance at getting vaccinated in the next phase.The vaccination drive began at 11am, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address, and continued till around 5.30pm.CMO Dr Deepak Ohri said 221 males and 172 females were vaccinated at the Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Sharda Hospital, Kailash Hospital and at the community health centres (CHCs) at Bhangel and Bisrakh.One health worker each at SSPHPGTI and CHC Bhangel had complained of headache and nausea after the shots. “They were kept in observation and then discharged. There were no side effects of the vaccine on Saturday,” the CMO said. “Since there is no side effect, we hope more and more people will come forward now.”GIMS director Brig (retd) Dr Rakesh Gupta, Sharda University’s dental college dean Dr M Siddhartha, SSPHPGTI’s chief medical superintendent (CMS) Dr DK Singh also got vaccinated on Day One. They said that they have observed no side effects of the vaccine and urged people to register for vaccines. Suhas LY, district magistrate GB Nagar, said that the vaccination drive went smoothly at six locations. “The details of health workers were noted and also uploaded on Co-Win app. The health officials are well trained to conduct this exercise,” he said. In the first phase, 24,453 health workers will be vaccinated, he said. Replying to a question on when he would be vaccinated, the DM said he expected it second phase when police personnel, district administration staff and officials, revenue department officials, among others will get the shots. Shamim, a lab technician at the SSPHPGTI received the first vaccine dose of Covishield. “I first reached the registration counter where they checked my Aadhaar card and made an entry. It was like a normal injection administered in one minute,” he said. He said that he did not feel any pain or abnormalities in his shoulder or body after the vaccination. After the vaccination, he was kept for observation for 30 minutes where doctors monitored him and then he was discharged. The hospital issued a vaccination card which mentions patient’s serial number, name, phone number, date of first dose and date of second dose. The people vaccinated on Saturday have been asked to come for a second dose on February 15. GB Nagar’s immunisation officer Dr Neeraj Tyagi said the administration will soon share the details about the next phase of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/393-people-vaccinated-on-day-1-in-noida-101610819631110.html
16-01-2021||Gurugram||Wazirabad housekeeping staffer becomes the first recipient of Covid-19 vaccine in Gurugram||Radha Chaudhary, a housekeeping staff member of Wazirabad urban primary health centre (UPHC), became the first recipient of the Covishield vaccine in Gurugram on Saturday. However, until January 15, a night before the nationwide launch of the two Covid-19 vaccines, Chaudhary had no idea that she would be the first one to be vaccinated. On Saturday, as she received the injection in her arm at a vaccination site in government primary school in Wazirabad, Chaudhary suddenly realised that she had to lead by example. “I didn’t feel anything at the time of vaccination — no pain or fear,” said Chaudhary, seated in a brown plastic chair inside the observation room. “For the last one year, many doctors have been working day and night to save lives of people infected with Covid-19. It is only through vaccination that we can bring the disease to an end and save lives,” she said, without flinching for a moment.For the last two years, Chaudhary has been working as a cleaner at the Wazirabad UPHC. Before that, she worked in a private school in Sector 9. Since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, she has been assigned the task of collecting and disposing of the waste generated during Covid-19 sample collection. She has even assisted the rapid response teams during testing camps. “I was never scared of Covid-19 duties,” she said.For the 47-year-old, the speech given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through video conference before the launch further boosted her confidence. She was administered the vaccine soon after the launch. “Vaccination wasn’t scary as senior doctors at our UPHC also got vaccinated along with us. But what the PM said about the vaccine being a protective shield against the virus made me feel more positive,” she said. Chaudhary was not aware of the name of the vaccine being given to her. After waiting in the observation room for 30 minutes, Chaudhary came out brimming with confidence. “It feels normal. There is no itchiness or redness at the injection site,” she said.Chaudhary said her name was initially on the 38th spot in the list of beneficiaries. But the sanitation staffer was given priority on Saturday. “Before coming for the vaccination, I have heard that many people were sceptical about taking the vaccine. I simply knew that I had to take an injection. But now I feel that people should come forward and get vaccinated, without a shadow of doubt. My husband, who also works as a housekeeping staff at Civil Hospital, Sector 10, said to me that I was lucky to get vaccinated,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wazirabad-housekeeping-staffer-becomes-the-first-recipient-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-gurugram-101610819572152.html

Also, those waiting to get inoculated at the site were unaware of a consent form to be signed for receiving the Covaxin jab and said that they were not informed of the vaccine allotted to them.This accounted for only 6.4% of the 608, who received the inoculations on the day of the vaccine launch. The rest received Serum Institute’s Covishield.The vaccination site set up at a private school in Palam Vihar by the health team of Chauma urban primary health centre had minimum footfall since morning. According to the vaccination officers deployed at the site, healthcare workers from three primary health centres — Chauma, Laxman Vihar and Rajeev Nagar — had been allotted the Palam Vihar site for vaccination.“None of the health staff from Laxman Vihar, except for a senior medical officer, turned up for the vaccination. Most of them who got the inoculation had been from Chauma and a few from Rajeev Nagar. Only 39 people were inoculated throughout the day,” said a vaccination officer at the site. When HT reached the site and interacted with the staff waiting for vaccination, they seemed unaware of the consent form that had to be signed for taking the Covaxin jab.“We only know that a coronavirus vaccine will be injected. They haven’t told us the name of the vaccine,” said an anganwadi worker. During the inoculation, she seemed unaware of the second dose that had to be administered. Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “Due to delay in message delivery for vaccination, many workers did not reach the site timely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/only-39-of-100-turn-up-for-covaxin-jab-in-gurugram-101610819571581.html
16-01-2021||Gurugram||608 health workers receive Covid-19 vaccines in Gurugram||Over 608 front-line healthcare workers in Gurugram took the Covid-19 vaccine jab on Saturday amid the scepticism regarding the vaccine safety, said officials. On the day of a nationwide roll-out of the coronavirus vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — the district witnessed only a 60% footfall among the listed beneficiaries on the first day of the process. Workers who were set for vaccination on January 18 were called in to achieve the 100% target, senior officials’ privy to the matter said.Of the 600 registered healthcare workers to be vaccinated on Saturday, only 408 turned up for the vaccination till 4.30pm. “Due to less footfall after 4pm, it was decided to extend the list and call other healthcare workers who were enlisted to get vaccinated from January 18,” said a senior health official preferring anonymity. The official said, “At several sites, the vaccination had to be continued till 7pm to get an overall coverage of 600 vaccine beneficiaries at six sites.” Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, said, “Despite some challenges, we managed to achieve a 100% coverage. We had targeted to inoculate 600 persons and our teams managed to cover 608 healthcare workers. There has been no instance of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) in the district. Across the state, 13 AEFI instances have been reported.”The senior official cited above said that apprehension among the beneficiaries and poor functioning of the Co-WIN platform for fewer vaccinations in the initial hours. Live streaming of the vaccine launch was carried out at the six sites, in order to assuage concerns and appeal to the beneficiaries to take their jabs January 18 onwards.The first inoculation on Saturday came at a time when the district has reported more than 57,000 cases of Covid-19 and at least 349 deaths till now. Both are the highest in Haryana.Doses were administered to Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and anganwadi workers at four government session sites under the Chauma, Wazirabad, Daulatabad and Bhangrola urban primary health centres. At the private hospital session sites — Medanta and SGT Medical College — doses were administered to health workers directly dealing with Covid-19 patients at Covid wards and emergency ward. The Covishield vaccine was administered at five sites, except at Chauma in Palam Vihar, where the Covaxin vaccine was administered. For getting the Covaxin jab, workers had to sign a consent form.Healthcare staffer Radha Chowdhary, 47, was the first to take the vaccine jab in Gurugram, followed by senior doctors of the health department. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer and medical officers of Urban Primary Health Centres. At private hospitals, senior doctors, nurses and sanitation staff were inoculated. With healthcare workers being the priority group in the central government’s plan, the health department plans to inoculate almost 43,000 workers in 28 days. The immunisation programme will be extended to other session sites in the coming weeks, for a wider reach as well as to cover workers in private set-ups. The district administration and health department will try to cover 4,600 healthcare workers at 46 vaccination sites every day, starting January 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/608-health-workers-receive-covid-19-vaccines-in-gurugram-101610819571088.html

Some were on leave while few had health issues like fever,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer, who himself got the shot on Saturday. “After I got the shot, I felt a psychological pressure had lifted. Overall, none of the beneficiaries at the four centres were referred to the adverse event following immunization (AEFI) room which were prepared to take up any emergency which may have resulted.” Of the 379 beneficiaries who turned up, 182 were women and 197 men. In the first phase, health care workers from both government and private sector turned up.“The inaugural vaccination went on smoothly and healthcare workers took active participation in making it successful. The turnout on Saturday will also instil confidence in other beneficiaries and we hope to make the overall vaccination drive a success,” said district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey.Some glitchesBeneficiaries were supposed to receive a text message on Friday informing them of their vaccination date, time and centre. “During the last dry-run on January 11 we received the SMS but this time, there was none. We were instead informed by staff that we were scheduled for getting the shot. My husband (working in Delhi) and I are doctors and we have in-laws who are aged over 70 years. So, it was important that both of us get the vaccine,” said Dr Garima, who goes by single name and a medical officer with the health department. She received her shot at the Dasna community health centre. Dr Bharat Bhushan, the in-charge of the Dasna CHC, said: “We had some issues with the system because of which the alert could not be sent to a few beneficiaries. As soon as we got to know of this, we had our staff call them up and inform them.” Dr NK Gupta confirmed issues with the Co-WIN portal, which was developed by the central government, and that they had backup to deal with the issue. Dr Rekha Singh, senior consultant at district women hospital, said that the initial slow turnout for the vaccination was due to fear and apprehensions among the beneficiaries. “There were rounds of rumours going around over the social media and people were also apprehensive about the first shots. My family and especially my husband motivated me a lot. When I took the vaccine i suffered no side effects or any reactions. Even I got calls from my children and they were eager to know how I felt after getting the shot,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-achieves-94-75-turnout-for-inaugural-vaccination-none-reports-any-immediate-side-effects-101610819511720.html

Senior zoo officials said that all safety protocol laid down by the Centre was being followed. Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, said, “The zoo witnessed the death of a brown fish owl in its captivity. Its cloacal, tracheal and ocular swabs were sent to the animal husbandry unit of the Delhi government for serological examination, which returned positive for H5N8 avian influenza.” “As per standard protocol and guidelines issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), ministry of environment forests and climate change (MoEFCC) and the animal husbandry department of Delhi government, sanitation and surveillance drills have been intensified in the zoo and all possible preventive and prophylactic measures are being taken,” he added. Environment ministry officials confirmed that with the positive case at Delhi zoo, safety protocol at the premises had been intensified. The only solace this time, as compared to the last avian flu breakout at the zoo in 2016, is that this time the zoo is already closed for the general public. This will make managing the flu among the inhabitants a lot easier, according to officials. “Two barn owls, which were next to the enclosure of the owl that tested positive, have been isolated. A close watch is being kept on the migratory birds, who may be carriers. Zoo staff have been distributed special drapers and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. They are following our advisory and are in constant touch with the ministry of animal husbandry. The zoo is closed, so there is no fear of transmission to people,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, environment ministry’s additional director-general. In a statement issued, the ministry also said that the zoo authorities have been directed to use disinfectant spray of lime juice, Virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite, and foot bath of potassium permanganate is being done at regular intervals. “Chicken feed to raptors and entry of vehicles inside the zoo had already been stopped. This is being further reinforced and intensified. Movement of staff and workers in zoo is also being restricted and regulated keeping in view the animal influenza threats,” the ministry statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-zoo-reports-first-bird-flu-death-doubles-down-on-safety-measures-101610819452504.html
16-01-2021||Other||One small jab for Manish, one giant, leap for Delhi: Sanitation worker is first to be vaccinated in Delhi||New Delhi: While 34-year-old Manish Kumar, a sanitation worker at Delhi’s AIIMS, was vying to be among the first to receive a Covid-19 vaccine, his mother, Laxmi Rani, was dead against it. She didn’t want him to even be in the first batch to receive the jab. She even offered to trade places with him, given that she is employed as a sanitation worker at the same hospital.But in the end, Rani relented. At 11.10am on Saturday, Kumar became the first resident of the national capital to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease. Kumar on Saturday emerged as the face of a months-long global effort against time to develop an inoculation against the infection that has killed over two million people. He said he always believed in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine.“I have narrated my experience to over 50 journalists so far. Do you see any adverse impact on me?” Kumar said it wasn’t a coincidence that he was a part of the first batch of frontline staffers at the premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to be vaccinated, all of whom received a jab of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. “When I found out that members of my team were to be vaccinated, I volunteered to be on that list. My immediate supervisor wasn’t very excited about my confidence, but I wanted to serve as an example to my family and colleagues,” said Kumar, who has been a machine operator in AIIMS’ sanitation department for eight years now.And when Kumar received a confirmatory text message on Friday, he approached his boss once again, with another request. “I urged my supervisor to let me be the first person from AIIMS to receive the vaccine, though I didn’t think I would be obliged,” he said. Among those he encouraged to take the vaccine shot was his childhood friend Shaukat Ali, also a sanitation worker at the hospital. “I have had three surgeries and was very scared to take the vaccine,” Ali said, even as he stood on his toes to record a video of Kumar getting the jab. In fact, like Laxmi Rani, Ali too urged him against taking the shot till as late as 9am on Saturday, for fear of any potential adverse effects. But like Laxmi Rani, Ali relented too.“I told him to watch me receive the vaccine and get inspired,” said Kumar.Early on Saturday, Ali became one of the recipients of the Covid-19 vaccine as well.Kumar said he hid the vaccination plan from his family till Wednesday, when his announcement met with mixed responses. Apart from his mother, his wife also took some cajoling to give in to his plan. “Eventually, she said she would stand on the sidelines and watch me receive the vaccine,” said Kumar. However, they changed their minds later, and decided she would worry too much if she came to the vaccination centre. Kumar’s Saturday began like any other working day over the past eight years. He caught a bus from Najafagarh, where he lives with his family, and arrived at AIIMS for the vaccination, as well as his regular duties. He didn’t know that within hours though, he would be making news and even trending on Twitter. His mother, too, was unaware of the fanfare that would eventually surround his vaccination. While Kumar was flanked by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, his mother continued with her housekeeping work at the hospital. Kumar kept himself masked while he was administered a dose of Covaxin, even as the gathering around him cheered. Soon after, he was whisked away to a room, away from the media’s glare and questions. “There were three doctors around me for 30 minutes after the injection. They kept asking me about any reactions I might have been having.” He was confident the vaccine was safe. But, he said, he knew the media’s glare would keep him in good stead.“I knew the media was there. The Prime Minister was live just minutes before my vaccination. And the health minister was by my side. Even if a problem were to occur, they would ensure I was taken care of.” He said him volunteering to be among the first to get the jab should dispel fears about the vaccine. “There are rumours on social media about the vaccine. I am fortunate to play a part in dispelling those rumours. There are no rashes on my body, no nausea, no pain, nothing.” Despite Kumar and his mother working at AIIMS, and more relatives working at different hospitals in the city, neither he, nor anyone in his family, was touched by the virus. “But the fear of the virus was always there. We had witnessed deaths by this disease,” said Kumar.Now, Kumar will go back to his daily duties at the hospital, even as several more get vaccinated there, as in the rest of the country. He will be back for the second and final dose of the vaccine 28 days later, at which point, doctors said, he can breathe easy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-small-jab-for-manish-one-giant-leap-for-delhi-sanitation-worker-is-first-to-be-vaccinated-in-delhi-101610819452953.html

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Saturday was 407, in the ‘severe’ zone, as against the 460 recorded on Friday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Friday forecasted that the air quality of Delhi was on its way to sliding into the ‘severe plus’ or ‘emergency’ levels on Saturday. Even though till 10am on Saturday, Delhi was engulfed in a thick blanket of fog, as the day progressed this fog condensed and melted the pollutants that had accumulated. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that on Saturday morning the fog cover over Delhi condensed and precipitated, washing the accumulated pollution particles with it. “Even though dense fog conditions usually leads to a rise in pollution levels, sometimes the fog condenses and precipitates. In simpler words, when the moisture level in the air increases beyond a point, it flushes and clears the atmosphere. The average wind speed during the day was also around 7-8 kmph, which made conducive conditions for the air to clear off,” said Soni. IMD recordings show this phenomenon more clearly. At 8.30 am the relative humidity, which is essentially the moisture content in the air, was 100%. Soni said that from Sunday afternoon the wind direction will change from north-westerly to easterly and this will bring further relief for Delhiites. “There is also a forecast of another western disturbance impacting Delhi. Even though this western disturbance will not bring any rainfall in the plains, it will improve the wind speed in Delhi and the NCR towns, and this will lead to a further improvement in the air,” she added. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that from 1am to 10am on Saturday, Delhi experienced a prolonged fog spell, which reduced the visibility to zero metres for several hours. Despite the dense fog, the minimum temperatures in the city rose to 6.6 degrees Celsius, which was only one degree below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official recording for the entire city, was 19.1 degrees Celsius. “On Sunday too, the temperature is expected to remain in the same range. However, after the wind direction changes to easterly, in the next week, the mercury will rise and even reach around 10 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fog-cover-precipitates-to-flush-pollutants-rescue-delhi-s-air-101610819451533.html

He said that Rajpath — from Vijay Chowk to India Gate — will also remain closed for traffic during this period. The traffic police will deploy a large number of its personnel to divert traffic in view of these restrictions. Agrawal said that motorists should expect congestion and restrictions on these routes between 9am to noon on these four days and should avoid taking these routes. On Sunday, slow down and congestion is expected in New Delhi, Central Delhi and west Delhi from morning to evening as a Nagar Kirtan on the occasion of the birth of Shri Guru Gobind Singhji is being organised by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. “Like every year, the procession will begin at 9.30am and will culminate at Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sahib in Hari Nagar,” said MS Randhawa, additional commissioner of traffic police. Buses passing through New Delhi area will be diverted from different points, the officer said and advised motorists to avoid the route being taken by the procession. Meanwhile, the police commissioner, SN Shrivastava, reviewed the Republic Day security preparations and arrangements at the farmers’ agitation in view of the law and order situation in Delhi. “He also took a stock of the pending cases of sexual crimes against children and overall offences against women.

From sanitation workers to hospital administration clerks, from senior doctors to ambulance drivers, those who volunteered to take the vaccine shot said they would lead the way in inspiring confidence in the antidotes by defeating the virus. Though civil defence volunteers and police personnel were posted outside Delhi’s 81 vaccination centres to manage crowds and keep intact law-and-order, there were no reports of any untoward incidents from any of these points.Until Saturday evening, 4,319 of the scheduled 8,100 persons had got vaccinated in Delhi. Hospital authorities said some who were to get the jab said they were not in the city, or cited personal reasons. Authorities said the absentees could also be attributed to a glitch in the CoWIN app, and to people either being on duty or on leave.“It could be because people wanted to wait and watch what happens. It could also be that some of them were on duty or in quarantine,” said a senior doctor from GTB hospital. A senior doctor from Lady Hardinge Medical College said that a technical snag on Friday night resulted in fewer people turning up for vaccination. At Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, many doctors said they did not want to take a Covaxin jab, which the facility had received.While only 32 workers were vaccinated at Lok Nayak hospital, 45 were given their first doses at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (RGSS) hospital. Each centre had a target of vaccinating 100 people on Saturday.Dr Ajeet Jain, nodal officer of Covid-19 and cardio surgeon at RGSS hospital, “There is vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers despite conducting multiple counselling sessions.” But those who visited the vaccination centres called the process “smooth and effective”. Those who received Covaxin doses had to sign a consent form since it is being administered under a clinical trial. At most centres, health care workers, who received the vaccine shot on the first day, were welcomed by their colleagues with gift hampers and sweets. While a gift hamper with chocolates, chips, and juice were distributed at RGSS hospital, workers at Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital were greeted with sweets.Several hospitals, including Max Hospital in Saket, decorated their premises to mark the first day of the vaccination drive. On Saturday morning, the process started with the beneficiaries showing the SMS received on their phone regarding their appointment. This was checked by the civil defence volunteers deputed at the front desk by the office of the district magistrate of Central Delhi. The process also included noting the name, phone number of the beneficiary along with an additional phone number of a person close to the person, who would be informed in case of any side-effect.Once verified with a photo identification document, beneficiaries were asked to sit in a waiting room while maintaining social distance. The beneficiaries then went inside and got the vaccine shots. After which they were sent to the observation room for 30 minutes to check on any possible symptoms. “It took around 45 minutes for the entire process to get over. I can vouch for the vaccine as I feel no discomfort even 2 hours after taking the first shot. Each person who is getting vaccinated is being informed about the type of vaccine being administered before the injection,” said Dr Abhishek Bhowmick, 32, a senior resident doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital. The hospital was inspected by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, state health minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev and health secretary Vikram Dev Dutt. Kejriwal also interacted with two beneficiaries, including Atmaja Priyadarshini Nayak, a nursing officer. “I was vaccinated in the presence of the chief minister. He also asked about my wellbeing. I have not witnessed any side-effect,” the 37-year-old said. Biji Tony, a nursing officer in Lok Nayak hospital, was the first to get the Covishield vaccine at the state-run facility. At Delhi state cancer institute, 46 healthcare workers were vaccinated on the first day. Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer of vaccination at the institute and Head of Department (HoD) Clinical Oncology, volunteered to take the first shot at the institute. “I decided to take the first shot in an effort to inculcate confidence among my team members,” she said.At around 12:20 am, health care and paramedical staff at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital in Tahirpur welcomed their colleague Dr Akansha Rathore.A senior resident at the hospital, Dr Rathor had been on Covid-19 duty from the beginning of the outbreak. “I am proud and overwhelmed at the same time. I did not face any discomfort. I request people to not believe rumours and participate in the vaccination drive.”RGSS hospital saw 45 vaccinations on day one. Dr Vikas Dogra, head of department of the school of pulmonology, was the first person to get the vaccine shot there. Vinish Kumar, 30, a nursing staff complained of some discomfort after the shot. However, he was immediately shifted to the emergency room for further observation. “Immediately after taking the shot, it felt as though my blood pressure had fluctuated.

Those from Kasturba hospital joined them on Saturday.“We stopped work from today and launched an indefinite strike as our salaries are pending for the last four months. We were last paid in September. We have also refused to take part in the Covid vaccination programme,” BL Sharma, president Kasturba Hospital Nurses’ Union, said.There are nearly 250 nursing and paramedical employees at Kasturba Hospital, while at Hindu Rao Hospital, the number of nursing and paramedical staff is around 350. Nearly 180 paramedic and nursing employees work at Rajan Babu TB Hospital.Sharma said that none of the hospital, dispensary or maternity and child welfare centre was included in the list of facilities where vaccination for Covid-19 was to start in the first phase on Saturday, as authorities were mindful of the ongoing strike.“We had clearly said that the nursing and paramedic staff will not support the Covid vaccination programme till pending salaries are paid. Fearing this, the government decided to do away with municipal centres as vaccination points in the first phase,” Sharma said. Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said that the civic body was making all arrangements to clear salaries and end the deadlock.He, however, hit out at the Delhi government for striking out the names of municipal facilities from the list of Ccovid vaccination centres, where the drive was to be initiated on Saturday and alleged “step-motherly” treatment.“In times such as these, the municipalities worked with the Delhi government and supported them by diligently carrying out our duties. But due to political malice, the (Arvind) Kejriwal government removed the names of municipal centres from the list where vaccinations was supposed to be started from Saturday. We had successfully conducted dry runs at all our centres and we were all prepared,” he said. He added that the government had invoked DDMA act when it had engaged municipal employees in other duties and they could have done the same during the time of vaccination. “All our employees would have participated in the vaccination drive if the Delhi government had allowed vaccination at our centres and invoked DDMA act,” Prakash said. “There are some problems in the MCDs, because the workers are on strike. Keeping in mind that the citizens of Delhi should not face any issue regarding vaccinations, we have taken this decision. The Delhi government is committed to hold successful vaccination drive and it is our responsibility to ensure that the citizens do not face any problem regarding vaccination,” the government said in response to Prakash’s allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nursing-paramedic-staff-of-kasturba-hospital-join-protest-to-demand-pending-wages-101610818431909.html

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperatures, which are for now well below season’s average are likely to rise from Monday, January 18. “The wind direction is currently north-westerly, which is icy cold. The wind directions will start changing to the warmer easterly from Sunday night, which will have an impact on the temperature here from Monday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). The average minimum and maximum temperature for Monday is expected to hover around 9 degrees Celsius (°C) and 21°C. The weather department forecasts the mercury to rise by at least two to three notches by Monday onwards. “There is another western disturbance likely by January 22, which would further improve the harsh weather conditions as the strong easterly winds may improve the air quality and rise the mercury,” added Srivastava. On Saturday, the minimum temperature in Noida were recorded at 7.8 degrees Celsius against 8.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was 18.3 degrees Celsius, against 19.8 degrees Celsius.

Weather conditions will improve further by Sunday and Monday, with winds speeds changing, leading to rise in mercury and improvement in ventilation,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). He added that due to very dense fog in the morning hours in the National Capital region (NCR), the wind speed, though slight faster on Saturday afternoon, was unable to disperse pollutants. The foggy conditions and heavy air, due to low temperatures, tend to trap particle pollutants, making it difficult for moderate or light winds to disperse them. According to CPCB, the AQI of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Saturday was 434 against Friday’s 475. The AQI of Greater Noida was 438 – highest in the country – against 464 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 423, against 458 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered “moderate”, between 201 and 300 is “poor”, between 301 and 400 is considered “very-poor” and above 400 is considered “severe”. Levels of the major pollutant particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in the region saw a slight improvement. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Saturday was 351.22 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3), against 425.37µg/m3 on Friday. The average PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 341.64µg/m3 against 402.37µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level for Ghaziabad was 404.06µg/m3 against 427.67µg/m3 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60µg/m3. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (Safar), AQI is likely to improve to the upper end of “very poor” levels.“Slight improvements in surface winds are observed; wind speed is moderate and west, north-westerly. Due to slightly better ventilation, marginal improvement in air quality is forecasted for Sunday, and the AQI likely to improve to the higher end of “very poor” category. The Safar forecast reveals that AQI will continue at the high end of the “very poor” category for January 18 (Monday). This is likely to be the first extended extreme air pollution event for 2021. Further improvement is expected on January 19 and 20,” said Safar on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-ghaziabad-greater-noida-top-three-polluted-cities-in-country-101610817890893.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra suspends Covid-19 vaccine drive till Jan 18 due to CoWIN app glitch||Against the target of vaccinating 28,500 health workers on the day of the launch of the Covid-19 drive, 64.34 per cent or 18,338 health care workers were inoculated on Saturday in Maharashtra. Technical glitches in CoWIN app triggered communication lag and concerns among the beneficiaries which led to a relatively low turnout, state health officials said. Maharashtra has decided to begin the next session on Tuesday, January 19, after a gap of two days.Barring about 10 cases of mild reaction among the beneficiaries in some of the districts, no major events of 'Adverse Effect Following Immunisation' (AEFI) were reported in the state. The state government, which has planned the immunisation drive according to the Centre allotted stock of vaccines over the next 28 days, has stated that it will demand the additional stock at the earliest.The highest number of immunisations was reported in Mumbai (1,926) against 4,000, though the percentage (48.15 per cent) was the lowest in the state. Districts that clocked high percentage of inoculation included Hingoli (100 per cent ), Beed (90.2 per cent), Buldhana (95.83 per cent).Also read: 2 Delhi health workers felt slight tightness in chest after Covid shot Official“We always expect 100 per cent turnout, but because of the technical glitches in the CoWIN app which resulted in the late alerts to the beneficiaries about their turn for inoculation, there was a drop in response. We have been sending the messages to the beneficiaries a day prior to the vaccination and it too may be the reason for a low turnout,” said Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer.According to another official from the state health department, some of the beneficiaries are in ‘wait and watch’ mindset and are expected to turn up gauging the results of the vaccination in initial days. With very few cases of Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI), we expect the remaining beneficiaries to turn up over the next few days, he added.In six districts of Nagpur division, the turnout percentage was 63, while in four districts of Latur division it was 68 per cent. “We will accommodate the beneficiaries left out today to accommodate in next few days. The response from the beneficiaries will increase from next week,” said Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director, health services, Nagpur division.Also read: Here is what health workers said after getting Covid-19 shotsThane District saw 75.65 per cent vaccination as 1,740 beneficiaries got vaccinated out of 2,300 in 23 centres. The district saw no major glitches apart from server error, while no side effects were reported. Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation was the only corporation in the city to complete the 100 per cent vaccination target, as the drive began on time and ended on time with no chaos. Mira Bhayander reported 89.33 per cent turnout, Thane city 88.25 per cent, Navi Mumbai 78 per cent, Ulhasnagar 71 per cent, Thane rural 69.40 per cent, and Bhiwandi Nizampur 61.33 per cent.Abhijeet Bangar, NMMC commissioner, said that the number is likely to increase in the coming days.Thane District Collector, Rajesh Narvekar, inaugurated the vaccination drive in the city on Saturday. "This is a day of pride and happiness, more because the vaccine will first be given to our Covid warriors who have put in a lot of hard work to keep the situation under control in the last few months," said Narvekar.Dr Patil said that barring a few minor cases of reactions such as giddiness, nausea and inflammation, no major reaction was reported in the state. “Though the vaccine is new, we have machinery in place for the vaccination. We had vaccinated 2.92 crore people during our Measle and Rubella mass vaccination drive last year. The backup machinery to take care of any reaction was ready but no beneficiary required hospitalisation,” he said.Also read: I&B ministry starts work on self-regulation law for OTT platforms, online newsMany districts faced technical glitches in the CoWIN app that resulted in a communication lag. The vaccination teams were instructed to the refer and feed the data offline. "The server slowed down leading difficulties in uploading the data at many centres in our division. In Dhule district, all four centres faced problems. We have now directed the vaccination teams to register the details offline and then upload it subsequently. We had to use hard copies of beneficiaries data as the online data was not available for reference due to the glitches," said Dr PD Gandal, deputy director, health services, Nashik Division.“The server had slowed down owing to which the messages could not be sent out. The issue was resolved by 2 am after which the messages were sent to the beneficiaries,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department.The state government has decided not to hold the vaccination drive for two days on Sunday and Monday to work on the loopholes in the system. From Tuesday, the drive will start in a full-fledged manner. One of the main reasons for halting is the dysfunctional centralised CoWIN app. The state government has provided excel sheets to districts officers to upload data but as per BMC sources, that is also not working.Dr Vyas said that the next session will be held either from Monday or Tuesday once the issues related to the CoWIN app were discussed with the Centre.The state is holding four sessions a week and is expected to vaccinate about 4.4 lakh healthcare workers in 15 sessions over 28 days. The stock of 9,83,000 vials could cover about 4.4 lakh health workers with two doses each.When asked about the short supply of the vaccines, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that it is the responsibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that all the states get proportionate number of vaccines. “I do not want to politicise it, but Centre should ensure that all the states get the vaccine in the proportion of the population,” he said.Thackeray, who inaugurated the drive at BKC in Mumbai at 11.30 am on Saturday, said that there is no clarity if common people will get free vaccine as the call has to be taken by the Centre. “It is the call taken by the Centre over the charges towards vaccination, quota allotted to the states etc. There are 2-3 more vaccines expected to enter the market in the next few weeks after which there would be an adequate supply of the jab. I believe that the vaccine allocated to the states would increase after that,” he said.State health minister said that there were no major incidents of Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) reported. “People are happy to get inoculated and have been waiting for their turn. I am sure, once the prioritised groups are vaccinated in next 3-4 months, the vaccine will be available for the general public. We are also going to ask for the additional stock of the vaccines during our video conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan,” he said.Dr Padmaja Saraf was the first beneficiary at the Jalna district hospital. She said, “After having gone through very challenging times at the hospital when the pandemic was at the peak, I am happy that the vaccine is now available. The vaccine is very safe and everybody should go for it whenever available,” she said.Meanwhile, the state reported 2,910 cases of Covid-19 and 52 deaths on Saturday taking the tally to 1,987,678 and death toll to 50,388. Mumbai clocked 571 cases and 8 new deaths taking the total of cases to 3,02,226 and toll to 11,237.Maharashtra has 51,965 active Covid-19 patients with the highest number of patients in Pune, 15887, followed by 9,608 in Thane and 6,966 in Mumbai. State’s recovery rate stands at 94.79 per cent as 18,841,27 patients have recovered from the contagion so far.

With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. Later, in 2017, he joined SAD. The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 last year. Last week, SAD had officially declared a list of 28 candidates (all of whom were former councillors) for the upcoming elections, but on January 11, 22 of them sided with Kulwant.With the latest development, a four-cornered fight awaits the MC polls. In the fray are SAD, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Kulwant’s group. The splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has opted out of the elections and will support AAP candidates and independents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akali-dal-expels-former-mohali-mayor-kulwant-singh-101610815430826.html

BJP leader sees many a slip between the cup and the lip Newly elected mayor Ravi Kant Sharma, who got elected after bitter internal party feud in the BJP, was in for an image boost after the Chandigarh administration announced a financial package for the municipal corporation. But not all in the party were impressed or keen to credit Sharma. At a luncheon hosted by Sharma at his official residence, a senior party functionary said, “The financial package is an annual feature. What’s so big about it? The administration makes such announcements every January but seldom delivers. There is many a slip between the cup and the lip.” Ex-SAD councillors upset with calls to contest on party symbol A former councillor of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), who has sided with former mayor Kulwant Singh to contest the Mohali municipal corporation elections independently next month, says most like him are upset with the high command for pressuring them to contest on the party symbol. One of the councillors said all former members have been getting calls repeatedly from different leaders to return to the party fold despite being told that they’ve decided to contest independently. Heartwarming gesture by Chandigarh Police Amid the severe cold wave, Chandigarh Police reached out to needy residents and distributed blankets. The police station at Mauli Jagran organised a citizen outreach programme during which blankets were distributed to 150 senior citizens on the occasion of Lohri. DSP (East) Gurmukh Singh led the police team at the event. Weather office foggy on forecasting fog The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been accurate in warning us about severely cold days this season but its fog forecast has been more of a hit and miss. Only light to moderate fog was predicted in the city on Saturday but it ended up in dense fog. Foggy days turned out to be clear and sunny. However, in the IMD’s defence, it issues forecasts for the region with Chandigarh being a small constituent so some discrepancies can creep in.

The moment I came to know that my name figured in the list of health workers, I contacted the district chief medical officer of health (CMOH) and refused to take the vaccine. I am at Alipurduar district hospital overseeing the vaccination program,” said Chakraborty.The BJP didn’t leave a chance to take a jibe at the ruling TMC.“The MLA must have tried to hoodwink people by getting the first vaccine as he holds a doctorate degree and is not a doctor. As the news became public, the ruling TMC and Chakraborty, in particular, have been ridiculed by common people,” said Ganga Prasad Sharma, BJP Alipurduar district committee president.Also read: Some states report hurdle in vaccination as CoWIN app develops glitchesThe TMC leadership downplayed the incident calling it an error that was being blown out of proportion.“To err is human. As if BJP leaders do not make any mistakes and are always right. The matter has ended because Chakraborty has himself dropped his name. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has strictly directed that only health workers should get the vaccine,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson and minister.Meanwhile, at least two legislators of the ruling Trinamool Congress received Covid-19 vaccine on the first day of nationwide vaccination drive along with thousands of healthcare workers.The two TMC legislators who received the vaccine on Saturday were Rabindranath Chatterjee, MLA of Katwa, and Subhash Mondol, MLA of Bhatar. Both are assembly constituencies in East Burdwan district in south Bengal.“I have received the vaccine. Everyone will get in turn. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee will arrange the vaccine for every citizen of West Bengal,” said Mondol.Also read: In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priority“I received a message that I would be getting a vaccine.

They need to regularly come to the hospital and hence their names were selected.The BJP, however, took a jibe saying that it was surprising to see only two TMC legislators taking the vaccine.“What can I say? This is TMC. But I am surprised to see that only two came,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.“I don’t know whether they have taken the vaccine. But it would be wrong to take the vaccine today as it was meant for health workers only,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/to-err-is-human-says-tmc-as-mla-s-name-figures-in-list-of-vaccine-recipients-101610811859664.html

His wife, a homemaker, had contracted the virus last July. Babu was the first to receive the jab among 4.64 lakh healthcare workers in Bihar on Saturday.“I am perfectly fine. There is nothing to fear about the vaccine. I will request all to take the shot. I wish my family could also be vaccinated at this stage itself,” said Babu, holding a red rose as he sat in the observation room for over 90 minutes after vaccination. He was swarmed by shutterbugs and newshounds who were trying to take his soundbite.Also read: In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priorityThat he would acquire a celebrity status never came to Babu’s mind when he was randomly selected for the first day of the vaccination drive.“Two days prior to the vaccination, I got the first communication through my department (preventive and social medicine at IGIMS). A day later, the Bihar health minister was on phone and asked me if I could come to the State Health Society to be introduced to the media. Though I agreed, I didn’t understand till then what was happening. Today, when I look back, I feel very happy about it,” said Babu, who took the shot of Serum Institute’s Covishield in the presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar.Babu’s wife was equally happy that her husband had become the cynosure of all eyes.“I wish my children and I were also vaccinated at this stage itself,” she said.With colleagues like Neeraj, 21, an electrical attendant, requesting to be photographed alongside Babu, the sanitary attendant knew that God has answered his prayers.Talking about the initiative to get an outsourced sanitary staff vaccinated first, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, Pratyaya Amrit said, “They are the unsung heroes. People don’t see their work. The sanitary employees have toiled day and night through the pandemic. These unsung heroes have played a vital role in controlling the spread of the contagion, and Bihar is in a much better condition today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/dont-fear-it-s-safe-says-sanitary-staff-who-gets-first-vaccine-jab-in-bihar-101610808743320.html

He is saying that the police should not be demoralised. Those in power in Bihar are protecting criminals,” Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Bihar is turning into the crime capital of the country. The number of incidents of crime is increasing here. It was ridiculous to see the chief minister yesterday. Nitish Kumar seemed helpless, very weak and tired,” he added.Kumar on Friday while speaking to reporters lost his cool at those who questioned him regarding the state of law and order in Bihar citing the death of IndiGo Patna station manager Rupesh Singh. A visibly irritated chief minister had asked the reporters to not mix up issues of crime and development.The government in Bihar is under pressure to solve the murder of Rupesh Singh, who was shot by unknown assailants outside his apartment in Punaichak area in Patna on Tuesday evening.Yadav has been criticising the Janata Dal(United)-led government in the state over the killing of the IndiGo employee.

He was rushed to Sir JJ Hospital where after X-ray and CT-scan, it was found that the accused was allegedly carrying more drugs. The doctors tried to eject the drug-filled capsules from his body. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said, “The accused has been arrested. He is in JJ Hospital and the doctors are trying to eject more drugs from his abdomen”. Officers are probing how the accused had entered the country and if he is staying on a valid visa or illegally and since how long has he been in the drug smuggling racket, said Wankhede. On the basis of preliminary inquiry, it appears that the accused has been smuggling cocaine into the city, said officers. He has a bracket in his mouth where he used to hid drugs (capsules filled with cocaine) and then wait outside five star hotels where customers approach him for the contraband, an NCB officer said. After a tip-off, a team from NCB laid a trap outside the Juhu hotel and nabbed the Nigerian national. During inquiry, he removed some capsules from his mouth which he was hiding in a bracket, said the officer. NCB officers said while following such a modus operandi, the smuggler does not eat anything because the movement in abdomen could rupture the capsules, leading to death. “In such cases, during preliminary inquiry, we offer them food, and if they refuse, our suspicion gets fortified. The X-ray and CT scan tests were carried out in this case, following a court order,” added the officer. This is an old modus operandi, mostly used by smugglers to avoid being caught at airports. Once drugs are smuggled into the city, the smugglers use peddlers – mostly foreigners who come on business or education visa – to approach customers. The method is used to reduce the risk of getting caught. In the illicit market, one gram cocaine is worth between Rs5,000 and Rs10,000, depending on quality of the contraband material, said the officer. In 2013, in a similar case, the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) of Mumbai customs had arrested two Tanzanian nationals at Mumbai airport for allegedly smuggling cocaine by ingesting capsules. One of them died on the way to hospital after the capsules exploded inside his abdomen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/foreign-national-hides-cocaine-capsules-in-cavity-in-mouth-held-in-mumbai-101610799949766.html

We believe the lack of public transport is discouraging more students from reaching their allotted institute to confirm admissions, and therefore, a two-week extension will be helpful,” read the statement released by the association.Pre-admission registrations to ITI courses began in August and went on till September 2020. From 2.8 lakh registrations recorded in the 2019-20 academic year, registrations stood at 3.5 lakh for the 2020-21 academic year. Many experts attributed the spike to the encouragement given by Central and state governments to skill-based learning.However, ITI college principals were also worried that the spike in registration numbers might not necessarily result in a high number of admissions. “This year, registrations to ITIs began before admissions to junior colleges had even started, so that could be one of the reasons more students registered for ITIs as a back-up plan. The same numbers don’t seem to be reflecting in classrooms at present. So with added time, institutes are hoping to attract more students to confirm admissions before they start their academic calendar,” said the principal of a city-based ITI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-itis-seek-admission-deadline-extension-to-accommodate-more-students-101610798630250.html

He was arrested on the basis of a complaint lodged last year in September by Ashutosh Shah, an advertisement firm director, for alleged criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy. The first information report (FIR) was registered at Juhu police station but considering the magnitude of the case, it was transferred to EOW for further investigation. During its probe, EOW officers carried out searches at various premises of the accused. EOW said that Anugrah Stock has around 30,000 clients. “Nearly 400 investors have approached us so far, alleging that Kariya had pledged their shares with the clearing house and later told them that he had suffered losses and defaulted in returning their money,” said an EOW officer. Kariya is also accused of violating Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) norms by guaranteeing returns to investors. In the past, he reportedly told the police that his firm suffered a loss of around Rs600 crore during the market crash in 2020. He allegedly pledged his clients’ shares worth over Rs100 crore to get margin for trading. The clearing house then squared off his pledged shares and sold it at lower prices at the time, officers said. “Kariya was produced in court on Friday and was remanded police custody for six days (January 21). The investigation is on,” inspector Rajesh Kewale said. The FIR names two more accused, but they are yet to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-police-s-eow-arrests-director-of-brokerage-firm-in-450-crore-cheating-case-101610798570000.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Newly appointed registrar joins Mumbai university after a stand-off between VC and state government||The first day of the newly-appointed registrar of the University of Mumbai (MU), Ramdas Atram, the former director of Institute of Science, Nagpur, turned into a nightmare, as he was not allowed to take charge of his post, on Friday. The vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar awaited the clarity from the state government. The drama ended only at 5pm after the state government clarified and reaffirmed the appointment, following which, Atram officially took over the post.“Atram was at the vice-chancellor’s office on Friday at 10:30am with his relieving letter from the Institute of Science, Nagpur, and his joining letter approved by the state. Pednekar, however, had written to the state government two days prior, asking them to allow the current in-charge registrar, Baliram Gaikwad to continue on the post, and had asked Atram to go back to his previous post in Nagpur, until there’s clarity,” said a senior MU official on condition of anonymity.The state government, on January 8, had released a notification confirming the appointment of Atram for the post of the registrar for the University of Mumbai. The post had been lying vacant since July 2020, after the former registrar Ajay Deshmukh passed away. The state government notification states that Atram has been approved for the post of MU registrar for one year only.However, Pednekar had written to the state government on January 13, asking the government to rethink their decision stating that the current in-charge registrar Gaikwad “has been doing well at the post”, said the letter. “Pednekar mentioned the good work done by Gaikwad and asked for the government to consider continuing with the same in-charge registrar, instead of bringing someone from another city or university to MU in the middle of the academic year. However, Atram was already relieved of his post as director of Institute of Science (Nagpur) by then, so the government clarified that the new appointment will stay put,” said an official from the state ministry for higher and technical education.On Friday, while Pednekar waited for the government to respond to his letter, Atram had submitted his documents and the joining report to the concerned MU department as part of his joining process. Clarity on his hiring came only around 5pm.A spokesperson for the university refuted allegations of a stand-off between Pednekar and the state government. He told HT that the VC was only waiting for a response to his letter before making changes to the current office. “Atram was not asked to leave the university, he was only asked to delay the joining until the government responds to VC’s letter. Once the clarification from the state government came through, Atram immediately took over the post of registrar of MU,” said the MU spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/newly-appointed-registrar-joins-mumbai-university-after-a-stand-off-between-vc-and-state-government-101610798389687.html

Its cloacal, tracheal and ocular swabs were sent to the animal husbandry unit of the Delhi government for serological examination," zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said.The samples were found positive for H5N8 avian influenza virus under real time RT-PCR test done by ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), Bhopal, on Friday, he said.As per protocols and guidelines issued by the Centre and the Delhi government, sanitisation and surveillance drills have been intensified in the zoo and all possible preventive measures are being taken, Pandey said."Birds in captivity have been isolated and are under consistent monitoring and care for their behaviour and health. Spray of lime, virkon-S and sodium hypochlorite and foot bath of potassium permanganate are being done on regular intervals every day," he said.Chicken feed to raptors and entry of vehicles inside the zoo have already been stopped. Movement of staff is also being restricted and regulated in view of the bird flu outbreak.The Delhi zoo has both captive and free-ranging birds, including local migratory waterfowls and waders, in its premises.On Monday, samples taken from crows and ducks at parks and lakes in the national capital had tested positive for the avian influenza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bird-flu-confirmed-in-owl-found-dead-in-delhi-zoo-101610797843917.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC questions validity of field testing of narcotic, psychotropic substances||In an important order, the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday questioned the validity of field testing of narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances by law enforcement agencies for lack of documented standards.Justice Sandeep Shinde said in the absence of any documented standards of colour test reagents for preliminary identification of drugs seized from an accused, entire field testing of the suspect substance — as to whether the colour produced after reaction with the reagent matches with expected colour pattern for a particular drug or not — was left to the understanding of field officers, which the judge held to be “arbitrary”.The court made the observation while granting bail to 27-year-old Ulhasnagar resident Sagar Joshi, who has been booked by Kopar Khairane police station in Navi Mumbai for alleged possession of 65 grams of amphetamine, a psychotropic substance.Joshi was arrested on October 11, 2019, along with one of his colleagues at a pharmaceutical company at Ambernath. He claimed that the substance seized from them was “Ramlatan powder”.His counsel, advocate Sanjeev Kadam, submitted that the pre-trap panchanama did not show that the raiding team was carrying field testing kit which shows that no field test was conducted. He pointed out that the seizure panchanama merely mentioned that the field test indicated that the seized substance was amphetamine, but no field test reports were submitted with the charge sheet.The court found matter in his submissions. Justice Shinde said that in the case at hand, the prosecution claimed that white powder was seized from Joshi and his colleague and when tested with reagents, it produced dark brown colour, a colour pattern for amphetamine. “However, there are no documented, set standards as to which substance upon testing with reagent/s would produce which colour,” said the judge. “Thus, all and every aspect of field testing is left to the experience, knowledge and perception of the law enforcement officer,” he said.In the United States of America, the HC said, the National Institute of Justice has set standards for colour test reagents or kits for preliminary identification of drugs and has itemised particulars of final colours produced by reagents with various drugs and other substances.The court said no such document, if any issued by the ministry of home affairs, was produced by the police to prima facie ascertain and satisfy the authenticity of field test kit results.It further said standardisation of field test results was necessary in view of the fact that most of the drugs abused today are refined processed substances and are mostly circulated as white, off-white or brown powder, crystals or flakes or colourless, odourless liquids, and, therefore, it was very difficult to identify these substance unless tested with different reagents.In Joshi’s case, HC said, the police claimed that the seized substance was tested on field by using a field kit and the result matched for amphetamine. But, there was no material to prima facie accept that the substance recovered from the applicant was amphetamine except mere mentioning of the field test result in the seizure memo, and even the field test report was not annexed to the charge sheet.The HC also accepted Kadam’s argument that the charge sheet filed against Joshi was incomplete in as much as it did not contain the chemical analyser’s report about the seized substance and therefore, the accused was entitled to default bail on completion of 180 days, as contemplated under section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code.“It may not be overlooked that the chemical analyser’s report is an essential, integral and inherent part of the investigation under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and would lay foundation for culpability of the accused, without which the magistrate would not be able to form an opinion and take cognisance of involvement of the accused in commission of offence under the Act,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-questions-validity-of-field-testing-of-narcotic-psychotropic-substances-101610797729624.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||There has been a reluctance to introduce bicycles in Mumbai: MMRDA commissioner||Hinting at bureaucratic hurdles, metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev on Saturday said that there has been a lot of reluctance towards introducing cycles in Mumbai. Rajeev said this at an event to inaugurate a public bike-sharing system at the Versova Metro station. “There has been a reluctance to introduce bicycles in Mumbai by saying that the roads are congested. There are, however, two aspects to it. We have to introduce more of these facilities and people should also start cycling more. This will create a revolution and also decongest the roads,” Rajeev said. He further said that when there are more cyclists on road, city planners will be forced to create space for them. “Create the demand and city will give you space,” he said. On Saturday, the commissioner inaugurated public bike-sharing service from Versova metro station. The service, which started at Jagruti Nagar Metro station in 2019, will further be extended to DN Nagar and Azad Nagar metro stations in another 10 days, officials said. Commuters can rent a bike for ₹2/hour or get weekly and monthly passes for ₹280 and ₹900 respectively. The bikes can be taken home and parked at the Metro stations. MyByk (which runs the services) was part of a mobility challenge launched by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd. and World Resources Institute (WRI) in 2019. Madhav Pai, director, WRI India on Saturday said, “With 337 km of Metro network in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, last-mile connectivity will be a major challenge. Commuters need to be provided with a lot of options, of which, cycling will prove to be the most attractive option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/there-has-been-a-reluctance-to-introduce-bicycles-in-mumbai-mmrda-commissioner-101610797189664.html

But Pawar's statements on Munde are surprising. The BJP mahila morcha will protest against Munde across the state on Monday," Patil said.Patil said Munde's poll affidavit can be challenged as he has now accepted he has two children from a relationship with the complainant's sister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-bjp-chief-patil-says-surprised-by-pawar-s-statements-backing-munde-101610796269586.html

I am fine and have no problem,” said Amar Bahadur, who has been working at KGMU since 1995.“My son, who is in the merchant navy, also knew that I would be among first to be vaccinated,” he said.Amar came in the morning and was examined by the staff. He went to listen to the PM’s address in a hall at the vaccination centre at the Kalam Centre building. Minutes after, he was called for the vaccination and, by 11.15am, he was out in the observation room.“The entire process went off smoothly. A simple prick and I was vaccinated. It’s safe as any other vaccination programme,” he said.Amar Bahadur waited until the doctors said he could leave the vaccination centre that had listed 100 beneficiaries to be vaccinated on the first day.Asked what he would do next, he said, “Life will be normal. I think I will have no problem despite the fact that I have uncontrolled sugar, but this vaccine will save me from Covid infection.

16-01-2021||Other||NIA summons farm union leader Baldev Singh Sirsa, Sikh activists for questioning in sedition case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has summoned Baldev Singh Sirsa, who heads the Lok Bhalai Insaf Welfare Society that is one of the unions taking part in the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, besides Sikh activists in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) legal adviser Gurpatwant Singh Pannu. Sirsa has been summoned to the NIA headquarters in Delhi on January 17 for questioning in the case against Pannu for conspiring to create an “atmosphere of fear and lawlessness and to cause disaffection in people and to incite them towards rising in rebellion against the Government of India”. Reacting to the summons, Sirsa, who was one of the farmers’ representatives negotiating with the government over the farm laws, said, “The government is fearing the tractor parade in Delhi on January 26 and is trying to terrorise people of Punjab by sending these notices through the NIA. The sole motive is to derail the farmer agitation. However, we will continue our struggle for the repeal of the laws.” To oppose the NIA’s move, Sirsa led supporters at the site of a protest outside a mall in Amritsar. Several Sikh activists, who had also received the notices, joined them. BID TO STIFLE VOICE OF DISSENT: SIKH ACTIVISTTalking over phone, Canada-based freelance community journalist and analyst Baltej Pannu, who also received the summons, said, “I only cover developments related to Punjab and don’t have any direct link with farmer organisations or their funding. As far as the SFJ is concerned, to which I have being linked in the notice, its functionaries hurl abuses at me. They issue threats to my family. I’m surprised to be linked with this outfit by the government.” “The government wants to tighten the noose around activists supporting the farmers’ cause. It is misuse of power to stifle the voice of dissent,” said Ranjit Singh, the senior vice-president of the Sikh Youth Federation (Bhindranwale), who has been asked to appear at the NIA headquarters on January 21. Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu and his brother Mandeep have also received the NIA notice. “I’ve been participating in the farmers’ agitation since Day 1. To demoralise me, the government has chosen to harass my family members, too. They don’t have any link with my activism,” Deep said. Those summoned by the NIA include a tourist bus operator Inderpal Singh Judge, 47, a nut bolt manufacturer, Naresh Kumar, 56, a cable TV operator, Jaspal Singh, 56, besides Sikh activists Surinder Singh Thikriwala, Nobeljit Singh from Hoshiarpur, Palwinder Singh, Pardeep Singh, Parmjit Singh Akali and Sikh writer Balwinderpal Singh Jalandhar. BJP GOVT STIFLING FARMERS’ VOICE: SGPC Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur condemned the notices, saying “The BJP-led Union government is stifling the voice of farmers. The notice is a manifestation of the dictatorial policy of the government by misusing the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to suppress people associated with the agitation. Farmers are fighting for existence but the government machinery is being misused to suppress their voice which is not tolerable.” “If anyone opposes the injustice to him, is he anti-national? Is worrying for one’s future generations and fighting for one’s rights a divisive act?” she said, alleging that the Narendra Modi government is “destroying” democracy with its “ego and pride” instead of considering the demands of the farmers. NGOs Khalra Mission Organisation and the Punjab Human Rights Organisation (PHRO) termed the notice a violation of human rights and desecration of democratic ethos. “This is nothing but harassing people agitating peacefully for their rights,” the joint statement by these organisations said. The case against the SFJ leader was registered under Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on December 15, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nia-summons-farm-union-leader-baldev-singh-sirsa-sikh-activists-for-questioning-in-sedition-case-101610795269310.html

According to ANI, they were granted bail on the grounds that they were simply present at the spot at the time of the incident. The accused will be released on a surety of ₹15,000 each, the court said.On Wednesday, district judge SB Bahalkar heard arguments presented by special public prosecutor Satish Maneshinde and defence counsels Amrut Adhikari and Atul Patil appearing for the arrested accused in a dozen bail pleas. Maneshinde told the court that the applicants before the court were present at the scene, but they had no active part in the crime.Of the total 165 accused lodged in jail, 90 have sought bail and the court will decide on their pleas on January 16, defence counsel Adhikari said, according to news agency PTI. The court had earlier granted bail to 105 accused and rejected the pleas of 36 others, whose role, the court stated, had been proven and hence, they did not deserve bail.The defence counsels told the court that the applicants had no role to play in the incident and the police had arrested them on mere suspicion and based their mobile tower location. The accused also questioned the validity of three FIRs being registered for the same incident.Seventy-year-old Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri and Sushilgiri Maharaj, 35), and their driver Nilesh Telgade, 30 were lynched by a mob at Gadchinchale in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, about 140km north of Mumbai, on April 16, 2020.

However, the drive went on smoothly after the vaccination process was shifted to a new location.Farmers reached one of the two vaccination centres in Kaithal, set up at a school, and demanded that the Covid-19 vaccine is first given to BJP leaders and top level officials."We are not against this vaccination but they should give this vaccine to top officials,” said Hoshiar Singh Gill, BKU (Charuni) district president.Gill said that they also came to know that the local BJP MLA, Leela Ram Gurjar, was to inaugurate the vaccination drive, and this agitated the farmers as the MLA had raised questions over the ongoing farmers' agitation against the three agriculture laws.When contacted, Kaithal superintendent of police, Lokender Singh said that some people were protesting at the vaccination centre and therefore the drive was shifted to civil hospital in Kaithal.He added that the situation was under control and the vaccination drive was now going on smoothly.Kaithal health department officials said two vaccination centres had been set up in Kaithal and 100 people at each centre will be vaccinated on the inaugural day of the drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-farmers-protest-vaccination-centre-shifted-in-haryana-s-kaithal-101610791254551.html

Not all messages were going to health workers who were supposed to receive the vaccine on Saturday morning. The persons concerned were individually called up and informed over the phone,” said a senior official of the state health department.On Saturday morning too, when the vaccination drive took off at 204 centres across the state, problems were encountered with the app.“The data of the beneficiaries who received the vaccine was supposed to be uploaded. But it was taking a lot of time as the app was working too slowly. Rest everything went fine,” said a doctor from Kandi sub-divisional hospital in Murshidabad district, around 200 km north of Kolkata.In another hospital in South 24 Parganas, doctors encountered the same problem and had to enter the names and details of the beneficiaries on paper.“The app was not opening. We had to log in and log out several times. It was also too slow. We were asked to enter the details manually on paper,” said a doctor from Caning sub-divisional hospital in South 24 Parganas, around 60 km south of Kolkata.Senior health department officials in Kolkata said the matter had been flagged and was being taken care of.“The app was developed by the centre. We have informed the persons concerned and the matter was being taken care of. Apart from some minor glitches everything was going fine. Not a single beneficiary had developed any complications.

Without thinking twice, I said yes. I am happy that I got an opportunity to serve the nation,” said Yadav.Yadav is a contractual employee and is the sole bread-earner of his family of four people. Yadav has shown through for his commitment while managing the crowd of patients and visitors at the hospital without taking a single leave since March 2020, said a hospital official.“I live with my wife and two sons. My family fears for my health as I have been exposed to Covid 19 patients for the past nine months. When I informed my family about the inoculation against Covid 19, they showed concern and asked about its side effects. But I convinced them that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has himself guaranteed the safety of people taking vaccines so they shouldn’t worry about it,” Yadav said.Yadav, who lives in a slum at Roshanpura Square in Bhopal, said after receiving the vaccine, his neighbours would not avoid him. “My neighbours used to avoid talking to me and to my family as I work in a Covid-19 dedicated hospital. I never felt offended. I used to take all precautions because I didn’t want to spread the infection like Dharavi in Mumbai,” he added.In Indore, Asha Pawar became the first person to get a shot of Covid 19 vaccine. A grandmother, Asha works as a sanitation worker at the district hospital. “I have volunteered for the vaccine shot. The health officials asked me to take the vaccine and I immediately agreed. My family members are happy with my decision,” said Pawar.Pawar lives in a small house with her son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren. “I used to be really worried about the health of my family as I was working at a Covid-19 ward. Now my biggest worry will end with the vaccination.”Pawar said she faced many challenges while working at the hospital during the outbreak of Covid-19. “It was not easy for me to work wearing a PPE kit and mask for many hours in a day. When the number of Covid-19 cases increased by many times in August and September last, I stopped interacting with my family for their safety. My grandchildren used to get upset with me but I controlled my feelings,” she added.As many as 4.17 lakh healthcare workers will be administered the vaccine in the first phase of the drive in Madhya Pradesh.

16-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai temperature dips to 16.6 degree C, air gets cleaner on Saturday||Mumbai woke up to a chilly Saturday morning as temperatures dropped to 16.6 degree Celsius, the lowest so far, this year. Residents also breathed the cleanest air this year with the air quality index at 166.The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degree Celsius, a degree below normal. This is the second lowest minimum temperature recorded this season following a mercury drop to 16 degree Celsius on December 22 last year.Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degree Celsius, which was at par with the normal temperature. The IMD attributed this drop in temperature to the cold westerly winds.“There was a nice chill in the air as westerly winds have started blowing over parts of the state. Since, parts of northwest India are under the influence of a cold wave, north-westerly winds from these parts are colder. Minimum temperature in the state is expected to see a gradual fall in the coming days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Meanwhile, the air quality improved further on Saturday. Air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator-- of 166 (moderate), was recorded on Saturday morning. This is better than Friday’s 190.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.“Winds blowing from the north and west have cleared the air of pollutants. If the wind continues, air quality will remain moderate for the next couple of days, despite a drop in temperatures. However, without the winds, air quality may become worse,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-temperature-dips-to-16-6-degree-c-air-gets-cleaner-on-saturday-101610777423244.html

I extend my wishes to the citizens," he added.The Prime Minister also lauded scientists who were involved in the vaccine research."Today, scientists and those who are involved in vaccine research, deserve special praise.

16-01-2021||Patna||Bihar Congress vows not to let farm laws take effect; march to support farmers||Hundreds of Congress workers took out a march in Patna on Friday to support the farmers’ agitation against the three controversial farms laws passed by the Central government.All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Tariq Anwar, Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Madan Mohan Jha, chairman of BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh, AICC media panellist Prem Chandra Mishra and BPCC working president Shyam Sundar Singh Dheeraj led the procession, which had to be terminated near Rajapur chowk, about one kilometre away from the BPCC office.The party workers had planned to march up to Raj Bhawan in support of the protesting farmers’ demand for repeal of the farm laws but were prevented by the police from proceeding further after they had reached near Rajapur chowk.The party workers carried the party flag and shouted slogan against the Central government over its reluctance to repeal the laws, which protesting farmers fear would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporates.Addressing the party workers near Rajapur Pul on Boring Canal Road, where they were stopped by the police, AICC general secretary Anwar said, the party would not let the BJP-led government enforce the new laws at any cost. “The Congress is with the farmers and it would continue to support them without any political motive,” said Anwar.BPCC chief Jha thanked the leaders for turning up in large numbers and said no force could make the farmers bow. MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said the farmers from Bihar were standing in solidarity with those agitating around the national capital.“The new laws, if implemented, would make farmers sell their produce at throw away prices to the corporates,” said Mishra.Senior leaders including former MLC Ajay Kumar Singh, former BPCC vice president Pravin Kushwaha, state Intuc president Chandra Prakash, MLA VS Dubey, et al, also addressed the gathering and called upon party workers to sensitise people about the implications of the newly passed farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-congress-vows-not-to-let-farm-laws-take-effect-march-to-support-farmers-101610772232095.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||‘Want health insurance for sanitation workers’||After Rajesh Tambe completed his undergraduate degree in arts from Mumbai University, he could only find work as a computer hardware repairman in a private firm. Unhappy with the job, which was time-intensive and left him with no opportunity to pursue his dream of joining the civil services, he quit in 2015 and joined the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. He was given a job as a sanitation worker. Everyday, he would start his work at 7.30am and spent eight hours cleaning the drains alongside the arterial roads in Mumbai's Chembur suburb. In the evening, he would go back to his home and study for the state public service exam.Then, Covid-19 hit Mumbai.Starting March 25, when the government clamped a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the virus, Tambe worked 12 hours a day in India’s worst-hit city at the time. Around him, Mumbai teetered on the brink of collapse with hospitals struggling to deal with surging infections and patients sometimes waiting for days for an ambulance. But Tambe went to work, every day, without fail, for three months.“As only bus services were available, the daily commute was three to four hours,” said Tambe.Across India, close to 20 million municipal workers like him became an effective frontline force to manage containment zones and provide essential supplies in these areas, apart from carrying out daily santisation of localities. Many of them died due to exposure to the virus and other hazardous waste.During Covid-19, Tambe was part of BMC’s team that focussed on cleaning and disinfection of public places, considered risk prone areas for local spread of the virus.“It was a tough time. I avoided going home as I was concerned that I may transmit the virus to my two-year-old daughter, and this constant thought was an added stress.” Things are better now, he added.The number of cases have come down drastically in Mumbai, from its peak of 2,000 cases daily in September to 500-600 cases daily in January.In Tambe’s Navi Mumbai house that he shares with his wife and daughter, there is relief at the improved condition. “Our situation is way better now than what we faced during Covid-19. During the lockdown, we were unsure if we would get groceries on time and would always fear of running out of money. We somehow sailed through difficult times,” he said.In its budget 2020-21, BMC allocated ₹239 crores for solid waste management. This includes cleanliness, construction of toilets, and waste management. The civic body spent over ₹1,600 crore for Covid-related expenses which included cleanliness and sanitisation of public places.In the Union budget, Tambe wants the Centre to allocate funds for medical insurance of all sanitation workers in the country.He draws a monthly salary of ₹20,000, and says it is a struggle to meet ends every month. “Our jobs are the most vulnerable and even during this pandemic, we worked on cleaning areas throughout the year. The least we expect is medical cover by the government,” he said.Tambe, who is preparing for Maharashtra Public Service Commission examination, also hopes for a special scholarship scheme for children of sanitation workers to pursue higher education. “We cannot pay fees of private institutions. The government should provide scholarships to our children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/want-health-insurance-for-sanitation-workers-101610764000307.html

16-01-2021||Delhi||Koli held guilty in 12th Nithari murder case, employer Pandher acquitted||A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court in Ghaziabad on Friday held prime accused in the Nithari murders Surinder Koli guilty but acquitted his employer Mondinder Singh Pandher in a case linked to the murders.The case is of the abduction, attempted rape and murder of a 20-year-old domestic help and destruction of evidence in the crime. Lawyers attached to the case said that the quantum of punishment is likely to be pronounced on Saturday.The infamous Nithari murders were believed to be committed between 2005 and 2006. In December 2006, skeletons were found in a drain near to a house in Nithari, Noida. Pandher is the owner of the house and Koli was his domestic help.The CBI registered 16 cases, charge sheeting Koli in all of them for murder, abduction, rape besides destruction of evidence, and Pandher in one for immoral trafficking. The Ghaziabad court, however, summoned Pandher in five other cases after several victims’ families approached it.In 11 previous cases, the court had found Koli guilty in all and had awarded the death sentence all of which are now pending appeal in higher courts. With Friday’s ruling, Pandher has been acquitted in two cases.The 12th case was regarding a murder that is believed to have happened on November 12, 2006.“Koli lured her into the house where he killed her. Her body parts and belongings were recovered in the investigation and the parents identified her clothes. Koli in his statements before a magistrate had also revealed her name. Later, DNA sampling of the remains and blood of victim’s parents also matched,” said JP Sharma, CBI public prosecutor. He said that the prosecution produced 38 witnesses in the case.The prosecution, during final arguments in all previous cases, had demanded death penalty for Koli while terming the killings as “rarest of rare”.Koli, a native of Mangrukhal village in Almora district of Uttarakhand, is representing his cases himself in the trial court and had been lodged in Dasna jail ever since he was arrested in December, 2006. Pandher is lodged in Dasna jail.“Of the six cases we now have only one case which is pending trial at Ghaziabad while the other cases are pending appeal before higher courts,” said Devraj Singh, Pandher’s lawyer at Ghaziabad court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/koli-held-guilty-in-12th-nithari-murder-case-employer-pandher-acquitted-101610756213667.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||Two Chinese nationals among 12 nabbed for defrauding ‘thousands’||Twelve people, including two Chinese nationals, have been arrested after raids across Delhi and the National Capital Region for luring Indian cellphone users into earning easy money by “liking” videos on social media platforms and “following” those accounts. The suspects main intention, police spokespersons claimed, was to install malware in these phones and installed banned software in them.The two Chinese women, Chaohong Deng Daoyong, 27, and Wu Jiazhi, 54, were arrested from Lajpat Nagar.“The suspects would use a malicious app to make phone users knowingly or unknowingly ‘follow’ social media accounts. This could be used later to manipulate and influence Indian users,” said Roy, adding that tens of millions of Indians had downloaded these “malicious” apps and there were at least 40,000 confirmed victims who had lost their money to this fraud within two months.Investigators claimed that two other Chinese nationals, who the police believe to be the kingpins of the racket, are on the run. “They moved out of India in early 2020,” said Roy.Roy said the fraud began when users started receiving WhatsApp messages containing encrypted URLs from international numbers. “These messages promised good, easy money in return for clicking the like button on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, and for following social media accounts,” said the DCP.Clicking on the website link would lead to a link to download an app, Roy saidUpon registering on this app, users would receive social media videos to like and accounts to follow. They would be paid ₹6 for each such action. The number of tasks and amount paid for each action would rise substantially if the users opted for a “VIP membership”, by paying between Rs.1,000 and Rs.50,000.The DCP said the gang floated this fraud as a multi-level marketing scheme, in which users could earn a percentage of a money made by people referred by them.The police said tens of thousands of people ended up investing thousands of rupees each. Their earnings reflected in their accounts on the app, but was allegedly never handed over to their bank accounts.By doing this, the gang made crores of rupees which were routed to shell companies in which Indians as well as Chinese people were found to be directors. “The Indians who were made directors were people like accountants, office boys and drivers working for the Chinese people,” Roy said.Next, the social media accounts being promoted were being passed off as belonging to celebrities, but were actually freshly created accounts with unknown origin and ownership, the DCP said.“When these social media accounts would receive a large number of followers, they could later be used to manipulate and influence Indian social media users,” Roy said.While all this could be easily detected by the police, much more allegedly happened once the users downloaded the app. “The app would seek dangerous permission of users to discreetly install several software packages and apps. One of these apps was the QQ Browser app which belongs to the QQ family of apps banned by the Indian government in June last year,” said Roy.The DCP said that the app itself was a malware that would make users “follow” thousands of social media accounts without their knowledge.The website and app being used in the fraud were hosted to IPs found to be attached to Chinese companies, the DCP said.The police said they began probing this fraud after receiving complaint from a woman who lost R50,000 .Subsequently, on Wednesday, the police raided several places in Delhi-NCR to arrest the twelve suspects.The police have allegedly recovered Rs.25 lakh in cash from them and froze several accounts containing nearly Rs.4.75 crore of the duped amount||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-chinese-nationals-among-12-nabbed-for-defrauding-thousands-101610754029311.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||Poultry sale resumes after brief pause, traders say demand low||oultry trade in the Capital resumed on Friday, with the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations removing all restrictions on trade, storage, processing of poultry products, and import from other states.On Thursday, the animal husbandry department had confirmed that no cases of avian influenza had been found among samples collected from poultry birds in the Capital.On Friday, the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market – which is the only authorised one for poultry in Delhi – opened after being temporarily shut since last Sunday as a preventive measure against bird flu after amid reports of dead ducks and crows being found in several locations across the city came in.So far, the infection has been found in ducks and crows in Delhi, but no other bird.Traders, however, expressed concerns over declined demand, with a large section of people apparently avoiding consumption of chicken in the light of the avian influenza, cases of which has been confirmed in at least 10 states across the country so far. They also fear that a prolonged decline in demand will bring down the price of both raw and packaged chicken — a trend that Delhi saw in earlier instances of bird flu in 2006 and 2016.Delhi’s daily demand is around 350,000 live birds a day. Most of the supply arrives from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh – both currently impacted by the outbreak.“The demand for chicken and eggs will drop. It happens each time there is a bird flu scare. Even though live birds that arrive at the authorised wholesale markers are medically examined on departure and arrival, there is fear among people. The decline often brings down prices. However, we are thankful to the administration that they have removed all restrictions on trade,” said Iqbal Qureshi, a poultry trader and vice-chairperson of the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur.Siddhant Wangdi, CEO at Meatigo.com, said: “Though raw chicken sales went down 10% over the past few days, other products such as pork, mutton and ready-to-eat products have substituted the lost chicken sales. All our products are sourced through a network of private farms, where not a single case has been reported in the past 30 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/poultry-sale-resumes-after-brief-pause-traders-say-demand-low-101610753673191.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||3 die in blaze at scrap godown in Kirti Nagar||Three, including a child, were killed in a fire that broke out in some shanties atop a scrap godown in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar on Thursday night, the fire department said.The deadly mishap there was followed by another unrelated blaze at a multi-storey building in north Delhi’s Rohini, just hours later, in which two persons were injured. Firefighters rescued six others, who were stuck on the terrace, in the second incident.In the first blaze, the fire department received a call at 10.50pm and were informed of a fire at a furniture shop.But when the firefighters reached the scene, they found that the fire was at a scrap godown, constructed over a 100 square yard plot, and the building had three shanties above it, where people working in the godown lived, said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services.“Although we reached the spot within minutes of receiving the call, residents of nearby shanties were busy trying to control the blaze and had rescued most occupants from the shanties above. But we were told that a drunk man and a boy were still trapped inside. One local man even entered the burning building to rescue the trapped people, but ended up getting trapped himself,” said Mohit Kumar, station officer of Shankar Road fire station.The blaze raged on due to the presence of a large quantity of plastic and foam in the godown, Kumar said.The impact of the blaze was such that the roof of the godown collapsed in the midst of the firefighting operation.Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west), said when the fire was doused and a search for survivors began, two charred bodies were found inside. “One was of a man in his 20s and the other of a boy. They remain unidentified,” he said.The authorities continued the search and found another body in a drain. The DCP said it was of the local man, Rohit (20), who worked as a driver.“It appears Rohit got trapped in the blaze and ended up falling into the drain adjacent to the godown,” Purohit said.He said the godown belonged to a 50-year-old man, Tony Mahto. “We have registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder at the Kirti Nagar police station. Mahto is on the run, and we are searching for him,” the DCP said, adding that the trigger appeared to be an electrical short-circuit.In the second incident, reported from a six-storey building in north Delhi’s Rohini just hours later, a 42-year-old woman and a firefighter were injured.Garg said the call about the blaze was received at 5.35am Friday and four fire tenders were rushed to spot. Garg said the blaze began on the ground floor which is used to store and pack goods for an e-commerce platform.Paras Kumar, the fire officer who led the operation, said the six-storey building in Rohini’s Sector 6 was constructed on a 32 square yard plot.A woman received burns to her limbs and a firefighter, Sunil, sustained injuries to his leg while trying to break into the building. The police are probing how the blaze started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-die-in-blaze-at-scrap-godown-in-kirti-nagar-101610752416337.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||BJP drove MCDs to bankruptcy, alleges AAP; BJP hits||A day after the Delhi government said it would give Rs.938 crore to the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) to pay employees salaries, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and said its leaders have driven the civic bodies to bankruptcy due to their rampant corruption.The BJP – which leads all three municipal corporations in the capital -- dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and said the money assured by the AAP government is not even one-third of what it actually owes the MCDs for the third quarter of the financial year 2020-21.“Despite knowing that the BJP-ruled MCD owes more than ₹6,000 crore to the Delhi government, we have released Rs.938 crore because we do not want the MCD employees to suffer anymore. This money was meant for government departments and schemes. The Delhi government has given loans to the BJP-ruled MCDs several times in the past six years. But rampant corruption by BJP leaders have driven the MCDs to bankruptcy -- they cannot even pay their employees. The BJP should resign from the charge of the MCDs immediately,” said Atishi, AAP MLA from Kalkaji, at a press conference at the party head office in central Delhi on Friday.Employees of the three MCDs in Delhi – from teachers and doctors to horticulture staff and sanitation workers – have been on strike, on and off, for several months now, protesting against the delay/non-payment of salaries. On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said the government would give Rs.938 crore to the MCDs for payment of employee salaries.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said: “The allegations by MLA Atishi are baseless. The party is misleading people by portraying as if the Rs.938 crore is some sort of a “special grant”. The amount is actually less than one-third of what the Delhi government owes the three MCDs for the third quarter of 2020-21. The government owes Rs.13,000 crore to the three MCDs in total.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-drove-mcds-to-bankruptcy-alleges-aap-bjp-hits-101610751829434.html

After 12 years of wait, orders have been placed by DTC to induct 1,000 low-floor AC CNG buses. All these buses will be on-road by Sept 2021. Delhi government is committed to a pollution-free Delhi by building a world-class public transport system,” Kejriwal tweeted on Friday.In another tweet he said, “With these 1,000 buses, (the) total DTC fleet (size) will increase to 4,760 and the total bus fleet of Delhi (DTC and cluster) will increase to an all-time high of 7,693. Despite several obstacles in procurement in the past years, our government has persisted and delivered.”The decision to induct 1,000 new buses in the DTC fleet was approved by the DTC board, chaired by transport minister Kailash Gehlot,on January 6.Gahlot said on Friday, “Despite many obstacles and hurdles, we have once again delivered. We have kept our promise. Expectedly, by May 2021, Delhi residents will have the first lot of these state-of-the-art buses which will be environment friendly, too, as they will be BS-VI compliant.”The tenders for the batch of 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses were first floated in 2019. The contract was signed in 2020 but there were delays because of Covid-19 and the revenue shortage that it brought about. The letter of intent was issued to the manufacturer after the board’s approval.The 1,000 new buses in the DTC fleet is part of the government’s larger plan to scale up Delhi’s existing bus fleet by 4,000 -- in DTC and the cluster network operated by concessionaires -- and also by introducing electric buses. Delhi, according to transport experts, needs at least 11,000 buses to cate to its population of nearly 20 million.In December, the DTC also issued a tender to create a real-time passenger information system (PIS), which will enable commuters to access information on bus routes, estimated time of arrival, fare, location of nearest buses which a passenger wishes to board, availability of seats and best options for interchange -- all on their mobile phones.The government has plans to have equipment fitted in the new buses to conform with the real-time PIS system, a senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dtc-places-order-for-1-000-new-buses-another-promise-delivered-tweets-kejriwal-101610749590300.html

The resolution was unanimously passed by the Shiv Sena-headed standing committee. All the parties, including the Congress and NCP, supported the resolution to take back the special powers. The resolution is now sent to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal for his opinion. Under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had in March 2020 empowered certain officers to make financial decisions for the city for the period till the Act was implemented. Last week, BJP’s group leader Prabhakar Shinde, wrote to BMC’s municipal secretary, allowing the party to move a resolution to revoke all special financial powers granted to municipal commissioners, additional commissioners and assistant civic commissioners to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. “The BMC has spent around Rs2,100 crore in the pandemic so far. These powers were given on the condition that the administration would submit a detailed account of all the spending. But so far, no details have been given by the administration. There has been massive irregularities and corruption in all Covid-related spending. Hence, we had moved a proposal to give back the powers to the standing committee as per the law,” said Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and standing committee member. “In the interest of transparency, BMC must restore the powers given to the standing committee,” said Ravi Raja, Congress Corporator and leader of Opposition in BMC. Meanwhile, Yashwant Jadhav, standing committee chairman, said, “There was a proposal by BJP to take back powers that gave BMC’s administration the right to spend for Covid-19 mitigation without seeking the approval of the standing committee. The provision was made in March 2020, and now BJP proposed to revoke it. I have forwarded the proposal to Chahal for his approval.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-resolution-to-withdraw-special-spending-powers-for-mumbai-civic-body-administration-gets-sena-support-101610740782427.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||28,500 from Maharashtra to get Covid vaccine on Day 1||Maharashtra expects to inoculate around 28,500 health workers, a drop from the earlier target of 50,000, on day one of the Covid-19 vaccination drive on Saturday, as hours before the launch of the pan-India roll-out, the number of centres in the state fell from 358 to 285. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to launch the vaccination through an online programme, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will inaugurate the state’s vaccination drive from a Covid-19 centre in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), immediately after Modi’s function. Last week, when the pan-India vaccine plan was announced, the Centre had allotted 511 centres to Maharashtra, which dropped to 358 two days ago and now to 285 (279 for Covishield and 6 for Covaxin) on Friday.According to state health officials, the reduction in centres was as per directives of the ministry of health and family welfare. The officials said the centres were reduced to ensure effective handling of the drive. The officials said the reduction was also to ensure that the stock of vaccines supplied to the state was sufficient for second doses to beneficiaries until the next consignment was allotted.This will result in delay in completion of the vaccination of the targetted 800,000 health workers. The state government has also planned to hold sessions on four days a week. This will prolong the process to more than six weeks for the completion of the first phase, from the earlier plan of completing it in four weeks.“The reduction in centres is as per the direction of the central government. We have stock of vaccine to cover 55.5% of the health workers registered with us. The vaccine has reached every centre and has been maintained at the stipulated temperature. The centres are at the district level and in some of the medical colleges, so there would not be any logistical problem. The standard operation procedure (SOP) has been in place with sufficient number of beds and backup medical arrangements. All the beneficiaries have already been informed about timing and centres they have to report to,” said Dr Ramaswami N, commissioner, family welfare, and director, National Health Mission.Meanwhile, Maharashtra reported 3,145 cases and 45 deaths on Friday, taking the tally to 1,984,768 and toll to 50,336. Mumbai clocked 574 cases and eight deaths, taking the tally to 301,655 and toll to 11,229. Pune and Nagpur, other two most affected cities, clocked 263 and 243 cases, respectively. Both the cities reported two deaths each on Friday. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.54%, while its overall positivity rate has dropped to 14.5%.The state has 52,152 active patients in various Covid-19 facilities across the state. The highest number of active patients, 15,777, is in Pune, followed by 9,799 in Thane, and 7,107 in Mumbai. State’s recovery rate stands at 94.78%.According to the statement from the health department, the beneficiaries have been informed about the vaccine name, details about the centres through SMSs till Friday evening. “Each of the vaccination centres will have a team of five members, including the vaccinator, and four members for identification, maintenance of protocol and to make entries into the Co-WIN app,” the statement said.PM Modi will interact virtually with the beneficiaries at the Cooper Hospital in Mumbai and the district hospital in Jalna on Saturday morning. The webcast facility at all vaccination centres has been set for the launch programme.Maharashtra has received 963,000 doses of Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield and 20,000 vials of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The centres at medical colleges in Mumbai, Aurangabad, Solapur and Nagpur and district hospitals at Pune and Amravati will administer the doses of Covaxin. The drive will be between 9am and 5pm on four days a week.The health department is also wary about health workers backing out of fear against the reaction of the vaccine. State health minister Rajesh Tope said both vaccines are completely safe for use and health workers should set an example before the general people by participating in the drive. “The politicians are not going for inoculation because we want the most vulnerable groups to benefit first. The health workers are real heroes during this pandemic and they should set an example before others by getting vaccinated,” he said.The highest number of vaccination centres are in Mumbai (40), followed by Pune (31), Thane (23), Nashik (13) and Nagpur (12).“The beneficiaries will get the SMSs one or two days in advance. We will add beneficiaries above the 55.5% health workers once we get the next consignment of the vaccine from the Centre. The stock of 983,000 vials will last for 55.5% of 800,000 health workers registered for vaccination in the first phase,” said Dr DN Patil, state immunization officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/28500-from-maharashtra-to-get-covid-vaccine-on-day-1-101610740072241.html

16-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn comes to the rescue of MC, releases ₹130 crore for development||In the beginning of this crucial election year itself, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has received a major shot in the arm with the UT administration finally deciding to financially rescue the beleaguered municipal corporation (MC).The administration on Friday decided to immediately release ₹30 crore for carrying out development works in the 13 villages, which had come under the MC jurisdiction a year ago. Another ₹60 crore will be released in a phased manner by June 2021.The administration also decided to release in full the pending grant-in-aid of ₹100 crore to the MC. The aid will come without the Centre-imposed mandatory expenditure cuts.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “The administration has also assured that for the next financial year (2021-2022), the grant-in-aid will be increased from the current ₹425 crore to ₹500 crore.”The decision was taken in a meeting called by UT adviser Manoj Parida and attended by mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and Yadav.After being elected as mayor earlier this month, Sharma had promised to take up the issue of shortage of funds with the UT administration on priority basis. He had directed the MC departments to prepare a list of projects that had been suffering due to the paucity of funds.The MC engineering department had prepared a proposal of ₹102 crore for village development for works like new roads, laying stormwater pipes and sewer lines, electrical and horticulture works, supply of water and installing more than 1,000 tube-wells for improving water supply.Village devp crucial for BJPDelivering on village development is crucial for the ruling BJP as the MC goes to poll this year, and villages are now part of the 35 new MC wards. The party had come under severe criticism from residents and opposition parties on the issue. Residents had complained that the development in villages had suffered immensely after they were brought under the MC.With funds in its kitty, the MC will also start releasing ₹80 lakh each to councillors under ward development funds, which will allow long-pending works to be restarted, said Yadav. Last year, the councillors hadn’t received any.In addition to releasing the aid and additional funds, the administration has also, in principle, agreed to the long-standing demand of the MC of sharing of revenues generated from the Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA) with it. If implemented, the MC stands to gain more than ₹100 crore additional revenues every year.On Friday, the administration also decided to transfer development of some of the infrastructure projects from MC to the UT engineering department. This includes reconstruction, if needed, of the five parking lots in Sector 17 and other sectors, which have been declared unsafe for use. This will save the MC around ₹25 crore in costs.UT to share costs of village devpClose to ₹12 crore will be incurred by the UT engineering department for development works in the 13 villages; the department has been directed to complete the construction of seven community centres in the city before May 2021. This will also add to the revenue of the MC.For revenue generation, permission for exhibitions at Kala Gram have been assured to the MC. The administration has also assured that provision of a banquet hall in Industrial Area, Phase I, will be made.The UT adviser has also directed the chief architect to increase the unipole sites from 24 to 75 and to earmark two additional petrol pump sites for the MC. This will further revenue generation for the MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-comes-to-the-rescue-of-mc-releases-130-crore-for-development-101610739881731.html

But it goes beyond that and sales of all items in general are suffering. News of a second virus is making people stay at home.”Restaurants, however, are adopting innovative ways to adapt to these conditions.Kohli, who is also the proprietor of Hotel Aroma in Sector 22, said that he was using this opportunity to develop vegetarian dishes. “While some people are ordering more mutton and fish dishes, we are seeing a rise in people turning to vegetarian food, and we are working on that part of our menu.”Outlets offering imitation chicken, fishSunveer Sondhi, the city head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI)’s Chandigarh chapter, said, “This is the second jolt that the restaurant industry has received in the past year. It is difficult for people to feel welcome at a restaurant when there are rumours going on about bird flu. The NRAI has asked all restaurants to cook chicken at a higher temperature than normal to ensure that the food is safe for people to eat.”Also the proprietor of Pyramid at Elante Mall, Sondhi added that they had launched a line of imitation meat made from vegetables: “Imitation meat that uses soya and other vegetables is starting to take off in the city. Customers are curious to know about vegetarian chicken and vegetarian fish that we sell.”Many eateries in the city report a higher demand for mutton and fish dishes. Proprietor of Pal Dhaba in Sector 28, Amit Pal Singh, said, “There is no sale of chicken dishes, but the sale of mutton and fish products has increased by 30-40%.” The prices of mutton and fish, however, have started increasing, thus affecting sales, leading to a 40% dip, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/restaurant-sales-in-chandigarh-suffer-due-to-avian-flu-101610739822659.html

16-01-2021||Mumbai||First rake for Metro-2A, 7 unveiled, to reach Mumbai by January-end||The first rake for Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E) was unveiled at the Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) manufacturing unit in Bengaluru on Friday. The six-coach train can also function as a driverless Metro, an option which authorities say will be explored six months to a year post operations. The train is expected to leave the unit on January 23 and reach Mumbai’s Charkop depot by January 27-28, officials from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) confirmed. While it was unveiled in Bengaluru by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, MMRDA will organise an event in Mumbai on January 29, which is expected to be attended by Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “Ten trains are ready at the manufacturing depot in BEML. The first train will reach Mumbai by road on January 27-28, post which some minor works will be undertaken at the depot itself.” MMRDA is looking at initiating trial runs for Metro-2A and Metro-7 by March, post which operations are expected to start from May.While MMRDA was hoping to initiate trial runs from January 14, 2020, it got delayed. On Friday, Singh tweeted, “Visited the BEML manufacturing facility at Bengaluru and unveiled India’s first indigenously developed Driverless Metro Car. I’m proud of the good work the team of engineers and technicians are doing at BEML. They are the real warriors of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, taking India ahead.”The first mock train for the Mumbai Metro lines was unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2019. MMRDA had placed an order for 378 coaches at ₹3,015 crore in November 2018. The authority then placed an order for 12 more trains of six coaches each for line 2B (DN Nagar-Mankhurd), 7A and 9 (Dahisar-Mira Bhayander and Andheri to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-rake-for-metro-2a-7-unveiled-to-reach-mumbai-by-januaryend-101610739102808.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya involved in planning strategy for the 2022 Mumbai civic elections||While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is preparing for a high-decibel campaign for the February 2022 Mumbai civic polls, on the lines of the recent Hyderabad civic elections, the ruling Shiv Sena has quietly begun work on ground. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) election will be a tough contest for the Sena, as it will go head-to-head with the BJP for the second time since 2017. Political dynamics in the state have altered since then, as the Sena-BJP parted ways in 2019. According to Sena functionaries, party president and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Aaditya Thackeray are involved in the preparations and the strategy to retain power in one of India’s richest civic bodies. The Sena chief is expected to convene a meeting with senior leaders, ministers and key Mumbai legislators in the coming week to chalk out the party’s plan to retain power in BMC. Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya, in a meeting last week, mobilised the functionaries of the party’s youth wing Yuva Sena, which he heads, in each of the 227 electoral wards in Mumbai to publicise the work carried out by the party and by the Sena-led state government. Aaditya, who is also the guardian minister of the Mumbai suburban district, is inspecting, reviewing, and planning projects on-ground to upgrade the Mumbai’s civic and transport infrastructure. Taking a leaf out of the BJP’s book, the Shiv Sena is focusing on upgrading city’s transport and infrastructure. Thackeray’s recent review of transport and infrastructure projects is an attempt to show the party as pro-development in contrast to their opponent BJP’s claim, political observers said. Last week, Aaditya held meetings with BMC officials over several issues, including the city’s biggest problem – flooding during monsoon – which earns the Sena most brickbats every year. In a series of tweets following the meeting, Aaditya said they plan to have an integrated transport hub at the city’s entry points and fix 386 flooding spots that have emerged in the city. The environment minister also outlined his “long-term plan” to make Mumbai into a “sponge city, with aquifer recharge, rain water percolation and holding tanks”. The BJP, which has already announced that it will hoist their ‘pure’ saffron flag atop the BMC headquarters, has targeted the Shiv Sena over the Metro car depot issue and painted the Sena as anti-development. It recently also alleged misdoings in spending of funds meant for Covid relief operations and corruption in handing out contracts to private parties. Behind the doors, Aaditya has mobilised the Yuva Sena core committee and the 36 vibhag (division) heads of the youth wing. The party that has recently fortified its social media presence through its youth wing will use WhatsApp, other messaging apps, and social media to pass on “information” to people. A party functionary, who was a part of Aaditya’s recent meeting, said, “Aaditya ji will formally convene a meeting for election preparation once again, but during the interaction with Yuva Sena core committee, Yuva Sena and Yuvati Sena functionaries, he has asked everybody to remain alert and active in their wards. Aaditya ji asked them to make a team of 20 people under each of the division head to promote party work, government’s work to tackle Covid-19. Use of messaging apps will be used to spread information.” The party could also use ‘Aaditya Samvad’ – a townhall style interaction where Thackeray would interact with the youth. The party had used the event conceptualised by Prashant Kishor’s firm I-PAC as part of Sena’s Lok Sabha campaign in 2019. “Not immediately, but we can go for Aaditya Samvad at the later stage of campaigning,” said a party functionary close to Aaditya. Meanwhile, Thackeray is expected to convene a meeting of senior leaders to strategise for the elections, after the gram pachayat results are out on January 18. Thackeray, in his interactions with Mumbai legislators, has already asked them to start the ground work in ward levels, a party functionary said. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the Sena will have to activate Shiv Sainiks, as there is a “loss of emotional attachment after the formation of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and a communication gap has set in”. “The Shiv Sena has an upper hand going into the election as they are in power in the state. It is a prestigious battle for them to retain power in the BMC,” Jondhale said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-s-plan-for-next-year-s-mumbai-civic-elections-is-quiet-clear-101610738922275.html

He will be among the first beneficiaries of the vaccine against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, at BYL Nair Hospital on Saturday morning. On Friday evening, Dr Bhansali, who was made the in-charge of all private Covid-19 hospitals in Mumbai during the peak of the pandemic, had received a call from Nair Hospital on Friday, asking him to reach the vaccination centre by 9.30am on Saturday to get inoculated with the Covishield vaccine. He had registered for the vaccine along with other healthcare workers from Bombay Hospital last month.“Being a doctor, I think it is my responsibility to get the vaccination administered and so that the general public trusts its efficiency. So when the hospital asked me if I wanted to get the shot tomorrow [Saturday], I readily agreed,” said Dr Bhansali. Dr Bhansali, who has worked round the clock to take care of Covid-19 patients, said, “I haven’t taken a day off since the pandemic broke out. Now, almost 10 months later, I am happy to get the vaccine. I hope this immunisation programme marks the end of the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dr-bhansali-from-bombay-hospital-to-get-vaccine-101610738863621.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||Hospital staff upbeat a day before first jabs||Three women, who helm a leading private hospital in Delhi, one of the first to start treating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, are all set to mark a crucial milestone in their fight against the global pandemic — the hospital is one of 81 centres in the national capital where the nationwide vaccination drive will kick off at 10.30am on Saturday. Their collective fight, the women managers said, is finally drawing to a close.The 250-bed Max Smart Hospital in Saket was converted into a dedicated Covid-19 centre on May 9 and now that the Covid patients are fewer and far between, the hospital has gotten the nod to restart non-Covid services in 102 beds. The hospital will start inoculating its staff members at one of the three sites on its premises on Saturday.“With the hospital ready to vaccinate its staff and open its doors to non-Covid patients, it feels like Covid-19 is finally coming to an end. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel. There were three phases in our fight against the infection. First, was in January, when we had first set up a screening centre; as the disease was not even in India people wondered what we were doing. Second, was when hospitals started getting overwhelmed with the number of Covid patients and people started following all precautions. And, the third, is this,” said Bindu Sharma, assistant general manager, Saket Max Smart Hospital.Nursing head Manju Devi said this was the beginning of the end of all struggles -- of staying away from loved ones; living in fear of contracting the deadly virus; of dealing with the loneliness felt by patients admitted to the Covid wards who could not speak to their family members.The team, led by medical superintendent Dr Sahar Qureshi, however, managed to save countless lives and will now be among the first ones in India to receive the vaccine shots.Her sentiments were echoed by Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital. “It is like a long-awaited festival for us,” he said.Staff and technicians at Lok Nayak hospital worked till late evening on Friday to ensure that the vaccination drive on Saturday goes without a hitch. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will flag off the vaccination drive from the hospital at 12 noon. A doctor, a nurse, and a safai karmachari will receive the jabs in the presence of the CM, according to sources.Two large halls have been created in the middle of the out-paient seating space for the inoculation drive. Alternate seats on the blue coloured sofas have been crossed out using white medical tape to ensure social distancing between recipients.Another of at least three vaccination sites at the hospital has been set up on the first floor of the outpatient department. Two rooms with oxygen support and all emergency medications have been created at the site itself for managing any adverse event. The vaccines reached the hospital on Friday afternoon and were stored in deep freezers on the fifth floor of the same building, doctors said.“We are fully prepared for the vaccination drive and all our staff are very excited. They have been treating the very sick Covid-19 patients since last March,” said Dr Kumar.At Safdarjung Hospital, red arrows from the Ring Road gate marked the way to the vaccination site on the first floor of the old emergency building. The three room site was abuzz with activity on Friday afternoon. Across the road, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will flag off the drive at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.With nearly 67,000 tests, Delhi reported 295 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday, the lowest number recorded in a day since May 9, when the city had seen 224 cases.This has also brought down the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – to 0.44%, the lowest ever since the state government began releasing regular testing data.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off India’s massive vaccination exercise at 10.30am on Saturday, when 81 sites in Delhi will start immunising their health care workers. Each centre aims to immunise 100 persons||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospital-staff-upbeat-a-day-before-first-jabs-101610737866755.html

According to police, the accused, identified as Aman Sikandar Shaikh, was unhappy after his sister eloped with the victim, Akram Chawdhary, 26, six months ago, and stabbed him in the stomach with a chopper. Vilas Gangawane, senior inspector of Shahu Nagar police station said that Chawdhary, who worked in a call centre in Bengaluru, and Shaikh’s sister Fatima had been in a romantic relationship since the past several years. After Fatima’s parents refused to allow them to marry, the couple eloped and married in court six months ago.Chawdhary left the city and returned recently to take his wife back with him. Shaikh had kept watch for the victim since the past six months and attacked him when he was alone.On Thursday, when Chawdhary left his house at 10.30pm, Shaikh followed him. When the victim reached Matunga Labour Camp, Shaikh confronted Chawdhary. After a heated argument, Shaikh stabbed Chawdhary with a chopper in the stomach.“Shaikh stabbed him so fiercely that the wooden handle and the blade got separated, leaving the pointed end in the victim’s stomach,” said Gangawane.Police arrested Shaikh from his house early on Friday and are on the look-out for his associate Ejaz, 19, who has allegedly helped him with the murder.“Shaikh did not like my son and the moment he found him alone, he stabbed him with a knife so brutally that it cut through his entire intestine and other organs, leaving him dead in a matter of seconds,” said Yusuf Chawdhary, the victim’s father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-man-arrested-for-stabbing-brother-in-law-to-death-101610738442182.html

During the 2016 elections, he had decided not to contest.“If everyone (referring to the affiliated sports associations) wants me to be the president of COA, I have no issues. But it all depends on the office bearers of the sports associations,” said Sodhi, who is the recipient of the Maharaja Ranjit Singh award, Punjab’s highest sports award.“I have also worked as the president of the COA, so if given the opportunity again, I will deliver my best. Being a former sportsperson, sports has always been my top priority,” he added. Maha Singh, who is currently the secretary of the COA, will be re-contesting for another term. “The elections are a numbers game. Most of the sports associations wanted me to re-contest. So I have decided to contest again for the post of honorary secretary,” he said. “Rana Sodhi is the presidential candidate from our group and most likely his candidature will be a unanimous choice for the top post.”The COA has a voting strength of 68: there are two votes each for the 34 affiliated state sports associations. The display of the electoral college is on January 16; filling of nomination papers is on January 18; and withdrawal is between January 22-24.A faction led by the president of the Chandigarh Basketball Federation, Chander Mukhi, and Chandigarh Amateur Judo Association’s president Raj Pal Chauhan had trained guns on Maha Singh over affiliations granted to several sports associations in the last couple of months and also alleged that if he (Singh) reruns for the post of secretary, it would be a violation of the National Sports Code.“I was made treasurer of the COA in the middle of the 2012-2016 term and was secretary in 2016-2020. As per the Code, I am eligible to contest again. Moreover, the state Olympic body doesn’t fall under the preview of that Code,” said he, who is also the vice-president of the Chandigarh Archery Association.On affiliation to hockey bodies, he added, “As there is a case going on in the court between two Chandigarh’s hockey bodies, so till the time there is no verdict from the court, we (COA) have not given affiliation to any.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sports-minister-likely-to-head-chandigarh-olympic-body-101610738322610.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu in poultry spreads in 11 more villages in seven districts of Maharashtra, confirms ICAR-NIHSAD||The ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing bird flu cases, has confirmed avian influenza or bird flu in poultry chickens at 11 places, covering seven districts of Maharashtra on Friday.The central laboratory has found bird flu to be the cause of death in poultry birds in two more villages each at Parbhani and Latur districts. In addition, it has found bird flu deaths in poultry birds at two villages each in Nanded and Pune, and one village each in Solapur, Beed and Ahmednagar districts. State animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh confirmed the development.“Following confirmation from the central laboratory, the district administrations will start culling poultry birds within one-km vicinity of the infected areas from Saturday,” Singh said.Earlier, ICAR-NIHSAD has confirmed bird flu in poultry birds in one village each in Parbhani and Latur districts, respectively, where nearly 15,000 poultry birds were culled to contain the spread in other areas.Besides, ICAR-NIHSAD had also confirmed avian influenza in other birds in Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Beed and Latur districts.On Friday, 571 bird deaths were reported in different districts, pushing the count to 3,949 across the state. ICAR-NIHSAD also confirmed H5N1 strain of bird flu in Yavatmal district, where peacocks deaths were reported.“As the state government has empowered district collectors to impose a containment plan, even if they only suspect deaths are owing to bird flu, most of these districts have started implementing the plan. The Centre has allowed the administration to start culling poultry birds only after receiving a confirmation report from ICAR-NIHSAD,” the animal husbandry commissioner said.According to the containment plan prepared by the Central government, the local administration will have to cull poultry birds within a one-km radius of that particular poultry farm where bird deaths were found to be due to avian influenza or bird flu. A surveillance zone within a periphery of 10km will have to be created, which means no birds will be allowed to sell or purchase in that area. The particular village where that poultry farm is situated will have to be declared a prohibited area, which means no one can enter or exit, including local villagers. A medical team also has to be set up for the examination of the local people.Decrease in chicken dish ordersHotels and restaurants witnessed a reduction of chicken dishes by 10% to 20%. “Many people are now shying away from chicken dishes and ordering sea food,” said Shivanand Shetty, president, Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association (AHAR), an association of hotels and restaurants. He said that overall business has not been affected due to bird flu.Fountain Hospitality Private Limited (FHPL), which runs four restaurants including Flamboyante and Fountain Sizzlers, has increased the variety of mutton, fishes and prawns dishes on its menu. “We have witnessed people reluctant to have chicken dishes and hence has increased other non veg items,” said Amrish Arora, managing director, FHPL.The president of the Poultry Farmers and Breeders Association of Maharashtra said that chicken sales have come down to 1.50 lakh metric tonnes daily from the normal 2.00 lakh metric tonnes. “It will due to the scarce created by the media. It will normalise soon,” said Vasantkumar Shetty, president of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-in-poultry-spreads-in-11-more-villages-in-seven-districts-of-maharashtra-confirms-icarnihsad-101610738322244.html

As a result, confusion prevailed till late evening as the registered healthcare workers failed to receive information about their vaccination centres and timings.As per protocol, health workers who wish to be vaccinated, have to register on the app. With the health department unable to receive the link to send messages to registered individuals, officials at vaccination centres were forced to call each beneficiary to provide the requisite information. “Due to some technical glitches, the server of CoWin app has slowed down. Thus, we aren’t able to send message to the registered beneficiaries. So we have created a WhatsApp group, where all the beneficiaries of each district have been added, and we are sending a message in those groups, informing them about the vaccination centres and timings,” said state immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil. Around 7pm, BMC officers sought permission from the state to start informing the registered healthcare workers individually but they were asked to wait longer. The permission was granted around 9pm and by 10pm, BMC health officers released the list of those registered to all the Covid-19 war rooms at the respective wards to call the healthcare workers. “We worked so hard only for all our efforts to go in drain at the last minute. We’ve asked all the officers at the respective war rooms to call and send information to the beneficiaries individually. This will go on till late night,” said a senior health officer who was at BMC health office, making arrangements at 11pm. Till the time of going to the press, officers were calling the registered individuals.The development has raised concerns among those in-charge of the vaccination centres. “We have the app but we haven’t received the link yet. We are personally informing healthcare workers about the timing for the vaccination,” said the dean of one of the BMC-run centres. “This might be the biggest hurdle tomorrow as we need to verify the details of the beneficiaries,” the dean added.On a regular basis, hospitals have to make a roster of their medical staff. Due to the confusion, hospital staffers also had to wait till late night to make the roster. “We don’t know who will get called for the vaccination. So we couldn’t even make the rota of our duty till late night. There is so much confusion,” said a doctor from BYL Nair Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-vaccine-co-win-server-slows-down-leads-to-chaos-101610738142552.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 79% voting turnout for elections of 12,711 village panchayats||Termed as a litmus test for the ruling parties as well as the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a year after the changed political equations in the state, polls for more than half of the state’s village panchayats were held on Friday. The voting turnout for the panchayats was 79%, according to the State Election Commission (SEC). Counting of the votes will take place on Monday 18.Of the 14,234 panchayats for which the elections were announced last month, 12,711 saw voting on Friday, while 162 panchayats in Gadchiroli district will go to the polls on January 20. Most of the remaining panchayats saw members either elected unopposed, partially or fully. Elections to two gram panchayats in Nandurbar and Nashik were cancelled by the SEC after a probe found the posts of sarpanch and panchayat members to be auctioned from amongst the candidates.According to the records, 214,880 candidates were in the fray for 125,709 seats, for which 356,221 nominations were filed and 26,718 members were elected unopposed.Though the gram panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, political parties field their workers to wrest power in the village bodies. “Elected representatives in district and tehsil-level local bodies – district councils and panchayat samities – take a keen interest in the elections to ensure that the party workers are elected in the village panchayat. The political parties see the village panchayat elections as their opportunity to strengthen the party base in villages. The BJP, during its five-year regime at the state level, successfully brought many village panchayats under its control. Similarly, after the change in the political equation in the state, the three ruling parties will now try to gain control over them,” said a Congress leader.The leader said that the panchayat elections will prove to be a litmus test for the ruling parties, a year after the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, was formed. The ruling alliance had recently bagged four of five Legislative Council seats from the graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies. It expects a repetition in these elections too. Three ruling parties had announced to contest the gram panchayat elections separately. The MVA government had scrapped the previous Devendra Fadnavis government’s decision of electing sarpanchs or panchayat heads directly from the voters.In Thane district, gram panchayat elections saw an estimated turnout of over 80% as per the district election commission.

16-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Won’t ask Dhananjay Munde to resign for now, says NCP chief||Maharashtra social justice minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde will not have to resign from his post over allegations of rape for now, party chief Sharad Pawar said on Friday, adding he would be allowed to continue until the police investigation is completed. The decision was taken considering the allegations of “honeytrapping” made by leaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Pawar said. On the other hand, the opposition BJP announced an agitation from Monday, demanding removal of Munde from the state cabinet. Pawar said he also suggested the police appoint an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) level woman officer to investigate the allegations against Munde as well as against the woman. “As I had said yesterday, we have taken the allegations against Munde seriously because a sister (complainant) had made the claims and we were discussing our course of action. But a few people have also made allegations against the same woman. We have come to the conclusion that there is a need for an in-depth investigation and so we will wait for the police investigation to be completed,” he said. “The woman, who is accusing Munde of sexual exploitation, is now facing allegations from three others. Considering this, anyone can make allegations against someone (other ministers) and then demand he be removed from the government. Hence, we will take the next step only after verifying the facts. A decision without verifying the facts is likely to bring injustice.” The NCP took the decision in a late-night meeting of core committee members as leaders from the BJP and MNS alleged the same woman had tried to “honeytrap” them too. HT on Friday had reported that Munde may not have to resign from the ministerial council. Senior NCP leaders were of the view that asking Munde to step down without any investigation, even after fresh revelations by different people, would not be right, said NCP insiders. “If Munde is forced to resign, there is a possibility that the same incident would be repeated with others. We should refrain from a knee-jerk reaction,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity. Munde has filed a petition against the complainant and her sister in the Bombay high court alleging blackmail. “NCP leaders were informed that the “blackmail” was going on for the past six years since Munde was appointed as the leader of opposition in the legislative Council,” said another NCP leader. “When a person goes to the court, there is a possibility that he has some faith in what he has done,” Pawar said. The complainant is the sister of a woman Munde was in a relationship with. On Friday, the woman reacted to the allegations against her on her social media account. “If I was wrong why these people were silent for so many years. I am proud of myself that I fought alone, even if I am forced to move back. I haven’t named any party but so many have ganged up against me,” she wrote. “Let’s do one thing. If you want to make a decision, go ahead without knowing the facts. I am ready to move back as you all are wanting (sic),” she added. Meanwhile, the women’s wing of the state BJP unit announced a statewide agitation from coming Monday, demanding Munde’s resignation. In a release issued on Friday, Uma Khapre, state chief of the women’s wing, said, “Munde has himself admitted that he was in a relationship with another woman and has two children. We need to think of the message we are giving to society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-won-t-ask-dhananjay-munde-to-resign-for-now-says-ncp-chief-101610736342164.html

16-01-2021||Mumbai||AQI at 190, Mumbai breathes cleanest air this year||The city breathed its cleanest air this year on Friday as westerly winds blowing from the north-west of India cleared up pollutants dispersed in the air. An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator— of 190 was measured on Friday, which was in the moderate category for the first time in 2021.According to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality had remained in the poor to the very poor category since the beginning of January owing to low temperatures. On January 8, the AQI was the worst at 317 (very poor) for this year. However, with the onset of westerly winds, the air has cleared up.“Winds blowing from the north and west has cleared the air of pollutants. If the wind continues, air quality will remain moderate for the next couple of days, despite a drop in temperatures. However, without the winds, air quality may become worse,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR. Navi Mumbai, however, recorded very poor air with the AQI being measured at 350. Along with the western suburbs, Malad had the worst air with an AQI of 211 (poor).Day and night also turned pleasant on Friday as temperatures dropped significantly in the city providing relief from week-long heat conditions. At Santacruz, the minimum temperature dropped to 19.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal. The Colaba observatory of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 21 degrees Celsius. While this was 2 degrees above normal, the minimum temperature was much lower than Monday’s minimum temperature of 23.5, the highest in a decade. Meanwhile, maximum temperatures remained below normal. Santacruz reported a maximum temperature of 31 degrees Celsius, which was 0.8 degrees below normal. At Colaba, the maximum temperature dropped a degree below 30 degrees Celsius and was 1.1 degrees below normal.“IMD had forecast that temperatures would drop from Friday for the next few days as westerly winds have started blowing over parts of the state. Since parts of north-west India are under the influence of a cold wave, north-westerly winds from these parts are colder,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of the western region, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aqi-at-190-mumbai-breathes-cleanest-air-this-year-101610735922166.html
16-01-2021||Mumbai||Dhananjay Munde suffers setback as his upward surge halted by controversy||Dhananjay Munde’s rise in state politics has been impressive since 2014. Though he lost to cousin Pankaja Munde in 2014 assembly elections, he was handpicked by NCP leadership for the post of Opposition leader in Legislative Council-the post that was occupied by the likes of Sharad Pawar, Nitin Gadkari and Chhagan Bhujbal in the past. During the five years of Devendra Fadanvis led the BJP-Sena government, he emerged as an aggressive opposition leader, often attacking the government over its policies and controversies. He surprised everyone when he defeated Pankaja in 2019 assembly elections. As the three-party coalition of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress formed the government, he was inducted as a cabinet minister and given politically significant social justice department. He was also being seen as a prominent Other Backward Class (OBC) not only of his party but also of the ruling MVA.But now Dhananjay Munde,45, is staring at a setback in his political career. His image has taken a beating following the allegations of sexual exploitation made against him by a woman. The allegations have also forced him to disclose that he was in a relationship with the woman’s elder sister and they even had two children together. The BJP has now announced an agitation from Monday to demand his sacking from the state cabinet. It is also accusing him of hiding his second marriage in his election affidavit (though he has used the word relation and marriage) and demanding his disqualification as a legislator. He almost lost his post as minister in the MVA government in the state but has got respite after two leaders from BJP and MNS came forward to say that the woman in question had tried to honey-trap them in the past. However, there is going to be a police investigation into the entire episode. As such, his fate would depend on the outcome of the investigation.Will he be able to bounce back?Ironically, Dhananjay first became a known name in political circles due to controversies surrounding him during his mentor and uncle Gopinath Munde’s tenure as deputy chief minister of first Shiv Sena-BJP government in the state. As senior Munde got busy with his responsibilities, nephew Dhananjay got an opportunity to handle political management in his uncle’s stronghold, Beed district in Marathwada or central Maharashtra. Dhananjay and his father Panditanna were often accused of running riot by Munde’s political opponents. He kicked up several controversies and his uncle was forced to do damage control.Subsequent years saw differences emerging between Gopinath Munde and his brother-nephew duo. The gap widened as senior Munde fielded his daughter Pankaja to represent his assembly constituency when he moved to Lok Sabha in 2009. Three years later, Dhananjay joined the NCP.Following Munde’s death in an accident in June 2014, Dhananjay tried to wrest the leadership of the Munde clan from cousin Pankaja but failed. He avenged it first by constantly attacking her (she was a minister in Fadnavis government) as Opposition Leader of Council and later by defeating her in 2019 assembly elections.The rivalry between the cousins is likely to continue as Pankaja is likely to launch an offensive against him to avenge her defeat.“This controversy is a set back for him but it is unlikely to affect him much in his rural constituency as his performance is not bad. However, it will tarnish the party’s image,” opined political analyst Hemant Desai.“He had a good future to become a prominent leader but now this affair may haunt him. It will affect his base among women voters,” he added.Perhaps that was why NCP chief Sharad Pawar termed the allegations against him as serious and indicated that he would have to face the consequences. The party top brass discussed if he was needed to be dropped from the state cabinet but has now decided against it. Dhananjay is close to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who has thrown his weight behind the former. Him being an OBC leader in a party dominated by Marathas could help him as the party would be cautious not to irk his OBC supporters.He also shares cordial relations with Fadnavis and would hope that the BJP does not go far in seeking his scalp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dhananjay-munde-suffers-setback-as-his-upward-surge-halted-by-controversy-101610735562054.html

As for ICU beds, the number can be reduced from 40% to 25% or double the number of admitted patients, according to the ordered signed by Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of nursing homes in Delhi.The hospitals with less than 100 beds have been asked to reserve the beds on their own as per requirement. However, the hospitals that still have patients admitted need to earmark double the number of beds and keep it till all patients are discharged, the order says.The number of beds has already been brought down to 11,880 as on Friday evening from over 18,700 beds two weeks ago. The government had ordered 115 government and private hospitals to reduce the number of beds on December 31.Only 9.5% of the total beds earmarked for Covid-19 are occupied in hospital across Delhi, with just under 12% of the ICU beds being occupied as on Friday night, according to the Delhi Corona App.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-further-reduces-only-covid-beds-in-pvt-hospitals-101610734601842.html
16-01-2021||Delhi||‘‘People at the top are living like lords’: HC asks Delhi MCDs to list non-essential expenses||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the city’s three civic bodies to disclose their non-essential expenses, including the perks availed by councillors and senior officers, while stating that it intends to stop such expenditure.“People at the top are living like lords. Once they feel the pinch, the things will work out,” said the bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, adding that a paucity of funds in the municipal corporations could not be an excuse to deny employees their salaries, as they are at the front line of the civic bodies’ work.Employees of the three municipal corporations have routinely gone on strike in recent months over the non-payment of their salaries. Thousands of civic body staffers went on an “indefinite” strike on January 7, demanding their pay and pension be released.The court on Friday said employees are being denied their fundamental right of receiving salaries, a move that would affect the quality of life of the workers, as well as those dependent on them.“The people who are working on the ground have not got their salaries. The councillor doesn’t care and will continue to roam around in their cars and use the powers of the civic body. When people at the top feel the pinch, then there will be some change. I am first going for the councillors. We want a system in place,” the court added.The court was hearing several PILs claiming non-payment of salaries and pensions of serving and retired employees, including teachers, doctors and sanitation workers, of the three corporations.During the hearing, the bench also disapproved of the action of the Delhi government decision to deduct for loans from the amounts transferred to the corporations as aids, saying that even the Reserve Bank of India had imposed a moratorium on recall of loans and declaration of accounts as NPA by banks and financial institutions.“We all know that revenue has gone down and we are going through a bad phase. You should not have done this, you should not have asked for the repayment of the loan. It’s as good as not giving,” the court told Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam.Advocate Satyakam urged the court sought time to take instructions on why the deductions were justified following which the court posted the matter for January 21.It also asked the Delhi government to explain why funds payable to the corporations under the heads of ‘transfer duty’ and ‘parking charges’ were not released, and asked when they will be paid.The Basic Tax Assessment (BTA) comprises 6% of the revenue collected by the Delhi government which was being deducted by the government to recover the loans given to the corporation, Satyakam told the court. He said that during the pandemic, amounts paid under that head were reduced due to lower revenue collection.He said grant-in-aid of 6.5% was paid without any reduction to the corporations under the heads of education, health and urban development.The corporations, however, contended that if the loan amounts are not deducted from the BTA, then they can meet the salaries of all their employees. They said that presently they were unable to pay salaries or pensions due to paucity of funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-at-the-top-are-living-like-lords-hc-asks-delhi-mcds-to-list-non-essential-expenses-101610734181800.html

From there, it was on to jail, where orange-tinted water spewed from the sink and shower and prison-issued dirty sandals proved useful in shoving sewer roaches in the bathroom into the toilet.A handwritten journal he wrote behind bars — a copy of which was provided exclusively to The Associated Press — offers new details about his ordeal in Iran, which ended last June when the State Department secured the Navy veteran's release. In it, he catalogues physical abuse from his jailers and taunts from fellow inmates while held on dubious allegations. He writes tenderly of the woman he visited even while likening himself to a mouse lured into a trap. And he brands himself a “political hostage,” held on pretextual charges to secure concessions from the US. Seven months after his release, White is trying to reassemble his life in Mexico, unsure what comes next but eager to share his story.“I don’t want the government of Iran to think that, 'Oh, Mike White's out of here, he's going away, he's going to be quiet,'" he said in a recent interview. “That's not going to happen. Believe me, if only you understood the fear and anger inside of me as a result of what they did.”The peculiar saga began in July 2018 when White flew to Iran to visit a woman he'd met years earlier in a Yahoo chat room and with whom he hoped to rekindle an on-off relationship that included two prior visits to the country. But the bond turned sour on the most recent trip when the woman stopped seeing him and encouraged him to return home earlier than he'd planned.His 156-page manuscript is told from his own perspective with details that are vivid though sometimes difficult to corroborate. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. But according to the document, the men who arrested him pulled him into their car and drove him, blindfolded and handcuffed, to a building for questioning. His interrogator asked about his relationship with the woman, seeming to know details of her family, and telling White, vaguely, that some in Iran were concerned about his intentions there.He was taken to what he calls the “intel jail,” where he says he was given no food for days, nor blanket or pillow even as the vent blew frigid air. The conditions were compounded, he says, by his cancer diagnosis that had resulted in chemotherapy treatment and hospital stays in the months before he left for Iran.He was repeatedly interrogated over several months about why he'd come to Iran, as officials suspicious that he may be a spy handed him questionnaires focused on his military background and any intelligence service connections. At one point, he writes, he fabricated a tale about being tasked to gather intelligence by an acquaintance he said was with the National Security Agency, figuring that interrogators wanted to hear something like that before setting him free.“I was just saying something out of desperation, doing whatever to hopefully get them to just cut me loose," he said in the interview. ”It turned out it wasn’t really helpful at all."The truth was more mundane, he says, albeit more difficult to comprehend: He was a “dumb American” pursuing love.White's decisions were undoubtedly risky: His Iran visits came despite that country's hostile relationship with the US. He says he and his girlfriend got together in 2014 in Iran's Kish Island, even though retired FBI agent Robert Levinson vanished from there years earlier.But White, 48, who grew up in Southern California and was honorably discharged from the Navy, says he's long been drawn to Iran's culture and people and had felt safe there, connecting through social media to a network of acquaintances. He'd once thought of law school or entering politics, but at the time of a 2018 trip he hoped would recharge his life, he was working as a Job Corps resident adviser.He struggles to reconcile his affection for the woman he perceived as his girlfriend — “Her voice melts me with its softness and tenderness. My heart flutters when I see her,” he writes — with the suspicion that he was somehow set up during his visit. His Instagram page reflects that ambivalence, with photos posted this year of them together.“Yet, sadly, I was lured into a trap, like a mouse trap. I was the mouse,” he writes. "I followed my heart instead of my head and missed signs.”In jail, he writes, he was once awakened by a guard dumping a bucket of cold water on him. Another time, an interrogator snapped a whip on his toes as he completed a questionnaire. After White tossed water on a surveillance camera to get the guards’ attention, they pummeled him in the ribs and threw him to the floor, he writes.He was relocated to another prison where some inmates tauntingly referred to him as “The Great Satan.” One placed a cockroach inside his pants pocket as a prank.At the suggestion of a prisoner he befriended, he began a handwritten manuscript, writing it under the cover of playing Sudoku to hide it from the guards. He gave the pages to the prisoner who he says was able to smuggle it out through a cousin.White ultimately faced various charges, including posting private images, collaborating with the US. against Iran and disrespecting Iran's supreme leader. He was sentenced to 10 years but calls the charges a pretext to “extort” concessions.He insists he's not a spy and never posted any inappropriate photos of his girlfriend. He writes in his manuscript that he has indeed made social media posts about Iran but denies having disparaged Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.An unexpected development came last spring as the coronavirus ravaged Iran. White, who was himself infected, was among thousands of prisoners released on medical furlough, permitted to live freely in Tehran in the Swiss Embassy's custody while required to remain in Iran.The State Department, which has maintained that White was wrongfully detained, arranged for his release in June, flying him back to the U.S. as part of a deal that spared additional prison time for an American-Iranian doctor convicted in the US of sanctions violations.In August, he visited the White House with other freed hostages and detainees to record a Republican National Convention segment praising the Trump administration. He sat beside President Donald Trump in a three-piece suit in an experience he says made him feel like a celebrity, though he recalls Trump not shaking his hand.“He was like, well, you know, if the media sees that, they're going to be flipping out of because of the corona(virus) thing,” White said.White isn't sure what comes next. He had contemplated opening a Persian restaurant, but isn't sure he'll do that now. He likens his life to the aftermath of a city-flattening hurricane."I’m just picking up the pieces, regrouping and trying to figure out how I’m going to move forward and stuff."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-the-mouse-how-quest-for-love-landed-us-navy-veteran-in-iran-jail-101610820662594.html
16-01-2021||World||US lawmakers who helped the rioters should be prosecuted, says Nancy Pelosi||US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday said lawmakers who may have helped in the January 6 storming of the Capitol in any way will be prosecuted.Democrats have alleged that rioters were given advance tours of the US Capitol ahead of the attack by some Republicans. How else, they have argued, could the rioters know their way around, reaching office rooms deep inside the building.“If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecutions,” Pelosi said at a news conference.“In order to serve here with each other, we must trust that people have respect for their oath of office, respect for this institution,” she added.Mikie Sherrill, a Democratic lawmaker who is also a former US Navy pilot, said she saw “members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on January 5 for reconnaissance for the next day”. She leads a group of Democrats demanding action against them.James Clyburn, a senior Democrat whose endorsement was crucial to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the primaries, was surprised that the rioters reached his unmarked office. “Well, it seems to me that something was going on - some coordination was going on between sitting members of Congress and some of these visitors to the Capitol,” he said.Four insurrectionists and one Capitol police officer were killed in an attack on the US Capitol on January 6 by a mob incited by outgoing President Donald Trump to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Biden’s election victory.Trump was impeached on Wednesday for “incitement of insurrection”, making him the first American president to be impeached twice. A trial by the Senate will take place at a date and time not announced yet.Preparations are underway to secure the US Capitol for Biden’s inauguration on January 20 - with four times more troops deployed in Washington, DC than in Iraq and Afghanistan combined as well as tall fencing. Trump will not attend Biden’s inauguration, he has said before, breaking a long-running tradition. Biden does not want him there either. Vice-President Mike Pence is expected to attend the inauguration. He called vice-president elect Kamala Harris on Thursday afternoon to congratulate her. Neither Pence nor his boss had conceded defeat until then or congratulated the incoming team. Trump still hasn’t. And along with his enablers, he had contested the results with baseless claims of fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-who-helped-the-rioters-should-be-prosecuted-says-nancy-pelosi-101610818611908.html
16-01-2021||World||Federal prisons on lockdown in run-up to Biden inauguration||All federal prisons in the United States have been placed on lockdown, with officials aiming to quell any potential violence that could arise behind bars as law enforcement prepares for potentially violent protests across the country in the run-up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday.The lockdown at more than 120 federal Bureau of Prisons facilities took effect at 12am Saturday, according to an email to employees from the president of the union representing federal correctional officers.“In light of current events occurring around the country, and out of an abundance of caution, the decision has been made to secure all institutions,” the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement.The lockdown decision is precautionary, no specific information led to it and it is not in response to any significant events occurring inside facilities, the bureau said.To avoid backlash from inmates, the lockdown was not announced until after they were locked in their cells Friday evening.Shane Fausey, the president of the Council of Prison Locals, wrote in his email to staff that inmates should still be given access in small groups to showers, phones and email and can still be involved in preparing food and performing basic maintenance.Messages seeking comment were left with Fausey on Saturday.The agency last put in place a nationwide lockdown in April to combat the spread of the coronavirus.During a lockdown, inmates are kept in their cells most of the day and visiting is canceled. Because of coronavirus, social visits only resumed in October, but many facilities have canceled them again as infections spiked.One reason for the new nationwide lockdown is that the bureau is moving some of its Special Operations Response Teams from prison facilities to Washington, DC, to bolster security after President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol on Jan. 6. Authorities are concerned there could be more violence, not only in the nation’s capital, but also at state capitals, before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.A Bureau of Prisons spokesman said the agency was coordinating with officials at the Justice Department to be ready to deploy as needed. Earlier this month, about 100 officers were sent to the Justice Department's headquarters to supplement security staff and were deputized by the US Marshals Service and given special legal powers to “enforce federal criminal statutes and protect federal property and personnel,” said the spokesman, Justin Long.The specialized units typically respond to disturbances and other emergencies at prisons, such as riots, assaults, escapes and escape attempts, and hostage situations. Their absence can leave gaps in a prison’s emergency response and put remaining staff at risk.“The things that happen outside the walls could affect those working behind the walls,” Aaron McGlothin, a local union president at a federal prison in California.As the pandemic continues to menace federal inmates and staff, a federal lockup in Mendota, California, is also dealing with a possible case of tuberculosis.According to an email to staff Friday, an inmate at the medium-security facility has been placed in a negative pressure room after returning a positive skin test and an X-ray that indicated an active case of tuberculosis.The inmate was not showing symptoms of the lung disease and is undergoing further testing to confirm a diagnosis, the email said.As a precaution, all other inmates on the affected inmate’s unit were placed on quarantine status and given skin tests for tuberculosis.The bacterial disease is spread similarly to Covid-19, through droplets that an infected person expels by coughing, sneezing or through other activities such as singing and talking.Mendota also has 10 current inmate cases and six current staff cases of Covid-19.As of Wednesday, the last day for which data was available, there were 4,718 federal inmates and 2,049 Bureau of Prisons staff members with current positive tests for Covid-19.Since the first case was reported in March, 38,535 inmates and 3,553 staff have recovered from the virus. So far, 190 federal inmates and 3 staff members have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/federal-prisons-on-lockdown-in-run-up-to-biden-inauguration-101610816787593.html
16-01-2021||World||Prince William worried about strain on UK emergency workers||Prince William says he is concerned about the mental health of UK ambulance drivers, police officers and other first responders who are being exposed to extraordinary levels of trauma and death as coronavirus cases soar.William, a former search and rescue helicopter pilot, told emergency workers on a video call that they must not be afraid to ask for help despite their inclination to help others first.“I fear…you’re all so busy caring for everyone else that you won’t take enough time to care for yourselves, and we won’t see the impact for quite some time,’’ William, the second in line to the British throne, said on a tape released late Friday.Britain’s health care system is staggering as a more contagious variant of the coronavirus coupled with cold, wet winter weather puts unprecedented strain on hospitals and emergency workers.The London Ambulance Service says it is receiving about 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared with 5,500 on a typical busy day. But the strain is being felt across all emergency services. Hundreds of firefighters, for example, have volunteered to drive ambulances to ease pressure on beleaguered services.The surge in infections across the UK has pushed the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 to a record 37,282, more than 70% higher than during the first peak of the pandemic in April. Britain has reported 87,448 coronavirus-related deaths, more than any other country in Europe and the fifth-highest number worldwide.Eleven months into the pandemic, the pace is taking a toll on the men and women who are first to respond to calls for help.But many emergency workers aren’t taking advantage of counseling and other support programs because they are too focused on responding to the crisis, said Phil Spencer, a police inspector who coordinates well-being programs for the Cleveland Police force in northeastern England.“Perhaps further down the line, when all this is gone, we’re going to have some broken police officers and emergency services staff, because we’re too busy focusing on protecting the most vulnerable,” Spencer told the prince and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.William and Kate have made ending the stigma attached to mental health issues a focus of their charitable work.As the couple chatted with emergency workers and counselors, William shared his own experiences of working as a helicopter pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance.“I think a lot of the public don’t understand that when you’re surrounded by that level of intense trauma and sadness and bereavement, it really does, it stays with you at home, it stays with you for weeks on end, doesn’t it?’’ he said. “And you see the world in a much more, slightly depressed, darker, blacker place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-worried-about-strain-on-uk-emergency-workers-101610813122957.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump will leave about $500 million poorer after 4 years in office||On the day Donald Trump was getting impeached in Washington, the lobby of his New York tower at 40 Wall St. was almost silent. Few footsteps smudged the shiny marble.But up the dark and golden elevators, trouble was stirring in one of the billionaire’s most valuable properties. Inside one law office, two partners had clashed over whether to keep paying rent to a landlord who encouraged the Capitol’s deadly riot. On the 24th floor, a nonprofit that fights tuberculosis was exploring options for leaving. On the seventh, the Girl Scouts were figuring out how to break their lease.And in the basement, vintage bank-vault doors that weigh more than 10 tons stood wide open. There, in a club room that Trump renovated, the news was playing on a jumbo television to an audience of empty armchairs just as Congress voted against him.So it goes in Trump’s empire as his presidency slouches toward the end.The Trump Organization, run by sons Eric and Don Jr., was struggling with the devastating consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic even before their father incited a raid on Congress. Efforts to sell his Washington hotel were shelved, his office buildings were losing value amid a glut of space in Manhattan, and his golf courses were facing the reality that younger generations aren’t so interested.Trump entered office worth $3 billion. Despite soaring stock prices and his own tax cuts, he will leave about $500 million poorer, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.His buildings are saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, most of it coming due in the next three years and more than a third of it personally guaranteed. Refinancing would mean finding lenders and corporations willing to work with history’s only twice-impeached ex-president.“Nothing like this has ever happened to him,” said Barbara Res, who was an executive in Trump’s company for years. “Will he come back? My gut tells me yes, because he always comes back. But he won’t come back the same.”Deserted AvenueTrump already has survived corporate bankruptcies, rough times in Atlantic City, a school that ended with probes and dead-end brand journeys for Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka and even an airline. The man who made “America First” his catchphrase could now hunt overseas for partnerships and licensing deals.Even so, Deutsche Bank AG, his longtime financier, won’t touch him anymore. Signature Bank, where his daughter Ivanka once served on the board, is closing his accounts. Cushman & Wakefield Plc, a broker for 40 Wall St., is cutting ties, and PGA of America is steering clear.The biggest hits to Trump’s fortune are in New York, the heart of his empire, where the Queens-born developer turned into a reality star and then descended his own escalator to enter politics.Outside Trump Tower, East 56th Street remains blocked, a parking lot for about a dozen black SUVs with government plates. The building is closed to visitors due to the pandemic, shutting Trump’s grill, bar, cafe and ice cream parlor.Not that there are tourists around for winter sundaes. Fifth Avenue is almost deserted. Vacant storefronts are multiplying, and some remaining boutiques are now appointment-only. Rents have slid 32% from a 2018 peak, according to the Real Estate Board of New York.Trump’s cavernous East 57th Street space is currently subleased to the iconic Tiffany’s jewelry store, but a new tenant will soon be needed.High above, 1,596 square feet of Trumpian extravagance keeps getting cheaper.Apartment 55B, with blue lapis floors and medallion ceilings, is listed for $2.995 million, about $2.5 million less than four years ago. It’s hardly an outlier. Prices at the skyscraper have slipped by a third since Trump took office, StreetEasy data show.And even before the Capitol attack, his company was offering concessions to some tenants at 40 Wall St., lender records show. The $137 million debt at the property was added to lender watch lists in November after net income dipped below what underwriters expected when the debt was issued in 2015.City’s Rejection“I don’t believe his name is going to bring a premium currently,” said Warren A. Estis, founding partner at real estate law firm Rosenberg & Estis and owner of an 86th-floor penthouse at Trump World Tower near the United Nations. Still, Estis said he’s heard no rumblings from his condo board about stripping Trump’s name from the building.“What’s in a name? A rose by any other name is still a rose,” says Estis. “It appears Donald is very resilient and I expect he’s going to bounce back from this.”New York City itself wants nothing to do with Trump. Officials plan to end more than $17 million in contracts with the president’s family business, including a carousel and two ice skating rinks in Central Park and a Bronx golf course.“The City of New York has no legal right to end our contracts and if they elect to proceed, they will owe the Trump Organization over $30 million,” the company said in a statement. “This is nothing more than political discrimination, an attempt to infringe on the First Amendment, and we plan to fight vigorously.”While police officers were keeping the public out of Trump Tower, including its Trump Store, there was also bad news for fans going online to nab Trump pint glasses for $55 or a Trump candle set for $80. Shopify is refusing to service the website, which has left customers with a warning that their connection isn’t private and “attackers might be trying to steal your information.”Not long ago, the big question hovering over Trump’s return to the business world was whether the former reality television host would make a foray into conservative media, where product endorsements and licensing deals are legion. Now the talk in finance circles centers on whether he can defend his existing empire. He’ll have to convince lenders he’s worth the risks, and prove to developers his name retains enough cache.“The presidency and Donald’s racist, sexist and xenophobic language has tarnished the brand to such an extent that it is valueless,” said Michael Cohen, his lawyer-turned-critic.Streaming TrumpEric Trump brushed off such assertions in an interview with the Associated Press this week, blaming “cancel culture” for recent hits to the family empire that he said posed no threat to the company’s finances. His father, he noted, still has armies of fans: “You have a man who would get followed to the ends of the Earth by a hundred million Americans.”One executive in conservative media who’s still bullish on Trump’s prospects for creating a subscription-based video service conceded that recent events may limit possible platforms, advertisers and partners.Still, the executive said that even controversial porn purveyors can find homes online. He estimated Trump could get 5 million to 15 million supporters to pay $10 a month for content, predicting gold hawkers and close friends wouldn’t balk at advertising.The Trump Organization could also look overseas.During his presidency, Trump pledged that his businesses wouldn’t sign new deals in foreign countries, but it continued to collect income from licensing arrangements in Turkey, the Philippines and India. His administration developed close ties in the United Arab Emirates, where he’s previously done business, and Saudi Arabia, where his company considered projects before his ascent to the presidency.Betting on ReboundHussain Sajwani, chairman of Dubai’s DAMAC Properties, said he’d welcome the chance to expand his firm’s relationship with Trump.“We have a great relationship with the Trump Organization, and, be assured, we have absolutely no intention to cancel our agreement,” he said in a statement.The author of “The Art of the Deal” and “The Art of the Comeback” could try his hand at returning to publishing. Trump’s predecessors in the White House, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, got a record-breaking $65 million advance for their memoirs.Trump may have created problems for himself here, too. Publisher Simon & Schuster canceled a planned book by Trump ally Josh Hawley, citing the Missouri senator’s “role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.”At least for now, a return to politics isn’t out of the question. Betting website PredictIt pegs the odds that Trump will file this year to run again for president at about 30%. Recently, like so much else, that number has taken a tumble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-will-leave-about-500-million-poorer-after-4-years-in-office-101610813077951.html

The groundbreaking for the project was done in November during the visit of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, and it was the first India-funded grant project to be inaugurated this year.The running track is the only one of international standard in the Maldives, and it was built on an open space in Male that has been used to conduct sports events and tournaments. Over the past six months, eight grant projects backed by India have been completed in the Maldives.The newly laid running track is designed to make the space more suited for exercise and sports and athletic events and will equally benefit sports professionals and residents of Male. The track also will promote a healthier lifestyle, which is one of the key pledges of Solih.Solih and Indian envoy Sunjay Sudhir participated in a limited overs cricket match during the inauguration ceremony and there was also a relay race and events involving differently-abled children.The Ekuveni project is part of 30 high-impact community development projects being implemented across the Maldives with a total outlay of $13 million from India.The projects completed with Indian grants includes a convention centre in Ukulhas, installation of streetlights in Kolhufushi, development of Vaani police centre, provision of vehicles and machinery to the Male city council, the Goidhoo-Fehendhoo school ferry, provision of equipment for gyms on 61 islands and creation of 67 children’s parks on atolls.Over the next three months, more India-backed projects will be inaugurated, including the Rasdhoo coastal protection project, a wetland park in Faresmathoda, and a refurbished orphanage and a renovated jetty in Hulhumale. With a special focus on the development of Addu city, India is helping set up three fish processing plants, five eco-tourism zones and a drug detoxification centre.India has also provided grants to set up a bottled water plant in Hoarafushi and a soil-testing laboratory at the Hanimaadhoo Agricultural Research Centre.“High impact community projects undertaken through Indian grant assistance constitute an important dimension of the dynamic development partnership between India and the Maldives,” the Indian high commission in Male said in a statement.“This development partnership is further distinguished by its transparent and participative nature and an inherent flexibility to perfectly complement requirements of the local community and the thrust of the government on decentralisation,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-implements-community-projects-worth-13-million-in-the-maldives-101610810693030.html

Paulo reported on Saturday, citing government and industry sources.Financial costs potentially worth billions of dollars and the exit of ally President Donald Trump from the White House are forcing President Jair Bolsonaro to backtrack on his opposition to Huawei bidding to provide the next generation cellular network for carriers in Brazil, the paper said.Like Trump, Bolsonaro opposes Huawei on the unproven grounds that it shares confidential data with China's Communist government.But, with China being Brazil's largest trade partner and Huawei's ability to compete on price, he has faced resistance from industry and within his own government, including from Vice President Hamilton Mourao.Estado de S. Paulo quoted Mourao as saying all companies that provide the necessary guarantees on respecting Brazil's national sovereignty and data protection will be allowed to offer 5G equipment in the country.Last month, sources told Reuters that Bolsonaro's government was looking for a legal way to exclude Huawei from 5G networks in Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-to-allow-china-s-huawei-in-5g-auctions-report-101610810245281.html

According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, New Jersey and Mississippi are offering the vaccine to smokers under the age of 65 to provide immunity against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has claimed more than 392,000 lives in the United States.Earlier this week, Mississippi governor Tate Reeves announced an expansion of the vaccine rollout for people under 65 years of age with high-risk medical conditions. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines say that adults of any age with smoking habit are at increased risk for severe Covid-19 associated illness and are placed in Phase 1c population groups, ahead of those essential workers not included in Phase 1b. Tate told a news conference that essential workers like teachers are next in line for the vaccination."And just be very clear to our emergency first responders, to our police officers, to our firefighters, and to our teachers, you're on deck. The next time we have an update, I expect it will be to announce that the vaccine will become available to you," the Mississippi governor said.While the phased rollout of vaccines in the two US states is in line with the federal guidelines published by the CDC, the decision to prioritise smokers over essential workers like teachers has drawn criticism. According to a CNN report, Bergen County Education Association president Sue McBride said that educators in New Jersey frustrated that they have been pushed back in the priority line."From what I am hearing, it's just another round of frustration and another round of difficulty, you know, our educators and our education support professionals have working contact with the students and with their colleagues in their school buildings," McBride was quoted as saying by the US media outlet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccination-priority-to-smokers-frustrate-essential-workers-in-us-report-101610808906895.html
16-01-2021||World||Norway: Deaths among elderly after first Covid-19 vaccine dose rise to 29||Norway has registered a total of 29 deaths among people over the age of 75 who’ve had their first Covid-19 vaccination shot, raising questions over which groups to target in national inoculation programs.The latest figure adds six to the number of known fatalities in Norway, and also lowers the age group thought to be affected from 80.Until Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech was the only vaccine available in Norway, and “all deaths are thus linked to this vaccine,” the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a written response to Bloomberg on Saturday.“There are 13 deaths that have been assessed, and we are aware of another 16 deaths that are currently being assessed,” the agency said. All the reported deaths related to “elderly people with serious basic disorders,” it said. “Most people have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.”Side EffectsNorway’s experience has prompted the country to suggest that Covid-19 vaccines may be too risky for the very old and terminally ill, the most cautious statement yet from a European health authority as countries assess the real-world side effects of the first shots to gain approval.The Norwegian Institute of Public Health judges that “for those with the most severe frailty, even relatively mild vaccine side effects can have serious consequences. For those who have a very short remaining life span anyway, the benefit of the vaccine may be marginal or irrelevant.”Pfizer and BioNTech are working with the Norwegian regulator to investigate the deaths in Norway, Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement. The agency found that “the number of incidents so far is not alarming, and in line with expectations,” Pfizer said.“We are aware that deaths have also been reported in other countries, but do not have full details of this yet,” Norway’s medicines agency said. “There are also differences between countries in who is prioritized for vaccination, and this could also affect the reporting of side effects, including death.”“The Norwegian Medicines Agency has communicated, prior to the vaccination, that when vaccinating the oldest and sickest, it is expected that deaths will occur in a time-related context with vaccination. This does not mean that there is a causal link between vaccination and death. We have also, in connection with the reported deaths, conveyed that it is possible that common and known side effects of the vaccines may have been a contributing factor to a serious course or fatal outcome,” the agency said.Norway’s recommendation doesn’t mean that younger, healthier people should avoid being vaccinated. But it’s an early indication of what to watch as countries begin to issue safety monitoring reports on the vaccines. Emer Cooke, the new head of the European Medicines Agency, has said tracking the safety of Covid vaccines, especially those relying on novel technologies such as messenger RNA, would be one of the biggest challenges once shots are rolled out widely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-suggests-covid-19-vaccine-may-be-too-risky-for-old-people-terminally-ill-101610809149331.html

Some of those steps were triggered by a law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran has blamed on its arch-foe Israel.They are also part of a process of retaliation Tehran started in 2019 in response to US President Donald Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the deal and his reimposition of US0. sanctions that the deal lifted in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.The three powers, who remain in the deal with China and Russia, said they were "deeply concerned" and that Iran's production of uranium metal had no civilian credibility and had potentially serious military implications.The nuclear deal imposes a 15-year ban on Iran producing or acquiring uranium metal, a sensitive material that can be used in the core of a nuclear bomb.The Iranian breaches raise pressure on US President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week and has pledged to return the United States to the deal if Iran first resumes full compliance. Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/major-european-powers-rebuke-iran-over-uranium-metal-plans-101610809470593.html

Eric Lander is the founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and was the lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome. He would be the first life scientist to have that White House job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.The president-elect also said on Friday he is retaining the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project. Biden also is naming two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Frances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will lead the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration.Collins, in an email statement, called Lander “brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.”“I predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science,” Collins said.The job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.Science organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.“Elevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion,” said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.Biden has picked Princeton's Alondra Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, as deputy science policy chief.Lander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur “genius” fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.Lander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his “Achilles' heel": “I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/science-will-always-be-at-the-forefront-of-my-administration-joe-biden-101610808352015.html

And that’s why I’m so excited to announce my candidacy to be Cincinnati’s next mayor," the 38-year-old Democractic Party politician tweeted."I’m running for mayor to bring executive experience & a record of improving government services to the table — starting with an economic COVID recovery that benefits every neighbourhood in our city & a plan to restore trust in City Hall," he said in another tweet.According to a local newspaper The Enquirer, Pureval's parents migrated from India in 1980 to Xenia, Ohio. He lost the race for Congress in 2018."The truth is families are really struggling. Our city is at a critical moment and the progress of the last decade is at stake.

16-01-2021||World||IT companies’ clients required to meet H1-B filing obligation under new US rule||The US department of labor (DOL) on Friday followed the final wages rule, signed in the Federal Register on January 14, with a new interpretation of the regulations and accompanying guidance for companies that sponsor H-1B visa holders. Under the new guidance, the secondary employers, also known as clients, will have to comply with the filing requirements and other obligations which, currently, only lie with the primary employers or the staffing agencies.According to the office of Foreign Labor Certification (FLC), the regulations require all common-law employers of H-1B workers to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA). It will not only put the liability on employers for compliance obligations relating to wages and working conditions but will also lead to higher administrative burden and costs for clients. The new guidance documents will take effect in 180 days, which means the employers have to comply with the obligations for the applications filed on or after July 14.The labor department said that the interpretation and guidance are “more consistent with the H-1B statute and regulations”, adding that it is also “appropriate” in the wake of interpretative changes made by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). “This revised interpretation is long overdue in light of the language of the regulations, better comports with the goals of the H-1B program, and is consistent with recent Executive Branch directives,” John Pallasch, assistant secretary for employment and training, said in a statement.After the announcement, US Tech Workers, a non-profit organisation “representing the voices of American workers harmed by the H-1B visa program”, said that the new guidance was a “great way to target companies” that use staffing agencies to “displace Americans.” In a series of tweets, US Tech Workers said that the new regulation will hold those secondary employers accountable that claim to be not directly involved in the sponsoring of H-1B visas.“When Disney was sued for laying off American workers and replacing them H-1B workers brought in from third party IT outsourcing firms (Cognizant & HCL), Disney’s defense was that they weren’t the ones who sponsored the H-1B visas. This regulation would now hold them accountable,” it tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-companies-clients-required-to-meet-h1-b-filing-obligation-under-new-us-rule-101610804734319.html

Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment," he said.The agency reported Thursday that a total of 29 people had suffered side effects, including the 13 people who died.Twenty-one women and eight men experienced side effects, officials said.Besides those who died, nine had serious side effects -- including allergic reactions, strong discomfort and severe fever -- while seven had less serious ones, including severe pain at the injection site, New York Post reported.According to health officials around 400 people die each week in the nursing home population.A Pfizer rep said the company is "aware of reported deaths" following the administration of the vaccine in Norway and is working with the Norwegian Medicines Agency to gather all the relevant information.The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Norway is 58,202, while the death toll stands at 517, according to the Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-23-people-die-within-days-of-getting-first-covid-19-vaccine-dose-101610804880470.html
16-01-2021||World||Explainer: Can Trump pardon himself? Would the courts reject the move?||As he prepares to end a tumultuous four years as US president facing potential legal jeopardy, Donald Trump has discussed the possibility of pardoning himself, according to a source familiar with the matter. But there are questions about whether a president's broad executive clemency powers under the US Constitution would permit such action.The Justice Department has previously taken the view that the Constitution does not allow a sitting president to be indicted, but a former president enjoys no such protections.Here is an explanation of the potential constitutional problems with a self-pardon and why such action would not end Trump's legal jeopardy after his term ends on Wednesday.Is a self-pardon constitutional?There is no definitive answer to this question, and the Constitution does not explicitly address this possibility. No president has tried it before, so the courts have not weighed in. Trump wrote on Twitter in 2018 that he had the "absolute right" to pardon himself. A White House spokesman declined to comment on the possibility of a self-pardon.Many scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case.Others have argued that a self-pardon is constitutional because the pardon power is very broadly worded in the Constitution. Historical texts made clear that the nation's 18th century founders discussed self-pardons, but opted not to include an explicit limitation on that power.The Constitution states that a president "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment." The common usage and history of the words "grant" and "pardon" imply a president's power under the clause is limited to issuing pardons to other people, according to University of Missouri law professor Frank Bowman.The last time the Justice Department explored the question was in a 1974 memo by a lawyer in its Office of Legal Counsel that concluded that it would be unconstitutional for then-President Richard Nixon to pardon himself. Nixon resigned that year amid the Watergate political scandal."Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case, the President cannot pardon himself," the Justice Department lawyer wrote.But the memo argued that Nixon could temporarily step down, be pardoned by his then-vice president, and then resume power. The 1974 memo does not have any legal authority.Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes, not state crimes.How might a self-pardon be tested in court?Under US law, courts do not issue advisory opinions. For a court to rule on a self-pardon's validity, the Justice Department would need to charge Trump with a crime, and then he would need to invoke the pardon as a defense, legal experts said.A self-pardon might only embolden prosecutors to bring a case against Trump because it would suggest he is hiding something, said law professor Jessica Levinson of Loyola Law School in California.Why would Trump pardon himself?He may face criminal liability on several fronts.Some legal experts have pointed to Trump's Jan. 2 phone call in which he pressured Georgia's top election official to "find" enough votes to overturn his Nov. 3 election loss to President-elect Joe Biden in the state. They said the call could have violated a federal and a state law.A Georgia law against "criminal solicitation to commit election fraud" makes it illegal for a person to intentionally solicit, request, command or otherwise attempt to cause another person to engage in election fraud. A separate federal law makes it illegal to attempt to "deprive or defraud" people of a "fair and impartially conducted election process."Trump would likely argue that he merely expressed his personal opinions to the official, and did not order him to interfere with the election.Some lawyers have said Trump could be in legal jeopardy for an incendiary speech he gave to thousands of supporters on Jan. 6, shortly before a mob descended on the US Capitol and disrupted congressional certification of Biden's victory, sending lawmakers into hiding and leaving five people dead. Trump could make a strong case that his remarks were protected by the Constitution's guarantee of free speech, other lawyers said.Trump could be targeted by prosecutors for violations of state laws. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance already is spearheading a tax-fraud investigation into Trump's businesses, though no charges have yet been brought. Trump has called the investigation politically motivated.How broadly could a self-pardon be worded?There is precedent for very broadly worded pardons. Nixon eventually received a "full and unconditional pardon" from his successor, Gerald Ford. The pardon cleared Nixon for "any crimes that he might have committed against the United States as president."The US Supreme Court has never ruled on whether such a broad pardon is lawful. Some scholars have argued that the nation's founders intended for pardons to be specific, and that there is an implied limit on their scope.Could a pardon be preemptive?A pardon cannot cover future conduct, but a pardon can be preemptive in the sense that it can cover conduct that has not yet resulted in legal proceedings.The Nixon pardon is an example, and there are others. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter preemptively pardoned hundreds of thousands of "draft dodgers" who avoided a government-imposed obligation to serve in the Vietnam War.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-can-trump-pardon-himself-would-the-courts-reject-the-move-101610799527059.html
16-01-2021||World||Joe Biden fills out state department team with Obama administration veterans||President-elect Joe Biden is filling out his State Department team with a group of former career diplomats and veterans of the Obama administration, signaling his desire to return to a more traditional foreign policy after four years of uncertainty and unpredictability under President Donald Trump.A transition official said Biden intends to nominate Wendy Sherman as deputy secretary of state and Victoria Nuland as undersecretary of state for political affairs — the second- and third-highest ranking posts, respectively.They were expected to be the 11 department appointees that Biden was announcing Saturday to serve under his pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the official said. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the appointments before the announcements and spoke on condition of anonymity.Among the others joining the Biden team are:—longtime Biden Senate aide Brian McKeon, to be deputy secretary of state for management.—former senior diplomats Bonnie Jenkins and Uzra Zeya, to be under secretary of state for arms control and undersecretary of state of democracy and human rights, respectively.—Derek Chollet, a familiar Democratic foreign policy hand, to be State Department counselor.—former U.N. official Salman Ahmed, as director of policy planning.—Suzy George, who was a senior aide to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, will be Blinken's chief of staff.—Ned Price, a former Obama administration National Security Council staffer and career CIA official who resigned in protest in the early days of the Trump administration, will serve as the public face of the department, taking on the role of spokesman.—Jalina Porter, communications director for Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., who is leaving Congress to work in the White House, will be Price's deputy.Price and Porter intend to return to the practice of holding daily State Department press briefings, officials said. Those briefings had been eliminated under the Trump administration.Jeffrey Prescott, a former national security aide when Biden was vice president, is Biden's pick to be deputy ambassador to the United Nations, He would serve under U.N. envoy-designate Linda Thomas-Greenfield.Five of the 11 are either people of color or LGBTQ. Although most are not household names, all are advocates of multilateralism and many are familiar in Washington and overseas foreign policy circles. Their selections are a reflection of Biden's intent to turn away from Trump's transactional and often unilateral “America First” approach to international relations.“These leaders are trusted at home and respected around the world, and their nominations signal that America is back and ready to lead the world, not retreat from it," Biden said in a statement. “They also reflect the idea that we cannot meet this new moment with unchanged thinking or habits, and that we need diverse officials who look like America at the table. They will not only repair but also reimagine American foreign policy and national security for the next generation.”Sherman led the Obama administration’s negotiations leading to the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which Trump withdrew, and had engaged in talks over ballistic missiles with North Korea during President Bill Clinton's second term. Nuland served as assistant secretary of state for European Affairs during the Ukraine crisis..Sherman, McKeon, Nuland, Jenkins and Zeya will require Senate confirmation to their posts while the others will not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-fills-out-state-department-team-with-obama-administration-veterans-101610804015535.html

If we don’t start bringing revenue into the sector, we’re going to be in a very difficult place indeed," he told BBC radio."Airlines have been staying in business by taking on billions of pounds of debt which will need to be paid back," he added.Britain's current lockdowns ban most international travel meaning that airline schedules are currently minimal, but the withdrawal of any quarantine-free travel from Monday will be a further blow for the industry.The latest restrictions were prompted in part by a third wave of the disease that has caused record daily death tolls in Britain, as well as concern about a new coronavirus variant discovered in Brazil.Karen Dee, chief executive of Britain's Airport Operators Association, said the government needed to go beyond existing support that includes a temporary exemption from local property taxes.“The UK and devolved governments (for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) now need to set out as a matter of extreme urgency how they will support airports through this deepening crisis," she said.Relief from regulatory, policing and air traffic control costs would help, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-airports-call-for-urgent-government-support-after-travel-rules-tightened-101610802066491.html

And, the decision is an initiative to save their culture and identity as the Cherokee Nation has only 2,000 fluent speakers of the language.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19What is the Cherokee Nation?The Cherokee Nation is the sovereign tribal government settled in Indian territory present-day Oklahoma, United States. It is the largest tribe in the United States with more than 380,000 tribal citizens worldwide. The new government was established by the Cherokee people in the city of Tahlequah, Oklahoma. A constitution was also adopted 68 years earlier to the statehood of Oklahoma in September of 1839.The main aim of the Cherokee Nation is to protect the inherent sovereignty, preserve and promote their culture, language and values, and to improve quality of life for the next seven generations of Cherokee Nation citizens.Covid-19 and the Cherokee NationAround 141,000 tribal citizens reside in the reservation boundaries of northeastern Oklahoma. The tribe recorded 12,759 coronavirus disease cases and 73 deaths till date, as per the Cherokee Nation health dashboard. More than 30 who lost their lives due to the pandemic were native language speakers of the Cherokee Nation, according to the tribe reported CNN.Also Read | AIIMS worker, 34, is first in India to get Covid-19 vaccine"When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure," principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr was quoted as saying by CNN. "Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left," he added.Vaccination targetThe tribal government received the first consignment of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine of 975 doses on December 14 last year. More than 600 native speakers have been vaccinated so far and the government targets vaccinating 1000 by the end of the week, reported CNN.Prioritisation of native language speakers and people aged 65 years and beyond have also imbibed the tribal citizens with the trust in the vaccine. Hoskin said that the prioritisation of native speakers and elders has resulted in easing the anxieties of the citizens against the vaccines."People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation. I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence," Hoskin was quoted as saying by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/native-speakers-on-covid-19-vaccine-priority-list-as-cherokee-nation-looks-to-prevent-culture-erosion-by-pandemic-101610800874454.html

Moscow has so far supplied 200,000 tonnes of wheat to Dhaka.Now, it looks like Russia will not be able to supply the rest of the quantity, Khanum said. Bangladesh is the third biggest buyer of Russian wheat after Turkey and Egypt."We are also importing wheat through international tenders and from June, we'll start our local wheat procurement drive," she said. Dhaka aims to import 600,000 tonnes of wheat by June, she said.Bangladesh imports around 6 million tonnes of wheat annually, making it one of the world's biggest grain importers.Dhaka is rushing to import rice and wheat to shore up its depleted reserves after repeated floods last year ravaged its crops, sending local prices to record highs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-turn-to-ukraine-for-wheat-as-russia-plans-to-raise-export-tax-101610799242087.html

Final results were expected at 3 p.m (1200 GMT), it said.In a phone interview with Reuters, Wine accused Museveni of fabricating the results and called the poll "the most fraudulent election in the history of Uganda". He urged citizens to reject the results.Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker, also said his home in the capital, Kampala, was surrounded by hundreds of soldiers and that the military was not allowing him to leave.The army's deputy spokesman, Deo Akiiki, told Reuters that security officers at Wine's house were assessing threats he could face by going out: "So they might be preventing him in the interest of his own safety."Soldiers and police were out in force patrolling Kampala on Saturday.Museveni, 76 and in power for 35 years, campaigned for another term arguing his long experience in office makes him a good leader and promising to keep delivering stability and progress.Wine, 38, galvanised young Ugandans with his calls for political change and pledged to end what he calls dictatorship and widespread corruption.Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said on Friday he had video proof of voting fraud, and would share the videos as soon as internet connections were restored. The government ordered the internet shut down the day before the election, and the blackout was still in place.Electoral Commission Chairman Simon Byabakama said on Friday that under Ugandan law, the burden of proof rested with Wine.Reuters has not independently verified Wine's claims.The United States and the European Union did not deploy observer teams, but the U.S. State Department’s top diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, said in a tweet early on Saturday that the "electoral process has been fundamentally flawed".He cited fraud reports, denial of accreditation to observers, violence and harassment of opposition members, and the arrest of civil society activists.The African Union and East African Community sent observer teams to the election, but neither group of officials responded to requests for comment about possible irregularities.Police recorded 42 election-related offences nationwide during voting and tallying so far, police spokesman Fred Enanga said on Friday night on local NBS TV. Offences included assaults, voter bribery, and theft and damage of electoral materials, he said.The run-up to Thursday's election was more violent than in previous polls. Security forces cracked down on opposition candidates and their supporters during the campaign, and more than 50 people died in protests in November on one of the multiple occasions when Wine was arrested.PARLIAMENTARY WINSIn addition to the internet blackout, the government on Tuesday banned all social media and messaging apps. Wine and his supporters often used Facebook to relay live coverage of his campaign.In the parliamentary election, where candidates were vying for 529 seats, results were still coming in but Ugandan media reported that at least 19 candidate from Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) had won their races, while the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), previously the largest opposition party, has so far won 17 seats.The country's vice president, Edward Ssekandi, was one of a number of senior ruling party MPs who lost their seats, according to broadcaster NTV Uganda.The FDC won 35 seats in the 2016 election, but the NUP had no seats in the previous parliament - Wine was elected as an independent and joined the party last year.(Reporting by Nairobi newsroom; Writing by Maggie Fick; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Frances Kerry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uganda-presidential-polls-bobi-wine-claims-museveni-committed-electoral-fraud-101610798848527.html
16-01-2021||World||Japan's suicides jump 16% in Covid-19 second wave after fall in 1st wave: Study||Suicide rates in Japan have jumped in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly among women and children, even though they fell in the first wave when the government offered generous handouts to people, a survey found.The July-October suicide rate rose 16% from the same period a year earlier, a stark reversal of the February-June decline of 14%, according to the study by researchers at Hong Kong University and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology."Unlike normal economic circumstances, this pandemic disproportionately affects the psychological health of children, adolescents and females (especially housewives)," the authors wrote in the study published on Friday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.The early decline in suicides was affected by such factors as government subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure, the study found.But the decline reversed - with the suicide rate jumping 37% for women, about five times the increase among men - as the prolonged pandemic hurt industries where women predominate, increasing the burden on working mothers, while domestic violence increased, the report said.The study, based on health ministry data from November 2016 to October 2020, found the child suicide rate spiked 49% in the second wave, corresponding to the period after a nationwide school closure.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this month issued a Covid-19 state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures in a bid to stem the resurgence. He expanded it this week to seven more prefectures, including Osaka and Kyoto.Taro Kono, administrative and regulatory reform minister, told Reuters on Thursday that while the government would consider extending the state of emergency, it "cannot kill the economy.""People worry about Covid-19. But a lot of people have also committed suicide because they have lost their jobs, they have lost their income and couldn't see the hope," he said. "We need to strike the balance between managing Covid-19 and managing the economy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-suicides-jump-16-in-covid-19-second-wave-after-fall-in-1st-wave-study-101610798535980.html

The document is set to be adopted by the European Commission on Jan. 19, the day before US President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-draft-sets-out-plans-to-limit-us-dollar-reliance-report-101610797213865.html
16-01-2021||World||US officials plead for more use of languishing antibody drugs||US health officials are pleading for more use of Covid-19 antibody therapies from Eli Lilly and Co. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that have been plagued by logistical issues, lack of efficacy data and insufficient reimbursement.The antibody treatments, touted by President Donald Trump and once feared to be subject to rationing because of demand, have instead been underused. As little as 5% of the supply available was being used in some areas in December, and utilization is now about 20% to 25% of regimens distributed to states, according to a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson.The US has more than $4.2 billion in supply agreements for millions of doses of antibody therapies for Covid-19, including a $2.6 billion deal with Regeneron clinched this week. Frustrated health officials seek wider use of the drugs that, like Covid vaccines, were developed at top speed in hopes of keeping patients out of hospitals and potentially preventing the severely ill from overwhelming the nation’s health system.“We don’t have the kind of evidence people are used to,” Janet Woodcock, a longtime Food and Drug Administration official who serves as therapeutics lead for Operation Warp Speed, said Thursday in a briefing. Still, she said, the evidence that the drugs can keep people off hospital wards “is very convincing.”Worth the EffortWoodcock, who’s likely to play a role in President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, urged hospitals and health centers to make the investments to administer the drugs.“We really feel it is worth it to go to the effort, set up the infusion centers, have as many infusions to high-risk people as possible and decrease the burden to the health-care system,” she said at the briefing.The Lilly and Regeneron antibody treatments mimic proteins that are typically produced by the body to fend off the virus. Trump received Regeneron’s antibody therapy after he was diagnosed with Covid last year and heralded the drug’s benefits.Emergency FDA clearances in November made them the first drugs authorized for use in non-hospitalized patients. They’re intended specifically for older individuals or those with chronic medical conditions, who are at high risk of progressing to severe Covid-19.But the authorizations were based on small, early-stage trials, a point of contention for clinicians who say insufficient data makes it difficult to recommend the drugs to patients.Just over 641,000 doses of the antibody treatment had been administered as of Jan. 6, according to US government figures. US patients currently hospitalized with Covid numbered almost 130,000 as of Jan. 10, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Logistical HurdlesGetting the drugs to patients is rife with complexity. The antibody therapies must be infused early in a Covid-19 illness, when patients are infectious, so common treatment sites like hospital wards are risky. Further, the government’s distribution plan relies on hospitals.The government’s distribution plan to date has relied heavily on hospitals. Beset by the pandemic, they are not yet getting paid for performing infusions of the government-supplied drugs because of delays in Medicare reimbursement and payment from commercial health insurers.“It is a problem at a time when hospitals are financially strapped, as are many others in health care,” Nancy Foster, the American Hospital Association’s vice president of quality and patient safety policy, said in an interview. “It needs to be resolved quickly.”An even tougher issue is identifying patients early after infection and getting them timely treatment, Foster said. Many patients aren’t tested at hospitals, and the institutions can’t always determine who’s eligible for antibody treatment, Foster said.Health-care companies are providing some assistance. Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. has funding from the U.S. to pinpoint viable recipients and administer antibodies in patients’ homes and long-term care facilities. Insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. is following as many as half a million patients in a real-world study in partnership with Lilly to help clarify how well the drugs work.Bolstering UptakeAlready this year, Lilly is seeing a significant improvement in uptake of its antibody, called bamlanivimab, over last year, according to Chief Financial Officer Joshua Smiley.Some states are “running out of drugs, and are trying to get more, while other states, they’re in that 20% or less utilization range,” Smiley said in an interview.Regeneron declined to comment.Patients and doctors would benefit from more information about where to find the monoclonal antibodies, he said. But the companies can’t advertise their products, which lack full approval that’s required to do outreach. Absence of a coordinated, federal response is also an an obstacle, creating a void of information about how and where to get the treatment.“I get friends of friends of friends who say, ‘My dad is sick. I know about Lilly’s drug, but how do I get it?’” he said.Belated WebsiteThe government has launched a website outlining which hospitals have received antibody therapies. As of Thursday, about 23 states lacked any identified infusion sites. Officials say they are working on updating the platform, and that all sites will be required to have their locations listed. The National Infusion Center Association, an industry group, has also launched a treatment locator.The US has also expanded distribution of antibody therapies to other settings like nursing homes, with hopes of doing so in urgent cares as well, Woodcock said Thursday.The AHA has urged the government to consider sites like separate infusion clinics run by public health or home health agencies, or converting ambulatory surgery centers into infusion sites. Rural areas are looking at using mobile units, which federal officials have expressed support for, according to Mark Howell, senior associate director of policy for the AHA.Smiley said he’s optimistic that more patients will get access to its antibody therapy. The company will likely invest another $300 million to $400 million this year to ramp up supply and even develop a more easily administered version, after spending about $450 million on its Covid program in 2020.“We should be able to make a bigger impact than we are making, and certainly we’ll be able to make a bigger impact in February and January and so on,” Smiley said. “Hopefully by the second half of this year it’s not as big of an issue because we’re getting the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-plead-for-more-use-of-languishing-antibody-drugs-101610795008878.html
16-01-2021||World||Armin Laschet elected chairman of German chancellor Merkel's CDU party||Germany's Christian Democrats elected Armin Laschet as chairman on Saturday, aiming to unify their divided party behind a new leader who they hope can succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor when she steps down after federal elections in September.Laschet, the premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia - Germany's most populous - won a runoff vote against Friedrich Merz, securing 521 votes against 466 for his arch-conservative rival, according to a ballot of 1,001 party delegates.At the helm of the CDU he replaces Europe's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, who has said she will not run for chancellor again."I want to do everything so that we can stick together through this year... and then make sure that the next chancellor in the federal elections will be from the (CDU/CSU) union," Laschet said in his victory speech.Laschet, 59, presents himself as the Merkel continuity candidate, and she said last year he had "the tools" to run for chancellor, the closest she has come to endorsing anyone.By tradition, the CDU chairman is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the conservative bloc is on course to win September's federal ballot.However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is the conservative most favoured by voters. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic Health Minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armin-laschet-elected-chairman-of-german-chancellor-merkel-s-cdu-party-101610795554401.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump’s China Inc. onslaught leaves key decisions for Biden||A year ago, President Xi Jinping asked the US to treat Chinese companies “fairly” in a letter read out at the White House to mark the signing of a landmark trade deal between the world’s biggest economies.At the time, President Donald Trump’s actions against China Inc. had mostly been aimed at tech giant Huawei Technologies Co., which had become a global leader in the race to set up 5G networks across the world. And even though it was blacklisted, Huawei enjoyed an ample supply of the radio chips critical to maintaining its dominance.Now, with Trump set to leave office next week, dozens of strategic Chinese companies find themselves in US crosshairs after a year that saw relations nosedive as the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Besides closing loopholes on Huawei, effectively knee-capping its smartphone business, the Trump administration took a wide range of actions to thwart China’s efforts to dominate high-tech industries that will drive growth over the next few decades.The profile of the companies targeted, including in the latest announcements on Thursday, is staggering. They include China’s three biggest telecom firms, its top chipmaker, its biggest social media and gaming players, its top two smartphone makers, its main deepwater energy explorer, its premier military aerospace contractor, its leading drone manufacturer and its primary commercial planemaker. At risk is China’s ability to produce everything from 5G networks to a passenger jet to compete with Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.While the scope of Trump’s unprecedented actions has roiled markets, the full reckoning of their impact largely hinges on President-elect Joe Biden. His incoming administration will have the power to either keep the restrictions in place, remove them or tighten them further on companies such as Xiaomi Corp., an Apple Inc. competitor hit this week for alleged ties to China’s military -- an allegation it denies.“Biden can’t afford to look soft on China, so may end up getting stuck enforcing any measures Trump puts in place on his way out, regardless of whether they are fully consistent with his own administration’s ideal policy approach,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting, a US-owned firm that helps companies invest in China.Trump’s campaign against Chinese companies accelerated in June, when the Pentagon unveiled a list of Chinese companies it said were effectively controlled by the People’s Liberation Army for the first time under a requirement in a 1999 law. In November, shortly after he lost the Nov. 3 election, Trump banned US investment in Chinese companies named on the list, which climbed to 44 on Thursday with the addition of Xiaomi and eight others.The order said that designated stocks could not be purchased by Americans from Jan. 11, and that holdings by Americans must be fully divested by November when transactions will be frozen. Nearly $12 billion worth of Chinese securities will need to be divested by US investors by the November deadline, Morgan Stanley strategists estimated, using the Jan. 13 version of the list.The New York Stock Exchange this month said it would delist the thinly-traded New York shares of China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp. and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd., the first time an American exchange removed Chinese companies due to tensions between the two countries. In Hong Kong, where the three stocks are primarily listed, China Mobile fell to its lowest price since 2006 and China Telecom tumbled to a low of more than 17 years.Chinese officials dismissed the impact of the NYSE’s restrictions and said it would ultimately hurt U.S. interests, but they also struck a critical note. “Some politicians in the US have been oppressing foreign companies listed in the US,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.Xiaomi SinksThe decision was followed by a series of similar moves from U.S. providers of funds, derivatives and investment products as the ban took effect on Jan. 11. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. delisted about 500 warrants and callable bull/bear contracts in Hong Kong, the world’s largest market for structured products. State Street Corp.’s $13 billion Tracker Fund of Hong Kong bled $470 million in a single day -- the most since it was founded in 1999.On Friday, Xiaomi sank 10% after being named on the military list, the worst day since its Hong Kong debut in July 2018. Other firms on the list include state-owned planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, which is central to China’s goal of competing with Boeing and Airbus.Besides the list of military companies, Trump’s Department of Commerce has maintained a separate but connected list of Chinese firms that need specific permission to access U.S. technology. In December, the department said it was blacklisting chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co. and more than 60 other Chinese companies “to protect US national security.” China National Offshore Oil Corp., the country’s third-biggest oil company, was added to the Entity List on Thursday. It said it noticed the development and would continue to monitor it.‘Grand Bargain’Unless Trump takes action on Xiaomi or other companies placed on the military list before next Tuesday, it will be up to Biden to determine whether to restrict the company from accessing key components from the US While Biden hasn’t tipped his hand on which Trump actions he could rescind, most of the current administration’s tougher stances against China have received bipartisan support in Congress.Kurt Campbell, tipped to become Biden’s Indo-Pacific coordinator, said the administration would initially seek to build consensus with allies on China after dealing with a host of domestic issues, according to the South China Morning Post. He said the two countries could take confidence-building steps, such as reversing tit-for-tat moves on expelling journalists, easing visa restrictions and reopening closed consulates.“It’s possible the sanctions could be lifted in a grand bargain, perhaps as part of a trade agreement that would give the president political cover for easing back on recent actions,” said Nicholas Turner, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson LLP in Hong Kong who specializes in economic sanctions.China RetaliationChina, for its part, isn’t sitting still. The Foreign Ministry on Friday vowed to protect the rights of Chinese companies, with spokesman Zhao Lijian saying Trump’s moves amounted to “unilateralism, double standards and bullying.”Over the past few years, China has enhanced its toolbox to hit back at the US even though it has mostly held fire. It created an “unreliable entities list” and passed a new export control law that could potentially be used to restrict rare earths vital for key technologies. Last week it issued new rules that would allow Chinese courts to punish global companies for complying with foreign sanctions -- a move that could theoretically force businesses to choose between the US and China.Xi has also appeared to abandon hope that relations with the US would improve under Biden, with a renewed push to gain self-sufficiency in key technologies. China’s public, meanwhile, is getting used to the constant barrage and see the US lists “as a certificate of achievement for Chinese companies,” said Chen Xi, an adjunct associate professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University.“The Biden administration won’t be dealing with these issues anytime soon once he is sworn in, because it is beneficial for him to use such lists and sanctions as a bargaining chip with China,” Chen said. “In the long run, Chinese companies will strengthen their self-dependence in core technology, while global firms may find themselves losing an important market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-china-inc-onslaught-leaves-key-decisions-for-biden-101610795013918.html
16-01-2021||World||Pak HC forces govt to remove Imran Khan's aide from PTV chairman's position||The Pakistan Cabinet has removed Naeem Bukhari, a close associate of Prime Minister Imran Khan, as chairman of Pakistan Television (PTV), after the Islamabad High Court barred him from working as the head of the state-run channel, according to media reports on Saturday.Supreme Court lawyer, politician and former TV host Bukhari was appointed as chief of the state broadcaster in November last year, inviting criticism for getting benefit from his closeness to Prime Minister Khan.In an embarrassment to Khan, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday restrained Bukhari from working as the PTV chairman while hearing a set of petitions challenging his appointment, citing it a violation of a 2018 Supreme Court order in a similar case.Justice Minallah had remarked that the Cabinet did not make a clear decision on relaxing the age limit for 65-year-old Bukhari.The Cabinet, through circulation, took a decision in which Bukhari and two other PTV directors were removed from their posts as they were over 65 years, the Dawn News reported, quoting Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry.When asked why the decision was taken in haste and made through circulation instead of convening a formal meeting of the Cabinet, the minister said the government had to take a decision as presently the PTV was without a head and facing a “chaos-like situation”, the report said.The Cabinet also restored Aamer Manzoor as the managing director of PTV, the Geo News reported. Manzoor was removed by the corporation's board of directors on January 1.Barring Bukhari from serving as PTV chairman, the high court had directed the government to move a fresh summary for his appointment and clarifying special age relaxation for him. The court adjourned the hearing for two weeks.While passing the order, the IHC recalled a 2018 Supreme Court decision, which set aside the appointment of Ataul Haq Qasmi as PTV chairman.The apex court in Qasmi's appointment case had ordered the federal government to appoint a full-time managing director of PTV after fulfilling all legal, procedural, and codal formalities strictly in accordance with the law.The court noted that the information ministry had repeated the same mistakes as those made in Qasmi’s case and did not go through the apex court’s judgement before sending the summary to the federal Cabinet.The petition while challenging Bukhari’s appointment pointed out that contrary to the direction of the apex court, the vacancy had not been advertised in the press and the appointment was made without inviting applications for the vacant position.It said the federal cabinet had relaxed the upper age limit for Bukhari, without mentioning plausible reasons in the minutes of the federal cabinet meeting.Bukhari successfully defended Khan in 2017 in a famous case seeking his disqualification from public office for failing to show the source of income for buying an estate in the suburbs of Islamabad. He also led the legal team of Khan in the Panama Papers leak case.Interestingly, Bukhari's appointment was made in apparent haste as the federal Cabinet had in its meeting considered a summary for his appointment but did not endorse his induction as PTV chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-hc-forces-govt-to-remove-imran-khan-s-aide-from-ptv-chairman-s-position-101610793151424.html
16-01-2021||World||End of Merkel era: German CDU to pick new party leader on Saturday||Germany's Christian Democrats elect a new chairman on Saturday, aiming to unite their conservative party behind a leader who they hope can succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor when she steps down after federal elections in September.At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy. Merkel, the continent's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, has said she will not run again.The new CDU chairman will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress, who began voting shortly before 1000 GMT.By tradition, that person is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the conservative bloc is on course to win September's federal ballot.Centrist Armin Laschet, arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are vying for the CDU leadership.However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is the conservative most favoured by voters. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic Health Minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership.Laschet, the first of the three candidates to speak on Saturday, said many voters preferred Merkel over her party."The Chancellor's reputation both here and abroad can be summed up in one word: trust," he told an empty studio from which the congress was livestreamed to delegates.The next leader's task would be to earn that same trust, both for himself and for the party, he said.The three declared CDU candidates all contrast with Merkel.Roettgen, 55, the eloquent chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China. Merz, 65, has targeted European Central Bank policy and is less diplomatic. Laschet, 59, who has polished his international profile, complains Berlin has taken "too long to react" to French calls for European Union reform.Roettgen has suggested that, if elected CDU leader, he could support Soeder, Bavaria's premier, to run as chancellor candidate for their alliance.Soeder, 54, has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late. He plays coy about his ambitions - "My place is in Bavaria" has been his repeated refrain.Carsten Nickel at Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said Soeder's deft move towards the centre ground could make him the ideal candidate to lead a coalition with the ecologist Greens."But of course, the true challenges will arise when liberal and conservative demands clash," Nickel added.Germany is headed for another coalition government in September, with the CDU/CSU likely though not guaranteed to lead it.Opinion polls give Merkel's conservative bloc around 36% of votes, followed by the Greens on around 20% and the Social Democrats on 16%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-of-merkel-era-german-cdu-to-pick-new-party-leader-on-saturday-101610793176680.html

A Washington Post photographer captured a partial, but clear image of the memo carried by My Pillow CEO Michael Lindell.According to the official schedule, Trump was supposed to “work from early in the morning until late in the evening” and “make many calls and have many meetings” on his final Friday in office. Lindell, an avid Trump supporter, reportedly met the US president with notes which included words like “Insurrection Act” and “martial law”.“Insurrection Act now as a result of the assault on the—” reads one of the snippets from notes captured on camera by Post photographer Jabin Botsford, and the next line reads, “martial law if necessary upon the first hint of any—”.@MyPillowUSA CEO Michael Lindell shows off his notes before going into the West Wing at the White House on Friday, Jan 15, 2021 in Washington, DC. pic.twitter.com/AY6AyJNSyEPolitical observers fear that a number of phrases and agenda items on the memo match with the apprehensions about drastic measures which may be ordered by the outgoing president in an attempt to seize the power. Days before the certification of Electoral College and president-elect Joe Biden’s victory, elected officials of District of Columbia were reportedly analysing the risk of a similar threat.According to a Buzzfeed report, the DC attorney general’s office had shared a memo with the 13-member City Council during a closed briefing that focussed on president’s capability to take control of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department by invoking Insurrection Act of 1807. Earlier this week, the United States army sent out a rare message to its community, urging them to uphold their values during this critical period.The army said that the violent riot at the Capitol was an attack on the Congress and the constitutional democracy, reminding all soldiers and civilians to “uphold the army's apolitical standards.” “Democratic elections are a constitutional right, and the military has no role in determining their outcome. The Nation expects all member of the United States Army to follow the law and do the right things the right way, whether we are in or out of uniform,” the letter read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-ally-with-alarming-martial-law-notes-captured-on-camera-at-white-house-101610792353034.html

The list includes individuals, companies, unions and political action committees that contributed through January 10. All gave at least $200, but individual amounts were not disclosed.Other companies on the updated list are United Parcel Service Inc. and Yelp Inc.The committee isn’t required to disclose the full list with amounts to the Federal Election Commission until 90 days after the inauguration, but said it was making voluntary disclosures in the interest of transparency.Other companies previously disclosed include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. Qualcomm Inc., Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc., Boeing Co., Anthem Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Donors came from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with 19% coming from California.Taxpayers pay for the inauguration ceremony itself, but newly-elected presidents raise their own funds to pay for related celebrations that usually include a parade and inaugural balls. Donations to Biden’s committee will go toward dramatically scaled-down ceremonies that have mostly moved to virtual, made-for-television events because of the Covid-19 pandemic and security concerns following the violent riots at the Capitol last week.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris — as well as District of Columbia officials — have asked Americans to stay home on Inauguration Day on Wednesday, and mark the event from there.The National Park Service said Monday that the National Mall, which usually holds the throngs of Americans witnessing an inaugural, will be closed. The Virginia Department of Transportation said several bridges and roads linking that state to Washington would be closed from 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-uber-among-new-corporate-donors-for-joe-biden-inauguration-101610791804284.html

However, two members of the Afghan police force, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media, said Kabul's deputy police chief Mawlana Bayan was wounded in the attack.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing in Kabul.In the southern Helmand province, a suicide car bomber targeted a police compound late Friday, killing one policeman and wounding two others, provincial police spokesman Zaman Hamdard said. The attack took place in Lashkar Gah district on the highway between Helmand and Kandahar provinces.Also in Kandahar province, a suicide car bomber and multiple gunmen attacked an auto workshop belonging to the Afghan intelligence agency on Saturday but inflicted no casualties, provincial governor Rohullah Khanzada said. He said at least four attackers were killed and that an operation to clear the workshop compound was ongoing.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks in Helmand and Kandahar.The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for multiple attacks in the capital in recent months, including on educational institutions that killed 50 people, most of them students. IS has claimed responsibility for rocket attacks in December targeting the major US base in Afghanistan. There were no casualties.The violence comes as the representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government earlier this month resumed peace talks in Qatar. However, the negotiations were off to a slow start as the insurgents continue their attacks on Afghan government forces while keeping their promise not to attack US and NATO troops.The stop-and-go talks are aimed at ending decades of relentless conflict. Frustration and fear have grown over the recent spike in violence, and both sides blame one another.There has also been growing doubt lately over a US-Taliban deal brokered by outgoing President Donald Trump’s administration. That accord was signed last February. Under the deal, an accelerated withdrawal of US troops ordered by Trump means that just 2,500 American soldiers will still be in Afghanistan when President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-insider-attackers-kill-12-afghan-militiamen-official-101610790841754.html
16-01-2021||World||China builds hospital in 5 days after surge in Covid-19 cases||China on Saturday finished building a 1,500-room hospital for Covid-19 patients to fight a surge in infections the government said are harder to contain and that it blamed on infected people or goods from abroad.The hospital is one of six with a total of 6,500 rooms being built in Nangong, south of Beijing in Hebei province, the official Xinhua News Agency said.China had largely contained the coronavirus that first was detected in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019 but has suffered a surge of cases since December.A total of 645 people are being treated in Nangong and the Hebei provincial capital, Shijiazhuang, Xinhua said. A 3,000-room hospital is under construction in Shijiazhuang.Virus clusters also have been found in Beijing and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning in the northeast and Sichuan in the southwest.The latest infections spread unusually fast, the National Health Commission said.“It is harder to handle,” a Commission statement said. “Community transmission already has happened when the epidemic is found, so it is difficult to prevent.”The Commission blamed the latest cases on people or goods arriving from abroad. It blamed “abnormal management” and “inadequate protection of workers” involved in imports but gave no details.“They are all imported from abroad. It was caused by entry personnel or contaminated cold chain imported goods,” said the statement.The Chinese government has suggested the disease might have originated abroad and publicized what it says is the discovery of the virus on imported food, mostly frozen fish, though foreign scientists are skeptical.Nationwide, the Health Commission reported 130 new confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Friday. It said 90 of those were in Hebei.On Saturday, the Hebei government reported 32 additional cases since midnight, the Shanghai news outlet The Paper reported.In Shijiazhuang, authorities have finished construction of 1,000 rooms of the planned hospital, state TV said Saturday. Xinhua said all the facilities are due to be completed within a week.A similar program of rapid hospital construction was launched by the ruling Communist Party at the start of the outbreak last year in Wuhan.More than 10 million people in Shijiazhuang underwent virus tests by late Friday, Xinhua said, citing a deputy mayor, Meng Xianghong. It said 247 locally transmitted cases were found.Meanwhile, researchers sent by the World Health Organization were in Wuhan preparing to investigate the origins of the virus. The team, which arrived Thursday, was under a two-week quarantine but was due to talk with Chinese experts by video link.The team's arrival was held up for months by diplomatic wrangling that prompted a rare public complaint by the head of the WHO.That delay, and the secretive ruling party’s orders to scientists not to talk publicly about the disease, have raised questions about whether Beijing might try to block discoveries that would hurt its self-proclaimed status as a leader in the anti-virus battle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-hospital-in-5-days-after-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101610788481211.html

16-01-2021||World||Massive violence erupts in PoJK over road being built by China||Massive protests and violence erupted in Pakistan-occupied Jammu Kashmir (PoJK) over the Chinese move to build a 33-kilometer road on Friday.Talking to the media, Amjad Ayub Mirza, an exiled activist from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) informed that China is building a 33-kilometer road from Yarkand to PoJK to move its artillery and military personnel in the region."China is now building a road from Yarkand of 33 km wide enough to bring its artillery, military and personnel. Things are gearing up in a precarious way, but PoJK people have risen up to the occasion. There will be more protests in PoJK, and I think Pakistan has lost in PoJK totally," said Mirza in the interview to the media.A general strike has been going on since January 13, and Friday's strike is a continuation of the protest against the People Liberation Army's (PLA) move to build the road in PoJK."This is the second time in the month when we are witnessing a general strike. This time the strike in PoJK is widespread, last time the strike was limited to the Poonch division but now it has gone out of control. The whole of PoJK was under general strike on January 13th and the focal point became Azad Pattan Bridge, which is the entry point between Pakistan and PoJK, that was blocked. Police opened fire, tear gas and lathi-charged and there were clashes after which police had to retreat back to Pakistan," said Mirza."This is a big thing. The police check-post was set alight and yesterday even after the general strike the inertia is still there, and yesterday on the LoC at Mandhor, there were protests spreading like a wildfire across 750 miles Line of Control (LoC). People are fed up with food shortages, there is no flour, no electricity, no clean drinking water, and big cities are full of filth because the system has collapsed," added Mirza.PoJK was already in chaos since the Imran Khan-led government made it the fifth province of Pakistan. People are protesting the decision and every day a procession or stir against the decision is witnessed in the region."Now what is happening that not a single day passes without a protest, sometimes more than one protest in different parts of PoJK. Every single day people are protesting in Gilgit Baltistan, PoJK, and Pakistani media does not report it. International media is not allowed in those areas," informed Mirza.Mirza lamented the fact that the elected government of PoJK is sitting in Islamabad and merry-making while the public in the region is holding a crusade against Chinese incursions in the area."The whole of PoJK government elected after November 15th is sitting in Islamabad, enjoying buffets and parties, having a fun time because it's very cold in Gilgit. The government of Farooq Haider is called 'miscreants' by its people. PoJK has gone out of the hands of Pakistan, it has lost it. There is no sentiment for Pakistan in PoJK," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-violence-erupts-in-pojk-over-road-being-built-by-china-101610788479764.html

16-01-2021||World||US carries out 13th and final execution under Donald Trump administration||The US government carried out the 13th and final federal execution under President Donald Trump's administration early on Saturday, days before his successor Joe Biden takes office with a promise to try to end the death penalty.Dustin Higgs, 48, was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. EST (0623 GMT), the federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement, after a late-night Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the execution to proceed.Since resuming federal executions last year after a 17-year hiatus, Trump, a long-time proponent of capital punishment, has overseen more executions than any US president since the 19th century, including three this week.Higgs was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for his role in the kidnapping and murder of three women on a federal wildlife reserve in Maryland in 1996: Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black and Mishann Chinn.His accomplice, Willis Haynes, who confessed to shooting the women, was sentenced to life in prison in a separate trial.In his final words, Higgs sounded calm and defiant at the Justice Department's death chamber in its prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, a reporter who served as a media witness said."I'd like to say I am an innocent man," he said before lethal injections were administered, mentioning the three women by name. "I did not order the murders."Some of his victims' relatives attended, and a sister of Jackson released a statement, although the Bureau of Prisons did not share the sister's name."When the day is over, your death will not bring my sister and the other victims back," the statement said. "This is not closure, this is the consequence of your actions."Higgs' older sister, Alexa Cave, could be heard sobbing uncontrollably from a separate witness room as Higgs died."THIS IS NOT JUSTICE""The government completed its unprecedented slaughter of 13 human beings tonight by killing Dustin Higgs, a Black man who never killed anyone, on Martin Luther King's birthday," Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs' lawyers, said in a statement."Dustin spent decades on death row in solitary confinement helping others around him, while working tirelessly to fight his unjust convictions."The majority conservative Supreme Court's ruling was consistent with earlier decisions: it had dismissed all orders by lower courts delaying federal executions since they were resumed last year."This is not justice," one of its members, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote in dissent."After waiting almost two decades to resume federal executions, the Government should have proceeded with some measure of restraint to ensure it did so lawfully. When it did not, this Court should have. It has not."The federal government executed 10 people last year, more than three times as many as in the previous six decades, marking the first time that it had conducted more executions than all US states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.A minority of the country's 50 states still carry out executions.Before Trump became president, only three people had been executed by the federal government since 1963.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the execution of Higgs the end of a "cruel, inhumane and lawless" spree by the federal government."President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to end the federal death penalty. He must honor that commitment," Cassandra Stubbs, director of ACLU's Capital Punishment Project said.After a failed triple date with the three women, Higgs and Haynes offered to drive them home but instead took them to the Patuxent Research Refuge. Prosecutors said Higgs gave Haynes a gun and told him to shoot the three women.The disparity in their sentences was grounds for clemency, Higgs's lawyers had said.Higgs and another death row inmate, Corey Johnson, were diagnosed with Covid-19 in December, but on Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected an order by a federal judge in Washington delaying their executions for several weeks to allow their lungs to heal.The Justice Department executed Johnson on Thursday night.Cave, Higgs' sister, said she believed life in prison would have been a more just punishment."They don't have freedom at all in any sense of the word," she said in an interview on Friday, before Higgs was executed. "What purpose does it serve to kill you? It brings nothing back."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-13th-and-final-execution-under-donald-trump-administration-101610788435362.html
16-01-2021||World||Covid-19 effect: UN report finds global migrants fell by 2 million by mid-2020||A new UN report estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic reduced the number of international migrants by 2 million by the middle of 2020 because of border closings and a halt to travel worldwide — an estimated 27% decrease in expected growth.Clare Menozzi, principal author of the report by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Population Division, told a news conference Friday that for the second half of 2020 “we have a sense that it will be probably comparable, if not more so.”She said international migration had been projected to grow by 7 to 8 million between mid-2019 and mid-2020.But the border closures and travel clampdown starting in March, as the pandemic circled the globe, meant zero growth for four months, and an estimated 2 million reduction in the expected number of international migrants, Menozzi said.By August 2020, Population Division Director John Wilmoth noted, “there had been more than 80,000 travel restrictions imposed by 219 countries or territories across the world.”Over the last two decades, growth in the number of international migrants has been robust.Wilmoth said that according to the latest estimates, “the number of international migrants worldwide reached 281 million persons in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000,” They account for just 3.6% of the total global population, he said.Liu Zhenmin, undersecretary-general for economic and social affairs, said, “The report affirms that migration is a part of today’s globalized world and shows how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the livelihoods of millions of migrants and their families” and undermined progress on achieving UN development goals for 2030.The economic fallout from the pandemic is expected to reduce remittances from people working abroad to low- and middle-income countries from $548 billion in 2019 to $470 billion in 2021, according to projections by the World Bank.Wilmoth said the data confirmed that nearly two-thirds of all international migrants were living in high-income countries.According to the report, the United States continued to top the destination list with 51 million international migrants in 2020, representing 18% of the global total. Germany was second, hosting around 16 million international migrants, followed by Saudi Arabia with 13 million, Russia with 12 million and the United Kingdom with 9 million, it said.India topped the list of countries with the largest diasporas in 2020, with 18 million Indians living abroad, followed by Mexico and Russia, each with 11 million outside the country, China with 10 million, and Syria with 8 million, the report said.In 2020, it said, women and girls comprised 48% of all international migrants, and refugees accounted for 12% of international migrants, up from 9.5% in 2000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-effect-un-report-finds-global-migrants-fell-by-2-million-by-mid2020-101610787378872.html
16-01-2021||World||Angela Merkel succession gets serious with vote for party leader||The race to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor will start to take shape when her party elects a new leader on Saturday.Unlike orderly transitions of the past, a botched succession has led to a tight three-way race between long-time Merkel antagonist Friedrich Merz, moderate state leader Armin Laschet and Norbert Roettgen, a foreign-policy expert and former cabinet member. The winner will see the Christian Democratic Union through national elections in September.While the CDU leader usually goes on to be the chancellor candidate for Germany’s conservative bloc, that step isn’t automatic this time. The Bavarian CSU sister party will have an important say in the decision — and Markus Soeder, the Christian Social Union’s leader, is well ahead in polls for chancellor preference. Merkel called on her party to avoid infighting over its leadership in the buildup.“I’d like to see us choose a team to lead our proud people’s party,” the chancellor said in opening remarks to the virtual convention on Friday.The new CDU leader will have a brief window to prove himself until the two parties choose their joint candidate after state elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate on March 14. A strong CDU performance at the polls would enhance its chances of thwarting the Bavarian premier.Merkel’s succession plan was upended nearly a year ago when her protege -- outgoing Chairwoman Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer -- announced she would step aside following a series of gaffes and leadership challenges. Now, as the final term of Europe’s longest-serving leader nears its end, 1,001 Christian Democrats will choose one of three men to chart a course into the future.The meeting has been delayed twice because of the coronavirus pandemic and will be held online to adhere to Germany’s hygiene and distancing rules. That presents the party with a number of challenges, including ensuring delegates -- many in their 70s -- can manage the digital voting process.The CDU is also going to great lengths to ensure systems aren’t hacked and will follow up the online vote with a mail-in ballot -- with the winner being the only option -- to abide by German laws. Any hiccups could spur legal challenges.Neither of the three contenders is likely to get an absolute majority in the first round, meaning there will be a runoff between the two front-runners. A final result is expected as early as noon.The new CDU leader faces a challenging political environment. The Greens were on par with the conservative bloc before the coronavirus crisis, and the far-right Alternative for Germany -- which arose from dissatisfaction with Merkel’s policies -- is nipping at its support. But the conservative bloc maintains a comfortable lead in the polls, thanks to Merkel’s steady leadership and her shift to the center.The outcome is critical far beyond Germany’s borders. The European Union needs the country’s leadership as it seeks to recover from the pandemic, reset trans-Atlantic ties under US President-elect Joe Biden and chart a post-Brexit course.Merz, 65, offers the biggest break with Merkel. The former BlackRock Inc. director advocates for a more economically liberal approach. His divisive rhetoric could turn off many voters, and the Greens -- the most likely coalition partner -- are skeptical.“A CDU under Friedrich Merz would certainly be more shaped by policies that move far away from us and from the center of society,” Robert Habeck, co-chair of the Green party, told reporters this week. His views on capitalism and the economy have “fallen out of sync with time.”Laschet, 59, is a moderate in Merkel’s mold. He was considered the clear favorite after forging an early alliance with Jens Spahn, the up-and-coming health minister. The premier from North Rhine-Westphalia has faltered badly in recent months, but could get votes as a safer choice than Merz and has indicated that he’s open to appointing Soeder as chancellor candidate.Roettgen, 55, was seen as an outsider, but has rallied in recent weeks. A centrist, who was fired from Merkel’s cabinet in 2012, would push a tougher line on Russia and China. He was an outspoken critic of Merkel’s refusal to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from Germany’s 5G wireless networks and has opposed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with Russia. He’s also expressed a willingness to consider alternative candidates for chancellor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-succession-gets-serious-with-vote-for-party-leader-101610787794866.html

16-01-2021||World||England not listening to Johnson’s lockdown orders any more||People across England are about to be hit with a deluge of new government adverts on television, radio and social media containing one blunt demand: Stay at home.It’s a familiar message -- and that may be why the public seems to be shrugging it off.The data shows Britons are far more active during the current third national lockdown than when the first emergency “stay at home” order was given last spring. There’s more traffic on the roads, more people on trains and more shoppers making trips out.Government officials worry too many are flouting the rules as Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges the public to try harder to avoid spreading coronavirus. With the National Health Service buckling under the weight of Covid-19 patients, the UK already has the highest death toll in Europe at more than 87,000.While there are early signs that infection rates are starting to fall in places like London, and one person in 20 has now been vaccinated, officials warn life still might not be back to normal by spring.Images of a state health-care system collapsing would risk inflicting further huge damage to Johnson’s standing, with public confidence in the government’s handling of the crisis already severely dented since it began.Hospital crisis“We are now seeing cancer treatments sadly postponed, ambulances queuing, and intensive care units spilling over into adjacent wards,” Johnson said on Friday. “This is not the time for the slightest relaxation of our national resolve and our individual efforts.”Last week, schools and businesses were shut and people were told to stay home for work if they possibly could, and to avoid all journeys unless they were essential.Despite the crisis, traffic on U.K. roads was still running at 63% of pre-pandemic levels on Jan. 11, government figures showed. That’s almost double the rate at the beginning of the first lockdown in early April, when traffic fell to 35% of normal levels.Public transport use is also up, with four times the number of rail passengers this week than at the start of the spring lockdown. Despite the closure of non-essential stores, more people are out shopping this time, too, according to research firm Springboard.Schools are open only for children of key workers but are reporting much higher attendance levels than in the spring. Latest government figures show that 14% of pupils in state-funded schools were in on Jan. 11, compared to an overall level of just 2% in April.Rule breakersGiven the stark threat facing the country, why are people going out more than they did when the pandemic first hit? Is there more rule-breaking, is the public just bored, or are the rules themselves not tough enough?The picture is not unique to the UK Elsewhere in Europe, people have grown tired of wave after wave of restrictions. What makes England different is that even from the start, the messaging was mixed from a government that was reluctant to curb people’s liberties.In Spain and Italy, which imposed harsh lockdowns from the beginning, entire families became accustomed to living with life-altering restrictions. In Madrid and Milan, everyone wears a mask outside, and children must wear them at school. In London, face coverings outdoors are still optional.Back at the beginning of the pandemic, England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned that citizens would “understandably get fatigued” with the restrictions.But in recent surveys people insist they are still following the rules. Stephen Reicher, a UK government adviser and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews, dismissed the concept of lockdown “fatigue” as a way for the authorities to shift the blame onto the public.“Some of the rules and the messaging around them may be the problem,” he wrote in the British Medical Journal. For one thing, during the summer ministers encouraged people to go back to work and gave them discounts to eat in restaurants.Some of the restrictions do appear to be more relaxed now compared to the start of the first lockdown: Nurseries are open to all children, there are childcare and support bubbles, and people can meet up with someone else for exercise. Restaurants are also open -- albeit only for takeaway meals.Mixed messagesSusan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London and a government adviser, said “having more things open sends a mixed message” and makes people doubt that the country is “at crisis point.”“On the one hand they are saying ‘stay at home,’ on the other hand they are allowing universities, nurseries, places of worship, non-essential businesses to stay open,” she said.But increased activity could also be down to a change in attitude toward the virus some 11 months into the pandemic. Robert Dingwall, professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said people were understandably frightened in the spring but it’s now become “normalized, a routine hazard.”He said that for many people who hadn’t fallen ill with the virus, there was “more and more discrepancy” between their everyday experiences and the government press conferences reporting countless deaths.SacrificeThe Cabinet Office said the government had “set out clear instructions to the public about what they need to do” to suppress the disease and the “public has made enormous sacrifices, to prevent our NHS from becoming overwhelmed and help save lives.”But senior government ministers have confused the picture by offering different versions of the rules. Home Secretary Priti Patel said Thursday that people should exercise alone, even though the rules allow activity with a friend.Johnson himself was criticized for cycling in the Olympic Park in east London, 7 miles away from his Westminster home, despite guidelines saying people should stay in their local areas.In the end, it all comes back to the prime minister. A libertarian at heart, he has struggled from the start with the idea of curbing freedoms. In December he declared it would be “frankly inhuman” to ban people from gathering over Christmas, before being forced to do just that as the virus surged days later.Even now, Johnson can’t quite bring himself to be definitive in his messaging. In a Twitter video on Friday, he addressed people planning to leave their homes to go out this weekend. “Please,” he said. “Really, think twice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-not-listening-to-johnson-s-lockdown-orders-any-more-101610786841888.html
16-01-2021||World||Hong Kong government 'strongly' objects to US congressional report||The Hong Kong government said it "strongly" objects to a US congressional report critical of Beijing's handling of the city, calling the report "biased, politically motivated and not reflecting the truth"."Safeguarding national security through legislation is in line with international practice," the government of the financial hub said in a statement late on Friday.The annual report from the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China this week said that the "one country, two systems" framework in Hong Kong has been "dismantled", severely undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights that the city has long enjoyed.The report says a national security law that Beijing imposed over the summer on the former British colony directly threatens Hong Kong residents' right to due process and their freedoms of expression and association. "The legislation is clearly meant to target, intimidate, and silence Hong Kong's robust civil society," it says.Hong Kong countered that contrary to the erroneous allegations that the law undermines the "one country, two systems" framework, China "has the right to legislate for this matter" under the framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-government-strongly-objects-to-us-congressional-report-101610783401327.html
16-01-2021||World||US slams Beijing for continuous withholding of Covid-19 information||Calling for a transparent and thorough investigation into the origin of Covid-19, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Friday said the pandemic was avoidable adding that Beijing did not reveal vital information about the virus, which would have helped scientists to save the world from the disease.Pompeo, in a statement said the United States has "repeatedly called for" a transparent and thorough investigation into the origin of COVID-19. Understanding the origin of this pandemic is essential for global public health, economic recovery and international security."The Covid-19 pandemic was avoidable. Any responsible country would have invited world health investigators to Wuhan within days of an outbreak. China instead refused offers of help - including from the United States - and punished brave Chinese doctors, scientists and journalists who tried to alert the world to the dangers of the virus," he said."Beijing continues today to withhold vital information that scientists need to protect the world from this deadly virus, and the next one... Until the Chinese Communist Party allows a full and thorough accounting of what happened in Wuhan, it is only a matter of time until China births another pandemic and inflicts it on the Chinese people, and the world," Pompeo added.The top US diplomat added that Washington has "reason to believe" that several researchers inside the WIV [Wuhan Institute of Virology] became sick in autumn 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses."This raises questions about the credibility of WIV senior researcher Shi Zhengli's public claim that there was 'zero infection' among the WIV's staff and students of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-related viruses," Pompeo said.The US Secretary of State accused the WIV not been transparent nor consistent about its work with RaTG13 or other similar viruses, including possible "gain of function"."Despite the WIV presenting itself as a civilian institution, the WIV has collaborated on publications and secret projects with China's military. The WIV has engaged in classified research, including laboratory animal experiments, on behalf of the Chinese military since at least 2017," the top diplomat added.Earlier this week, the international team of experts of the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived in Wuhan to study the origin of the pandemic.Amid this visit, the US Department of State shared some data about the outbreak in a hope that the WHO will press the Chinese authorities to get more information about the deadly virus.Previously, Pompeo said the CCP "has offered not one, not two, but at least three alternative theories for where this began.""They continue to attempt to obfuscate. Everything that we have seen indicates that this began not only inside of China but at Hubei province, Wuhan," he added.Pompeo said there "will be hundreds and hundreds of thousands" more people continue to live in poverty as a direct result of the economic challenges that the 'Wuhan virus' has foisted upon the world.As of Saturday, 7.52 am IST, the Covid-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) reported that the global coronavirus caseload stands at 93,787,372 while the fatalities across the world stand at 2,006,987.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slams-beijing-for-continuous-withholding-of-covid-19-information-101610783455912.html
16-01-2021||World||At 18 million, India has largest diaspora in the world: UN||The Indian diaspora, one of the most “vibrant and dynamic”, is the largest in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland in 2020, the UN has said.The United Arab Emirates, the US and Saudi Arabia host the largest numbers of migrants from India, it said.“India has the largest transnational population in the world. It has the most migrants abroad -- 18 million, which is a significant number and another feature which is very interesting about the Indian migrant population is that they're really distributed all over the globe,” Population Affairs Officer in the Population Division at UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Clare Menozzi told PTI in an interview on Friday.Menozzi said while some transnational populations are really clustered in one country or region, the Indian diaspora is present in all continents and regions -- from the Gulf to Northern America to Australia, UK.“It's a very vibrant” and dynamic diaspora in the world, she said.The report, ‘International Migration 2020 Highlights’, by the Population Division of UN DESA, released on Friday said in 2020, 18 million persons from India were living outside of their country of birth.Other countries with a large diaspora included Mexico and Russia (11 million each), China (10 million) and Syria (8 million).The report said India’s large diaspora is distributed across a number of major countries of destination, with the UAE (3.5 million), the US (2.7 million) and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million) hosting the largest numbers of migrants from India.Other countries hosting large numbers of migrants from India included Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar and the UK.Between 2000 and 2020, the size of the migrant population abroad grew for nearly all countries and areas of the world. India experienced the largest gain during that period at nearly 10 million, followed in order of magnitude by Syria, Venezuela, China and the Philippines.Migration from India is largely motivated by labour and family reasons, Director of Population Division at UN DESA John Wilmoth told reporters at the launch of the report here, adding that forced displacement is a much smaller category (about 10 per cent) in the total.Menozzi said the Indian diaspora is comprised predominantly of persons who are working, but also students and people who moved for family reasons.She said there is a very large presence of migrants who are born in India, in the Gulf countries where they are playing a central role in the economic prosperity of the countries, working in construction, hospitality and care services. The diverse Indian diaspora also includes highly-skilled scientists, engineers and doctors.The US remained by far the largest country of destination of international migrants with 51 million migrants in 2020, equal to 18 per cent of the world’s total.Germany hosted the second largest number of migrants worldwide at around 16 million, followed by Saudi Arabia (13 million), Russia (12 million) and the UK (9 million).The report said preliminary estimates suggest that Covid-19 pandemic may have slowed the growth in the stock of international migrants by around two million by mid-2020, 27 per cent less than the growth expected since mid-2019.The report said growth in the number of international migrants has been robust over the last two decades, reaching 281 million people living outside their country of origin in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000 and 221 million in 2010.Currently, international migrants represent about 3.6 per cent of the world’s population.Between 2000 and 2020, the number of migrants grew in 179 countries or areas. Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the US gained the largest number of migrants during that period. By contrast, in 53 countries or areas, the number of international migrants declined between 2000 and 2020. Armenia, India, Pakistan, Ukraine and Tanzania were among the countries that experienced the most pronounced declines.In many cases, the declines resulted from the old age of the migrant populations or the return of refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin.In terms of regional migration corridors, between 2000 and 2020, some regional migration corridors grew very rapidly. The corridor Central and Southern Asia to Northern Africa and Western Asia grew the most, with 13 million migrants added between 2000 and 2020; more than tripling in size."The majority of that increase resulted from labour migration from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka to the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),” the report said.It noted that while it is too soon to understand the full extent, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 may have slowed the growth of this regional migration corridor.In many GCC countries, thousands of migrant workers in the construction, hospitality, retail and transportation sectors lost their jobs due to the pandemic and were required to return home.The report said according to World Bank projections, the Covid-19 pandemic may reduce the volume of remittances sent to low-and middle-income countries from USD 548 billion in 2019 to USD 470 billion in 2021, a decline of 14 per cent.Menozzi said India is the main country of recipient of remittances worldwide and in 2019 received USD 83 billion in remittances from its diaspora. The World Bank projects that in 2020, the amount will decline by around 9 per cent to about USD 76 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-18-million-india-has-largest-diaspora-in-the-world-un-101610780174277.html
16-01-2021||World||Biden announces plan to vaccinate 100 mn Americans in his 1st 100 days in office||US President-elect Joe Biden has announced an ambitious goal of inoculating 100 million Americans with Covid-19 vaccines in the first 100 days of his administration, noting that the vaccine rollout in the country, the worst hit by the pandemic, has been a "dismal failure."Ahead of his inauguration on January 20, Biden on Friday held a briefing with his team on addressing the major health crisis that has engulfed the nation for nearly a year now.The US is the worst-affected country in the world with more than 23,523,000 Covid-19 infections and 391,955 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.During his election campaign, Biden, a Democrat, made tackling Covid-19 and the economic hardships it had put on Americans a core pitch to voters.“The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure thus far and in today's briefing we discussed five things, five things we will do in an attempt to turn things around, five things to turn frustration into motivation, five things to help us meet our goal of 100 million shots by the end of our first 100 days in office. Some wonder if we are reaching too far for that goal. Is it achievable? It's a legitimate question to ask,” Biden told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware.“Let me be clear; I am convinced we can get it done, and this is the time to set big goals to pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is literally at stake. First, we will immediately work with states to open up vaccinations to more priority groups,” he said.Biden said that the process of establishing priority groups is driven by science, but the problem is the implementation has been too rigid and confusing.“If you were to ask most people today, they couldn't tell you who exactly is getting vaccinated. What they do know is there are tens of millions of doses of vaccine sitting unused in freezers around the country while people who want and need the vaccine can't get it,” he said.Exuding confidence, Biden said that his administration will fix the problem by encouraging states to allow more people to get vaccinated beyond healthcare workers and move through those groups as quickly as they think they can. That includes anyone 65 years or older, a population that has accounted for over 80 per cent of the deaths to date.“We also have to continue vaccinating frontline essential workers like educators, first responders, grocery store workers, et cetera. It won't mean that everyone in this group will get vaccinated immediately as the supply is not where it needs to be, but it will mean that vaccines become available--as they become available, it will reach more people who need them, will reach out and get the vaccine used,” he asserted.Secondly, more vaccination sites would be added.“That is where we are going to harness the full resources of the federal government to establish thousands of community vaccination centres. On my first day in office, I will instruct the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to be again setting up the first of these centres. By the end of our first month in office we will have 100 federally supported centres across the nation that will ultimately vaccinate millions of people,” he said.Within the first month, the administration is going to deploy mobile clinics moving from community to community that will partner with community health centres and local primary-care doctors to offer vaccines to hard-hit and hard-to-reach communities in cities, small towns and in rural communities. And to staff up these centres, the US will mobilise thousands of clinical and non-clinical professionals."The third change we are going to make is we are going to fully activate the pharmaceutic--the pharmacies across the country to get the vaccination to more arms as quickly as possible."Millions of Americans now turn to their local pharmacies every day for their medicines, flu shots, and much more. We are going to immediately start a new major effort working directly with both independent and chain pharmacies to get Americans vaccinated," he said.This programme will expand beyond access in neighbourhoods across the country so that people can make an appointment and get shot, conveniently show up at a particular time and get it done quickly, he said.Biden said his administration is going to use the full strength of the federal government to ramp up supply of the vaccines.Biden said he will use the Defense Production Act to work with private industry to accelerate the making of materials needed to supply and administer the vaccine from the tubes and syringe--and syringes to protective equipment.He alleged that the outgoing Trump administration's policy of holding back close to half the supply of the vaccines available did not make sense.“Our administration will release the vast majority of the vaccines when they're available so more people can get vaccinated weekly while still retaining a small reserve for any unseen shortage or delays,” he said.He said his administration will always be "honest and transparent about where we stand, both the good news as well as the bad. We're going to make sure state and local officials know how much supply they'll be getting and when they can expect to get it so they can plan.""Right now, we're hearing that they can't plan because they don't know how much supply of vaccines they can expect at what time frame. That stops when we're in office,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-announces-plan-to-vaccinate-100-mn-americans-in-his-1st-100-days-in-office-101610778581340.html

16-01-2021||World||Joe Biden says we'll 'manage the hell' out of feds' Covid-19 response||President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to boost supplies of coronavirus vaccine and set up new vaccination sites to meet his goal of 100 million shots in 100 days. It's part of a broader COVID strategy that also seeks to straighten out snags in testing and ensure minority communities are not left out.“Some wonder if we are reaching too far,” Biden said Friday. “Let me be clear, I'm convinced we can get it done.”The real payoff, Biden said, will come from uniting the nation in a new effort grounded in science.Biden spoke a day after unveiling a $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan” to confront the virus and provide temporary support for a shaky economy. About $400 billion of the plan is focused on measures aimed at controlling the virus. Those range from mass vaccination centers to more sophisticated scientific analysis of new strains and squads of local health workers to trace the contacts of infected people.“You have my word: We will manage the hell out of this operation,” Biden declared. He underscored a need for Congress to approve more money and for people to keep following basic precautions, such as wearing masks, avoiding gatherings and frequently washing their hands.Throughout the plan, there’s a focus on ensuring that minority communities that have borne the brunt of the pandemic are not shortchanged on vaccines and treatments.A key challenge for Biden and the nation: Vaccines are in too-short supply.Biden said he would use the Defense Production Act, a Cold War-era law, to boost vaccine supplies and work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up 100 vaccination centers around the country by the end of his first month in office.“Almost a year later, we’re still far from back to normal. The honest truth is this: Things will get worse before they get better," he said Friday, as US deaths climbed closer to 400,000. The global toll has now reached 2 million.Biden seconded the Trump administration's call earlier this week for states to start vaccinating more seniors, reaching those 65 and older as well as younger people with certain health problems. Until now states have been focused on inoculating health care workers, and some are starting to vaccinate people 75 and older. Relatively few are providing shots to people between 65 and 75.Another carryover from the Trump administration plan: Biden said he intends to mobilize local pharmacies to administer vaccines.“Is it achievable?" he asked. "It’s a legitimate question to ask. Let me be clear. I’m convinced we can get it done.”In fact, Dr. Leana Wen, a public health expert and emergency physician, said the president-elect should aim higher.“At this point, mass vaccination is our last and best chance to restoring normalcy,” she said. “There should be no expenses spared in the vaccine rollout. A hundred million in 100 days needs to be seen as only a start."Two medical groups, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Group, said Friday evening they “strongly support” the Biden plan. The strategy “will be vital to ending the impacts of Covid-19” in the US, the groups said.As Biden spoke, some governors blasted the Trump administration for what at least one said was “deception” in suggesting earlier this week that a reserve of vaccine doses was ready to ship, augmenting supplies. An administration official said states have still not ordered all of the doses allocated to them, and called it a problem with states' expectations.Biden committed to better communication with the states, to avoid such surprises. His plan calls for the federal government to fully reimburse states that mobilize their National Guards to help distribute vaccines.Biden's proposal comes as a divided nation is in the grip of the pandemic’s most dangerous wave yet. “We remain in a very dark winter,” he said.The political outlook for the legislation remains unclear, although a powerful business lobbying group, the US Chamber of Commerce, welcomed its focus on controlling the pandemic.“This is not a political issue,” Biden said. “This is about saving lives. I know it’s become a partisan issue, but what a stupid, stupid thing to happen.”Biden has long held that economic recovery is inextricably tied to control of the coronavirus.Under Biden's multipronged strategy, about $20 billion would be allocated for a more disciplined focus on vaccination, on top of some $8 billion already approved by Congress. Biden has called for setting up mass vaccination centers and sending mobile units to hard-to-reach areas.On Friday, he announced former FDA chief David Kessler as his chief science officer for the vaccine drive. Kessler has been advising Biden as a co-chair of his advisory board on the coronavirus pandemic. A pediatrician and attorney, he has emphasized a need to ease public concerns about the safety of the vaccines.With the backing of Congress and the expertise of private and government scientists, the Trump administration delivered two highly effective vaccines and more are on the way. Yet a month after the first shots were given, the nation’s vaccination campaign is off to a slow start with about 12.3 million doses administered out of more than 31 million delivered, or 39%.About 10.6 million individuals have received first or second doses, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the American Hospital Association estimates that 246 million must be vaccinated to reach widespread or “herd” immunity by the summer. Vaccines currently available require two shots to be fully effective.Biden has called the vaccine rollout “a dismal failure so far."“We need to be getting to more than 3 million vaccinations a day, rapidly,” said Wen.Biden's plan also would provide $50 billion to expand testing, which is seen as key to reopening most schools by the end of the new administration's first 100 days. About $130 billion would be allocated to help schools reopen without risking further contagion.The plan would fund the hiring of 100,000 public health workers, to focus on encouraging people to get vaccinated and on tracing the contacts of those infected with the coronavirus. The Biden administration also plans to launch a public education campaign to overcome doubts about vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-we-ll-manage-the-hell-out-of-feds-covid-19-response-101610775423634.html
16-01-2021||World||Amazon, Uber among new corporate donors to Biden inauguration||Amazon.com Inc., United Airlines and Uber Technologies are among companies that made new contributions to President-elect Joe Biden’s inaugural ceremonies, according to a new disclosure posted by the Biden Presidential Inaugural Committee.The inaugural committee disclosed the names of 3,184 additional donors on Friday night, after making its first disclosure of 959 donors last Saturday. The list includes individuals, companies, unions and political action committees that contributed through Jan. 10. All gave at least $200, but individual amounts were not disclosed.Other companies on the updated list are United Parcel Service Inc. and Yelp Inc.The committee isn’t required to disclose the full list with amounts to the Federal Election Commission until 90 days after the inauguration, but said it was making voluntary disclosures in the interest of transparency.Other companies previously disclosed include Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. Qualcomm Inc., Comcast Corp., Charter Communications Inc., Boeing Co., Anthem Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.Donors came from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with 19% coming from California.Taxpayers pay for the inauguration ceremony itself, but newly-elected presidents raise their own funds to pay for related celebrations that usually include a parade and inaugural balls. Donations to Biden’s committee will go toward dramatically scaled-down ceremonies that have mostly moved to virtual, made-for-television events because of the Covid-19 pandemic and security concerns following the violent riots at the Capitol last week.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris — as well as District of Columbia officials — have asked Americans to stay home on Inauguration Day on Wednesday, and mark the event from there.The National Park Service said Monday that the National Mall, which usually holds the throngs of Americans witnessing an inaugural, will be closed. The Virginia Department of Transportation said several bridges and roads linking that state to Washington would be closed from 6am Tuesday to 6am Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-uber-among-new-corporate-donors-to-biden-inauguration-101610770911828.html
16-01-2021||World||New York prosecutors interview Michael Cohen about Trump finances||New York prosecutors conducted an hour-long interview Thursday of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, asking a range of questions about Trump's business dealings, according to three people familiar with the meeting.The interview focused in part on Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank, his biggest and longest standing creditor, according to the three people, who weren't authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.The interview, at least the second of Cohen by the Manhattan district attorney's office, comes amid a long-running grand jury investigation into Trump's business dealings. District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. has been waging a protracted legal battle to get access to the president's tax records.The US Supreme Court is expected to rule on Trump’s request for a stay and a further appeal after he leaves office Jan. 20.The New York investigation is one of several legal entanglements that are likely to intensify as Trump loses power — and any immunity from prosecution he might have as a sitting president — as he departs the White House.The Manhattan-based grand jury has been continuing its work despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has curtailed many court operations.The Republican president also faces a civil investigation, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, into whether Trump’s company lied about the value of its assets to get loans or tax benefits. Cohen also is cooperating with that inquiry.He previously told Congress that Trump often inflated the value of his assets when dealing with lenders or potential business partners, but deflated them when it benefited him for tax purposes.The White House declined to comment. A message seeking comment was sent to Cohen's attorney.Trump has repeatedly called the investigations by Vance and James, both Democrats, a baseless political “witch hunt."Vance has declined to provide specific details about the investigation, but pointed to news reports of what prosecutors described as “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization" in court filings.Among the reports Vance’s office referenced in court filings was a 2017 article about Ladder Capital, a commercial mortgage lender that made more than $250 million in loans to the Trump Organization that were secured by Trump properties. Jack Weisselberg, the son of Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, is a director of Ladder Capital.Subpoenas issued in the investigation cover 11 entities engaged in business dealings as far away as Europe and Dubai, according to an appeals court judge speaking at a hearing on the matter.Cohen, who is serving the remainder of a federal prison sentence on home confinement, has been asked by investigators to examine certain Trump Organization documents and to provide other details about its corporate structure, the people familiar with the matter said. Cohen pleaded guilty to evading taxes, lying to Congress and facilitating campaign finance crimes.Germany-based Deutsche Bank continued to do business with Trump even after he defaulted in 2008 on a loan for his Chicago hotel and condo development. Trump sued the bank and others whom he blamed for his inability to repay.But Deutsche Bank’s private banking division continued to lend to Trump, including $125 million to finance the purchase and renovation of his Doral golf resort in 2012, according to previous disclosures.Deutsche Bank declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-prosecutors-interview-michael-cohen-about-trump-finances-101610770943828.html
16-01-2021||World||Aftershock rocks Indonesia quake zone as search continues||An aftershock hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Saturday as rescue workers searched for people trapped under rubble after an earthquake killed at least 45 people, injured hundreds and sent thousands fleeing in terror.Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said no damage or casualties were reported from the Magnitude 5.0 aftershock in the West Sulawesi districts of Mamuju and Majene a day after the Magnitude 6.2 earthquake.Agency head Doni Monardo told Kompas TV the search continued for victims who could still be trapped under rubble.More than 820 people were injured and about 15,000 people have been evacuated, the agency said. Some have sought refuge in the mountains, while others went to cramped evacuation centres, witnesses said.Friday's quake and its aftershocks damaged more than 300 homes and two hotels, as well as flattening a hospital and the office of a regional governor, where authorities told Reuters several people had been trapped.Access to the neighbouring city of Makassar remains cut off, Arianto Ardi of the search and rescue agency in Mamuju told Reuters, adding that the search will focus on the hotels.Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told Metro TV on Saturday that another quake was possible and could reach a magnitude of 7.0, urging residents to keep out of the water because of the tsunami risk.The earthquake magnitude scale is logarithmic; a one-point increase means it is 10 times bigger. The difference in energy released is even greater. Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes.In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aftershock-rocks-indonesia-quake-zone-as-search-continues-101610771403084.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump will leave White House before Biden inauguration, may go to his golf club||By the time Joe Biden is sworn in as the 46th US president Wednesday, his scandal-tainted predecessor Donald Trump will already be far away, having helicoptered out of the White House a last time earlier that morning, an official said Friday.Trump will be the first president in a century and a half to snub the inauguration of his successor.An official who asked not to be identified said Trump would go to his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, which is his legal residence and will become home after the White House.He is expected to be out of town well before Biden is sworn in on the steps of the Capitol building at exactly noon.After spending more than two months trying to overturn the results of the November election, pushing false conspiracy theories about fraud, Trump's presence had not been expected at the inauguration.The final straw came on January 6 when Trump gathered a huge crowd of supporters on the National Mall and once more claimed that they had to fight to stop a fraudulent election. A mob then stormed Congress, halting proceedings underway to certify Biden's win.For longer than anyone can remember, outgoing presidents have stood by their replacement on the Capitol steps, watching them take the oath -- and in so doing showing visible support for the peaceful transfer of power.Trump, who was impeached for a record second time in the wake of the Congress storming, has also broken with more discreet protocol by refusing to invite Biden and his wife Jill Biden to the White House for a traditional cup of tea in the Oval Office.On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence did make the gesture of telephoning his incoming counterpart Kamala Harris, a source said.Although this came only five days before inauguration day -- and more than two months after the election -- The New York Times said Pence offered his congratulations and belated assistance to Harris, describing the exchange as "gracious and pleasant."Recriminations over the January 6 attack continued to reverberate on Friday, however, when Trump's health secretary criticized "the actions and rhetoric following the election."In a letter confirming he would step down when Biden takes office on January 20, Alex Azar called the violence "an assault on our democracy and on the tradition of peaceful transitions of power," urging Trump to condemn all violence and help ensure a smooth handover to Biden.- Inauguration like no other -Trump's extraordinary exit adds to the nervous atmosphere around an inauguration that was already set to be like no other.In the wake of the Congress attack, thousands of National Guard troops have taken up position around central Washington. And even before the security nightmare, organizers had been forced by Covid-19 safety measures to nix the traditional big crowds and long guest lists.For Biden, the subdued ceremonies will quickly be followed by a mammoth To Do list. His administration faces multiple crises on day one, including the stumbling national Covid vaccination project, a precarious economic recovery and Trump's looming impeachment trial in the Senate.At the same time, Biden will have to cajole the Senate into rapidly confirming his cabinet appointees, allowing him to form a government and bring stability back to the country.Incoming White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday that the Senate is fully capable of juggling the impeachment trial along with the urgent confirmations."The Senate can do its constitutional duty while continuing to conduct the business of the people," she said."Our expectation and hope and belief is that we need to walk and chew gum at the same time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-will-leave-white-house-before-biden-inauguration-may-go-to-his-golf-club-101610768833354.html
16-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un’s new missile could be an attempt to get Joe Biden's attention||Kim Jong Un has rolled out a lot of new missiles in recent months, including at least one more this week. The next step is for him to fire them into the air to get President-elect Joe Biden’s attention.The North Korean leader paraded a new submarine-launched ballistic missile through central Pyongyang Thursday as part of a military pageant to mark the completion of more than a week of ruling party meetings. The Pukguksong-5 -- the largest in an growing line of solid-fueled nuclear missiles -- moves Kim closer to a opening a maritime front in his strategic struggle with the US.The new missile comes only four months after Kim unveiled a smaller version of the same rocket at a similar military parade in October. That event also featured a massive new intercontinental ballistic missile, which is believed to be the world’s largest road-mobile weapon of its sort.The problem for Kim is that many of these new systems haven’t been proven, diminishing their value as a deterrent against an American attack. If Kim wants to achieve the ambitious nuclear program he outlined at Workers’ Party gatherings this month, he’ll need to start launching soon.“I am certain we will see tests in the near future,” said Melissa Hanham, a non-proliferation expert and an affiliate with the Stanford Center for International Security and Cooperation.North Korea hasn’t fired off an ICBM since November 2017, when Kim moved to open communications with US President Donald Trump. Kim has already declared an end to the testing freeze he put in place to facilitate talks with Trump and earlier this week reaffirmed that the US was his “biggest main enemy.”The next launches may illustrate how rapidly North Korea has developed its nuclear delivery systems over the past few years, despite tough international sanctions and Trump’s three face-to-face meetings with Kim. The provocations may also help pressure the Biden administration into making concessions.North Korea tested President Barack Obama with the launch of a long-range rocket and a nuclear device within months after he took power in 2009. He welcomed Trump with a series of tests culminating with the launch of an ICBM that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to the entire US.“The Biden administration need not accept this as a done deal,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “An early signal from the US. could stay Kim’s hand, but Biden would have to offer a clearly valuable inducement, like the prospect of sanctions relief.”The Biden administration has indicated it may be ready to ease sanctions in exchange for steps by Kim to freeze, cap and wind down his atomic arsenal. This could help Kim fix an economy that has only gotten smaller since he took power about a decade ago.Kim has vowed never to surrender the nuclear arsenal he views as key to his regime’s survival. Each new missile helps bolster his argument that the US. should drop its demands for “final, fully verified denuclearization” and accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.Earlier this month, Kim outlined plans for smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, improving the ability to strike strategic targets within 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) -- a thinly veiled allusion to the US. He said he was seeking to develop solid-fuel ICBMs and a nuclear-powered submarine.North Korean state media released photos and footage from the latest parade Friday. Kim could further signal his intentions at a parliament session scheduled to being Sunday in Pyongyang.Koh Yu-hwan, president of the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said North Korea may hold off on testing the Pukguksong missiles for now. “Kim may just want to send a message to Washington that his weapons would only advance if the US. continues to press him,” Koh said, saying the goal was “opening up the possibility of talks with the new administration.”Kim’s latest SLBMs would require a vessel with more capacity than his only current missile submarine, the Gorae, said Joseph Dempsey, a London-based research associate for the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“The considerably wider body diameter of the Pukguksong-3, -4 and now -5 raises the question if any of these missiles could be fitted on this boat, even with extensive modification,” he said. North Korea is building at least one other ballistic missile submarine, he said.Although it could be years before Kim deploys a bigger submarine, the program will require lots of provocative tests. North Korea may conduct ejection tests of the new Pukguksong-5 on land before launching it off a submerged barge and finally from a submarine, said Hanham, of the Stanford Center.Moreover, the weapons move North Korea closer to developing solid-fueled ICBMs, which can be stored full and moved quickly to evade a counterattack. The diameter of Kim’s latest Pukguksong missiles appear to have reached the key 1.7 meter (5.6 feet) threshold needed to build one capable of crossing the Pacific, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.“We’ve been saying for a year that North Korea could test a solid-propellant ICBM in 2021,” Lewis said. “I would expect more missile tests in the coming year, unless there is some dramatic change in the relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-new-missile-could-be-an-attempt-to-get-joe-biden-s-attention-101610767595319.html

Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas.There were reports of many people trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes and buildings.In a video released by the national disaster agency, a girl stuck in the wreckage of a house cried out for help and said she heard the sound of other family members also trapped. “Please help me, it hurts,” the girl told rescuers, who replied that they desperately wanted to help her.The rescuers said an excavator was needed to save the girl and others trapped in collapsed buildings. Other images showed a severed bridge and damaged and flattened houses.The quake damaged a hospital and patients were moved to an emergency tent. Rescuers struggled to extract seven patients and staff who were trapped under rubble. After several hours, an excavator came to help and the rescuers retrieved four survivors and three bodies.Another video showed a father crying, asking for help to save his children buried under their toppled house. “They are trapped inside, please help,” he cried. Thousands of people were evacuated to temporary shelters.The quake was centred 36km south of West Sulawesi’s Mamuju district, at a depth of 18km. The disaster agency said the death toll climbed to 42 as rescuers in Mamuju retrieved 34 bodies trapped in the rubble of collapsed homes and buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/midnight-quake-kills-42-in-indonesia-101610767241423.html
16-01-2021||World||Damaged roads, lack of gear hinder Indonesia quake rescue||Damaged roads and bridges, power blackouts and lack of heavy equipment on Saturday hampered Indonesia's rescuers after a 6.2 magnitude earthquake left at least 42 dead and hundreds injured on Sulawesi island.Operations were focused on about 10 locations in the hardest-hit city of Mamuju, where people are still believed trapped following Friday's nighttime quake, said Saidar Rahmanjaya, who heads the local search and rescue agency.Cargo planes carrying food, tents, blankets and other supplies from Jakarta landed late Friday for distribution in temporary shelters. Still, thousands spent the night in the open fearing aftershocks and a possible tsunami.The National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s spokesperson Raditya Jati said 34 people were killed in Mamuju and nearly 200 hospitalized.The nearby district of Majene was also ravaged, leaving at least eight dead and more than 630 injured, he said.At least 300 houses in Majene were damaged and about 15,000 people moved to shelters. Many survivors said that aid has not reached them yet due to damaged roads and disrupted communications.The quake set off landslides in three locations and blocked a main road connecting Mamuju to Majene. Power and phone lines were down in many areas.Mamuju, the capital of West Sulawesi province with nearly 75,000 people, was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings. A governor office building was almost flattened by the quake and a shopping mall reduced to a crumpled hulk. A large bridge collapsed and patients with drips laid on folding beds under tarpaulin tents outside one of the damaged hospitals.Two hospitals in the city were damaged and others overwhelmed.Two ships headed to the devastated areas from the nearby cities of Makassar and Balikpapan with rescuers and equipment, including excavators.State-owned firm AirNav Indonesia, which oversees aircraft navigation, said the quake did not cause significant damage to the Mamuju airport runway or control tower.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said Friday that he instructed his Cabinet ministers and disaster and military officials to coordinate the response.In a telegram sent by the Vatican on behalf of Pope Francis, the pontiff expressed “heartfelt solidarity with all those affected by this natural disaster.”The pope was praying for “the repose of the deceased, the healing of the injured and the consolation of all who grieve.” Francis also offered encouragement to those continuing search and rescue effects, and he invoked “the divine blessings of strength and hope.”Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is frequently hit by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Palu on Sulawesi island set off a tsunami and caused soil to collapse in a phenomenon called liquefaction. More than 4,000 people died, many of the victims buried when whole neighborhoods were swallowed in the falling ground.A massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia in December 2004 triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries._____Karmini reported from Jakarta, Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/damaged-roads-lack-of-gear-hinder-indonesia-quake-rescue-101610766737116.html

China confirms on January 11 its first death in Wuhan from an illness which will be named Covid-19.- Wuhan cut off -On January 23 Wuhan is placed under quarantine and cut off from the world. Countries start to repatriate their citizens from China.France reports the first death confirmed outside Asia, a Chinese tourist, on February 15.- 'Pandemic' -By March 6 more than 100,000 cases have been recorded around the world.Northern Italy is locked down, quickly followed by the rest of the country.On March 11 the WHO says Covid-19 is a pandemic.Global stock markets crash.Governments and central banks roll out massive economic support measures.- Europe in lockdown -Spain (March 14) and France (March 17) order their populations to stay at home.

16-01-2021||World||US imposes fresh sanctions on Iran in final days of Trump presidency||The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on companies in Iran, China and the United Arab Emirates for doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and on three Iranian entities over conventional arms proliferation.They are the latest in a series of measures aimed at stepping up pressure on Tehran in the waning days of President Donald Trump's administration, which ends on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington had sanctioned seven companies, including Chinese-based Jiangyin Mascot Special Steel Co and UAE-based Accenture Building Materials, and two people for shipping steel to or from Iran.He said Iran's Marine Industries Organization, Aerospace Industries Organization and the Iran Aviation Industries Organization had also been blacklisted over conventional arms proliferation.In a statement later on Friday, Pompeo said he was also increasing the scope of metals-related sanctions against Iran administered by the State Department.Those who knowingly transfer 15 materials which the State Department says are used in connection with Iran's nuclear, military or ballistic missile programs, including certain types of aluminum and steel, would be subject to sanctions, he said.During his four years in office, Trump has tried to force Tehran back into talks over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its activities in the Middle East. Saying the agreement did not go far enough, Trump in 2018 quit an Iran nuclear deal, which Tehran struck with world powers in 2015 to rein in its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief.Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who will succeed Trump on Wednesday, has said he will return to the 2015 nuclear pact if Iran resumes strict compliance with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-fresh-sanctions-on-iran-in-final-days-of-trump-presidency-101610763312389.html
16-01-2021||World||WHO stops short of advising proof of Covid-19 shots for travel||The World Health Organization on Friday refrained from advising proof of Covid-19 vaccination or immunity as a condition for international travel, citing "critical unknowns" regarding their efficacy in reducing transmission and limited availability.The WHO's Emergency Committee, composed of 19 independent experts, held its sixth meeting in a year as the global death toll from the pandemic reached two million among more than 90 million cases.The experts issued a series of recommendations, which WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accepted and sent to the U.N. agency's 194 member states, a statement said."At the present time, do not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry as there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission and limited availability of vaccines," the WHO panel said."Proof of vaccination should not exempt international travellers from complying with other travel risk reduction measures."Didier Houssin, panel chairman, said that there was currently a "great disparity" among countries about testing, quarantines and travel bans, leading to the world being "a little bit paralysed, a little bit confused".Its advice to WHO was to "take a strong lead in order to produce clear guidance and scientifically based guidance about how best to facilitate and permit the circulation of people in a safe manner by air, by sea", he told a news conference.Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said: "What the committee is saying is 'at this present time', scientific evidence is not complete, there isn't enough vaccine and therefore we shouldn't do that now and create an unnecessary restriction to travel."So we are trying to protect the travel space and ensure economies are not entirely isolated," he added.Britain is tightening border controls from Monday to block new variants of Covid-19, suspending all "travel corridor" arrangements that had meant arrivals from some countries did not require quarantine.The WHO panel urged countries to monitor virus variants such as those identified by Britain and South Africa to assess the effects on the efficacy of vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tests.It called for promoting technology transfer to low- and middle-income countries with the potential capacity to accelerate global production of Covid-19 vaccines.Further research was also needed on "critical unknowns about Covid-19 vaccination efficacy on transmission, duration of protection against severe disease and asymptomatic infection" as well as the duration of immunity following infection or vaccination, and protection after a single dose, the panel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-stops-short-of-advising-proof-of-covid-19-shots-for-travel-101610765214818.html
16-01-2021||World||Post US Capitol riots, Podcasts help extremists get their message out||Major social platforms have been cracking down on the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories in the leadup to the presidential election, and expanded their efforts in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. But Apple and Google, among others, have left open a major loophole for this material: Podcasts.Podcasts made available by the two Big Tech companies let you tune into the world of the QAnon conspiracy theory, wallow in President Donald Trump's false claims of a stolen election and bask in other extremism. Accounts that have been banned on social media for election misinformation, threatening or bullying, and breaking other rules also still live on as podcasts available on the tech giants’ platforms.Conspiracy theorists have peddled stolen-election fantasies, coronavirus conspiracies and violent rhetoric. One podcaster, RedPill78, called the Capitol siege a “staged event” in a Jan. 11 episode of Red Pill News. The day before the Capitol riot, a more popular podcast, X22 Report, spoke confidently about a Trump second term, explained that Trump would need to “remove” many members of Congress to further his plans, and said “We the people, we are the storm, and we’re coming to DC.”Both are available on Apple and Google podcast platforms.Podcasting “plays a particularly outsized role” in propagating white supremacy, said a 2018 report from the Anti-Defamation League. Many white supremacists, like QAnon adherents, support Trump. Podcasting’s an intimate, humanizing mode of communication that lets extremists expound on their ideas for hours at a time, said Oren Segal of ADL’s Center on Extremism.Elsewhere on social media, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been cracking down on accounts amplifying unfounded QAnon claims that Trump is fighting deep state enemies and cannibals operating a child-sex trafficking ring. A major talk radio company, Cumulus, told its hosts to tone down rhetoric about stolen elections and violent uprisings or risk termination, although it's not clear what impact that dictate has had.Google-owned YouTube axed “Bannon's War Room,” a channel run by Trump loyalist Steve Bannon on Jan. 8 after he spread false election claims and called for the beheading of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease expert. But podcast versions of Bannon's show live on at Apple and Google. Spotify took it down in November, according to one of its hosts.“Podcasts filled with hatred and incitement to violence should not be treated any differently than any other content," Segal said. "If you’re going to take a strong stance against hate and extremism in the platform in any way, it should be all-inclusive.”Apple, Spotify and Google curate lists of top podcasts and recommend them to users. Apple and Spotify are the dominant players in the U.S., with other players far behind, said Dave Zohrob, CEO of the podcast analytics firm Chartable. Despite its name recognition, Google remains a tiny presence.Spotify said it takes down podcasts that violate its policies against hate speech, copyright violations or break any laws, using “algorithmic and human detection measures” to identify violations. Apple’s guidelines prohibit content that is illegal or promotes violence, graphic sex or drugs or is “otherwise considered obscene, objectionable, or in poor taste.” Apple did not reply to repeated questions about its content guidelines or moderation.Google declined to explain the discrepancy between what’s available on YouTube and what’s on Google Podcasts, saying only that its podcast service “indexes audio available on the web” much the way its search engine indexes web pages. The company said it removes podcasts from its platform “in very rare circumstances, largely guided by local law.”X22 Report and Bannon’s War Room were No. 20 and No. 32 on Apple's list of top podcasts on Friday. (Experts say that list measures a podcast's momentum rather than total listeners.) X22 Report said in October that it was suspended by YouTube and Spotify and last week by Twitter. It's no longer available on Facebook, either. It is supported by ads for products such as survivalist food, unlicensed food supplements and gold coins, which run before and during the podcasts.The website for Red Pill News said YouTube banned its videos in October and that a Twitter suspension followed. The podcast is available on Apple and Google, but not Spotify.Several QAnon proponents affected by the crackdown sued YouTube in October, calling its actions a “massive de-platforming.” Among the plaintiffs are X22 Report, RedPill78 and David Hayes, who runs another conspiracy podcast called Praying Medic that's available on Apple and Google, but not Spotify.Melody Torres, who podcasts at SoulWarrior Uncensored, self-identifies as a longtime QAnon follower and said in a recent episode that her podcast is “just my way of not being censored." She said she was kicked off Twitter in January and booted from Instagram four times last year. She currently has Instagram, Facebook and YouTube accounts; her podcast is available on Apple and Google. Spotify removed the podcast Friday after The Associated Press inquired about it.X22 Report, RedPill78 and Hayes did not respond to requests for comment sent via their websites. Torres did not reply to a Facebook message.Podcasts suffer from the same misinformation problem as other platforms, said Shane Creevey, head of editorial for Kinzen, a startup created by former Facebook and Twitter executives that offers a disinformation tracker to companies, including some that host or curate podcasts.Creevey points out that it's harder to analyze misinformation from video and audio than from text. Podcasts can also run for hours, making them difficult to monitor. And podcasting has additional challenges in that there are no reliable statistics on their audience, unlike a YouTube stream, which shows views, or a tweet or Facebook post, which shows likes and shares, Creevey said.But some argue that tech-company moderation is opaque and inconsistent, creating a new set of problems. Censorship “goes with the tide against what’s popular in any given moment," said Jillian York, an expert at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights group. Right now, she said, “that tide is against the speech of right-wing extremists ... but tomorrow the tide might be against opposition activists.”___AP Technology Editor David Hamilton contributed to this article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-us-capitol-riots-podcasts-help-extremists-get-their-message-out-101610756419161.html
16-01-2021||World||US steps up claims Covid-19 may have escaped from Chinese lab||The State Department on Friday said it had new information suggesting the Covid-19 pandemic could have emerged from a Chinese laboratory and not through contact with infected animals, the latest salvo in the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure Beijing over the virus’s origins.Specifically, the US said it had obtained new evidence that researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in the fall of 2019, before the first identified case of the outbreak in the surrounding city, with symptoms it said were consistent with either Covid-19 or common seasonal illnesses.The department said China’s lack of transparency about the pandemic’s origin more than a year ago, as well as efforts to mask early shortcomings in the country’s response to the outbreak, make it difficult to draw clear conclusions. But the brief, unsigned statement issued by the US -- less than a week before the end of the Trump administration -- provided no data to back up its claims.“The virus could have emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, spreading in a pattern consistent with a natural epidemic,” according to the State Department. “Alternatively, a laboratory accident could resemble a natural outbreak if the initial exposure included only a few individuals and was compounded by asymptomatic infection.”A State Department spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked for further comment.China has repeatedly rejected charges that the virus might have emerged from a laboratory. The US didn’t say how it obtained the new information about illnesses at the lab.The comments, in a State Department fact sheet, come as China faces criticism for initially preventing some members of a World Health Organization mission from entering China as part of an effort to trace the origin of Covid-19, saying they hadn’t passed health screenings. While the experts were eventually granted clearance, China had already been criticized by the WHO for delaying the mission’s plans to visit the country.China has been under scrutiny since the outbreak exploded in and around Wuhan, but the Trump administration also sought to pin more blame on authorities in Beijing after the pandemic took off in the US and deaths soared. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo frequently refer to the illness as the “China virus”, “China plague” and “Wuhan virus.”For its part, China is mounting a campaign to cast doubt the virus originated within its borders. State media have played up research suggesting that there were cases in Italy and the U.S. that pre-date those in Wuhan, and hinted that the pathogen could have entered the country via frozen food or packaging.On Friday it was announced that 2 million people had died worldwide from the outbreak, with almost 400,000 deaths in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-claims-covid-19-may-have-escaped-from-chinese-lab-101610763288387.html

They will be critical to ensuring that our policy agenda is effective in bringing change for the American people.”The president-elect is set to unveil his economic proposals at 7:15 p.m. from Wilmington, Delaware.Fazili comes to the White House from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where she was director of engagement for the community and economic development department. She previously served in the Obama administration as a senior adviser at the NEC and at the Treasury Department, where she spent time in the offices of Domestic Finance and International Affairs.Budget ImpactBeckwith-Stanley was an associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom before joining the Biden transition team. She previously clerked for Judge Ronald Buch of the United States Tax Court, and began her public policy career advocating for low-income kids and families at the Children’s Alliance in Seattle. During the transition, Beckwith-Stanley has been focused on building analytical and budget tools to assess the impact of budget and tax policies on racial equity, a transition official said.Brian Deese, Biden’s NEC director, described the new hires as “people with really impressive economic-impact credentials, but also deep experience in inclusive economic development, racial equity, and a sort of place-based and community-based focus on economic engagement, which is something that we’re looking to prioritize within the NEC.”Fazili joins two other deputy directors announced by the transition last month, David Kamin and Bharat Ramamurti, whose portfolio will focus on financial reform and consumer protection. Joelle Gamble will be a special assistant to the president for economic policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-taps-kashmir-born-sameera-fazili-as-us-national-economic-council-101610759341128.html

We are also interested in Russian vaccine Sputnik V, who have submitted some data but we have sought more data from them," he said."We are trying to get AstraZeneca vaccine both through the Covax facility and through direct procurement," he added.This revelation comes as several countries have already started administering Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-has-not-placed-any-orders-for-covid-19-vaccine-says-health-official-101610759951260.html

"Covid-19 cannot be beaten one country at a time."He said priority must be given to those who are "on the front line: humanitarian personnel and populations at high risk."Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAt a press conference, the president of the UN General Assembly, Volkan Bozkir, announced that he and Guterres would both be vaccinated very soon.

16-01-2021||World||Who are German chancellor Merkel's potential successors||Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) elects a new leader on Saturday who would be in the pole position to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor after she steps down following federal elections in September.The new CDU leader will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress. By tradition, the leader is usually - though not always - chancellor candidate for the CDU's "Union" with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Here's a look at the potential successors: Armin LaschetThe premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous region, presents himself as the Merkel continuity candidate. Laschet, 59, has the advantage of controlling the CDU in NRW, which provides 298 of the 1,001 congress delegates, but lacks appeal with the wider electorate. He has polished his international profile, courted French President Emmanuel Macron, and complained last year that Berlin had taken "too long to react" to French calls for European Union reform. CDU sources say Laschet, a centrist, would be well suited to negotiating a possible coalition government with the Greens. However, he resisted early efforts to curb coal production. Merkel said last year he has "the tools" to run for chancellor, the closest she has come to endorsing anyone.Friedrich MerzA rock-ribbed conservative who narrowly lost a 2018 bid for the CDU leadership, Merz was pushed out of his role as CDU parliamentary leader by Merkel in 2002 and has been out of the Bundestag since 2009. But he retained an influential network of CDU contacts while pursuing a successful business career and is a favourite with many rank-and-file party members. The plain-speaking Merz, 65, wants to shift the CDU to the right. He told Reuters last year that the EU must be careful not to become a "transfer union" in which richer member states are asked to bankroll their poorer peers. He has criticised the European Central Bank's policies on the euro common currency.Norbert RoettgenAfter starting the leadership race as an outsider, Roettgen, 55, has picked up support by presenting himself as a moderniser, appealing to women and younger voters. He has shown a capacity to reinvent himself, and some CDU lawmakers would like to see him do the same with the party. He beat Laschet in a 2010 contest to be party chief in NRW only to lose a subsequent state election, after which Merkel fired him as environment minister. He subsequently became chairman of the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee. Eloquent and intellectual, he wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China.Markus SoederThe Bavarian premier, 54, projects a charm that none of the CDU leadership candidates can match and is voters' preferred conservative leader. A political chameleon, he has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late and has courted the Greens, the Union's likely next coalition partner after many years with the sliding Social Democrats. Soeder plays coy about his ambitions - "My place is in Bavaria" has been his repeated refrain - but insists the CDU and CSU will decide together who should be their chancellor candidate. He has warned against departing from Merkel's centrist brand of politics. No German chancellor has ever come from the CSU.Jens SpahnBy far the youngest of potential chancellor candidates, Spahn, 40, backed Laschet for the CDU leadership last February but his own profile and standing has since been boosted by his capable management of the coronavirus crisis. An economic liberal and openly gay Catholic, he was critical of Merkel's open-door policy during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis. Some CDU lawmakers, unimpressed with the three declared party leadership contenders, would like him to run for chancellor. While standing by Laschet in the CDU leadership contest, he has been more circumspect when asked about running for chancellor: "As of today, I rule that out," he said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-the-german-chancellor-merkel-s-potential-successors-101610757784202.html
16-01-2021||World||On guns, abortion and voting rights, Trump leaves lasting mark on US judiciary||When a U.S. appeals court declared that Florida could make it harder for convicted felons to vote - a ruling decried by civil rights activists - the impact of President Donald Trump's conservative judicial appointments was plain to see.The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was divided 6-4 in the September ruling, with five Trump appointees in the majority. They ruled that the Republican-governed state could require felons to pay fines, restitution and legal fees after serving time and before casting ballots. A lower court had ruled the law violated their voting rights under the U.S. Constitution.The dissenting 11th Circuit judges were all Democratic appointees.The outcome illustrated that Trump's success in moving the U.S. judiciary to the right was not limited to the Republican president's three Supreme Court appointments - Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - who pushed the top U.S. judicial body's conservative majority to 6-3.Nowhere is that more clearly on display than on the 13 influential federal courts of appeals, one rung below the Supreme Court. Trump, due to leave office next Wednesday, has appointed 54 judges to these courts in his four years as president, just one fewer than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama did in eight years. Trump's total amounts to almost a third of the 179 federal appellate judges.Trump also appointed 174 federal district court judges, a step below the appeals courts. Only Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served from 1977 to 1981, appointed more judges overall during a single four-year term, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who tracks judicial nominations.Earlier in his presidency, Trump often touted judicial appointments as one of his greatest achievements in office. But after losing the Nov. 3 presidential election, he turned on judges, including Supreme Court justices, who repeatedly rejected his efforts to overturn the result as he pushed false claims of widespread voting fraud and irregularities."He misses the fundamentals, much less the subtleties, of the independent judiciary," Wheeler said. "Those concepts are just foreign to him."When Trump took office in January 2017, the 11th Circuit had an 8-3 majority of Democratic-appointed judges. Due to the speed of Trump's nominations and the quick work that the Republican-led Senate under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made of confirming them, it now has a 7-5 majority of Republican appointees.The number of Republican and Democratic appointees is typically an indicator of an appeals court's conservative-liberal balance.Trump's nominees have generally been relatively young, meaning they could serve in their lifetime appointments potentially for decades. Trump appointed eight non-white judges and 11 women to these appeals courts, including Barrett, who he subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court.Although Supreme Court rulings have the greatest impact on the law, it hears fewer than 100 cases a year, typically leaving the final word to the 13 appeals courts. Trump's judicial appointees already are having an influence not just on voting rights but on other contentious issues including guns, abortion and LGBT rights.'TIPPED THE BALANCE'"Having such a very high number of ideologically driven young courts of appeal judges around the country not only tipped the balance on a number of these circuits but has also tipped it in a way that could last for a long time," said Russ Feingold, a former Democratic U.S. senator and president of the American Constitution Society, a liberal legal group.When Trump took office, Democratic-appointed judges held majorities on nine of the 13 appeals courts. Under Trump, the 11th Circuit and two other regional appeals courts - the New York-based 2nd Circuit and the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit - have "flipped" to have a majority of Republican appointees.Even on courts that have not flipped, Republican-appointed judges have made inroads. At the start of Trump's presidency, the liberal San Francisco-based 9th Circuit had an 18-4 majority of Democratic appointees. Now it is just 16-13.Trump-appointed judges have made their mark on the 9th Circuit, including when Judge Kenneth Lee authored a ruling last August striking down a California gun regulation that banned large-capacity magazines.On abortion, four Trump-appointed judges were in the majority in 2019 when the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit declined to reconsider a ruling that upheld a Republican-backed Louisiana law that placed restrictions on doctors who perform abortions. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 ruling last June struck down the law.The White House did not respond to a request for comment, but supporters of Trump's judges said their rulings have shown independence from political influence."So many of these court of appeals judges ... have proven over and over that they put the rule of law and the Constitution ahead of any political agenda. Democrats predicted that they would be political hacks, but they’ve been proven wrong," said Leonard Leo, a long-time conservative legal activist who advised the Trump administration on judges.McConnell played a crucial role in clearing the way for Trump's appointments by impeding Senate confirmation of Obama's picks - including refusing to consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court in 2016 - while subsequently speeding approval of Trump's nominees.In some ways, Wheeler said, "it's McConnell's legacy: He gave Trump the vacancies to fill."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-guns-abortion-and-voting-rights-trump-leaves-lasting-mark-on-us-judiciary-101610760292200.html
16-01-2021||World||Pompeo offers burst of actions, attacks before leaving State||Mike Pompeo isn't quietly fading away. In his final days as secretary of state, he's issuing orders that have caused international consternation and tweeting up a storm on his official and personal accounts to cement his legacy as a prime promoter of President Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine.With a potential eye on a 2024 presidential run, Pompeo has doubled down on his support for Trump, even as other Cabinet members have resigned or stayed out of sight in the aftermath of the Capitol violence. While the House debated Trump's role in encouraging the riot, Pompeo sent a tweet promoting Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.Also Read: US secretary of state Mike Pompeo says Donald Trump's legacy stronger than riotsOver the past week, Pompeo has celebrated controversial policies that are likely to be overturned by his successor, stepped up criticism of what he believes to be unfair news coverage, and he has complained about alleged censorship of conservatives on social media.And in a sign of his post-Trump ambitions, he urged followers of his official State Department Twitter account to start following his personal one.While it’s not unusual for outgoing Cabinet members to publicize their successes, Pompeo has taken it a step further by trashing his predecessors in the national security community, some of whom will play prominent roles in President-elect Joe Biden's administration.“Remember this Middle East ‘expert?’ He said it couldn’t happen. We did it,” Pompeo said in a taunting tweet featuring a video clip of John Kerry saying Arab countries would not recognize Israel without an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. Kerry, a former secretary of state, will serve as climate envoy in the Biden administration.Already the most political of recent secretaries of state, Pompeo has bristled at even the mildest criticism and accused his critics of being misguided, unintelligent or incompetent. He has ignored the advice of his own advisers by forging ahead with pet projects, some of which seem designed to complicate Biden’s presidency.Since last Saturday, he has:—Rescinded long-standing restrictions on U.S. contacts with Taiwan, a move that's main result is to anger China.—Declared Yemen's Houthi rebels a terrorist organization, a step that the United Nations and relief agencies say could worsen what is already a humanitarian catastrophe.Also Read: Donald Trump becomes first US President to be impeached twice—Re-designated Cuba a “state sponsor of terrorism," an action that will impede or at least delay any attempt by Biden to improve ties with Havana.—Accused Iran of deep and longstanding ties with al-Qaida, a pronouncement that many in the intelligence community find overblown given a history of animosity between the two.The actions are in line with a tough “America First” policy that he has long espoused with gusto.He has attacked China, Iran, various U.N. organizations, multilateral institutions like the International Criminal Court, and bilateral treaties such as arms control accords with Russia, two of which the Trump administration has withdrawn from during his time as America’s top diplomat.On Iran, Pompeo has been particularly harsh, re-imposing all sanctions that had been eased by the Obama administration after the 2015 nuclear deal and adding more penalties. He also advocated for the killing of a top Iranian general in Iraq at the beginning of last year and has been at the forefront of an effort to encourage Sunni Arab states to unite against predominantly Shiite Iran.“The foreign policy blob constantly looks for a moderate inside the Iranian regime who will ‘normalize relations’, Pompeo said this week. “The reality is you have a better chance finding a unicorn.”Pompeo has made a sport out of trashing China, Cuba and international organizations, as well as Obama administration officials he believes were hopelessly naive in negotiating with them.“As the UN’s largest contributor, I put U.S. taxpayers and America’s interests first,” Pompeo tweeted on Monday. It was accompanied by a photo of former President Barack Obama, Kerry, Obama’s national security adviser Susan Rice and Obama’s U.N Ambassador Samantha Power at the United Nations. Along with Kerry, Rice and Power have also been named to prominent positions in Biden’s administration.Yet for all the efforts to celebrate Trump administration foreign policy, Pompeo and the State Department have had minimal roles in some of the biggest areas, with the White House taking charge. That was most notable in what Trump supporters see as one of his top accomplishments, improving Israel's ties with its Arab neighbors.Led by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the administration relentlessly promoted Israeli-Arab peace efforts, culminating in agreements for the normalization of relations between the Jewish state and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. Pompeo and the State Department were largely absent from that diplomacy, with the exception of Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, who reports mainly to the White House.Pompeo's State Department was effectively shut out of Kushner's much-talked-about Israeli-Palestinian peace "vision" — and the secretary of state was not present for the rollout of the economic part of the plan in Bahrain in 2019. Pompeo and other Cabinet members were present for the unveiling of the political piece of the proposal last January, yet his role in creating the plan, which was immediately rejected by the Palestinians, is murky.On Thursday, Pompeo lauded Trump's March 2019 decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in 1967. He tweeted a video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem that night with the caption: “I’ll never forget this moment.” Yet he and his delegation had been out of the loop on the timing of the Golan Heights decision, which Trump made after consulting with Kushner just minutes before Pompeo was to meet with Netanyahu.Similarly, the State Department took a backseat in Kushner's negotiations to get Morocco to normalize ties with Israel, which involved U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara.Pompeo did void a decades-old U.S. legal opinion regarding the legality of Jewish settlements on land claimed by the Palestinians. On his last visit to Israel in November, Pompeo became the first secretary of state to visit a settlement and on Thursday proudly promoted a West Bank wine named after him.“L’Chaim to Pompeo wine!” Pompeo said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-offers-burst-of-actions-attacks-before-leaving-state-101610760028531.html
16-01-2021||World||US Capitol riots: FBI questioning dozens in killing of police officer, assaults||The FBI is questioning dozens of people in the killing of Brian Sicknick, a police officer who died a day after physically engaging with a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the US. Capitol last week, and other assaults on law enforcement, the New York Times reported on Friday.The FBI detailed its investigation in a memo sent to the private sector and others on Friday, the newspaper reported.As rioters overpowered Capitol police, Sicknick was pepper-sprayed and hit in the head, his father told Reuters last week. Ambulance crews resuscitated him twice as he was rushed to a nearby Washington hospital. Sicknick died the next day.The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sicknick’s death is being investigated as a homicide by the Washington Metropolitan Police. The FBI is assisting.Sicknick was the fifth person to die after Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.The Republican president had summoned them to Washington for a rally and urged them to fight as lawmakers were meeting to certify his November election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The deaths included some rioters.Fourteen other Capitol Police officers were injured in the riot, the FBI memo said, according to the New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-riots-fbi-questioning-dozens-in-killing-of-police-officer-assaults-101610753933056.html
16-01-2021||World||World hits 2 million Covid-19 deaths with cases still surging||Led by the U.S., the world has hit a frightening Covid-19 threshold, with 2 million people dead and few expectations for the numbers to start dropping any time soon.“You want to get to the point first where the virus can’t outrace you,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and co-director of the Global Health Justice Partnership. “It’s very hard to project out in any fine level of resolution how many people will be dead from this, in even 6 months to a year.”With the rollout of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and the Moderna Inc. shot going slowly in the U.S., and virtually non-existent in many parts of the world, the odds of controlling the outbreak before the summer at the earliest are slim, especially because it can take weeks for an infected person to die.“We have a great forest fire of a pandemic happening,” Gonsalves said in a phone interview. “But if you have just a bucket of water in a forest fire, then you aren’t doing well.”Overall, the U.S. is leading all countries in deaths with 388,705, with Brazil, India, Mexico and the U.K. next in line. Covid, meanwhile, has already killed more people than malaria and tuberculosis combined in the past year, and is nearing the peak number of annual deaths seen from AIDS, which occurred in 2005.French Prime Minister Jean Castex sees a gradual exit from the pandemic in his country, potentially by next summer.“This tragedy our country is living, that the world has been living for months and which weighs on so many of us, the utmost priority to get out of this crisis is the recourse to vaccination,” Castex said Thursday at a news conference in Paris. “But we must collectively show patience and responsibility, because it’ll be several months before vaccination will be able to sufficiently protect us.”In the U.S., public health officials say that most people will have access to the vaccine by summer, which will start to choke off the virus and create some level of protection.Ali Mokdad is a population scientist and professor of global health at the University of Washington, where the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has been tracking and modeling the outbreak for the past year.The institute projects that the world won’t get to about 3 million deaths by the end of 2021, meaning that fewer than 1 million people will die from coronavirus this year. The group’s latest analysis projects 2.89 million deaths worldwide by the end of the year.“All the way to December, it’s not going to be another million,” Mokdad said in a telephone interview. When it comes to infections, he said, “we are not going to see any more situations in the U.S. with 4,000 deaths a day.”People need to wear masks until 75% of the population is immunized, Mokdad said, which could happen sometime this summer. That assumes, he said, that the vaccines continue to roll out, that no further side effects emerge, that there is no new mutation that makes it less effective and that Americans don’t start to celebrate too soon.“Cases are going to come down simply because of the vaccine and the weather,” he said. “It‘s on us to keep doing what we need to do.”Still, studies haven’t confirmed whether the vaccine will stop the spread of the virus itself, instead showing it protects those who receive it from contracting a symptomatic or severe infection. Still, as more and more people obtain some protection against the immediate ravages of the pathogen, the death and hospitalizations rates should start to slow.Gonsalves, though, is concerned that even if the U.S. is able to stem its outbreak, the virus will continue to surge elsewhere. “If you can’t put it out everywhere,” he said, “you can’t put it out anywhere. You are always going to have travel seeding new outbreaks.”Booster ShotWhile the vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are promising to protect people right now, it also remains unclear how long that protection will last.Pfizer is continuing to study its vaccine, hoping to move from its emergency use authorization to final approval, and to determine if regular booster shoots will be needed to keep the virus from re-emerging.While the number of deaths is likely to recede as more and more people get vaccinated, herd immunity -- which occurs when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, making the person-to-person spread unlikely -- won’t be achieved until at least 70% of the population is protected, experts including Anthony Fauci have said.IHME projects this to happen sometime in July. Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease doctor and soon to be a key adviser to Joe Biden once he becomes U.S. president on Jan. 20, said last month that herd immunity will likely happen in the summer, with a return to normality by the end of the year.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization puts the timeline globally at 2022.Worldwide Protection“Even as vaccines start protecting the most vulnerable, we’re not going to achieve any levels of population immunity or herd immunity in 2021,” said the WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan at a Jan. 11 news briefing. “Even if it happens in a couple of pockets, in a few countries, it’s not going to protect people across the world.”The WHO has placed orders for more than 2 billion vaccine doses for low and moderate income countries through its COVAX facility, designed to fight the pandemic. It also has the option to acquire a billion more, according to Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist working with the WHO.“This issue is not the lack of vaccines that we are ordering for the low and low middle income countries,” according to Aylward. “The crucial thing is the timing, to get at least some of those doses early enough to protect these health care workers on the front lines in these countries, as well as the older populations and others who are at high risk of potentially dying of this disease.”Aylward urged wealthier countries to focus not on making sure that all of their population is vaccinated first, but that those at highest risk and most likely to keep the virus viable worldwide get priority access.‘Incredible Progress’“This is not the time to get disheartened,” said the WHO’s Swaminathan, an Indian pediatrician known for her work on tuberculosis and HIV. “We’ve made incredible progress, and a year ago nobody would have predicted that there would have been not one but several vaccines against this new virus that have been developed, manufactured, produced and distributed.”It takes time to scale up the production of doses “not just in the millions but here we’re talking about the billions,” she said. “We have to be a little bit patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-hits-2-million-covid-19-deaths-with-cases-still-surging-101610757155085.html
16-01-2021||World||National Rifle Association files bankruptcy, citing New York politics||The National Rifle Association of America, the gun-rights group feared for its lobbying clout but now threatened with dissolution by the state of New York, filed Friday for Chapter 11 bankruptcy with plans to regroup in Texas.Restructuring in court will help the NRA exit “a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York,” according to a statement on its website. The NRA’s petition listed assets and liabilities of as much as $500 million each.The filing marked another dramatic twist in months of infighting and external legal pressure that have battered the New York-based NRA, one of the most powerful influencers in American politics. New York has been at the forefront of pursuing the NRA in court, with Attorney General Letitia James suing to dissolve the organization and accusing leader Wayne LaPierre and three others of fleecing it.Chapter 11 bankruptcy allows entities to continue operating while working on a plan to repay creditors. In addition, it pauses pending litigation against the bankrupt entity. Besides James’s case, Washington D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine has filed a separate lawsuit against the NRA’s charitable arm, accusing it of misusing donor funds.The NRA struck a defiant tone Friday, asserting that it is in “its strongest financial condition in years” and is “not insolvent” on a question-and-answer web page about the bankruptcy filing.Texas-Bound“The plan can be summed up quite simply: We are DUMPING New York, and we are pursuing plans to reincorporate the NRA in Texas,” LaPierre, the group’s executive vice president, wrote in a letter on its website, citing “costly, distracting and unprincipled attacks” by politicians.James retorted in her own statement, saying, “The NRA’s claimed financial status has finally met its moral status: bankrupt.” She said New York would “not allow the NRA to use this or any other tactic to evade accountability and my office’s oversight.”The NRA has enjoyed enormous sway in Washington for its full-throated defense of the firearms industry and gun rights, beating back repeated attempts for stricter laws in the wake of mass shootings, especially since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut. But the internal rifts and James’s lawsuit dented the group’s image of invulnerability, and President Donald Trump’s impending departure is poised to remove one more NRA ally in Washington’s power structure.For years, the NRA has received millions of dollars annually from the NRA Foundation, whose donors get a tax deduction -- until the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the group’s successful grassroots fund-raisers.Spending ClaimA report detailing alleged lavish spending under LaPierre, published in April 2019 by The Trace, led James to open a probe into the NRA’s nonprofit status. After former NRA President Oliver North complained about financial misconduct at the gun association, LaPierre pushed him out of his unpaid post. The NRA sued North in an attempt to bar him from seeking legal fees, and North countersued.James filed suit in August, alleging the NRA for years diverted millions of dollars in charitable donations to enrich the organization’s top executives in violation of laws governing nonprofits. James also is demanding millions of dollars in restitution and penalties. The case immediately posed one of the biggest legal threats the NRA faced since its founding in New York in 1871.The NRA countersued James in federal court, accusing her of violating its First Amendment rights. The organization also accused her of weaponizing her regulatory and legal power under the guise of protecting state residents.The NRA’s turmoil began with a power struggle in 2019 between North and LaPierre, which included allegations of self dealing. A subsequent state probe found wrongdoing blamed for more than $64 million in losses in the last three years alone, James said when she filed her suit.As part of litigation arising from the power struggle, the NRA claimed that North plotted with its former ad agency, Ackerman McQueen Inc., to smear LaPierre by leaking details of his spending. North and Ackerman denied the claims. The NRA has also accused James of trying to circumvent the organization’s legal rights by demanding information about its members as part of a “political witch hunt.”The case is National Rifle Association of America, 21-30085-11, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (Dallas).(Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, is a donor to candidates and groups that support gun control, including Everytown for Gun Safety.)(Adds Letitia James’s comment in seventh paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-rifle-association-files-bankruptcy-citing-new-york-politics-101610753953065.html
16-01-2021||World||Trump's approval rating plummets to all-time low of 29% following Capitol riots||US President Donald Trump's approval rating has plummeted to an all-time low, led by a dramatic drop in support among voters of his own party, following insurrection at the Capitol last week.A new Pew Research Center poll released on Friday found that just 29 per cent of Americans have approved of the job Trump is doing in office, by far the lowest rating he has received during his presidency, reported The Hill.The poll said 68 per cent of people disapprove of his handling of the job, while 52 per cent say Trump bears a lot of responsibility for the violence and destruction that took place at the Capitol last week.Voters have deeply disapproved of the way the president has conducted himself in wake of the November election he lost to President-elect Joe Biden. More than six in ten say his behaviour after Election Day was poor, and almost half of those who say they voted for Trump called his behaviour either poor or only fair.The rating makes Trump one of the least popular presidents of all time, slightly above the percentage of Americans who approved of Richard Nixon's job performance when he resigned office in disgrace. Just 26 per cent of Americans said they approved of Nixon's job performance when he left office in 1974, The Hill reported.Meanwhile, Sputnik reported that as Biden prepares to take office just days after the riot inside the US Capitol, 64 per cent of voters expressed a positive opinion of his conduct since he won the November election and majorities also approved of Biden's Cabinet selections and how he has explained his plans and policies for the future, Pew said.Other surveys have also depicted a free fall in Trump's approval rating.On January 6, a group of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol to protest legislators confirming electoral slates from battleground US states they thought were invalid.Five people died in the riot, including one police officer as well as one Air Force veteran and a Trump supporter who was shot dead by police.Following the violence, the US House of Representatives on Wednesday impeached Trump for "inciting" last week's deadly violence at Capitol Hill, making him the first US President to be impeached twice.Congress voted 232 to 197 on the single article of impeachment charging Trump with "incitement of insurrection".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-approval-rating-plummets-to-all-time-low-of-29-following-capitol-riots-101610756961062.html

Wiedemann also prohibited Barnett from using the internet or having contact with anyone else who participated in the Jan. 6 violence.Federal prosecutors indicated the Justice Department planned to appeal the order and asked Wiedemann to stay her decision. Barnett was set to be released on Saturday.Barnett was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol. Five people died because of the protest and violence, including a Capitol police officer.Barnett is charged with unlawfully entering a restricted area with a lethal weapon — in this case, a stun gun. Barnett also is charged with disorderly conduct and theft of public property.He surrendered voluntarily Jan. 8 to FBI agents at the Benton County Sheriff’s Office in Bentonville, Arkansas, and has remained in the Washington County jail since then.During a nearly four-hour hearing Friday held over video conference, prosecutors showed pictures of Barnett sitting at a desk in Pelosi's office and Capitol security video of him inside the building. They also showed footage of him bragging on a bullhorn to a crowd outside the Capitol about taking a envelope from the speaker's office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-riots-pelosi-s-office-invader-barnett-to-be-put-under-house-arrest-101610756464229.html

He is the first life scientist to have that job. His predecessor is a meteorologist.Saying “science will always be at the forefront of my administration,” Biden said he is boosting the science advisor post to Cabinet level, a first in White House history.The president-elect also said he is retaining National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins, who worked with Lander on the human genome project, and named two prominent female scientists to co-chair the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.Frances Arnold, a California Institute of Technology chemical engineer who won the 2018 Nobel Prize in chemistry, and MIT vice president for research and geophysics professor Maria Zuber will co-chair the outside science advisory council. Lander held that position during Obama administration.Collins, in an email statement, called Lander “brilliant, visionary, exceptionally creative and highly effective in aspiring others.”“I predict he will have a profound transformational effect on American science,” Collins said.The job as director of science and technology policy requires Senate confirmation.Science organizations were also quick to praise Lander and the promotion of the science post.“Elevating (the science adviser) role to member in the President's Cabinet clearly signals the administration's intent to involve scientific expertise in every policy discussion,” said Sudip Parikh, chief executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world's largest general scientific society.Biden chose Princeton's Alondra Nelson, a social scientist who studies science, technology and social inequality, as deputy science policy chief.Lander, also a mathematician, is a professor of biology at both Harvard and MIT and his work has been cited nearly half a million times in scientific literature, one of most among scientists. He has won numerous science prizes, including a MacArthur “genius” fellowship and a Breakthrough Prize, and is one of Pope Francis' scientific advisors.Lander has said in talks that an opportunity to explain science is his “Achilles' heel": “I love teaching and more than that, I firmly believe that no matter what I do in my own scientific career, the most important impact that I could ever have on the world is going to be through my students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-eric-lander-as-science-adviser-puts-in-cabinet-101610756567191.html
16-01-2021||World||Pelosi calls for prosecution of Congress members who aided Capitol siege||Any members of the US Congress who helped a crowd of President Donald Trump's supporters storm the Capitol should face criminal prosecution, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday.The unprecedented Jan. 6 attack on the seat of Congress left five dead and led the House to impeach Trump a second time, for a fiery speech that day in which he urged thousands of his followers to fight Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's victory.The hundreds who stormed the Capitol quickly overwhelmed police guarding the building, calling security preparations into question, and showed a level of detailed knowledge about the location of lawmakers' offices by some rioters that raised suspicions.Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill, a former US Navy helicopter pilot, has accused some Republican lawmakers of helping Trump supporters, saying she saw colleagues leading groups on "reconnaissance" tours on Jan. 5.Pelosi was asked at a news conference whether any actions would be taken against lawmakers who may have brought tours to the Capitol the day before the attack, which briefly halted Congress in its duty of certifying Biden's win."If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crimes, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress, in terms of prosecution for that," Pelosi said.The Capitol Police is investigating whether members of Congress led people through the Capitol the day before the attack. "The matter is under investigation," said Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki.More than 30 House Democrats, including Sherrill, have asked the acting House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the acting head of the Capitol Police for information about who was in the building on Jan. 5.Pelosi announced a security review of the siege by Trump followers, some of whom were aligned with white supremacist groups. The review would study the Capitol's security infrastructure, procedures, and "command and control," she said.Some Republican Representatives have loudly protested security measures put in place since the attack, including new requirements that everyone entering the House chamber pass through a metal detector.The march by Trump's supporters had been publicized for weeks.There was no direct evidence to suggest rioters had formed "kill capture teams," the top federal prosecutor in Washington, DC said on Friday, softening a statement made by US prosecutors in Arizona in a court filing late on Thursday.The US Justice Department's internal watchdog will review how the FBI and other law enforcement agencies prepared and responded, Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Friday.The House on Wednesday approved an article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection for his speech immediately before the attack.Pelosi declined to answer questions from reporters about when she would send the article to the Senate, the step necessary to trigger a trial. A spokesman for the speaker said he could not confirm a CNN report later on Friday that she is expected to send the article next week.Trump is not expected to face trial before his term ends on Jan. 20, though lawmakers could bar him from running for office again.Congressional Democrats have been grappling with how to balance the impeachment of Trump with other Senate priorities including confirming Cabinet nominees and addressing Biden's request for a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.When Biden takes office on Wednesday, he will be leading a nation where more than 388,000 people have died of Covid-19, which is infecting more than 235,000 people per day."This is a matter of complete urgency," Pelosi said of the Covid-19 vaccine distribution under Biden's proposal.According to Senate rules, the trial would start the day after the charge is sent over by the House. The last time the House voted to impeach Trump, in December 2019, Pelosi did not transmit the charges to the Senate for weeks.Those charges related to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The Senate in February 2020 voted to acquit Trump, keeping him in office.Democrats said on Friday they are bringing back two outside lawyers who helped prosecute Trump's first impeachment: Barry Berke, who will serve as chief impeachment counsel, and Joshua Matz, according to a House Judiciary Committee statement.The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday, the day before Biden's inauguration.A presidential inauguration traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors, but the ceremonies have been scaled back dramatically because of the Covid-19 pandemic, even before last week's riot.Now Washington is wrapped in a security blanket with thousands of troops and law enforcement officers on duty.Trump plans to leave Washington on the morning of the inauguration and go to his club in Palm Beach, Florida, a source familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-calls-for-prosecution-of-congress-members-who-aided-capitol-siege-101610754352140.html
16-01-2021||World||Retired doctors and more syringes: Biden lays out plan to get America vaccinated||US President-elect Joe Biden on Friday said he would order increased production of syringes and other supplies to ramp up vaccinations against COVID-19 and improve upon the Trump administration rollout that he called a "dismal failure."Under Biden's plan, federal disaster-relief workers would set up thousands of vaccination centers, where retired doctors would administer shots to teachers, grocery store workers, people over 65 years old and other groups who do not currently qualify.The Democrat would invoke the Defense Production Act to increase production of equipment needed to distribute the vaccines, such as glass vials, needles and syringes, according to a document released by his transition team. He would also use the law to support vaccine refrigeration and storage.Biden said his team has identified companies that are ready to be activated under the law, which enables the president to order businesses to produce items necessary for national defense.States that use their National Guard in the effort would be reimbursed by the federal government, the transition team said.The coronavirus has killed more than 390,000 people in the United States, and a top Biden adviser said on Friday the death tally could reach 500,000 by February.Biden has promised to do better than President Donald Trump to curb the virus and get 100 million vaccine shots into the arms of Americans during his first 100 days in office."This is a time to set big goals and pursue them with courage and conviction because the health of the nation is literally at stake," said Biden, who takes office on Wednesday.EXPANDING VACCINATION SITESSpeaking near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden called for increasing vaccine distribution in lower-income neighborhoods not currently well served by hospitals and pharmacies. Biden also plans a marketing campaign to encourage those skeptical of the vaccine to get inoculated.His transition team said he will reorganize the vaccine distribution team currently called "Operation Warp Speed" and has asked former Food and Drug Administration chief David Kessler to work with manufacturers to boost vaccine availability.Biden said his administration will release the vast majority of doses when they become available, rather than holding back a large portion to ensure that recipients can get a second dose, which had been the Trump administration's approach for much of the rollout. States will get regular updates to know how many doses are coming to ensure they can distribute them efficiently.He said he will order the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up 100 vaccine centers within a month, which he said would ultimately serve millions of people. Neighborhood pharmacies would also be enlisted as vaccination sites, he said.Even with these changes, Biden said it will take time for the United States to beat back the virus. "The honest truth is this: things will get worse before they get better," he said.Biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on Thursday that includes $20 billion for vaccine distribution as well as $50 billion for coronavirus testing, which experts and officials said should help speed the process up.The stimulus proposal faces an uphill battle in Congress, however. When Biden takes office, Democrats will control both the Senate and the House of Representatives but by narrow margins. Some Republicans have balked at its cost, while liberals have pushed for more spending on direct payments to individuals.The Trump administration had aimed to give vaccine doses to 20 million Americans by the end of 2020. But only 12.3 million coronavirus shots had been administered as of Friday morning out of more than 31 million doses distributed to states, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Federal officials have largely left states to manage distribution, resulting in big differences in vaccination rates. The Trump administration has said it expects 1 million shots to be delivered per day by the end of next week.A Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States is on track to have 300 million doses available by the end of Biden's first 100 days in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/retired-doctors-and-more-syringes-biden-lays-out-plan-to-get-america-vaccinated-101610755517777.html
16-01-2021||World||US imposes sanctions on Cuba citing human rights violations||The US Department of the Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Cuba's Interior Ministry and its leader, accusing them of serious human rights violations.The measures against the ministry and Brigadier Gen. Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas include freezing any bank accounts they may have in the United States and blocking any business operations with US entities.The new sanctions, which are largely symbolic, come less than a week before the end of Donald Trump’s presidency, which has been characterized by strong hostility toward the Cuban government.“The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to address the dire human rights situation in Cuba and elsewhere around the world,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.The sanctions will be implemented under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and directed “against the perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption throughout the world,” the US government said in a news release.The statement cited the case of Cuban dissident Jose Daniel Ferrer, who was held in a prison controlled by the Interior Ministry. Ferrer reported being beaten, tortured, held in solitary confinement and denied medical attention at the prison.The island’s Ministry of the Interior oversees the internal order in the Caribbean nation and includes police, firefighters, the penitentiary system and border guards. The Cuban government does not recognize the legal status of dissidents, whom it often accuses of being manipulated and financed by American interest groups wanting to discredit the socialist government.It is not the first time that high-ranking Cuban officials have been sanctioned by the United States. In September, the US Department of State imposed sanctions on the former president and current leader of Cuba’s Communist Party, Raúl Castro — a historical leader of the Cuban Revolution — and his four children.Trump has promoted a policy of sanctions and restrictions on the island since taking office in 2017, reversing the bilateral relations that had begun under President Barack Obama. The Trump administration has applied hundreds of measures and sanctions, some of only symbolic value, such as the ones announced Friday, and others with a strong impact on the island’s economy and its population.President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office Wednesday, said during his election campaign that he will re-establish at least part of Obama’s policies related to the island. Biden’s advisers have said he plans to eliminate restrictions on remittances and travel, among other measures implemented by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-sanctions-on-cuba-citing-human-rights-violations-101610754443039.html

16-01-2021||World||UN Security Council approves Kubis as new Libya mediator||The United Nations Security Council approved on Friday the appointment of veteran diplomat Jan Kubis as the UN Libya envoy, diplomats said, nearly a year after the last mediator stepped down.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had proposed that Kubis succeed Ghassan Salame, who quit the role in March last year due to stress. Salame's deputy Stephanie Williams has been acting Libya envoy.Kubis, a former Slovakian foreign minister, is currently the UN special coordinator for Lebanon. He has also served as the UN special envoy in Afghanistan and Iraq.The appointment of Kubis comes after the Security Council approved in December a plan by Guterres' to name Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov to the Libya role. But a week later Mladenov said he could not take up the position due to "personal and family reasons."Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October, the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire.Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-approves-kubis-as-new-libya-mediator-101610753904153.html

The factory, located in Puurs, supplies vaccine to all countries other than the US, the German Health Ministry said.“As part of the normal productivity improvements to increase capacity, we must make modifications to the process and facility that will require additional regulatory approvals,” a Pfizer spokeswoman said in a statement. “Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March.”Together, Pfizer and BioNTech will be able to deliver the fully committed quantity of vaccine doses to the European Union in the first quarter, and even higher output in the second quarter, BioNTech said in a statement Friday. The EU deliveries will return to its original schedule the week of Jan. 25, with increased deliveries commencing the week of Feb. 15.“The companies will inform the European Commission, EU member states and other countries impacted by the changes about the updated delivery schedules,” BioNTech said in the statement.Pfizer and its German partner are under growing pressure to make more shots as countries around the world rush to immunize vulnerable people. The companies recently increased their output target for this year by more than 50% to 2 billion doses. However, some of that increase is simply due to regulators giving health-care providers the go-ahead to pull an additional dose from each vial.The partners are also seeking to boost capacity at their factories and find new production partners. A new BioNTech factory in Marburg, Germany, passed its emissions review with the German state of Hesse on Friday, putting it a step closer to opening as planned next month.Pfizer shares were little changed at $36.70 in New York on Friday, while BioNTech’s American depositary receipts fell 4%.‘On the Case’European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she called Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla, who promised that the company will meet delivery targets for the first quarter.“He’s personally on the case on reducing the delay,” she said. “We urgently need the guaranteed doses in the first quarter.”Because of the dosing schedule, “there is also a medical necessity and need to stick to what we have agreed, to the schedule we have agreed, and to the delivery,” von der Leyen said. “In Europe we have been supportive and we will be supportive in what concerns the scaling up of production capacity, but we expect then that the delivery schedule is being fulfilled.”Countries RespondNorway said it will get 36,078 doses from Pfizer next week instead of the 43,875 that were anticipated. Two doses given three weeks apart are needed to vaccinate one person.Meanwhile, Italy’s virus emergency czar, Domenico Arcuri, said Friday that he’s warned Pfizer that it faces potential, unspecified action for temporarily reducing shipments of its Covid-19 vaccine to Italy and other European countries.“Today Pfizer unilaterally announced that starting from Monday it will deliver to our country about 29% fewer vaccine vials than the schedule it had shared,” Arcuri said in a statement demanding the restoration of the original allocation.In Canada, which has ordered more Covid-19 vaccine doses per capita than any other country, Procurement Minister Anita Anand called the temporary reduction “unfortunate.” Pfizer plans to catch up on deliveries by the end of March, Anand said, adding that by the end of September, everyone who wishes to be vaccinated will be able to get a shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-to-cut-vaccine-shipments-as-belgian-factory-renovated-101610754532094.html

We must adjust our regulations and policies and take other necessary actions to reduce the risk of PRC technical and human espionage activities directed at the Federal Government," he said, referring to the People's Republic of China.He said Trump had directed government bodies to conduct reviews "to minimize the procurement of People’s Republic of China (PRC) goods and services by the Federal Government."O'Brien did not give examples of the procurement he referred to, but a senior administration official said a key aim was to push back against Chinese attempts to infiltrate US IT networks."Anything having to do with Chinese companies that are going to have kit components in our network could potentially become a vulnerability that could be used to continue China's military-civil fusion strategy," the official said."If there's hardware, for example, that would make its way into our networks, that's the sort of stuff that could pose a potential vulnerability."The announcement comes less than a week before Trump leaves office to be succeeded by Democrat Joe Biden on Jan. 20. It was the latest in a series of steps targeting China, which analysts see as a bid to lock in a tough approach to Beijing.Trump has pursued hard-line policies toward China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus. Relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when he ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-directs-government-to-minimize-procurement-from-china-101610754006038.html
16-01-2021||World||US agents guarding Ivanka, Jared had to rent $3k/month flat||US Secret Service agents guarding President Donald Trump’s family members and advisers, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, were instructed not to use the half-dozen bathrooms in the couple’s house in Washington, compelling them to use facilities at neighbours’ houses and a portable washroom for months, according to a report by the Washington Post.Asked not to use the bathrooms inside the couple’s sprawling 5,000-square-foot house in the elite Kalorama neighbourhood, several US agents resorted to using a porta-potty as well as bathrooms at the nearby homes of former President Barack Obama, and Vice-President Mike Pence. Sometimes, they even went up to commercial facilities nearby to use the washrooms, two law enforcement officials cited by the Washington Post report said.Finally, in September 2017, the federal government rented from a neighbour a basement studio with a washroom for $3,000 per month, which resolved the issue but came at a total cost of $100,000 to American taxpayers.A White House spokesperson, however, denied that the President’s daughter and son-in-law had restricted the Secret Service agents’ entry into their house.“When discussions regarding protecting their home were initially had in 2017, Ivanka and Jared made clear that their home would always be open to the incredible men and women on their detail. It was only after a decision by the [Secret Service] was made that their detail sought other accommodations,” White House spokesperson Judd Deere said. “Their home will always be open to them and they have immense gratitude for their service over the last four years,” the spokesperson added.The law enforcement officials gave a different version. One of the officials cited above told the Post that the reason for not allowing agents inside the house was not known, but the second official said the decision was taken by the Kushners.“It’s the first time I ever heard of a Secret Service detail having to go to these extremes to find a bathroom,” said one of the officials aware of the matter.A spokesperson for the Secret Service refused to comment.The US Secret Service is a federal agency that is in charge of protecting US political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of governments along with conducting financial investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usagents-guarding-ivanka-jared-had-to-rent-3k-month-flat-101610739528709.html

Meanwhile, several other mutations have been reported from other countries which may differ from the original UK variants.Here is all you need to know about several variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus.UK variantThis variant, believed to be more contagious, was first reported in December. It was first reported to the WHO on December 14. The variant is known as VOC 202012/01. It is likely to infect young people and people with no serious health issues as well, unlike the original virus.South African variantThis variant 501Y.V2, first reported on December 18, is now spread in 20 countries, according to WHO. This variant does not lead to serious illness but is contagious.Japan/Brazil variantA new variant has been detected in four persons who travelled from Brazil to Japan. Among these four, two are children, which makes it apparently clear that this variant can infecchildren as well. This was reported to the WHO on January 9. It has 12 mutations to the spike protein including three mutations of concern in common with the UK and the South African variant.Brazil too reported similar variant independent of the cases detected in Japan.United StatesOhio researchers have claimed to have discovered two new variants of the virus which likely have their origin in the United States. The findings have not yet been published as studies are being conducted. The strains have been found in Columbus — one is similar to the UK variant but the other was an entirely different mutation, researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-south-africa-brazil-us-japan-how-many-variants-of-sars-cov-1-virus-found-so-far-101610698432774.html
16-01-2021||India||Rahul, Jaishankar spar at panel meet||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi had an animated debate on Indian foreign policy against the backdrop of the border standoff with China during a routine meeting of a parliamentary consultative committee on Saturday, according to people familiar with the matter.As the minister concluded an hour-long presentation, the Congress leader said it appeared to be a “laundry list” rather than a concerted strategy to deal with the Chinese threat — a view echoed by his party colleague Shashi Tharoor, who held the charge of junior foreign minister during the UPA era. Jaishankar responded by saying a simplistic approach could not be adopted in a multipolar world and, equally significantly, a multipolar continent too, according to the people cited above.“Do you have a clear strategy in mind that could be summarised in three sentences?’’ Gandhi was said to have asked Jaishankar. “The Chinese strategy is to move from the maritime to the terrestrial, to change the old Silk Road to a land route linking China to Europe and through the CPEC to the Gulf and bypass the old centrality of India, making us irrelevant. What will India do to counter it?’’To Gandhi’s concern that China was increasingly turning the world bipolar, the minister said: “We cannot write off Russia, and Japan is a rising power too. We will do our best so that the world is multipolar; we should think of a multipolar continent too.’’Jaishankar said the debate with Gandhi could continue endlessly as both had counterpoints.As the Congress MPs defended the successive UPA regimes in the context of foreign policy, the minister said connectivity with neighbours had improved dramatically over the past six years. He said ties with the Gulf countries, for instance, were limited to the Indian community and energy-related transactions during the UPA years but acquired a deeper character under the Modi government, which, among other things, resulted in better treatment of the Indian diaspora during the pandemic.Jaishankar said Rs.4,600 crore was spent annually on the Chinese border till 2016 but the figure was ramped up to Rs.11,800 crore since then. Past neglect of border infrastructure was part of the current problem, he said.On the Congress MPs’ objection that minutes of the meetings of the consultative committee were not being made available by the government, the ministry said the decision to adopt this practice was taken by the then external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in 2008.After the sharp exchanges, the meeting concluded on a cordial note, with Congress MPs Anand Sharma and Shashi Tharoor thanking the external affairs ministry for arranging safe evacuation of Indians stranded abroad during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-jaishankar-spar-at-panel-meet-101610821322013.html

Mumbaiites also inhaled the cleanest air so far this year with Air Quality Index at 162.The Santacruz station of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 degrees Celsius, a degree below normal. This is the second lowest minimum temperature recorded this season following a mercury drop to 16 degrees Celsius on December 22 last year.Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius, which was at par with the normal temperature. The IMD attributed this drop in temperature to the cold westerly winds.“There was a nice chill in the air as westerly winds have started blowing over parts of the state. Since, parts of North West India are under the influence of a cold wave, north-westerly winds from these parts are colder. Minimum temperature in the state is expected to see gradual fall in the state in the coming days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Maximum temperatures also remained low compared to the beginning of the week. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was recorded at 31.2 degrees Celsius, which was just normal. Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 29.6 degrees Celsius which was 1.6 degrees below normal.Meanwhile, air quality improved further on Saturday. An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator-- of 162 (moderate), was recorded on Saturday morning. This is better than Friday’s 190.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.“Winds blowing from the north and west have cleared the air of pollutants. If the wind continues, air quality will remain moderate for the next couple of days, despite a drop in temperatures. However, without the winds, air quality may become worse,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.Navi Mumbai recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 365 (very poor). Andheri was a distant second among the 10 locations with an AQI of 221.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-year-inhales-cleanest-air-101610819273902.html

16-01-2021||India||Bribe-for-relief scam: CBI suspends 2 officers, recommends action against 2 more||The Central Bureau of Investigation on Saturday suspended two of its officers - Inspector Kapil Dhankad and Stenographer Sameer Kumar Singh - and approached the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) recommending administrative action against two deputy superintendents- RK Rishi and RK Sangwan, for allegedly running a bribe-for-relief racket in the agency, people familiar with the development said.The DoPT is the nodal ministry for the CBI and any administrative action against Class-I gazetted officers (DSPs) is approved by it while the CBI Director has powers to suspend Inspectors and below rank officers.Four officers were allegedly accepting bribes from companies under CBI investigation.A senior CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The agency has zero tolerance policy against corruption, be it other departments or within the organisation hence two officers have been suspended while action has been recommended against the other two”.According to the CBI case against the officers, they were accepting bribes from private companies by leaking sensitive case related information to them. Bribes worth around ₹55 lakh paid to two officers has already been identified and efforts are being made to ascertain the payments made to two others.As reported by HT, the racket was being run inside the agency since 2018 and there is a possibility that more officers are involved in diluting the CBI cases in lieu of illegal gratifications.The two DSPs -- RK Rishi and RK Sangwan – mainly played the role of bribe facilitators leaking the information to the companies.All four have been questioned by a team led by a Superintendent of Police (SP) rank officer in Anti-Corruption-4 unit of the agency, which has jurisdiction to investigate cases all over India.HT couldn’t locate the four officers for their comments.However, a senior cadre officer in the CBI, who didn’t want to be named, said, “How is it possible that a stenographer, or an Inspector was leaking case information or documents and the concerned SP wasn’t aware of it? Shouldn’t there be a wider probe rather than restricting it to DSPs only?”CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla, who is due to complete his two-year tenure in February first week, didn’t respond to a text query.The scandal has hit the agency at a time when CBI is investigating a large number of bank fraud cases involving huge public funds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bribeforrelief-scam-cbi-suspends-2-officers-recommends-action-against-2-more-101610818175595.html

However, one thing Bihar still lacks is industrialisation. During the Covid-19 pandemic, when lakhs of migrants returned to the state, we have told them to stay back and work here. We are exploring possibilities and it is heartening to see Bihar’s diaspora taking such a keen interest in contributing to their roots. Bihar awaits industrialisation,” he added.He was addressing the diaspora from Bihar organized by the Bihar-Jharkhand Association of North America in collaboration with the Consulate General of India, New York. Kumar said that such interaction would now be a regular feature to get feedback and provide a platform for knowledge sharing. Non-resident Indian Alok Kumar also extended an invitation to visit New York and address the diaspora there.The CM said that policies have been simplified and they would be further eased to help those wanting to contribute to Bihar’s progress in different ways. “All the requirements in terms of roads, power and infrastructure have been met. There would be time-bound clearance of proposals. Even land allotment policy through Bihar industrial area development authority (BIADA) has been simplified,” he saidChief secretary Deepak Kumar had earlier said that the government would provide nearly 50% subsidy on land cost and there was around 450-acres of land available at 68 locations for the purpose of industries. He also made an offer to the NRIs to explore the possibility of a tie-up with Bihar government’s public sector undertakings to get things done more easily.Former minister and MLC Sanjay Jha, principal secretary to CM, Chanchal Kumar and additional chief secretary Brajesh Mehrotra were among several officials present during the online interaction.Kumar urged the people from Bihar settled in USA, Canada and other parts to visit the stato see and feel the change for themselves. “With people from Bihar feeling the urge from so far away to do something for the state, I am convinced it will happen and the state government will do whatever it takes to make your plans a success. Bihar needs your expertise and passion,” he added.Earlier, a number of NRIs shared their vision and plans for the state in different fields, be it education, tourism, innovation and incubation, agriculture and food processing, sister-city partnerships and cultural exchange programmes and tie-ups through important festivals like Chhath Puja.JD-U national general secretary Sanjay Jha said that Bihar’s march from a state of hopelessness 16 years ago to an aspirational state was something that had generated a lot of interest among the Bihari people settled abroad to give something back to their state. “This is based not on any government publicity, but on their own feedback from their family members and friends and it is refreshing. With all the ground work done in the last 15 years, this is perhaps the take-off stage for Bihar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contribute-to-bihar-s-industrial-growth-cm-nitish-kumar-to-diaspora-101610817038149.html
16-01-2021||India||'Beginning of the final war': Here is what health workers said after getting Covid-19 shots||From the heights of Ladakh to coastal Kerala, healthcare and frontline workers were administered with vaccines as India launched its vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday. The Union health ministry said as many as 191,181 people were given the shot during the first day of the vaccination drive across the country. Sanitation worker Manish Kumar became the first recipient of the Covid-19 shot in the country as he was vaccinated at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the presence of Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and other doctors.During the first phase of the vaccination, which started on Saturday, healthcare workers and people who are working at the forefront of the fight will be vaccinated. In the second phase, people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions will be given priority. The vaccines will be available for the general public after the priority list is covered.Priyanka Maitra Karwk, a doctor at Medical College in Kolkata, was among the people who received the first shot of the vaccine. Karwk said that she was feeling "absolutely fine" and urged others to do the same. "I am feeling absolutely fine after receiving the vaccine shot. Will take another dose after 28 days. I would urge people to come up and take the vaccine," PTI quoted as saying.K Senthil, the president of Tamil Nadu's government association of doctors, said, "We saw agony, pain and many deaths due to coronavirus. We have been waiting for the vaccine for the past 10 months and it arrived sooner than we expected. For me, this is both an opportunity and a luck to get the vaccine".The news agency also cited K Jayamma, a health worker in Telangana, as saying that she got herself vaccinated first to "allay apprehensions if any about the vaccination." "I had no fear of taking the vaccine," she also said, PTI reported.In the national capital, Vinish Kumar, part of the nursing staff at a hospital, said that he was feeling normal after taking the shot. However, his blood pressure did go down for a while but "everything is fine now." "They put me under observation for one hour. Now I am feeling normal and everything is fine," he said as per the PTI report."It's our moment of reckoning, I guess, which is very humbling," Delhi nurse Biji Tomy said, according to PTI.Gujarat paediatrician Naveen Thacker hailed the vaccination drive as "beginning of a final war." "As you can see, I have not felt any adverse effect even an hour after getting inoculated," he said.India, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, plans to vaccinate around 300 million people in the first six to eight months of the year. Some 30 million healthcare and other frontline workers are first in line followed by about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.More than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, including more than 151,000 who have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/beginning-of-the-final-war-here-is-what-health-workers-said-after-getting-covid-19-shots-101610813653632.html

And I can assure you that when 2021 IFFI starts in November later this year it will be just like before with an auditorium full and resounding with applause,” Javadekar said.IFFI that is usually held in the month of November has been postponed to January in view of the restrictions on travel last year and the risks associated with large gatherings.The organisers have assured that all pandemic protocols will be followed according to the MHA guidelines and that the total seating capacity has been reduced to 902 which is less than half the usual capacity.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant welcomed filmmakers and film lovers from across the world to experience Goa while promising a safe experience.“I'm happy to inform you that we are having the event in a hybrid format -- we will have screening in auditoriums and also via online mode. The registration is more than 2000. We assure you that your health and hygiene has been given the utmost importance and we are following all the health protocols for conducting this event,” Sawant said.Billed as Asia’s oldest and India’s biggest festival, IFFI is being held in Goa since 2004. This year the festival will open with the Indian premiere of the movie ‘Another Round’ by Thomas Vinterberg. The movie starring Cannes Best Actor Award winner Mads Mikkelsen is among the star-studded line up of movies being showcased at IFFI. The movie is also Denmark’s official entry for the Oscars.The festival will have a line-up of famous movies with a total of 224 films from across the globe being screened. This includes 21 non-feature films and 26 feature films under the Indian Panorama films section.15 widely acclaimed films are part of its international competition section and will compete for the Golden Peacock Award. Argentine filmmaker Pablo Cesar will head the 51st IFFI’s international jury panel, while other members include filmmakers Prasanna Vithanage (Sri Lanka), Abu Bakr Shawky (Austria), Priyadarshan (India) and Rubaiyat Hossain (Bangladesh).Javadekar promised that there will be private participation too in organising IFFI from the next edition onwards.“There should be participation of the film industry as well as other industries because the responsibility of the government is to promote an atmosphere of art and culture and ensure that it is well publicized but it does not mean that the government itself does everything. So I invite private participation and I'm confident that in the coming 52nd IFFI there will definitely be private participation,” Javadekar said.Javadekar also announced the ‘Indian personality of the year award’ for actor, producer, director and singer in Hindi and Bengali cinema to Bishwajit Chatterjee while the Lifetime Achievement Award went to Vittorio Storaro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-goa-iffi-s-51st-edition-begins-with-hope-of-being-back-to-normal-next-year-101610813450797.html

Something which was considered unbelievable to be achieved for a country as populous, as heterogeneous and as diverse, as India, has been made possible under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Singh told PTI.Also Read: In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priorityThe emerging scenario, he said, has given the people of India a reinforced sense of self-esteem and self-confidence, and also reinforced people's faith and trust in Prime Minister Modi.Singh also lauded India's corona warriors for their enduring fight over the last one year.He said the pandemic had brought out the best in the Indian medical fraternity and brought to the surface the inner strengths and potentials of Indian medical professionals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-has-begun-to-look-up-to-india-as-a-power-to-reckon-with-union-minister-on-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101610811599946.html
16-01-2021||India||Shot in the arm for health staff: From facing harassment to being first to get Covid-19 vaccine||For Biji Tomy, a nurse who received the very first Covid-19 vaccine shot at the LNJP Hospital here on Saturday, it was a "historic moment" that helped her leave behind the unpleasant memories of her colleagues being harassed and taunted as "potential coronavirus carriers" in the early days of the pandemic.Hailing from Kerala, the 48-year-old healthcare worker at the state-run facility told PTI, "When the pandemic outbreak happened in Delhi in March, everyone was afraid and uncertain about the future, and many doctors and nurses had to face harassment and taunts from neighbours in the initial days as 'potential carriers of infection', and some landlords had threatened to evict them.""But, today, we are getting applause and fellow citizens are hailing the healthcare workers," she said, adding, "It is our moment of reckoning, I guess, which is very humbling."Several hundreds of healthcare workers, from doctors to sanitation workers at hospitals, were given shots of Covid-19 vaccine at 81 centres, after the world's largest vaccination drive was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi across the country."We were only trying to do our job when the virus had just invaded our cities, and our country. We were not criminals that they subjected many of our fellow brothers and sisters to humiliation. But, it feels very relieving today. People have understood we were trying to save lives, putting our own lives at risk," said Tomy, who hails from Idukki district in Kerala.Many doctors, nurses, sanitation workers and other frontline staff have lost their lives in Delhi since the first cases of the pandemic was reported here on March 1.The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital, which was soon converted into a dedicated coronavirus facility and where over 10,000 Covid-19 patients have been treated so far, drew praise from both Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Health Minister Satyendar Jain.Nurse Atmaja was administered a dose of Covishield in the presence of Kejriwal who visited the facility in the afternoon and interacted with a few healthcare workers.At the hospital's vaccination centre, beneficiaries were warmly greeted with a rose after administrating a shot and red carpet had been laid outside the main OPD Block of the facility to welcome them.As they exited the vaccination area post 30-minute mandatory observation, their colleagues and staff of the vaccination team cheered and clapped with a sense of solidarity.Among the doctors, who received the shots on the first day of the roll-out was Farah Husain, an anaesthesia specialist and one of the in-charges of the Covid ICU ward."Pride is quite natural, and tremendous happiness, after all the hardships and deaths we have seen last year, as the city and the country fought the pandemic," she said.Asked if the unfair treatment meted out to several healthcare workers by their landlords or taunts made by neighbours in the beginning phase of the pandemic made her feel vindicated today, she said, "No, not at all.""Yes, it was wrong behaviour by them, but today being chosen as the first in line to get the vaccine shots, we feel humbled and it emphasises our sense of purpose, and of the spirit of servitude for humanity which our profession teaches," she said.Husain, who still recalls a large number of patients dying in ICU at the height of the pandemic, hopes the vaccination drive will help create a veil of protection for the rest of the population, by developing "herd immunity" in the vaccinated people.While nurse Tomy was the first person to get the shot at the LNJP Hospital, Central District Programme Officer Puneet Jaitley was the second person to get the shot at the British-era hospital.Naveen Kumar from LNJP Hospital's administration department who also took the jab said he felt a "sense of blessing"."During the peak COVID time, I worked here wearing a PPE kit, and it was very tough. Society would see us a potential carriers of infection, and my own neighbourhood in Burari was a containment zone for some time," he said."We owe our lives to these doctors and nurses, they are the true corona warriors, and we salute them," Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shot-in-the-arm-for-health-staff-from-facing-harassment-to-being-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101610810301416.html

This was because of the glitches on the CoWIN app and more than usual time was taken to administer the vaccine at some of the districts centres, officials said.In West Bengal, problems were faced by health workers uploading data on the app about beneficiaries receiving the vaccine across the state as the app slowed down and could not be operated.“There were some technical glitches and the app had slowed since Friday. Not all messages were going to health workers who were supposed to receive the vaccine on Saturday morning. The persons concerned were individually called up and informed over phone,” said a senior official of the state health department.Also read: In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priorityOn Saturday morning too when the vaccination drive took off at 204 centres across the state problems were encountered with the app.“The data of the beneficiaries who received the vaccine were supposed to be uploaded. But it was taking a lot of time as the app was working too slowly. Rest everything went fine,” said a doctor from Kandi sub-divisional hospital in Murshidabad district, around 200 kilometres north of Kolkata. Similar, reports were received from some other districts in the state.In Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarkhand, similar glitches were reported from some districts.“The server was slowed down leading to difficulties in uploading the data at many centres in our division. We have now directed the vaccination teams to register the details offline and then upload it subsequently,” said Dr PD Gandal, deputy director, health services, Nashik Division.Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, state health department said the server had slowed down owing to which the messages could not be sent out. “The issue was resolved by 2 am after which the messages were sent to the beneficiaries,” he said.In Uttarkhand, Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, nodal officer of state's extended programme for immunization (nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination), said some technical glitches were reported from some districts as the app had slowed down.“Our technical team is looking into this,” he said. He added that in some places, volunteers reported reaction to the dose, including a health worker at AIIMS, Rishikesh, who reported a burning sensation. Another a person in Haridwar district got unconscious for a minute after the vaccination. “We are investigating the causes,” said Martoliya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-report-hurdle-in-vaccination-as-cowin-app-develops-glitches-101610810101231.html
16-01-2021||India||Launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive marks high point of efforts by SII, Bharat Biotech||With a reputation as the 'pharmacy of the world', India's inoculation drive, dubbed the world's largest and most ambitious, has been anchored on two home-grown vaccine makers who took a huge gamble once the pandemic began to unfold, overhauling assembly line and sacrificing some of the existing products in anticipation of a Covid-19 vaccine.In early May last year, Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, received a tiny 1-millilitre vial from Oxford, England, containing the cellular material for the vaccine, which kicked off the work on mass production of the vaccine.As the pandemic began to unfold, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla gambled to strike deals to secure coronavirus vaccine licenses.SII overhauled assembly lines to crank out 5,000 doses of vaccine per minute, even before the clinical trials ended.It had already produced around 40 million doses before the phase-III results of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, named Covishield, were known.A little later, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech started work on a 'desi' or 'Made-in-India' vaccine, Covaxin.As the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the world and India, all eyes were on the country's vaccine manufacturers for large-scale production and supply of coronavirus vaccines as it contributes around 60 per cent of the global vaccine production.More than 1 crore cases and around 1.5 lakh fatalities later, India took its first steps out of the pandemic with shots of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines being administered at medical centres across the country.The journey of the two vaccines started in 2020. In April, SII announced its partnership with Oxford University for Covid-19 vaccine."We have partnered with the Oxford University vaccine project as one of the seven global institutions manufacturing the vaccine," Poonawalla had said in a statement.He said SII had undertaken the decision to initiate manufacturing of vaccine at its own risk.The decision was solely taken to have a jump-start on manufacturing, to have enough doses available, if the clinical trials proved successful.The company also started clinical trials of the vaccine in India and in August said that the phase-III trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine were underway.However, the trials hit a roadblock in September, with the company receiving a show-cause notice from the central drug regulator for not informing it about AstraZeneca pausing clinical trials of the Oxford vaccine candidate for COVID-19 in other countries.The company was, however, given permission to resume clinical trials in September itself.In November, AstraZeneca announced that its Covid-19 vaccine candidate was 70 per cent effective on average.During the month, SII also said that it was in the process of applying for an emergency use licensure for AstraZeneca-Oxford's Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India in the next two weeks.There were challenges too, with a participant in the clinical trials alleging serious side effects due to the vaccine, a charge that was firmly rejected by the company.The other vaccine maker, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has developed Covaxin indigenously in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The company had received permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for conducting the phase-I and II clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine.In October last year, it applied to the DCGI for conducting phase-III randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial of its COVID-19 vaccine.The company was in spotlight in December, when Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij tested positive for coronavirus, days after participating in the trial of Covaxin. He had participated in a trial on November 20, 2020.At that time, Bharat Biotech had said its vaccine was safe and efficacious and had pointed out that Covaxin was based on a two-dose schedule and its efficacy was to be determined 14 days post the second dosage.Similarly, the company had also said that the death of a volunteer in Bhopal, who took a shot of Covaxin as part of the phase-III clinical trials, was not related to the medication.Bharat Biotech has also inked a pact with Precisa Medicamentos, a Brazilian company, to supply the Covid-19 vaccine candidate to the Latin American country.The long wait for regulatory approval finally came to an end for both vaccine manufacturers on January 3, with India's drug regulator approving Covishield and Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive innoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/launch-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-marks-high-point-of-efforts-by-sii-bharat-biotech-101610809745183.html

Culling operation of poultry is underway in the epicentre of Harda district, it added.According to the ministry, the central teams formed for monitoring the situation in the affected areas of the country are visiting the affected sites and conducting epistemological studies.On poultry sale and consumption, the ministry asked states to rethink their decisions to impose a ban on sale of poultry and poultry products and allow selling of poultry and poultry products sourced from the non-infected areas/states."It is reiterated that consumption of well cooked chicken and eggs is safe for humans. Consumers should not heed to baseless rumours that are unscientific and often lead to confusion," it said.These adversely affect poultry and egg markets and thereby poultry and maize farmers, who are already affected by the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, it noted.Following the central government's advisories, states are undertaking awareness generation activities through newspaper advertisements and social media platforms.Also, continued efforts to generate awareness about bird flu and how to deal with the situation are being shared among the general public through various media platforms, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook handles, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-in-poultry-confirmed-in-9-districts-of-maharashtra-culling-operation-on-in-mp-chhattisgarh-101610809141513.html

But, we don't have much hope. The intention of the government is anti-farmer, negative and there is a mindset to cater to the corporates. Our issue will not be settled by amendments. We are against the objectives of the laws," he said.Mollah said protesting farmers have decided to hold "kisan parade" on January 26 to highlight their issues including demand for repeal for three farm laws and they were holding their protest in a peaceful manner.He took exception to use of term "tractor rally" for their proposed programme on Republic Day and said it should be called "kisan parade"."The farmer unions had declared almost a month-and-a-half ago that if our grievances are not addressed properly, we would take out a kisan parade after the National Parade on the Republic Day. It would be an appeal to people to pay heed to our issues," he said."There is no question of struggle. We have been protesting for two months now and not a single instance of violence has happened and this is proof that we want a peaceful parade. There is a conspiracy to malign the farmers by calling it a struggle," he added.Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi supporting the protest by farmers, he said it is an opinion of a political party."We have never invited any political party to our protests neither have we let a political leader represent us. Farmers are the only leaders of this protest against the farm laws," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting on borders of Delhi against three farm laws and have held nine rounds of talks with the government so far. The next round of talks is scheduled for January 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-no-to-dialogue-with-govt-but-do-not-have-much-hope-farm-union-leader-101610809041574.html

Covishield, the Oxford University-AstraZenexa shot being manufactured by Serum Institute of India, was supplied to all states and Union territories and Bharat Biotech's Covasin was sent to 12 states, he added.Also read | ‘Day of tremendous relief’, says Harsh VardhanThere was a delay in uploading beneficiary list at some session sites and healthcare workers not scheduled for the first day were vaccinated but resolutions were provided for both the issues, the official said.A worker at Delhi's premier All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Manish Kumar, was the first person in India to be vaccinated against Covid-19, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched one of the world's largest immunisation campaigns to bring the pandemic under control.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog's VK Paul were also given the shots in the presence of Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.Also read | More people will turn up to get vaccinated, says defence minister Rajnath SinghAfter the vaccination of some 30 million healthcare and frontline workers, about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions will be given the shot during the country's vaccination drive.More than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, the highest number of infections after the United States, and more than 152,000 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-was-successful-on-day-1-says-union-health-ministry-101610807880788.html
16-01-2021||India||Microbiologist says Covid-19 vaccines made after in-depth study, research||Vaccines are always made with a lot of effort, and Indian Covid-19 vaccines have been made after plenty of study and research, said Dr Nandini Duggal, Head of Microbiology at Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital after taking the Covid-19 vaccine shot on Saturday.Dispelling the misinformation surrounding the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine, Dr Duggal told ANI, "There are certain tolerable reactions (cough and little pain) that people are bound to face. And they are well informed in advance."Speaking about her experience of getting vaccinated, she said, "I felt no pain. It is unlike any other vaccine. For half an hour I was kept under observation. It took barely 10 minutes. First, the verification was done. Then all other procedures were explained to us."Talking about his experience after getting vaccinated, Nitin Choudhary, Assistant Professor (Department of Anesthesia) at Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences, said, "Once you come here, they briefly tell you about the vaccination process. Thereafter, they give your consent to tell you what little you might face after the vaccines. Then the vaccine is administered.""I think everybody is a little apprehensive but looking at all those studies done on the vaccination and the information that has been provided to us, it seems pretty safe," he said."Obviously, whenever anything new comes up, there is a bit of anxiety. But since we have been frontline without the vaccine then why not with the vaccine," the Assistant Professor said adding that he is 99 per cent confident.Earlier today, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Singh Guleria along with NITI Aayog member VK Paul were administered the Covid-19 vaccine shot at AIIMS Delhi on the inaugural day of the nationwide roll-out of vaccination.Termed as the world's largest vaccination programme, covering the entire length and breadth of India, the drive aims to first vaccinate millions of its healthcare and frontline workers and then reach an estimated 3 crore people by the end of its first phase.In the first phase, government and private-sector health care workers, including Integrated Child Development Services workers, will receive the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/microbiologist-says-covid-19-vaccines-made-after-in-depth-study-research-101610807535849.html
16-01-2021||India||In bid to meet vaccine needs of other nations, India’s neighbours to be priority||The government is engaged in a complex exercise to meet foreign requirements for Covid-19 vaccines, with the initial focus on the immediate neighbourhood, though a decision on exports could take some weeks, people familiar with developments said on Saturday.As India rolls out the world’s largest Coronavirus vaccination programme that envisages covering 300 million people by July, authorities are closely tracking domestic requirements and production and delivery schedules of the two Indian vaccine manufacturers, and working out the right mix of grants and commercial sales for foreign countries, the people said on condition of anonymity.As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, there is considerable pressure on India, especially from neighbours and developing countries, to supply vaccines. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali, who was in India to co-chair a meeting of the bilateral joint commission, sought “early provision” of vaccines and was assured his country’s needs, will be a “priority consideration”.“Obviously, the priority will be the neighbourhood. A lot depends on the production and delivery capacity of the vaccine manufacturers,” said one of the people cited above.“In case of adequate capacity to meet the immediate needs of the country and neighbours, the possibility of deliveries to developing countries in other regions isn’t ruled out. We also have to work out what portion will be given as grants and what will be commercial sales,” the person added.Several countries, such as Bangladesh, have signed agreements with the Serum Institute of India for millions of doses. The people said in view of these factors, a decision on exports is expected to take a few weeks.The people brushed aside reports that India had set aside 20 million doses for its neighbours. “The figures are all up in the air. These things are still being worked out,” the person cited above said.Even within the neighbourhood, the need of some countries, such as Nepal, is pressing as they have no domestic manufacturing capabilities. Gyawali told reporters on Saturday that Nepal has framed four major criteria to determine purchases – the effectiveness of the vaccine, compatibility with Nepal’s cold storage chains, cost effectiveness, and how promptly the doses can be delivered.However, the rush to acquire Indian vaccines resulted in an embarrassing situation for the Brazilian government. Brazil’s foreign ministry announced on January 13 that an Airbus A330 aircraft was being sent to Mumbai to transport two million doses “purchased” from the Serum Institute.After the external affairs ministry announced on Thursday that decisions on exports will take more time, Brazil’s communications minister Fabio Faria tweeted on Saturday that the “mission [to Mumbai] was rescheduled due to diplomatic issues between Brazil and India and should take place in the coming days”.Besides overseas needs, India also has to meet its commitment to Gavi or the global Vaccine Alliance and its WHO-backed COVAX scheme, which aims to help 92 low and middle-income countries secure access to vaccines in 2021. Gavi has secured a commitment for 200 million does from the Serum Institute with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The people noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s commitment to help the world while launching the country’s vaccination programme on Saturday.“Today, when we have made our vaccine, the world is looking at India with hope. As our immunisation campaign progresses, many countries of the world will benefit from our experience. India's vaccines and our production capacity will benefit the whole of humanity – this is our commitment,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bid-to-meet-vaccine-needs-of-other-nations-india-s-neighbours-to-be-priority-101610804917977.html

Vardhan said a small section is spreading rumours about the vaccines, their utility and safety but a large number of people, including eminent doctors, received the shot with great joy and enthusiasm.“A debate has started that why are health ministers or people's representatives not taking the vaccine. I was asked why I am not taking the vaccine? I told them that I will wait for my turn, which will come when people above 50 years of age will be administered the vaccine,” Vardhan said.He was referring to the second stage of the immunisation drive, in which those above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with a high risk of infection, will be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease.The health minister's remark comes after a war of words between him and Congress leader Manish Tewari on Twitter. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?" Tewari had asked earlier.Following this, the health minister tweeted photos of health workers being administered the jab and accused the Congress leader and his party of being passionate about spreading distrust and rumours.Shortly after the Union health minister’s post, Tewari replied. “Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined. It is not fear Mongering.Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism. Expected better of you Sir,” he tweeted.He was referring to the death of at least 23 people shortly after receiving their first dose of a vaccine in Norway. Of them, 13 have been autopsied, with the results suggesting that common side effects may have contributed to severe reactions in frail, elderly people, Norwegian Medicines Agency was quoted as saying by news agency Bloomberg.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Covid-19 immunisation drive on Saturday. Two shots manufactured in India, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by Bharat Biotech, are being administered during the drive. Nearly 30 million health and frontline workers will be inoculated in the first phase. As many as 191,181 people received the shot on the first day, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ill-wait-for-my-turn-harsh-vardhan-s-comeback-on-why-he-is-not-taking-vaccine-101610805227726.html

People should not be afraid to receive it as it is meant for their protection,” he said.Over 800 health workers across the state were scheduled to be vaccinated on day one of the immunisation drive.This week, the state received 35,000 vaccine doses for vaccination in the first phase when 16,000 health workers will receive the first dose.Chief minister Conrad K Sangma, who launched the vaccination drive in Shillong, called the nation-wide roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine a historic and proud moment for the country. He added the launch is a positive step in the year-long fight against the virus.“We have been fighting Covid-19 for almost a year now and this has really taken a big toll… on the nation, on the economy and lives of every citizen of this nation and today this vaccine roll out is a very positive step towards our fight against Covid-19.”He asked people to not let their guard down against the virus and follow all necessary protocols to contain the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35yearold-sanitation-worker-first-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-meghalaya-101610799361284.html

So were many other doctors and nurses."As you can see, I have not felt any adverse effect even an hour after getting inoculated. I am blessed to be the first recipient...The vaccine is totally safe, effective, and we can defeat coronavirus only when all of us get vaccinated," Dr Thacker said."This is the beginningof a final war," he said, adding that misleading rumours have always dogged vaccines when they appeared two centuries ago, but one should not fall prey to them.Nurse Jalpa Gandhi has been on what she calls "Covid- 19 duty" from March 22, 2020, when the first coronavirus patient in the state was admitted to the civil hospital."I wore PPE kits when attending to patients, but there was always this apprehension that I might get infected and would end up infecting my family members. This caused me a lot of anxiety."I feel relieved after vaccination," she said.A majority of around 50 nurses who were given the vaccine shot on the first day at the civil hospital were working in Covid-19 wards, she said.Infection specialist Dr Atul Patel, another member of the state's task force on Covid-19, said feeling apprehension is normal as the vaccine on coronavirus is new, but there is no reason to worry."We know that side effects among almost half of beneficiaries (during trials) are very mild, like body pain and headache. Nearly 30 per cent may even get a fever. A fifth of the beneficiaries may even get joint and abdominal pain."But these side-effects are very mild and we should not worry too much about them as they can be easily resolved," Dr Patel said."It is the most safe and secure vaccine, which has passed through several trials and experiments," said Dr Ketan Desai, a former president of the Medical Council of India who was also among the first to get inoculated here.Of 100 health workers who were administered Covid-19 vaccine at the civil hospital, nearly half were doctors, including critical care specialist Dr Maharshi Desai, public health expert Dr Dileep Mavalankar, immunology expert Dr Sapan Pandya, and many doctors attached to the hospital itself.Medical Superintendent of the civil hospital Dr J V Modi was also vaccinated.Over 16,000 healthcare workers are set to be vaccinated on the first day across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-is-completely-safe-says-doctor-who-got-first-jab-in-gujarat-101610800019725.html

We never compare our relations with each other and we never accept interference in our domestic politics or internal affairs,” he told a group of reporters at the Nepalese embassy.“We are able to settle our problems ourselves. As a close neighbour, there may be some concerns or questions but we never accept interference,” he said, replying to a question about China’s efforts to resolve differences between factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Also read: AIIMS worker, 34, is first in India to get Covid-19 vaccineGyawali skirted a question about remarks by NCP leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had split the ruling party and dissolved Parliament on the “direction of India”, and said he also represented Prachanda and it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to comment.He defended Oli’s decision to dissolve the House of Representatives and call early elections by saying this was the outcome of long-standing “internal problems”.Gyawali added, “In a parliamentary system, if the prime minister feels the time has come to seek a fresh mandate, it is the universally accepted practice that the government can dissolve Parliament and seek a fresh mandate. By and large, democracy is a system where the public has the final authority to decide the fate of the government and the country.”Nepal was plunged into political uncertainty by Oli's decision to dissolve Parliament after problems within the NCP increased over the past few months. Amid the turmoil, China sent Guo Yezhou, the vice minister of the international department of the Communist Party of China, to Nepal to broker an understanding between the two factions of the NCP.Guo’s visit was preceded by the Chinese ambassador’s unsuccessful efforts for a patch-up between Oli and Prachanda. Guo’s efforts too didn’t yield any result.Against the backdrop of the military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India has kept a wary eye on China’s role in Nepal while maintaining a hands-off approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-never-allow-interference-in-domestic-politics-foreign-minister-gyawali-101610797475903.html

"I did not know that I am the first person to receive the vaccine. I had a good sleep last night, came here in the morning and talked to the other staff who were to get the shot," news agency PTI quoted Kumar as saying. "Many of them were scared. So, I went to my seniors and said I should be given the vaccine first. I wanted to prove to my colleagues that there is no need to be scared," Kumar also said, PTI reported.Kumar, who has been working for the hospital for the last eight years now, received the first shot of the vaccine in presence of Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and other doctors. After getting inoculated, Kumar said he will work without any hesitation now. "Earlier, I used to hesitate during duties due to coronavirus. Now, there will not be any hesitation," Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He said that while he was not worried at all, his wife was a bit nervous. "She even asked me not to take the vaccine. I told her it is just an injection. After taking the dose, I asked my mother to tell my wife that I am safe," he said, according to news agency PTI.When asked to share his experience after getting the vaccine shot, Kumar said, "I am having no issues like itching or anything. It is a big step for the country. Those who are having apprehensions after reading WhatsApp messages about these vaccines should not fear. After getting the shot, I am feeling better now."The drugs regulatory body of India has currently approved two vaccines to be used in the country. Pune-based Serum Institute of India has manufactured Covishield, the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, and Covaxin has been developed by Hyderabad's Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Medical Council of Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology.India, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases after the United States, plans to vaccinate around 300 million people in the first six to eight months of the year. Some 30 million healthcare and other frontline workers are first in line followed by about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.More than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, including more than 151,000 who have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-worker-34-is-first-in-india-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-101610797044914.html

16-01-2021||India||Expected better of you, Sir: Congress on Harsh Vardhan’s counter to vaccine criticism||A war of words erupted between Congress leader Manish Tewari and Union health minister Harsh Varshan on Saturday following the launch of the Covid-19 vaccination drive across the nation. Tewari once again raised doubts about the efficacy of Covaxin, the indigenously developed vaccine still in the third phase of trial. His remarks drew a sharp response from the health minister as he shared photos of frontline workers receiving the shot and accused the MP and the Congress party of being passionate about spreading distrust and rumours.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here“Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined. It is not fear Mongering.Look what is happening in Norway. It may be a different vaccine but do not hide behind vaccine nationalism. Expected better of you Sir,” Tewari tweeted in response to Vardhan’s post on Twitter.He was referring to the death of at least 23 people shortly after receiving their first dose of the vaccine in Norway. According to the Norwegian Medicines Agency quoted by news agency Bloomberg, 13 have been autopsied, with the results suggesting that common side effects may have contributed to severe reactions in frail, elderly people.Dear Dr @drharshvardhan Concerns that I have articulated are real & not imagined.

This goes against the entire doctrine of informed consent," he told news agency ANI. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Tewari has been a constant critic of the government’s restricted emergency use approval to Covaxin, which has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the inoculation drive on Saturday. In the first phase, nearly 30 million health and frontline workers will be vaccinated and the second group is of people over the age of 50 years, and the third will be of people under 50 with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney diseases, etc. The central government will bear the expenses on the drive in the first phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-health-minister-s-counter-to-vaccine-criticism-congress-says-concerns-are-real-not-imagined-101610794440010.html
16-01-2021||India||Demand to set new protocols, SOPs for vaccinated travellers||As Covid-19 vaccine roll out began on Saturday with inoculation of healthcare workers in the first phase, the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) appealed to the Central government to urgently set up new travel protocols for those getting vaccinated against Covid-19.In an appeal made by the national office bearers of TAAI on Saturday, Jyoti Mayal, President TAAI, said they have urged ministries of civil aviation and tourism to set guidelines for vaccinated travellers, issue verifiable certificates and set relevant standard operating procedures.The TAAI is the largest and oldest travel and tourism association in India.TAAI said that setting up of SOPs will enable vaccinated travellers to resume their activities to pre-Covid times."Every person vaccinated in India must be granted a certificate and our government should also tie-up with all countries verifying and accepting their Covid vaccine certificates,” Mayal said.TAAI said that many countries have started the process of vaccination and inoculated travellers are willing to travel to India. However, as of now, there is no clarity in terms of how their entry will be permitted. TAAI urged for a uniform policy for setting up the verification process for travel by vaccinated fliers.TAAI suggested that vaccinated people should be certified with the date of their vaccination mentioned and the requirement for a negative RT-PCR test result or quarantine for such passengers should be waived off. Besides, travel insurance should be taken by all travellers coming to India.TAAI suggested that a verifiable confirmation of vaccination, in the form of a certificate, should be issued to every vaccinated citizen and it could be linked to the Aadhar card.Currently travellers from New Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat need to carry a negative RT-PCR test result to be allowed entry into Maharashtra.The association further argued for mandatory health/travel insurance for travellers, which is covered under mediclaim / corporate medical cover policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-to-set-new-protocols-sops-for-vaccinated-travellers-101610794364782.html

Those who are spreading rumour that the vaccine is not safe, I want to say that they are not experts. It is a baseless thing and I want to tell people that they should not believe in rumours," he told PTI.Another first beneficiary Sandeep Nayar, who is the head of respiratory medicine department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital here expressed a similar sentiment."There is no local or systematic reaction. I will advise everyone to get the shots when their turn comes. Don't fall for rumours. The vaccines are safe," he said.The Covid-19 vaccination drive is underway in the national capital, with healthcare workers, who were at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, getting the first shots, as they were welcomed amid claps and cheers."I felt absolutely normal when the jab was given.

16-01-2021||India||Petitions in SC seeking direction for contempt of court proceedings against RBI Governor, others||A number of petitions had been filed before the Supreme Court seeking its direction for initiation of contempt of court proceedings and punishing Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das, and others for allegedly and willfully violating the apex court's order/directions of September 3, 2020.The top court had passed the order on the loan moratorium case in September last year and said those accounts that have not been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) as on August 31, 2020, cannot be declared as such until further notice.The petitioners -- Gorakh Pandurang Nawade, Suryakant Prabhakar Pawar, Pritam Sengupta, and Shanti Jewellers -- had filed their respective pleas through lawyer, Vishal Tiwari and Advocate-on-Record (AoR) Abhigya Kushwah, before the Supreme Court in connection with loan moratorium case.The petitioners claimed that the respondent, RBI, and others, allegedly had declared the account of the petitioners as NPA and thus flouted the stay order of the Apex Court of September 3, 2020, and thereby RBI committed contempt of court, and the Supreme Court should initiate the contempt of court proceedings against the RBI.Tiwari told that the apex court's order was flouted by many banks and borrowers suffered a lot.The petitioners also sought a direction from the top court that the contemnors should compensate for the damage caused to the petitioners by their contemptuous act, the petition stated.They also sought a direction from the Supreme Court that the respondents should grant a grace period of 90 days to the petitioner before declaring its account, NPA, the petition claimed.The respondents are duty-bound to promulgate the orders of this apex court throughout the country but they deliberately did not do it. The September 3 order was operational on all lending institutions and banks throughout the country and was passed in the favour of all borrowers' accounts to grant relief from financial stress during Covid-19, the petitioners claimed.The contemptuous act of the respondents has not only disobeyed the court's order but has also caused severe irreparable damage and loss to the petitioners (firm), the petitioners claimed.The contemptuous act of the respondents has shaken the confidence of the public and has degraded the trust of the borrowers. In this pandemic, where all borrowers are passing through the worst scenario that this stay order was operational throughout the nation and was in the public interest, the petitions stated.The stay order was operating as the life-saving drug to the petitioner but the contemptuous act of the respondent has brought a major setback to the firm and its survival has become critical, the petitioners claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petitions-in-sc-seeking-direction-for-contempt-of-court-proceedings-against-rbi-governor-others-101610791071804.html

16-01-2021||India||‘If vaccine is reliable, why no govt functionary took the shot’: Congress' Manish Tewari||Congress leader Manish Tewari once again attacked the Centre on Saturday over the vaccines against the coronavirus disease, saying they were being allowed to be used without the mandatory Phase 3 trials even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive.PM Modi launched India's vaccination drive, one of the world's biggest inoculation programmes, aimed at inoculating 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase. Two shots manufactured in India, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and the other by Bharat Biotech, are being administered during the drive."Many eminent doctors have raised questions with regard to the efficacy and safety of Covaxin with the government saying that people will not be able to choose as to which vaccine they would like to take. This goes against the entire doctrine of informed consent," Tewari said according to news agency ANI.The member of Parliament from Anandpur Sahib also questioned the reason behind government functionaries not taking the Covid-19 vaccine. “If the vaccine is so safe and reliable and the efficacy of the vaccine is beyond question then how is it that not a single functionary of the government has stepped forward to get themselves vaccinated as it has happened in other countries around the world?” Tewari asked.This is not the first time the opposition has questioned the Centre over the Covid-19 vaccine. A day after the government said that a recipient cannot choose the Covid-19 vaccine they want to be administered with, Tewari had raised doubts over the efficacy of the indigenously-developed Covaxin.“Covaxin was licensed by the government for emergency use. Now the government is saying that the recipient won't be able to pick and choose the vaccine which he's administered to. When phase 3 trials of Covaxin are not complete, it raises various concerns on its efficacy,” Tewari had told news agency ANI.As the Prime Minister launched the vaccination drive, he emphasised that “only when our scientists were assured of the power of vaccine, they gave permission for emergency use”, asking people not to pay heed to speculations about the efficacy of the shots. “We have credibility. We have earned this credibility from our track record. India produces 60% of vaccines given to children in the world. Our vaccines are made in tried and tested methods. They will give defining victory in the war against Covid,” PM Modi said in his address to the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-vaccine-is-reliable-why-no-govt-functionary-took-the-shot-congress-manish-tewari-101610786757328.html

About 150,000 staff in 700 districts have been trained to administer jabs and keep records.The government aims to manage the entire process digitally with its own app, CoWIN, which will link every vaccine dose to its recipient.11 million, 5.5 million The government has already bought 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVISHIELD shot, produced by the Serum Institute of India, and 5.5 million of Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN.72 per centCOVISHIELD is 72% effective, according to the Indian drug regulator, while Bharat Biotech says COVAXIN's last-stage trial results are expected by March.45,000 fridges, 1 bikeTo inoculate millions, India has prepared by coming up with four "mega depots" to take delivery of the vaccines and transport them to state distribution hubs in temperature-controlled vans, keeping the doses colder than 8 degrees Celsius (46.4 Fahrenheit).A total of 29,000 cold-chain points, 240 walk-in coolers, 70 walk-in freezers, 45,000 ice-lined refrigerators, 41,000 deep freezers, and 300 solar fridges are at the ready.These will be needed once the Indian summer arrives in the coming months.Three secondsGuarding the vaccine vials, the government has come up with high-security measures with armed police guarding every truck.CCTVs are in place at warehouses with entry subject to fingerprint authentication, news agency AFP reported. Automated data loggers will monitor storage temperature and transfer messages every three seconds to a central unit, AFP reported"Security measures are essential to not only address the issue of logistics and safety but also build confidence in people that the supply chain is intact, unbroken, and safe to the point of delivery," Preeti Kumar, a public health specialist told AFP.  ₹200 per doseIndia logged another feat on Saturday becoming one of the nations to provide the vaccine at a cheaper rate in the initial trial. An initial 11 million doses of Covishield, AstraZeneca's vaccine made by India's Serum Institute, at 200 rupees ($2.74) each, and 5.5 million doses of Covaxin at 206 rupees each.Serum plans later to sell the jab privately to Indian individuals and firms for 1,000 rupees ($14), raising fears that the rich will get inoculated sooner.70 DaysAuthorities say people will be given two doses of one of the vaccines -- and not one of each -- 28 days apart. Effectiveness begins 14 days after the second shot, they say.One Brazilian planeOther developing countries are banking on India for getting vaccines, and Brazil wanted to send a plane to India this weekend to collect two million doses from Serum.But President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday that "political pressure" by India had postponed the flight. Serum chief Adar Poonawalla told the Times of India it would supply Brazil in two weeks.20 million dosesIndia plans to offer 20 million doses to its neighbours, with the first batches shipped over the next two weeks, Bloomberg News reported.

There were problems with this project, to be implemented between Maharashtra and Gujarat, that still remain unsolved," the minister said.The industry should mount pressure on the Maharashtra government for this, he added.The association has launched Atmanirbhar Innovation Challenge 20-21 to promote startup ideas and bring them into reality, MAGIC director Ritesh Mishra said.This year, the challenge has received around 210 idea entries from 17 states.CMIA president Kamlesh Dhoot, Secretary Shivprasad Jaju, MAGIC director Prasad Kokil, and Ashish Garde were also present on this occasion.

16-01-2021||India||Controversy after TMC MLA’s name crops up in list of Covid vaccine recipients||A controversy erupted even before the vaccination drive could take off in West Bengal after the name of a legislator of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) figured in the list of health workers who were to receive the Covid-19 shots on Saturday.TMC MLA Sourav Chakraborty later dropped out, after questions were raised by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The ruling TMC said that it was an error, which has been rectified.Chakraborty, a TMC MLA from Alipurduar in north Bengal, holds a PhD degree. His name was the first in the list of health care workers who were to receive the vaccine at Alipurduar district hospital.“There must have been a communication gap on the part of the district health department as I hold a PhD degree and I am also the chairman of Rogi Kalyan Samiti (patient welfare committee) in the district hospital. The moment I came to know that my name figured in the list of health workers, I contacted the district chief medical officer of health (CMOH) and refused to take the vaccine. I am at Alipurduar district hospital overseeing the vaccination programme,” said Chakraborty.But the BJP took potshots at the TMC.“The MLA must have tried to hoodwink people by getting the first vaccine as he holds a doctorate degree and is not a doctor. As the news became public, the ruling TMC and Chakraborty in particular have been ridiculed by common people,” said Ganga Prasad Sharma, BJP Alipurduar district committee president.The chief medical officer for health of Alipurduar, Girish Chandra Bera, could not be contacted.“The MLA’s name figured in the list as the chairman of Rogi Kalyan Samiti and as he also writes his name as Dr Chakraborty. The health department should have cross-checked,” said a doctor of the hospital, who didn’t wish to be named.The TMC leadership downplayed the incident, saying that it was an error that was being blown out of proportion.“To err is human. As if the BJP leaders do not make any mistakes and are always right. The matter has ended because Chakraborty has himself dropped his name. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee has strictly directed that only health workers should get the vaccine,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson and minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/controversy-after-tmc-mla-s-name-crops-up-in-list-of-covid-vaccine-recipients-101610783165479.html

When the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gave emergency-use authorisation to Covaxin, it was allowed in "clinical trial mode" where the consent of the beneficiaries is must before vaccination.'Defining victory in war against virus': PM Modi launches Covid-19 vaccine drive"In case of any adverse events or serious adverse events, you will be provided medically recognized standard of care in government-designated and authorised centres or hospitals," the form said. If there is any serious adverse event which can be proved to be causally related to the vaccine, then Bharat Biotech will compensate, it says. "The vaccine has demonstrated the ability to produce antibodies against Covid-19. However, the clinical efficacy of Covaxin is yet to be established and it is still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials. Hence, it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to Covid-19 need not be followed," it said.The vaccinator too will have to give a declaration that he or she has reviewed the details of side effects with the vaccine recipient. The vaccinator will also have to confirm that the recipient was allowed to ask questions about the vaccination.The recipient will be asked nine questions, which are included in the consent form:1. Are you feeling sick today?2. Have you had a Covid-19 test in the last 14 days or been told by a healthcare provider to isolate or quarantine at home?3. Have you been treated with antibody therapy in the past 90 days. Details if yes.4. Have you ever had a serious allergic reaction?5. Have you had any vaccines in the past 28 days? Details if yes6. Are you pregnant or considering becoming pregnant?7. Are you a nursing mother?8. Are you on any medication for a long-standing disease?9. Are you taking radiotherapy?The Centre earlier instructed states to not vaccinate pregnant or lactating women or people below 18 years of age. For the vaccination drive, the Centre procured 55 lakh doses of Covaxin of which 16.5 lakh doses have come at free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-will-compensate-if-what-covaxin-consent-form-says-101610782493100.html

16-01-2021||India||In Photos: India begins its Covid-19 vaccination drive||India launched one of the world’s largest coronavirus vaccination drives on Saturday, setting in motion a complex deployment plan aimed at stemming the wide spread of infections across a nation of more than 1.3 billion people.At hospitals and vaccination centers across major Indian cities -- from Mumbai to New Delhi -- tens of thousands of key frontline workers began queuing, some to receive the first vaccines while others to administer them. Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off the program with a speech addressing more than 3,000 centers across India where the first shots were to be given.“These vaccines will help India win the battle against the virus,” Modi said, adding that Indians should get the shots and not pay heed to any anti-vaccine propaganda.In a hospital in Mumbai, health workers chanted the name of the Hindu god Ganesha, believed to bless new beginnings, as they moved vials from cold storage to the vaccination sites. Many health workers and hospital staff shortlisted to be inoculated on the first day of the campaign said they were relieved to be on the list.The inoculation campaign across the world’s second-most populous country will showcase whether Covid-19 can be swiftly tamed in nations with disjointed health and transportation networks. Officially, more than 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the disease that has also killed at least 150,000 in the country.India has granted emergency licenses to the two-dose vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Serum Institute of India Ltd. The latter partnered with AstraZeneca Plc to make at least one billion doses of their shot. New Delhi already made its first purchase of 11 million Astra shots, as well as 5.5 million vials of Covaxin, the indigenous inoculation produced by Bharat Biotech.Plans drawn up by India’s health ministry outline steps to vaccinate 300 million people in the first stage through August.In an initial round, 30 million health care and front line workers -- such as the police and defense forces -- will receive injections. The second phase is targeted at about 270 million people above the age of 50 and those at particular risk to Covid. The process will draw on existing networks used to vaccinate tens of millions of babies each year against diseases such as polio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-photos-india-begins-its-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101610778099096.html

16-01-2021||India||Punjab CM writes to PM Modi to provide free vaccine to poor of state||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking free vaccine delivery to the poor population of the state.Punjab will kickstart the process of vaccination of 1.74 lakh health workers with 40,000 to be covered every day over the next five days in the first phase.The Chief Minister, while acknowledging the receipt of 2,04,500 doses of Covishield vaccine, thanked the PM Modi for making the vaccine available on priority to the Health Care Workers (HCWs) of the State and Central Government in Punjab.At the same time, he earnestly requested him to consider providing free vaccine to the poor population with a view to lessen the disease burden and also ensuring a check on the further spread of transmission thereby allowing more economic activity.Referring to reports citing some central government sources that apart from the HCWs and Front Line Workers (FLWs), the remaining population may not be provided free vaccine, Captain Amarinder pointed out in his letter that "the people of the State have gone through a very difficult time due to Covid-19 wherein economic activities have nosedived and the economy has still not recovered from this shock.""It would be difficult for the poorer sections of society to pay for the vaccination," he said."All steps are in place to ensure vaccination of HCWs on priority, with FLWs to follow in the next phase. The State has adequate capacity for storing as well as transportation of the vaccine," he wrote.He further added that a sufficient number of vaccination sites have been identified and all logistics tied up. An adequate number of vaccinators have been identified, and trained and sufficient number of teams have been mobilised and trained to manage the vaccination sessions.Pointing out that "the Covid-19 pandemic has been an unparalleled disaster in living memory, and heavy expenditure had to be incurred in our coronavirus response," the Chief Minister further wrote that his government had already requested the Centre that the accumulated balances with the state in the State Disaster Relief Fund may be permitted to be used as necessary for Covid-19 response. "The MHA may kindly approve this to allow pending payments to be cleared," he urged the PM.An official spokesperson meanwhile said that Captain Amarinder will go live on Saturday morning to initiate the process of vaccinating the health workers in the state as part of the nationwide launch of the vaccination programme, shortly after the PM launches it for the country.The Chief Minister will kickstart Punjab's vaccination drive from Mohali at 11.30 am, with a total of 59 vaccination sites to be functional in the first phase. Since a specific number of vaccination doses have been received so far for the health care workers whose details were shared by the state government with the Centre, he himself will now take the vaccine in the next phase, said the spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-to-provide-free-vaccine-to-poor-of-state-101610779672109.html

Maybe, the government chose me as the first recipient of the vaccine in Assam based on my contributions," Umesh Chandra Sarma said."I would request all to get vaccinated without any fear or apprehension so that we are able to defeat Covid-19. I would also appeal not to get into a debate on efficacy of different vaccines as they have been released for mass use after going through proper research.”A GMCH graduate, Dr Sarma did his MD in preventive and social medicine from the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University. He has also received a degree in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.He was administered the first dose of the vaccine by Daisy Das, a nurse at GMCH. “I am very happy to be the first person to administer the vaccine in Assam,” Das told a local TV channel.The Assam government had chosen 12 senior doctors for the vaccination on Saturday.Dhrubajyoti Borah, a former principal of the Barpeta Medical College and Hospital, was the second to get vaccinated followed by Ilias Ali, Padmashri recipient and former head of department of surgery at GMCH.In Assam, around 190,000 doctors, nurses, hospital staff, lab technicians, and ambulance drivers would get vaccinated in the first vaccination stage followed by nearly 100,000 police and paramilitary personnel.“It is a historic moment and we will remember it for our entire lives. The first phase would be over by April. We have requested the Centre to give us additional vaccines so that officials on poll duty for the assembly election due in April are vaccinated,” said Himanta Biswa Sarma.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal took part in a similar ceremony at Assam Medical College Hospital in Dibrugarh.A total of 8,651 vaccinators have been trained for the vaccination under the supervision of 1,300 doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-get-into-efficacy-debate-take-vaccine-without-fear-assam-s-first-recipient-101610779442701.html

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories will conduct phase II and III trials, they added.“This is an important milestone in the progress of this pivotal clinical trial of the vaccine. We expect to commence the phase III study within this month and will continue to fast-track our efforts to bring in a safe and efficacious vaccine for the Indian population,” said GV Prasad, co-chairman and managing director, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.The phase III study will involve 1,500 subjects as part of the randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in India.Earlier, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed the safety data from the phase II clinical trial of the vaccine and recommended the phase III recruitment.In its report, the Board concluded that no safety concerns were identified and the study met the primary endpoints of safety.In September, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund to conduct the clinical trials of the vaccine and distribute its rights in India.Sputnik V has been developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. It became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the established human adenoviral vector platform.The vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed at 91.4% based on data analysis of the final control point of clinical trials in Russia.Currently, the vaccine’s clinical trials are underway in the UAE, Egypt, Venezuela, and Belarus. It has been registered in Algeria, Argentina, Belarus, Bolivia, and Serbia for inoculation.The vaccine's data was submitted to DCGI last week. It was examined by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation’s subject expert committee. On January 13, the committee recommended that phase III trials of Sputnik V can continue based on the submitted data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russian-sputnik-vaccine-gets-phase-3-trials-approval-in-india-101610779138187.html
16-01-2021||India||'Defining victory in war against virus': PM Modi launches Covid-19 vaccine drive||Indian vaccines made through “tried and tested methods” will deliver defining victory in the war against Covid, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, launching the world’s biggest vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease.An estimated 300,000 health care workers across 3,006 vaccination sites will be inoculated on Saturday, setting the tone for immunizing 30 million health care and frontline workers in the first phase. The first shot was administered in AIIMS, Delhi.Prime Minister Modi emphasised that “only when our scientists are assured of the power of vaccine, they gave permission for emergency use”, asking people not to pay heed to speculations about the efficacy of the shots.“We have credibility. We have earned this credibility from our track record. India produces 60% of vaccines given to children in the world. Our vaccines are made in tried and tested methods. They will give defining victory in the war against covid,” the PM said in his address to the nation.He hailed "atmabiswas and atmanirbharta (self-confidence and self-reliance)" as the engines of India’s vaccination drive. He said: “Indian vaccines are cheaper than foreign vaccines. There are some foreign vaccines with each dose costing ₹5,000, and also require a minus 70 degree Celsius temperature for storage.”The PM described the vaccine allotment formula as humanitarian and, in an emotional tone, described how in the difficult days in the war against Covid, several health care and frontline workers sacrificed their lives.“As we think about those days, we become sad. But in those days of crisis, there were people who put their lives in danger to save us. Our doctors, nurses, paramedic, ambulance drivers, police, Asha, and other frontline workers. They gave priority to their duties. Many of them stayed away from their families, didn’t go home. There are many friends who will never return home. They sacrificed their lives to save us,” Modi said.“India’s vaccination programme is based on humanitarian principles. Our doctors, nurses, medical and para medical staff are eligible to get a vaccine before others,” he added.The PM reminded the beneficiaries to get the second dose of vaccines and described how trials and dry runs were conducted with the help of state governments for a successful launch.“Two doses of the Corona vaccine is absolutely essential. Don’t make the mistake of not taking the second dose. Two weeks after the second dose, you will develop power to combat Corona. The way you remained patient during the war with Covid, you must show the same patience in the vaccination,” he said.He pointed out that over 100 countries have a population of less than 30 million, while India is vaccinating 30 million people in the first stage alone.“That’s why India’s vaccination programme is so big. That’s why the vaccination drive will underline India’s strength,” Modi added.The PM also defended all the measures to tackle Covid and emphasised that the government took the right decisions in right time. He narrated the long journey of forming a committee on January 17, becoming the first country to screen passengers at airports, and how his idea of janta curfew “mentally prepared the country for lockdown.”He admitted that the federal lockdown was a difficult task and said, “We knew it was difficult to keep such a large population inside home. We knew what will be the impact on economy. But we treaded on 'jaan hai to jahan hai' formula.”He also took digs at Pakistan that did little to expatriate its people from China. “We kept examples before the world. When some countries left their citizens in China, India expatriated its own people and also those of other countries. The world recognised the mettle of India. We showed how, states and the Centre can work together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defining-victory-in-war-against-virus-pm-modi-launches-covid-19-vaccine-drive-101610778095384.html

In that what came as a veiled dig at Pakistan, PM Modi said, "When countries left their citizens stuck in China amid the pandemic, India stepped up. We evacuated not only Indians but also people from other countries under Vande Bharat Mission," PM Modi said.It may be noted that Pakistan initially refused to airlift and evacuate its people from Wuhan, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The country reportedly cited "larger interests" of the region defending its decision to not evacuate Pakistanis who were staying in China at that time.'People should stay away from rumours, propaganda,' PM Modi at vaccine launchThe first case of Covid-19 in India was reported on January 30 in Kerala in a student returned from Wuhan. Soon, the ministry of external affairs and the civil aviation ministry arranged special flights to evacuate all people stranded in Wuhan.Click here for live updates of vaccine launchReports and videos of Pakistani students appealing for help to Air India evacuation jets in Wuhan went viral in February following which it was speculated whether India would offer help to Pakistani students as well.In February, minister of external affairs S Jaishankar told the Rajya Sabha that before India sent the first two Air India flights, it had offered to bring back all people in the neighbourhood. "This was an offer which was made to all our neighbours, but of them, seven nationals of Maldives chose to avail the offer. But the offer was made to everybody," the minister had said.Some Indian students had also chosen to stay back in Wuhan at that time.

"The mothers cried for their children and had to stay away. People could not meet their elderly admitted at hospitals. We could not bid adieu to those with proper rituals who died due to corona," he added.The vaccination programme, aimed at inoculating 3 crore health and other frontline workers first, will use shots manufactured in India - one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, the other by Bharat Biotech with the country's top clinical research body.Health workers, people over 50 and those deemed at high-risk are prioritised to receive one of the two approved vaccines.Meanwhile, India's Covid-19 caseload rose to 1,05,42,841 with 15,158 people testing positive for the infection in a day, while the recoveries have surged to 1,01,79,715 , according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Saturday.The country's deaths increased to 1,52,093 with 175 daily new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 1,01,79,715 pushing the national Covid-19 recovery rate to 96.56 per cent, while the Covid-19 case fatality rate stands at 1.44 per cent.

16-01-2021||India||I&B ministry starts work on self-regulation law for OTT platforms, online news||In a move aimed at providing a level-playing field in the media, the Narendra Modi government has decided to bring in an overarching statute that will provide for self-regulation in digital media including Over-the-top (OTT) platforms and news websites to address issues of sensitive video content and fake news, people familiar with the matter said. There are at least 40 OTT platforms including multinationals like Netflix, Amazon Prime and HotStar and hundreds of news content websites.The issue of self-regulation in digital media was taken up at the highest levels this month. Subsequently, the ministry of information and broadcasting decided to frame an overarching statute under which the digital media can self-regulate itself, a senior government official said.“Like the print media has the Press Council of India, films have the Central Board of Film Certification and TV channels are broadly regulated under The Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, the digital media which has been unregulated till now, will soon have an overarching regulation for redressal of complaints on content,” the official said.The market size of OTT platforms in India is close to ₹1,000 crore with around 20 crore users. Some of the OTT platforms are accessed through annual subscription fees, while a large number of them are free in a bid to attract subscribers.A second government official said the I&B ministry was conscious that the proposed legal regime should not curtail the freedom enjoyed by the sector and has been engaging with the Internet and Mobile Association of India for more than a year on self-regulation. The association is representing the interests of the OTT platforms.It is, however, felt that the self-regulating mechanism proposed by the association is tilted too heavily in favour of the OTT platforms. The other issue that the I&B ministry is trying to rectify is that while there is a mechanism to redress grievances involving the print and cable media, there is no such platform available for the digital media.The I&B ministry has been receiving complaints from the public over the adult content and language shown in OTT platforms that sometimes borders on soft porn. There have also been complaints against single-shop digital news websites for creating discontent in society by indulging in fake news without any redressal or retraction.The government is also examining the Australian model where multinational tech platforms such as Google and Facebook have been asked to pay for local news content. However, tech platforms like YouTube have explained to the government that they or other platforms only upload content from parties with which they have an agreement or are subscribers of the platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ib-ministry-works-on-self-regulation-law-for-ott-platforms-and-digital-media-101610774195596.html

Many other institutions have opted for a hybrid model of online and in-person teaching.Razdan said she got in touch with Harvard because of the anomalies, which she said she had initially dismissed as a manifestation of the “new normal” caused by the pandemic.Razdan said she provided Harvard some of the “correspondence” she had been sent in relation to the employment offer. “After hearing from the University, I have now learnt that I have been a victim of a sophisticated and coordinated phishing attack,” she wrote in her statement on the issue.Phishing is a cyber-crime in which fraudsters pose as someone trustworthy to lure victims into sharing personal information.Razdan said in her statement she has lodged a complaint with the police and requested “immediate steps to identify, apprehend and prosecute perpetrators of this abominable attack”.Razdan’s statement was not clear which Harvard school or faculty made her the purported offer. The Harvard University’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences does not have a department of journalism. In fact, the university does not have a professional school of journalism.It is understood that names referenced as members of human resources in the documents shared by Razdan were not found on Harvard’s employee rolls and a number of irregularities are understood to have been found by Harvard in the agreement document, which would have formalized the purported employment offer.For one, Harvard faculty appointments are not graded as might have been the case in Razdan’s documents, shared with the university.Two, many of the provisions in the agreement do not apply to Harvard faculty members. It could not be immediately ascertained what those provisions were.Third, and lastly, two of the claimed signatories of the agreement are believed to have indicated that they did not execute the attached agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nidhi-razdan-phishing-attack-harvard-doesn-t-have-journalism-department-101610774388925.html

A total of 3,006 session sites across all states and union territories have been virtually connected during the launch of the vaccine.Billed as the world's largest vaccination program, covering the entire length and breadth of the country, the drive aims to first inoculate millions of its healthcare and frontline workers and reach an estimated 3 crore people by the end of its first phase.Around 100 beneficiaries will be vaccinated at each session site on the inaugural day, the union health ministry has said.In the first phase government and private sector health care workers, including Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) workers, will receive the vaccine.The drive will be held daily from 9 am to 5 pm, except on the days earmarked for routine immunisation programmes.In the next phases of the vaccination drive, people aged over 50, and those who are below 50 years but have serious health conditions or co-morbidities will be vaccinated, according to the health ministry.Dry-runs at vaccination centres across the country have been held with lakhs of healthcare staff across districts being trained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-make-mistake-of-taking-off-mask-after-getting-1st-dose-of-vaccine-pm-modi-101610773678446.html
16-01-2021||India||'People should stay away from rumours, propaganda,' PM Modi at vaccine launch||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the biggest vaccination drive of the world and congratulated India and its scientists on the achievement. "It takes years to prepare vaccines. But in the shortest span of time, we have not only one but two India-made vaccines," PM Modi said heaping praises on scientists."There are 100 countries which do not have a population of 3 crore but India in the first phase will inoculate 3 crore healthcare workers. In the next step, we will take this number to 30 crore. There are only three countries in the world with more than 30 crore population: India, the US and China. Hence, this is going to be the biggest vaccination drive," PM Modi said.Allaying fears regarding made-in-India vaccines, PM Modi said India enjoys scientific credibility in the world. "Around 60% children of the world get vaccines that are manufactured in India. The world puts trust in India's vaccine science and research."India begins the world’s #LargestVaccineDrive. This is a day of pride, a celebration of the prowess of our scientists and hardwork of our medical fraternity, nursing staff, police personnel and sanitation workers.May everyone be healthy and free from illness. pic.twitter.com/AEpMMEAyzRIn his speech, PM Modi talked about the affordability and the user-friendly nature of Indian vaccines. "Some foreign-made vaccines need to be stored at minus 70-degree Celsius temperature. One dose of some vaccines costs over ₹5,000. Compared to that, Indian vaccines are cheaper and are also easy to use," PM Modi said. It may be noted Pfizer vaccine, which also applied for emergency use authorisation in India, requires minus 70-degree Celsius for long-term preservation.PM Modi also cautioned beneficiaries against lowering their guards after getting the vaccine shot. "Remember, these vaccines comprise two shots. And taking both the shots is necessary. It will also take some time after the second shot to show some effects. So, don't be impatient," PM Modi said.It was an honour for me to join our courageous Corona Warriors at AIIMS, Delhi on this momentous occasion.As a fitting tribute to their selfless service, our healthcare workers & frontline workers will be the 1st to be inoculated #COVID19 vaccine. pic.twitter.com/HCRCVEy7sXWhy India chose healthcare workers as the first beneficiaries? "The country owes this to our healthcare workers, their tireless efforts throughout the pandemic," PM Modi said.Elaborating on how India was prepared at every stage of the pandemic, PM Modi said, "The first case in India was detected on January 30, 2020. But an expert group was formed before that. Then Janta curfew prepared us for the lockdown that was to come. It was not an easy decision to make sure that this huge population remains where they were.""There are certain areas in the country which did not lose one single person to Covid-19," PM Modi said commenting on the present Covid-19 situation of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-vaccine-drive-watch-live-vaccine-india-news-developments-101610772751327.html

16-01-2021||India||Delhi-NCR air in severe category, temperatures to dip in northwest India||Air quality remains in 'severe' category in many parts of Delhi NCR on Saturday. Delhi's air quality index this morning is 441, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida also recorded 'severe' air quality which negatively impacts even the healthy.This is mainly due to low wind speed not allowing dispersal of pollutants in the air. Due to dry north/north westerly winds, minimum temperatures are likely to fall by 2-4 degree Celsius over most parts of northwest India during the next two days, according to the India Meteorological Department.Dense to very dense fog at isolated pockets are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, north Rajasthan, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar during the next 3 days.Cold wave or 'severe’ cold wave conditions are also very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and east Madhya Pradesh during the next two days. Cold day conditions at isolated pockets are also very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during the next two-three days, as per the weather department.According to IMD, a cold day or a severe cold day is classified as such based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees C and maximum temperature of 4.5 degree C or 6.4 degree C below normal, respectively.A cold wave occurs in the plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lower than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degree C in the plains.A cyclonic circulation is lying over southwest Bay of Bengal off Tamil Nadu coast in mid tropospheric levels and a trough runs over central parts of south Arabian Sea and adjoining equatorial Indian Ocean to the Comorin area.The condition is likely to result in scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala, Mahe and Lakshadweep area during the next two days and a reduction in rainfall activities thereafter, as per IMD bulletin.Conditions are becoming favourable for the cessation of northeast monsoon rains over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, Kerala and Mahe and adjoining areas of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, Rayalaseema and interiors of south Karnataka around January 19, IMD's Friday bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-ncr-air-in-severe-category-temperatures-to-dip-in-northwest-india-101610766346143.html
16-01-2021||India||Rapid blood test to identify patients at highest risk of severe Covid-19||Scientists have developed a rapid blood test that can predict within a day of hospitalisation which patients with Covid-19 are at the highest risk of severe complications or death, an advance that may help identify those who may best benefit from specific investigational treatments.The test, described in the journal JCI Insight, measures levels of mitochondrial DNA -- a unique type of genetic material that normally resides inside the energy factories of cells.According to the researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine at St. Louis in the US, mitochondrial DNA spilling out of cells and into the bloodstream indicates that a type of violent cell death is taking place in the body."Doctors need better tools to evaluate the status of Covid-19 patients as early as possible because many of the treatments are in short supply, and we know that some patients will get better without intensive treatments," said study co-author Andrew E. Gelman."We need to understand why some patients, irrespective of their ages or underlying health in some cases, go into this hyperinflammatory death spiral. Our study suggests that tissue damage may be one cause of this spiral, since the mitochondrial DNA that is released is itself an inflammatory molecule," Gelman added.Viruses are known to cause a type of tissue damage called necrosis that is a violent, inflammatory response to the infection, the researchers said, adding that this may lead to cells breaking open and releasing their contents including mitochondrial DNA."In Covid-19 patients, there has been anecdotal evidence of this type of cell and tissue damage in the lung, heart and kidney. We think it's possible that measures of mitochondrial DNA in the blood may be an early sign of this type of cell death in vital organs," Gelman explained.The scientists believe the new test could help predict disease severity and also act as a tool to better design clinical trials -- identifying patients who might benefit from specific investigational treatments."We will need larger trials to verify what we found in this study, but if we could determine in the first 24 hours of admission whether a patient is likely to need dialysis or intubation or medication to keep their blood pressure from dropping too low," said Hrishikesh S. Kulkarni, another co-author of the research.In the study, the researchers assessed 97 patients with Covid-19, measuring their mitochondrial DNA levels on the first day of their hospital stays.They found that mitochondrial DNA levels were much higher in patients who eventually were admitted to the ICU, intubated or died.According to the study, this association held independently of a patient's age, sex and underlying health conditions.It noted that mitochondrial DNA levels were about tenfold higher in patients with Covid-19 who developed severe lung dysfunction or eventually died.Those with elevated levels were almost six times more likely to be intubated, three times more likely to be admitted to the ICU and almost twice as likely to die compared with those with lower levels, the scientists said.They said the test could also predict outcomes as well as, or better than, existing markers of inflammation currently measured in patients hospitalised with Covid-19.According to the scientists, the test is quick to perform, returning results in less than an hour, and uses the same machinery that processes the standard PCR test for Covid-19.They said the method allows mitochondrial DNA levels to be quantified directly from patient blood samples without requiring intermediate steps to extract the DNA from the blood.The researchers hope to verify that the test is accurate in a larger multi-center trial before applying for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-blood-test-to-identify-patients-at-highest-risk-of-severe-covid19-101610764975487.html
16-01-2021||India||Covid-19: Nationwide vaccination drive to start today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Saturday launch the world’s biggest Covid vaccination programme in India, covering 300,000 recipients across 3,006 sites in the country on the opening day, according to the official schedule drawn up by the government.In several parts of the country, eminent persons and doctors will be among the first to take a jab, apart from nurses, sanitation and anganwadi workers, driving home the message that the vaccine is safe.Modi is expected to address the nation and interact with some of the beneficiaries in various states. According to officials across India, video conferencing arrangements have been made for the interaction and a webcast of the PM’s address would be done at almost all vaccination centres in the country.Each centre will deploy vaccines from a single manufacturer to avoid mixing of doses in recipients, which is not permitted, said officials involved in the delivery programme that will be launched at 10.30am.“If you consider a vaccination booth as a single unit then that unit will get vaccine supplies of a single Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer only. It will be either Covaxin or Covisheld so that there is no mixing of vaccines. As per the current plan, both the doses given to an individual will be from the same manufacturer. This will be to avoid any confusion,” said Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.States have been given a free hand to increase the number of session sites, if needed, as a single site cannot administer the vaccine to more than 100 beneficiaries in a day. District administrators can create additional session sites at any location by entering the pin code, followed by specifying the locality or village, and subsequently assigning a vaccinator.“We have to engage with people at many levels as part of the confidence building drive with regard to the Covid-19 vaccines. The objective is to assure them about their safety concerns in a scientific manner, put a rest to all unscientific fears and build confidence among large sections of people,” said Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev.On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to the people to stay alert against “misinformation” on the vaccine and focus on scientific expertise behind its making.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan reviewed preparedness for the vaccination drive on Friday and also visited the ministry’s Covid control room to have a look at last-minute arrangements.The main purpose of the review was to check the working of the CoWIN app, the digital platform that is the backbone of the delivery management system. The app will facilitate real-time information of vaccine stocks, storage temperature and individualised tracking of beneficiaries, besides assisting programme managers across national, state, and district levels. It will help track beneficiary coverage, dropouts, sessions planned versus those held and vaccine utilisation by volume.“The platform enables national and state administrators to view and sort data of beneficiaries as per their gender, age and co-morbidity. They can also view the metadata of vaccinations and adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) reported from constituent districts across states and Union territories,” the health ministry said in a statement.The ministry started the control room in April last year to monitor and analyse district-wise Covid-19 data from across the country and to interpret and evaluate the status of the pandemic.In Delhi, 8,100 recipients will get the vaccine at 81 centres across the Capital. All health and sanitation workers getting the vaccine have been registered on CoWIN and each vaccination is expected to take 10-15 minutes.Vaccines reached the states by Thursday, and have been kept in refrigerated rooms. Each beneficiary will receive a text message about the time of their vaccination to prevent rush at the centres. States have formed committees having a cardiologist and neurologist to monitor cases of adverse effects of the vaccine, if any.In Tamil Nadu, Dr K Vinay Kumar, joint director (immunisation), directorate of public health and preventive medicine, said the vaccine will be administered on intramuscular parts such as in the arm, leg or back. Tamil Nadu has identified 10 prominent personalities in the medical field to take the vaccine to allay fears, state health minister C Vijayabhaskar said.Dr Arun Sharma, 53, medical superintendent of the government super-specialty hospital in Jammu, would be among the first receivers. “I eagerly look forward to get the first jab on Saturday,” Sharma said.In Assam, Dr Umesh Chandra Sarma, retired vice-chancellor, Srimanta Sankardeva University of Health Sciences, who would receive the first vaccine, said he was not apprehensive as he was a specialist in preventive medicine.“I would request all to get vaccinated without any fear or apprehension so that we are able to defeat Covid-19,” he said. The Assam health department has invited 12 eminent persons to get the first doses of the vaccine including Sharma and Dr Dhrubajyoti Borah, former president of Assam Sahitya Sabha, the state’s biggest literary body, said health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.Principal, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, Dr Sudheer Bhandari will be the first person in Rajasthan to be vaccinated with Covishield. “I have no inhibition in taking the vaccine as it is scientific and like any other flu shot. I am very comfortable,” he said. PK Kundu, former head of the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata, who would be the first to take the vaccine shot in Kolkata, said, “My family members, especially my wife, were a bit wary as I am going to take the vaccine in the first lot. But, there is nothing to worry about.”In Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will inaugurate the vaccination drive at Mohali. Among the first to receive the shots will be health workers and safai karamcharis (sanitation staff). West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will launch the programme from the state secretariat and will interact with some beneficiaries. The Chhattisgarh government will launch the vaccination at 99 centres in the state, a health department official said, adding the state had received 332,000 doses of Covishield.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-21-101610765146253.html
16-01-2021||India||Rest for at least half an hour: Centre's guideline ahead of vaccination Day 1||Health care workers who will be vaccinated as India begins its emergency vaccination drive from today onwards have been asked to rest at least for half an hour after getting vaccinated at the vaccine centre itself. All vaccine sites have three marked areas for waiting, vaccination and observation. After one gets the jab, it has been advised to not leave the site immediately as the effects of the shot, if any, will be monitored. In all these areas, where the presence of more than one person is possible, Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, including the wearing of masks and social distancing, is to be followed.Though India has been carrying out large-scale vaccination drives for decades, since this is going to be the world's largest vaccination against the deadly Covid-19, precautionary measures are being taken.Sanitation workers, Padma awardee doctor, MP: List of 1st vaccine beneficiariesThe Centre has already specified age, medical, physical conditions which are not suitable for vaccination.Vaccinators and officials have also been trained on how to respond if there is any AEFI (adverse event following immunisation).Click here for live updates of Covid-19 vaccination driveAs the ministry has listed, Covishield, the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine locally manufactured by Serum Institute of India, can lead to tenderness and pain at the part of the body injected with the vaccine, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia, chills and arthralgia, nausea.Paracetamol may be used to provide symptomatic relief from post-vaccination adverse reactions.Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech, may lead to injection site pain, headache, fatigue, fever, body ache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomitting, dizziness-giddiness, tremor, sweating, cold, cough and injection site swelling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rest-for-at-least-half-an-hour-centre-s-guideline-ahead-of-vaccination-day-1-101610765113706.html
16-01-2021||India||Number Theory: How much does an average Indian earn?||India’s per capita annual income in 2019-20 was ₹1,26,968, according to provisional estimates published on January 7. This average, given India’s large income inequality, is not representative of the earnings of average Indians. Because India does not publish income statistics, and because consumption estimates, which are the next best proxy, have not been published since 2011-12, there is a debate around average incomes of Indians across class and social groups.To be sure, private surveys such as the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) have published income statistics. However, they do not enjoy the sanctity of official data. The report on the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), which was undertaken under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in 2017-18, is the first to given an idea about average incomes of Indians.To be sure, LASI is based on a relatively small sample (42,249 households), and its reference frame is confined to households which had at least one person aged 45 years or higher.Also, unit level data for LASI is yet to be released. These caveats notwithstanding, the results offer some interesting insights.2. Even the top 20% earn less than a lakh per yearThe LASI report gives a quintile-wise (bottom to top 20%) distribution on income statistics. It shows that even the top 20% of households earn less than .1 lakh per annum per capita. The bottom 20% of households earn just ₹25,825 per year per capita.LASI also gives quintile-wise per capita incomes for different professions. It shows that intra-class income inequality is the largest among non-agricultural businesses and the self-employed, while it is the smallest among those employed in agriculture. This is a trend which holds for caste-wise and rural-urban inequality as well.3. The rich seem to be gaining more from govt subsidies6% of India’s central budget was spent on subsidies according to the 2020-21 Budget. There has always been a debate on whether or not they benefit those at the bottom of the pyramid. The LASI report has tried to answer this question by estimating per capita income from government/-public transfers. This has been defined as income received from a list of 13 kinds of government transfers such as agricultural subsidies or subsidies on LPG cylinders. The statistics present an interesting challenge for the government. India does well when it comes to social and spatial targeting of subsidies, but the rich still end up gaining more from them. Households living in villages or belonging to Scheduled Tribes (STs), Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) report higher per capita incomes from subsidies than the ones living in cities or not belonging to these social groups. Despite this, top 20% of households get ₹1.43 of government support for every rupee which goes to the poorest households from such spending.4. Most Indians are a content lot, but it could be a result of economic ghettoisationEven at such low income levels, almost half of Indians think of themselves as being at par with their peers. What is even more surprising is the fact that this feeling hardly changes whether one looks at the poorest or the richest households. To be sure, these statistics could be a reflection of an entrenched economic ghettoisation in India. This is because respondents were asked to choose options on how they perceived their financial condition compared to other households in the same geographic community. On average, perceived destitution (financial condition being well below average) is 3.4 times more widespread than perceived opulence (financial condition being well above average) in India. This divide is greater in rural areas compared to urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-much-does-an-average-indian-earn-101610760612856.html

"They want to suppress the farmers and those who come in support of them," alleged Hooda.The Congress leader also demanded the special Assembly session and said that being public representatives we should raise the voice of the country's farmers."We tried to meet Governor and demand for the special Assembly session to raise our voice for the farmers.

16-01-2021||India||‘We are not in the game of greed for power’: Kumari Selja||Haryana Congress president, Kumari Selja said on Friday that she sincerely hopes that Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) MLAs and Independents supporting the Manohar Lal Khattar regime in Haryana would vote against the government in the state assembly. In an interview, the former Union minister said that many of these MLAs have openly opposed the three farm laws and people hope they will support the no confidence motion in the assembly. ExcerptsQ: What’s your reading of the farmers versus government standoff over the farm laws?Ans: The government has led the farmers up the garden path. While the patience of the farmers is laudable and they have maintained peace, the Central government has refused to understand their pain and pay heed to their demands. The government has decided to go ahead with the three farm laws and this will only lead to cartelization. These laws only favour big business houses and not the farming community.Q: Assuming you were to take a decision to resolve the standoff and pacify protesting farmers, what would’ve been your action plan?A: My action plan would have been to repeal the three laws. The Congress would have never enacted such anti-farmer legislation. We listen to the people first and give them what they want. The decisions taken by the BJP-led NDA government always work to the advantage of the big business houses. In fact, their actions are autocratic rather than democratic.Q: A number of JJP MLAs and Independents supporting the state government have spoken against the three farm laws. Do you think they would vote against the state government in case there’s a trust vote in the assembly?Ans: We would urge upon them to listen to their conscience and the woes of the farmers. I hope they would vote against the government in the assembly.Q: Does the Congress see any hope of forming the government with the support of disgruntled MLAs?Ans: We are not in the game of greed for power. But there can never be a vacuum in the political space. However, whatever happens has to happen in tune with the Constitution. Whenever a situation arises, the Congress will act as per the Constitution.Q: Who is the bigger loser in the entire episode – the BJP or the JJP?Ans: Unfortunately, kisan and mazdoor have been the biggest losers during the BJP-JJP rule. This is an opportunistic alliance formed merely to grab power. The JJP contested assembly elections against the BJP but in their hunger for power, the two came together. People will hold them accountable. They are already facing opposition from the public across the state. People will extract political price from them during the elections. Any government that does not have its ears to the ground and is insensitive to the people’s concerns will face consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-not-in-the-game-of-greed-for-power-kumari-selja-101610762819896.html

The ninth round of discussions between the government and farm unions on Friday ended in a deadlock with the next round set for January 19.During the meeting, union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar urged the farmers to be flexible and asserted that the government has been accommodative and has already accepted several demands.The government also proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on laws”.“There were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision. We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,” Tomar said. Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.Follow all the updates here:Bihar Congress vows not to let farm laws take effect; march to support farmersHundreds of Congress workers took out a march in Patna on Friday to support the farmers’ agitation against the three controversial farms laws passed by the Central government.

His comments were in reaction to a sit-in staged by Congress workers here against recent farm laws of the Centre and the rising fuel prices. Describing it as "political hypocrisy", Poonia said the frustration of power slipping out of the Congress's hand is visible on the faces of its leaders, adding that "they should get used to sit in the opposition".

It will be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 10.30am, followed by his address to the nation.The campaign will be held from 9am to 5pm on all days but those earmarked for routine immunisation programme. A record 300,000 health care workers across the country are scheduled to get vaccinated on the first day of the campaign and as many as 3,006 vaccination sites have been set up nationally for the day.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"This will be the world’s largest vaccination programme covering the entire length and breadth of the country," PM Modi's office said in a statement this week.The funding of the first two groups of those getting vaccinated—the healthcare and frontline workers—will be done entirely by the Centre. The drive will be held for these groups at various public health care facilities both in rural and urban India.Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine has reached all state capitals and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a backup to Covishield, has also reached some states.In his speech, PM Modi is expected to assure the nation that the vaccines are safe to use as they underwent a rigorous process of testing. He is also expected to talk about the need to fight against the misinformation campaign by vested interest groups aimed at creating fear among the people, an official familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times.Also Read | PM Modi set to launch world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive: Key things to knowIn a meeting with chief ministers of states with a high number of Covid-19 cases held earlier last month, the PM had said that the government will ensure every citizen gets a coronavirus vaccine but the candidates must first pass all scientific tests. "If speed is important, then safety is equally important," he had said.According to Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani, who also attended the meeting, “PM made it clear that in the first stage, the vaccine will be given to the frontline health workers, in the second stage to the police personnel, sanitation workers etc; to those above 50 years of age in third stage; and to those with co-morbid conditions in the fourth stage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-drive-pm-modi-to-address-the-nation-at-1030am-101610757562200.html
16-01-2021||India||Journalist Nidhi Razdan says Harvard teaching offer was an online fraud||The former executive editor of NDTV, Nidhi Razdan, on Friday said she was the victim of an elaborate online fraud that prompted the journalist to resign from her job and accept a teaching position — which has now turned out to be non-existent — at the prestigious Harvard University in the United States.According to the journalist, known for anchoring one of the channel’s flagship shows, Left, Right and Centre, she was offered the position of an associate professor of journalism in June last year and was supposed to join the Ivy League institution in the semester beginning September. She was later given the impression that this was delayed, and that classes would begin in January 2021.“Along with this, I noticed a number of administrative anomalies,” she wrote in her statement posted on Twitter. “At first, I had dismissed these anomalies as part of being reflective of the new normal being dictated by the pandemic, but recently the representations being made to me were of an even more disquieting nature.”After that, she said, without giving a timeline, she reached out to senior authorities at the university and found out that the offer was fraudulent. “The perpetrators of this attack used clever forgeries and misrepresentations to obtain access to my personal data and communication, and may have also gained access to my devices and email/ social media accounts,” Razdan, who worked at NDTV for 21 years, said.The journalist said on Friday that she has filed a complaint with the Jammu & Kashmir Police cyber cell. “I hope that the police are able to get to the bottom of the attack on me at the earliest,” Razdan said, adding in another post that she was “overwhelmed” by the support she had received on social media.Joshua Benton, a former journalist who founded the university’s news website, Nieman Lab, said there is no journalism department or journalism professors at Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences.“She (Razan) was apparently under the impression she was joining the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), which is the main faculty [for Harvard College and the Graduate School]. FAS definitely doesn’t have any journalism professors or offer any journalism degree,” he tweeted.Till the time of going to print, there was no official response from Harvard University.

16-01-2021||India||Will march in strength to Delhi, say farmers||Farmer groups camped at Singhu border said more agitators were joining them daily to strengthen their protests and their plan to march to Delhi in tractors on January 26.Farmers said on Friday, the ninth round of talks also failed with the government and every failed negotiation had only further strengthened their spirit and has fuelled the ongoing agitation. Nothing less than repeal of the three contentious farm laws were acceptable to them, they said.Dr Darshan Pal, member of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, who is also the president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, Punjab, said farmers are coming in large numbers to all the border points of Delhi.“In Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, there are frequent tractor marches and a large number of farmers are reaching Delhi. The enthusiasm of farmers has increased due to the huge support we have received…this movement is fanning out across the nation. Under the banner of ‘Mumbai for Farmers’, the Maharashtra farmers’ organization, along with other progressive groups, are organizing a huge rally,” he said.Pal said, farmers in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are continuing with an indefinite sit-in strike. “Kisan Delhi Chalo Yatra started from Odisha on January 15. The march will reach farmers at Delhi borders on January 21 after travelling via West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Kisan Jyoti March was started from Pune on January 12 and will reach Delhi on January 26,” the farmer leader said, adding that more than 500 farmers from Kerala have already reached the Shahjahanpur border.On Thursday, protest at Singhu border continued to be peaceful with farmer groups raising slogans, carrying out marches, cooking and distributing food at langars and delivering speeches.Manmeet Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar, who has spent almost ten days camping at Singhu border, said more people known to him have joined the protest since he left home.“Whoever I talk to, back home, say they are ready to come. Some, who had come left for their homes in December are again planning to come with more ration and cloths. They all plan to be here before Republic Day. Not everyone will march. We plan to support them from here by continuing the movement,” Singh said.Delhi Police continued to maintain their usual deployment with senior police officer ensuring round the clock presence at the posts that have been set up temporarily since the protests began. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said the deployment remained same as usual and will be stepped up as and when required. “The situation is being monitored continuously. We are also using drones for surveillance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-march-in-strength-to-delhi-say-farmers-101610754493435.html

16-01-2021||India||Build confidence in Covid vaccines, govt tells districts||As Delhi prepares to deliver the first jabs to its health care workers, officials of all the districts of the capital have been directed by the administration to build confidence among the masses regarding Covid-19 vaccines.The officials, according to orders of the administration, are required to address safety concerns of citizens through awareness drives, ongoing door-to-door health surveys and speak over phone with people registered for the vaccination.“We have to engage with people at many levels as part of the confidence building drive with regard to the Covid-19 vaccines. The objective is to assure them about their safety concerns in a scientific manner, put a rest to all unscientific fears and build confidence among large sections of people,” said Delhi chief secretary, Vijay Dev.On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to the people to stay alert against “misinformation” on the vaccine and focus on scientific expertise behind its making.Earlier this month, the health department of the government had already deployed accredited social health activists and anganwadi workers in a confidence-building drive, focusing on low-income group localities to address issues related to vaccine hesitancy”.This week, the revenue districts have been directed to systematically launch awareness programmes focused on confidence-building and addressing vaccine hesitancy. “They have also been asked to develop a system under which people registered for vaccination in their districts would get phone calls, reminding them of date, time, venue. The caller would also try to address hesitancies, if any, and help in confidence building. Right now, the government already has a system in place to help give reminders for the second dose of the vaccine. That too can be used,” said a second senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.Starting Saturday, Covid vaccine will be administered to health care workers, their numbers estimated at 300,000 in Delhi. This will be followed by vaccination of an estimated 600,000 front line workers. Registration for front line workers – which includes the police, sanitation workers, teachers, and officials from departments directly engaged in Covid-19 management — is currently in progress. The next in line for vaccination will be an estimated 4.2 million people aged more than 50 years and individuals with co-morbidities, whose numbers are yet to be ascertained.Experts have called for greater dialogue to increase vaccine acceptance.“Everything is ready. Now, we have to ensure that the beneficiaries actually take the vaccine,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College.She said, the health care workers who understand the science, are the ones asking the most questions.“The health care workers are the ones to be immunised first and they understand the science; that is the reason many of them have doubts and questions. The drug regulator has approved the vaccines, they are safe. People should take it because it is better than getting the disease, which can also have long-lasting sequelae (conditions following the disease, such as lung fibrosis in Covid-19),” said Garg.Promila Pargayi, a nurse at GTB hospital vaccination, said, “I do want to get the vaccine but I will wait for a few days to see what kind of adverse reactions people are getting. After all, most of us have been working in Covid-19 wards and have already had the infection. It protects us for some time at least.”Rekha Sharma, another health care worker based in Delhi, too said that she would rather wait and watch for some time. “I have diabetes and hypertension, so I am at a high risk . That is the reason I want to take the vaccine, but I want to wait a couple of days before getting it,” she said.A senior doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said, “There are some who are extremely excited about the vaccination drive. However, there are others who would like to wait and see what happens for sometime and those who would like to avoid getting immunised at the moment. In the first phase, medical professionals and those who work in the medical facilities will be vaccinated. Most of them are aware about Covid and to an extent about the vaccine. Large scale communication campaigns would be necessary for when the government starts roll out of the vaccines among the general public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/build-confidence-in-covid-vaccines-govt-tells-districts-101610749222947.html
16-01-2021||India||Delhi HC objects to WhatsApp asking judge not to hear PIL||The Delhi high court on Friday took strong objection to an e-mail sent by WhatsApp to a judge, asking asked her not to hear a plea challenging its new privacy policy.Justice Pratibha M Singh said the e-mail, which was later withdrawn, was completely unwarranted because she was anyway going to recuse herself from hearing the case filed by lawyer Chaitanya Rohilla, who has contended that WhatsApp’s updated policy virtually scrutinises the personal profile of a user 360 degrees, thereby violating the individual’s Right to Privacy.The petition also said that WhatsApp has put a “Damocles sword on its users” to accept its new privacy policy by February 8.When the matter was listed on Friday, justice Singh mentioned the e-mail in open court. “The court has received an e-mail. I take strong objection to that. There was no need to send this e-mail. I was, myself not going to hear this matter,” she said.WhatsApp, through its counsel, had written to the court suggesting that justice Singh should not hear the matter because she appeared as a senior counsel against WhatsApp in a matter in the Supreme Court in 2016. That case also pertained to WhatsApp’s privacy policy, and is still pending in the court. WhatsApp also sent an e-mail to the Registrar General of the Delhi high court, asking that the bench be changed.On Friday, the senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for WhatsApp, acceded that they should not have sent the e-mail. Advocate Tejas Karia, the counsel who had sent the e-mail on behalf of WhatsApp, apologised to the court, and said that he would withdraw it.The court posted the matter for Monday, when it will be heard by some other bench subject to the orders of the chief justice of the Delhi high court.The plea, filed by Rohilla, said that WhatApp’s new norms, which users must mandatorily accept by February 8, jeopardise the national security of the country by sharing, transmitting and storing user data in some another country.It alleged that WhatsApp was integrating people into Facebook so that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram (another subsidiary of Facebook) all become part of one package.Rohilla, through his counsel Manohar Lal, also contended that updated privacy policy essentially takes away the choice to not share their data with other Facebook-owned and third-party apps.He added that WhatsApp, through the policy, is clearly trying to share its user data to the parent company and other companies which will eventually use that data to serve their vested interests.The new privacy policy, which was rolled out by WhatsApp, owned by Facebook Inc, on January 4, includes mandatory sharing of data with the parent company. The decision to share data was first floated in 2016, post WhatsApp’s acquisition by Facebook, but until last week, users already on the platform before the acquisition had the choice of not sharing that data. That choice no longer exists. The move has faced backlash globally -- especially in WhatsApp’s biggest market India where it has 400 million users -- with people en masse defecting to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram.Experts said that the new policy may damage WhatsApp’s prospects in India. “Legally, there was no choice for customers who were required to either agree to the revised terms, or were to be denied the upgrade. Though WhatsApp has managed to retain its monopoly, next action of this nature, and Indian users are likely to migrate to Signal and Telegram,” said Major Nirvikar Singh (Retd), a Supreme Court lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-objects-to-whatsapp-asking-judge-not-to-hear-pil-101610748572504.html
16-01-2021||India||Farm bills have potential but cannot ignore those adversely affected: IMF||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes the farm bills passed by the Indian government have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms, a spokesperson of the organisation said here.There is, however, a need to strengthen the social safety net for those who might be adversely affected by the transition to the new system, Gerry Rice, Director of Communications at IMF, said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday.“We believe the farm bills do have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India,” Rice said.“The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middlemen, enhance efficiency and support rural growth,” he added.“However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system,” the spokesperson said responding to a question on the ongoing protests by farmers against the laws in the country.This can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms, he said.“And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform,” Rice said.The Congress on Friday vowed to continue their protests till the farm laws are repealed by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-bills-have-potential-but-cannot-ignore-101610748030759.html

The biennial elections to 12 seats of the Council will be held on January 28.“The central election committee of the Bharatiya Janata Party has approved the names of Swatantra Dev Singh, Dr Dinesh Sharma, Laxman Prasad Acharya and Arvind Kumar Sharma as candidates for the upcoming biennial election for the Legislative Council in UP,” read a release issued by the BJP, according to news agency ANI.State BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and the party’s state unit vice-president Laxaman Prasad Acharya are sitting members of the Council. Their term, along with that of nine other members belonging to other political parties, ends on January 30.On Thursday, Sharma had joined the party after taking voluntary retirement from service earlier this week. He was due to retire in July 2022.“Certainly, the party has some big plans for Sharma. It will be naïve to believe that he sought VRS from the country’s elite service, when he still had about two years to retire, just to become an MLC,” said a senior BJP leader who did not wish to be named.Sharma, a 1988 batch ex-IAS officer, was moved to the Prime Minister’s Office after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-fields-former-ias-officer-as-its-candidate-for-up-mlc-elections-101610747419660.html

The BJP government will have to take these black laws back,” news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Reacting to this, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh said: “The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself had promised these reforms and therefore, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying then or are lying now.”Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national Capital, demanding the repeal of the laws. While several of them marched towards Baijal’s residence, the Delhi Police stopped the protestors by barricading the route. This also led to a face-off between the two sides, during which senior Congress leader Alka Lamba was allegedly injured.However, Anto Alphonse, DCP (north), said that Lamba was not assaulted by the police. “She had a string entwined in her hand. The string was tied to balloons and a placard. In the melee that happened in the crowd, she may have got injured by the string tied to her hand. We have video evidence for this,” he said.Meanwhile, in Chandigarh, former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and in Uttar Pradesh, Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and other workers were allegedly taken into custody during the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-won-t-relent-till-centre-repeals-black-laws-says-rahul-101610746892474.html
16-01-2021||India||After protests, Goa CM announces relocation of IIT project from Melaulim, says CM||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday announced that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Goa campus that was to be set up at Melaulim village would be shifted to another place in the state.The decision caps more than six months of protests largely by the residents of Melaulim village who had refused to concede land and had set up a blockade at the entrance to the site refusing to allow government surveyors to enter the village to demarcate the land. On January 6, at least 12 policemen and several villagers were injured when both the groups had clashed as the police attempted to clear the blockade set up by the villagers.“We wanted the IIT project in Sattari so that the region is developed. (Health minister and MLA from Valpoi in Sattari Vishwajit) Rane also tried to explain (to the villagers). We had also invited the villagers for discussion, but they wouldn’t relent,” Sawant told reporters.On Friday, elected representatives from the neighbouring villages in Sattari submitted a formal request to the CM asking him to shift the project elsewhere.“The whole idea to bring the IIT to Sattari was for the development of Sattari and the development of the whole taluka and the neighbouring talukas. But if the people do not want the IIT in Sattari, I would like to make a humble request to please take a decision to shift the IIT out of Sattari and from Shel Melaulim,” the representation signed by around half a dozen district panchayat members, said.Bowing to the request of the elected representatives of the villages, Sawant said, “This government listens to the people. The government has decided to shift the project from Sattari to another place in Goa. We will be informing the IIT officials and a future decision will be taken to honour requests made by the elected representatives. Both me and health Minister had no personal interest in going ahead with the project.”Notably, on Tuesday, in a letter to CM, Rane had urged him to drop the proposal for an IIT campus at the village.“I want to assure the people of Sattari that for as long as I’m in politics and the representative of this area, we will not allow anyone to even put a single stone in place for the IIT because the people don’t want it,” Rane had said.In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 10 lakh sq. mts land in Melaulim village in North Goa, for setting up of IIT-Goa. Functional since 2014, the IIT Goa has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College.Melaulim village falls in an eco-sensitive zone but hasn’t been formally declared so with notifications not being formally issued. The land on which the IIT is scheduled to come up is revenue land belonging to the government, but the villagers have said that situation has persisted only because they did not have the required documentation to prove that they have rights over it.Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were scrapped, in face of protests from local residents.Villagers have opposed the project claiming that they are dependent on the land for their sustenance including cashews, betel nut and other agricultural produce.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-protests-goa-cm-announces-relocation-of-iit-project-from-melaulim-says-cm-101610745945286.html

All BSP workers must unitedly start preparing for these elections,” she said.The term of the 403-member UP assembly comes to an end in May, 2022 and that of the 70-member Uttarakhand assembly ends in March 2022.The BSP won no seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. It bagged 19 seats in the 2017 UP assembly polls and 10 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, when it fought in an alliance with the Samajwadi Party. It parted ways with the SP soon after the results were declared.The BSP leader also urged the Centre to accept all the demands of agitating farmers including repeal of the three farm laws.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, while welcoming the Covid-19 inoculation drive, requested the Centre to provide the vaccine for free to the common man. She said if her party comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, it will ensure that everyone gets the vaccine for free.She said if that doesn’t happen, the respective states should ensure that people get the vaccine for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-go-it-alone-in-uttarakhand-up-101610745079399.html
16-01-2021||India||CBI ‘bribe-for-relief’ racket was running since 2018, finds probe||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has found that a “bribe-for-relief” racket was being run in the agency since 2018 by leaking confidential case related information to some companies being investigated for bank fraud, people familiar with the development said.The agency has identified bribes worth ₹55 lakh paid to two of its officers– Deputy Superintendent of Police , R K Rishi ( ₹30 lakh) and Inspector Kapil Dhankad ( ₹25 lakh) – in lieu of favours extended to at least three companies.In all, nine persons have been named in a First Information Report, including four CBI officers: Rishi (deployed at CBI academy); Dhankad (who is posted in Bank Securities and Fraud Cell BS&FC of CBI); DSP R K Sangwan (posted in Special Crimes Unit) and Stenographer in BS&FC , Sameer Kumar Singh.Two advocates, Arvind Kumar Gupta and Manohar Malik have also been named along with Mandeep Kaur Dhillon (additional director of a company, Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd); and Sujai Desai and Udai Desai of Mumbai based company Frost International Pvt Ltd.According to the FIR, reviewed by HT, the four CBI officers, along with the two advocates, and certain other accused have been “compromising the integrity of investigation of certain cases on extraneous pecuniary considerations”.Both Shree Shyam Pulp & Board Mills Pvt Ltd (SSPBML) and Frost International are being investigated by CBI for defrauding banks. The case against Frost International was registered in August 2020 for cheating 14 banks of over ₹3500 crore.The CBI FIR states that “in the case of SSPNML, R K Sangwan, who was previous investigating officer of the case, offered and paid a bribe of ₹10 lakh in cash on behalf of Mandeep Kaur to Inspector Kapil Dhankad”. “On his part, Dhankad conveyed confidential information relating to the investigation of this case to R K Sangwan, with an intention to favour the accused”.It adds that R K Rishi paid ₹10 lakh bribe to Dhankad on behalf of Desais of Frost International.Rishi himself received ₹15 lakh twice through advocates Malik and Gupta (having their offices in Defence Colony, Delhi), to extend favours to a Chandigarh based company against which a corruption case was being investigated by CBI, the FIR said. “In this matter, Dhankad twice received ₹2.5 lakh from Gupta for having brokered the deal through Rishi.”The agency FIR says that “details of investigation of many other cases including confidential notes and directions have been communicated by (Sameer Kumar) Singh to Sangwan and Rishi on pecuniary considerations to protect the interests of the accused”.The two DSPs , R K Rishi and R K Sangwan, facilitated the bribes by leaking the information to the companies, said an officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.“The leak of sensitive case related information like raids, status of investigation, filing of charge sheet etc helps accused persons in destroying the evidence. There is a possibility that more officers are involved in the scandal as CBI investigations are monitored at various levels and documents are usually kept in respective branches. It is to be seen how Singh was leaking the documents without anyone’s knowledge,” said another CBI officer who didn’t want to be named.CBI is investigating the magnitude of the racket, as it could be much bigger considering large number of bank fraud cases are under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-bribe-for-relief-racket-was-running-since-2018-finds-probe-101610744767412.html
16-01-2021||India||Panel ignored advice on bidder: Officials||Two committees of senior bureaucrats sidestepped a suggestion by a junior official in the public private partnership (PPP) cell of the finance ministry to restrict a bidder from operating more than two airports on the grounds that the bidding clause would restrict private interests in airport privatisation, according to people aware of the matter. The Adani group clinched the six airports — Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Lucknow, Guwahati, Thiruvananthapuram and Mangaluru — in a global competitive bid by offering the highest revenue share to the government.The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2018 gave “in-principle” approval for leasing out six airports of the state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) through the public private partnership appraisal committee (PPPAC), chaired by the economic affairs secretary, and the empowered group of secretaries headed by the CEO of Niti Aayog to frame the bidding parameters for the leasing of assets to private entities, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“After elaborate inter-departmental discussions, the committees finally framed and approved the bidding parameters that did not impose any restriction on the number of airports held by one single bidder. Both the finance ministry and the Niti Aayog had apex level of representation [chairpersons of the respective panels] in the two committees,” one of them, a government official, said.The empowered group of secretaries headed by the CEO of Niti Aayog was created by the cabinet on November 8, 2018, a second official said. “It had the highest representation of ministries concerned, with the top official of Niti Aayog as its chairman, and other members included the civil aviation secretary, economic affairs secretary and expenditure secretary. This committee had the cabinet’s mandate to decide on any issue falling beyond the scope of the PPPAC,” he said.Both the economic affairs secretary and the expenditure secretary are top bureaucrats of the Union finance ministry.The Indian Express published a report on Friday saying the finance ministry and the Niti Aayog had raised red flags before Adani’s clean sweep of six airports. In February 2019, the AAI had declared Adani Enterprises Ltd the highest bidder for all six airports.The ministries of finance and civil aviation, the Niti Aayog and the Adani group did not respond to email queries on the matter.The government awarded airports to Adani on merit after evaluating open competitive bids and elaborate interdepartmental consultations. Some departments did raise certain issues, which were suitably addressed before the awarding the projects, the two officials quoted above said.“It was global competitive bidding. Compared to five-six bidders, Adani offered the highest revenue [share] to the government in each projects. There was no bar on number of projects one could bid for. Hence, it emerged the winning bidder,” the first official said.The second official said Adani’s bids were significantly high compared to the next highest bidders.“On average Adani offered about 24% more revenue than the next highest bidders that included existing airport operators and international firms. Any deviation from the bidding condition would have serious legal and audit implications,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-ignored-advice-on-bidder-officials-101610744178353.html
16-01-2021||India||Army displays drone swarming prowess||The Indian Army on Friday demonstrated its new drone swarming capability at the Army Day 2021 parade in Delhi Cantt with 75 locally designed and developed drones hovering in the sky and simulating a raft of missions including offensive operations.“The drones executed an array of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled simulated offensive missions and close support tasks during the parade,” the army said in a statement.Drones within a swarm can carry out a wide range of missions including strikes against tanks, infantry combat vehicles, ammunition holding areas, fuel dumps and terror launch pads, officials said.The army’s drone swarming capability is under development, though it has been tested for HADR (humanitarian assistance and disaster relief) roles, which are largely dropping medicines and essential items. The technology is being developed by the army in partnership with a Bengaluru-based start-up NewSpace Research and Technologies.“This demonstration is a recognition of the Indian Army’s steady embrace of emerging and disruptive technologies to transform itself from a manpower- intensive to a technology-enabled force to meet future security challenges,” army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said. “In a kamikaze mission, the drones can strike at a range of 100km,” the officials added.The Army is investing heavily into AI, autonomous weapon systems, quantum technologies and robotics to achieve a convergence between its war-fighting philosophies and military attributes of these technologies, the statement said. “One such project is the AI offensive drone operations... This project symbolises the beginning of the Indian Army’s tryst with autonomy in weapon platforms and showcases the army’s commitment towards merging the cutting-edge of digital technologies with its human resource,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-displays-drone-swarming-prowess-101610743692284.html
16-01-2021||India||Don’t test India’s patience, Army chief warns China||In a blunt message to China in the midst of a lingering border standoff in eastern Ladakh, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Friday said that India was committed to resolving the situation along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) through talks, but no one should test India’s patience.The border standoff is in its ninth month, with multiple rounds on military and diplomatic talks failing to break the deadlock. “We are committed to resolving disputes through talks and political efforts. However, no one should make the mistake of testing India’s patience,” Naravane said during his customary Army Day address at a parade in Delhi Cantt, where the force put up a display of its military might including the maiden demonstration of an underdevelopment drone swarming capability.The army chief added that India had given a fitting response to the [Chinese] conspiracy to unilaterally change the status quo in the Ladakh theatre, where the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have deployed more than 100,000 combat-ready soldiers and advanced weaponry.He also assured the country that the sacrifice of the Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan valley on June 15, 2020 would not go in vain -- the Chinese PLA also suffered heavy casualties in the brawl but Beijing has kept the figures under wraps. Naravane said the morale of soldiers deployed in forward areas in the Ladakh sector was higher than the mountains they were defending despite the extreme weather conditions. He said India will continue with its efforts to resolve the prevailing situation on the basis of principles of “mutual and equal security”.The army chief has conveyed to China unequivocally that India is prepared for any eventuality, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). “The message is clear --- if push comes to shove, India will take the necessary actions in the Ladakh sector,” Jaswal added.In a separate message published on army day, Naravane said the Indian Army has been “swift and decisive” in its response to counter the PLA’s attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo on LAC.Naravane, in a media briefing on January 12, said the army was prepared to hold ground in eastern Ladakh “for as long as it takes” to achieve national objectives in case the ongoing military and diplomatic talks with China to reduce tensions are “prolonged,” even as he described a joint threat from China and Pakistan as “very potent”.On the situation along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan, the army chief said in Friday’s address that 300 to 400 terrorists were present in terror training camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and waiting to sneak into India.He said ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army along the LoC increased by 44% in 2020 compared to 2019, exposing the neighbour’s attempts to help terrorists infiltrate into the country. Ceasefire violations are usually a cover to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir.He added that the army’s operations along the LoC not only caused heavy losses to the enemy but also thwarted many infiltration attempts. He said the army killed 200 terrorists at the LoC and in counterterror operations in the hinterland.Speaking about capability building at a time when India faces challenges from China and Pakistan, Naravane said the army invoked emergency and fast-track procedures in 38 cases to buy weapons and systems last year to sharper its combat edge. The army also concluded capital procurements worth ₹13,000 crore last year, he said.On January 12, the army chief said there was no doubt that India faced a collusive threat from China and Pakistan. “There is indeed increased cooperation between China and Pakistan in both military and non-military fields. And a two-front threat is very much something that we have to be prepared for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-test-india-s-patience-army-chief-warns-china-101610743297059.html
16-01-2021||India||Kathmandu requests early provision of vaccines||Nepal on Friday requested the early provision of Covid-19 vaccines by India even as Nepalese foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali raised an ongoing border row during a one-on-one meeting with his counterpart S Jaishankar to push for an early resolution.Gyawali, in India with a delegation that includes Nepal’s foreign and health secretaries, co-chaired a meeting of the bilateral joint commission with Jaishankar and reviewed all aspects of cooperation, ranging from connectivity and trade to water resources and border management.Both sides have worked closely to combat the pandemic, and the Nepalese side lauded India on its success in the production of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines and “requested for early provision of vaccines to Nepal”, the external affairs ministry said.Nepal is looking to India to provide vaccines as grant assistance for the first phase of its vaccination programme, which requires 12 million doses to cover 20% of its population.During his one-on-one meeting with Jaishankar, Gyawali raised the border row that took ties to a low last year, people familiar with the discussions said. Gyawali pressed for speedy steps, including meetings of bilateral mechanisms that handle the boundary issue, to facilitate a resolution.There was no official word from both sides on these discussions, though Gyawali referred to the border issue during a speech at the Indian Council of World Affairs. He said both sides have shown wisdom by continuing overall engagements despite differences on this issue. “We are also mindful that we should not let any outstanding issue...become [an] irritant in an otherwise friendly relationship,” he said. The row erupted after Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli issued a new map that included Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are part of Indian territory. The map was published in response to India’s opening of a road to Lipulekh, located on the border with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kathmandu-requests-early-provision-of-vaccines-101610742655793.html
16-01-2021||India||Ladakh personnel may be among first from the force to get vaccine||Military doctors, paramedics and front-line soldiers deployed in eastern Ladakh, where India and China are locked in a tense border standoff, will be among the first set of armed forces personnel to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease, with India all set to kick off an elaborate vaccination campaign on Saturday, officials familiar with the development said on Friday.At least 12,000 doses of the vaccine have reached Ladakh of which around 4,000 have been earmarked for armed forces personnel to protect them from Covid-19, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.“The top priority is being given to military doctors and medical staff who have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Front-line soldiers have also been identified for vaccination,” the officials said.The armed forces have been able to keep a check on the spread of the disease within its ranks by adhering to strict protocols, even as army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane described the pandemic and the situation on the northern borders as the main challenges the army confronted last year.Experts said it was critical to protect frontline military personnel from the disease.“It is absolutely critical to vaccinate the military medical staff and front-line soldiers against Covid-19, given the crucial role being discharged by them in harsh conditions. Others who are not directly part of the military set up but play a key role in keeping the system in forward areas up and running should also get the vaccine on priority,” said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services.He said the armed forces would have prioritised the list of personnel who have to be vaccinated ahead of others keeping their roles and service conditions in mind. “I am sure all drills are in place to ensure that people are vaccinated on priority according to the government’s guidelines,” Chopra added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on January 16 to start Covid-19 vaccination in India. As many as 3,006 vaccination centres will be part of this drive.The vaccination campaign, marking the final phase in India’s long battle against the pandemic, will be held daily from 9am to 5pm, barring the days earmarked for routine immunisation programme.Officials involved in the preparations said that all pallets of Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccines have reached state capitals and their distribution to the districts and blocks is on. Similarly, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, a backup to Covishield, has also arrived in some state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-personnel-may-be-among-first-from-the-force-to-get-vaccine-101610742226683.html
16-01-2021||India||President Kovind donates Rs5 lakh for Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya||President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday contributed Rs.500,100 for the construction of the Ram temple at Ayodhya. The amount was handed over to a delegation comprising the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s international working president Alok Kumar, treasurer of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerath Kshetra trust, Govind Dev Giri and former bureaucrat Nripendra Misra, who is the head of the temple construction committee.Kumar said in a letter given along with the money, the President has specified that the donation was in his personal capacity. “He is the first citizen of the country so we went to him to initiate this drive,” he said.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu’s family has also donated an undisclosed amount.The VHP, an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideological parent, was at the forefront of the Ram mandir construction movement. It has now been mandated to collect funds for the temple’s construction by the temple trust.According to VHP functionaries, the construction of the temple is expected to incur an expenditure of Rs.300-400 crore while the overall cost of the development of the temple complex which will have a prayer hall and an auditorium will be about Rs.1100 crore.“Money is being collected from individuals as no state funding will be accepted for the construction. Volunteers will spread out to 5.25 lakh villages seeking funds from people across castes and communities,” said a VHP functionary who asked not to be named.According to a second VHP functionary , so far, 75,000 people have contributed for the construction, of which 70,000 paid through online platforms. Donations are also being received in cash at the counters set up in Ayodhya. “ The collection boxes kept near the temple receive about Rs.15-20 lakh a month. Earlier, before the Supreme Court’s verdict this amount was in the range of Rs.2-2.5 lakh.”As part of the collection drive, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat also visited a Valmiki Temple in Delhi where he was given a cheque for an undisclosed amount by the head of the temple, Krishna Shah Vidyarthi.Other leaders contributeOthers who contributed on Friday include Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath (Rs.2 lakh); Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Rs.1 lakh); BJP leader and former MP chief minister Uma Bharti, CM of Uttarkhand Trivendra Singh Rawat who gave Rs.1.51 lakh; Uttarakhand governor Devirani Maurya who gave Rs.1.21 lakh; UP governor Anandiben Patel donated Rs.2 lakh; and a former legislator from Tezgaon in Uttar Rae, Bareli Surendra Bahadur Singh who gave Rs.1.11 crore .Governor of Jharkhand Draupadi Murmu has also contributed an undisclosed amount.In Delhi, where a camp office for the trust was set up, Rs.24 crore was collected on the first day itself, said a third person aware of the details.The fund collection campaign will be carried out between January 15 and February 27. “No payments will be made without receipts.

16-01-2021||India||Delhi air in toxic zone, could get worse today||lready in the “severe” category, Delhi’s air quality deteriorated further on Friday with the AQI nearly maxing out at several monitoring stations and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warning that the pollution levels may rise further and enter the “severe plus” or “emergency” category by Saturday.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed the overall air quality index (AQI) in the Capital at 460, deteriorating from Thursday’s 429.The temperatures in Delhi rose slightly on Friday but IMD scientists said the respite was brief, adding mercury will fall again from Saturday before it starts to rise again on January 18.On Friday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, settled at 6.4 degree Celsius, a notch below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 20.8 degree Celsius. On Thursday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 2 degree Celsius, five degrees less than what is considered normal for the season.IMD scientists said the minimum temperature would hover around 4-5 degree Celsius on Saturday and Sunday, and would slightly rise from Monday.CPCB’s hourly recordings of particulate matter levels also showed a rising trend. At 6pm on Friday, the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had remained above the 300ug/m3 mark for over 22 hours. The PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) was also inching closer to the 500ug/m3 mark.The acceptable standards of PM 2.5 levels in India is 60ug/m3 and for PM 10 is 100ug/m3.IMD scientists said the pollution levels are expected to get worse through Friday night and the air quality is likely to reach “emergency” levels by Saturday.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said that an improvement is likely only from January 18, when the wind direction will change from north-westerly to easterly.“The winds are calm and the ventilation conditions are not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. There is a forecast for pollution levels deteriorating even more through Friday night. The levels will stay in the ‘severe plus’ zone even on Saturday,” said Soni.At 7pm on Friday, a number of air quality monitoring stations were nearly maxed out. The hourly average AQI in RK Puram, Mathura Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Rohini, Narela, Okhla phase-II and Chandni Chowk had reached.Road, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Rohini, Narela, Okhla phase-II and Chandni Chowk had reached above 480. The maximum value on the AQI scale is 500.Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), said the city-state was looking at the “first prolonged extreme air pollution event of 2021”. “Extremely low ventilation and shallow boundary layer height is adding to the severity. Surface winds are calm and the minimum temperature is likely to fall further from Saturday. The AQI is forecasted to deteriorate further and rapidly,” the Safar forecast read.Boundary layer is the lowest part of the atmosphere, which changes according to factors such as temperature. The lower the boundary layer, lesser the space for pollutants to mix with air and disperse. This leads to pollutants being trapped closer to the ground.Despite the warning from the IMD and Safar, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) are yet to issue any precautionary directions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).The last order issued by the CAQM had extended the ban on hotmix plants and stone crushers in Delhi till January 2.CAQM head MM Kutty did not respond to HT’s calls or messages to seek a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-air-in-toxic-zone-could-get-worse-today-101610740696933.html
16-01-2021||India||Ninth round of farm talks inconclusive||The ninth round of discussions between the Union government and farm unions protesting three agricultural laws failed to make any progress on Friday, but both sides agreed to meet again on January 19 despite the stalemate.The farm unions representing tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, who have launched a mass agitation on the borders of the national capital, are demanding that the government scrap three laws approved by Parliament in September.The laws are aimed at freeing agricultural markets from government restrictions, which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.Like several earlier rounds of discussions, the farm unions demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws.At Friday’s talks, the government, which has ruled out a repeal of the laws, proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on laws”.“There were discussions on the three laws but we could not arrive at any decision. We suggested that the farmers form a smaller group with outside people who have expertise on the issue, but the unions rejected our suggestion,” agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.There was a discussion on Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader who represents the unions at the talks.At the talks, which were attended by two other Union ministers — Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash — Goyal defended the new amendments in the act but signalled the government’s willingness to make changes.Goyal told the unions that “some changes can be made in the Act too without quite saying that (what specific) amendments will be made,” according to Kuruganti.The Essential Commodities Amendment Act 2020, one of the laws farmers want scrapped, allows traders to stockpile large quantities of food stocks for future sales. The government argues that the changes were necessary to attract private investment in warehouses and food-processing plants.According to an official, the government suggested that it could review the stock limits proposed under the amended law.“We have said that the amendments should be removed and earlier Act restored because the new changes will allow hoarding and black-marketing of essential items,” said Hanan Mollah, a senior farm leader.The agriculture minister said the government suggested that the farm unions form a smaller, focused group that should evaluate specific issues in the laws and “present them before the government so that these could be discussed”.The government also repeated its proposal that farmers should go through the three laws “section by section” and list their objections. The farmers rejected both the suggestions.The Supreme Court on January 12 kept the three contentious laws in abeyance to “assuage the hurt feelings of farmers” and also formed a committee to look into the farmers’ grievances over the laws.The farmers have rejected the court’s offer, saying they want a full repeal of the laws, not a temporary ban on their implementation.“The government welcomes the Supreme Court’s decisions. We will present our point of view before the committee appointed by the court,” Tomar said.At the opening of today’s talks, the farm unions raised the issue of alleged harassment and arrest of their colleagues on trumped up charges in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. “Farmer unions wanted the Centre to address and prevent it,” said Kuruganti, the lone woman representative of the farm unions at the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ninth-round-of-farm-talks-inconclusive-101610739200773.html
16-01-2021||India||Kerala earmarks fund for mental health||A chit fund scheme to refurbish middle-class kitchen, special scheme for the mental health sector, hike in welfare pension, sops for start-ups and three industrial corridors were among some of the measures announced by Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Issac in the state budget for the next fiscal year on Friday.With the assembly elections due in four months, Issac presented the last budget of the Pinarayi Vijayan government for now, assuring that money won’t be a constraint for welfare programmes and some of the new measures will help lift the state’s consumerist economy reeling under the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state has earmarked Rs.64 crore for mental health programmes, usually a neglected sector, he said. According to a survey conducted by the state mental health department last year, at least 15% of the youth between 18 and 25 years suffered from depression and other mental health problems.Besides this, 4,000 new posts will be created in the health sector, Issac said.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, the state has the fifth highest suicide rate in the country with 24.3 deaths per 100,000 population.“We have given special emphasis on mental health care. Low-income families really struggle with persons with mental disabilities. Rs.50 crore has been earmarked to take care of these families while the rest of the fund will be allocated to modernise existing mental health centres,” the state finance minister said.Another highlight of the budget was the chit fund scheme to modernise middle-class kitchens. The ‘smart kitchen fund’ will help women purchase household items without difficulty and the government will partly fund the Kerala State Financial Enterprises, which is successfully running a number of lending schemes in the state.He also said free food kits which are being distributed in the wake of the pandemic will continue for some time and 5 million families will get additional rice for Rs.15 and Rs.10 per kg, respectively. Political observers said that it was the free kits that played an important role in the Left’s recent victory in the local body election.While the finance minister announced three industrial corridors worth ₹50,000 crore, he did not elaborate on how it will be financed. Similarly, welfare pensions will be hiked from Rs.1,500 to Rs.1,600 and the elderly will get free medicines at their doorsteps without any hassle, he said.The government has also decided to withdraw 1% flood cess on transactions amid demands from several trade bodies. Many sops were also announced for start-ups. In government tenders, these firms will be given preference and the government will bear at least 50% of the loss to encourage innovation, Isaac said.A package was also announced for the ailing hospitality sector with interest-free loans for operators. Pension for expats who returned to the state was hiked to Rs.3,000 per month.The Congress said the budget lacked substance. “It is a futile exercise eying the polls. There is no dearth of announcements but there are no funds. In the ease of doing business, the state is ranked 28,” said Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-earmarks-fund-for-mental-health-101610737270683.html

Though its export is banned, smugglers make it available easily to shopkeepers through the porous Indo-Nepal border.The police have seized two big consignments of Nepalese cigarettes in less than a month in Champawat.Jasveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Tanakpur police station in Champawat said, “We have seized two smuggled consignments of Nepalese cigarette ‘Khukuri’ worth ₹7 lakh in less than a month and handed it over to the Custom department. Smugglers make available these cigarettes after crossing the Sharda river which flows along the border.”‘Khukuri’ a brand of Nepalese cigarette has captured the market in the border areas of US Nagar, Champawat and Pithoragarh. Over 90% of smokers prefer to purchase and smoke this not due to taste but its cheap prices, said an official.Vinod Kala, a social activist of Banbasa Champawat said, “One can find ‘Khukuri’ cigarettes easily in every grocery or Paan shop in border areas. People who smoke prefer to purchase it compared to Indian cigarette brands.”A shopkeeper of Tanakpur, who did not wish to be named, revealed that a packet of ‘Khukuri’ cigarettes costs ₹60 to 62 and contains 20 cigarettes while Indian cigarette packets are rather costly and contain only 10 cigarettes. He said, “We know selling smuggled cigarettes is a crime but smokers demand this particular brand. In such a condition, we have to keep these Nepalese brand cigarettes in the shop.”Nepalese cigarettes dominate Khatima, Banbasa, Tanakpur, Jhulaghat, Jauljibi and Dharchula like the border areas markets and are freely available in every shop. A smoker said, “One ‘Khukuri’ cigarette costs us merely ₹3 while an Indian cigarette costs ₹7 to 10 with the same taste. Therefore, we prefer to smoke this cheaper brand.”Chauhan said, “We are trying to identify those elements who make available Nepalese cigarettes in our area. Action will be taken thereafter to check the smuggling of this particular brand of cigarettes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smuggled-nepalese-cigarette-brand-dominates-border-areas-of-uttarakhand-101610735143799.html
16-01-2021||India||Construction work on New Parliament begins||Construction work on the foundation of the New Parliament building officially began on Friday, officials aware of the development said adding that some of the work had already begun on an alternative site to make up for the delay in the construction.“As we were scheduled to start construction in December but had to put it on hold due to the Supreme Court’s initial stay we began building the blocks for the new building at a site alloted by the government at Kirti Nagar in New Delhi to save time,” a senior government official directly involved in the matter said requesting anonymity.“It is a process akin to putting Lego blocks together. We were able to make up for the delay on site construction through this process, “ the official added. “Work (at the site itself) began on Friday.” this person added.Construction work could not start earlier because the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court took a call on pending pleas on the issue.On December 10, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a new Parliament House , describing the event as a milestone in India’s democratic history and asserting that the building will become the symbol of a 21st century nation and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India. Modi performed the groundbreaking ceremony for the two-storeyed building amid vedic chants by 12 priests.The Supreme Court earlier this month gave its nod to the project that includes construction of a new Parliament Building and a common Central Secretariat.The apex court said that clearance of the Heritage Conservation Committee will be mandatory and the same should be obtained by the project consultant before proceeding with the development work.The Heritage Conversation Committee headed by the Additional Secretary of the ministry of housing and urban affairs cleared the Centre’s proposal for the new Parliament building this week.Tata Projects Limited emerged as the lower bidder for the tender to construct the new Parliament complex by quoting a bid of Rs.861.90 crore when the financial bids for the project opened on September 16 and it was awarded the contract to construct the building on September 29.The plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves having a new Parliament building in place by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the entire project, which includes constructing 11 administrative buildings to house all the government ministries, is slated to be finished by 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/construction-work-on-new-parliament-begins-101610734541231.html

In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the scam and the role of influential people in money laundering in West Bengal.Two Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha members, Sudip Bandopadhyay and Tapas Pal, were arrested by the CBI in 2017 in connection with the scam. Pal died last year, months after he was released on bail.Subhra Kundu was arrested from her apartment in an upmarket south Kolkata condominium and brought to the CBI office at the CGO complex at Salt Lake for questioning. She has been interrogated several times by the CBI and ED since 2015 when her husband was arrested by the latter. He has been in judicial custody since.Friday’s arrest came two days after that of former TMC Rajya Sabha MP and businessman KD Singh in Delhi in connection with an alleged money laundering case involving his Alchemist Group.A CBI official said on condition of anonymity that Subhra Kundu was under scanner for a long time as she is the director of two sister companies of Rose Valley. Although these companies are officially closed, some bank transactions have been detected in the accounts by these companies. Subhra Kundu, officials said, could not provide any satisfactory answer regarding the same.Although the CBI and ED are investigating several high-profile scams, such as the Saradha and Rose Valley, trial has not started in these.Last year, Calcutta high court chief justice T B Radhakrishnan constituted a two-judge bench for hearing ponzi scheme cases every Friday. The hearings started on September 25.Formation of a separate bench for ponzi schemes is being viewed in political circles as a significant development since several prominent leaders of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) figure among the accused in the Saradha case.Meanwhile, reacting to Subhra Kundu’s arrest, TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy said, “The Supreme Court asked the CBI to conduct the probe. The Central agency is doing its duty.”BJP’s West Bengal vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar welcomed the arrest and said, “All influential people and politicians involved in chit fund cases must be arrested as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-arrests-rose-valley-chit-fund-owner-s-wife-in-kolkata-101610710300033.html
16-01-2021||Today's||In India, the story of Covid-19 vaccines||Remember the date: January 16, 2021.This is the day India launched its Covid-19 vaccination drive, embarking on what should be the last phase of its fight against the coronavirus disease.That India got to this point in a little over 10 months since the first local Covid-19 cases emerged is an achievement that needs to be recognised, appreciated and cheered. That it did so with one locally made version of a vaccine developed by a multinational company and a university, and a locally developed one, makes the achievement even more significant.Sure, the regulatory approval granted to Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, without studies proving its efficacy, was a break from established protocol and surprising. We know that the vaccine is safe; we just don’t have enough data on its efficacy. It will come in a few weeks, but we do not have it now; and the regulator did not have it when it approved the vaccine. Hope should not be part of scientific processes.It would have been appropriate for the regulator and the government to admit as much and say that the vaccine was being approved, without knowing its efficacy, simply because these are unprecedented times, and unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures. That would have been enough for many people (including Chanakya).Instead, the government tied itself up in knots trying to justify its decision, and the debate rapidly degenerated, as almost every debate does these days, into one along politically polarised lines. Covaxin may be extremely effective; we just don’t have the data to establish this. It doesn’t matter that it was developed in India; the argument would have been the same had it been developed on Mars.And sure, the fact that people cannot choose which vaccine they get is a bit of a downer — especially since those getting a shot of Covaxin have to sign a consent form acknowledging that the efficacy of the vaccine is unknown.Still, the launch of the vaccination drive is significant – and definitely merits celebration.Israel, the Wall Street Journal reported, is already seeing a decline in infection rates two weeks after people received the first shot of the two-dose vaccine. Thanks to a happy confluence of factors, which are not particularly clear at this point in time, India’s vaccination drive has been launched at a time when the weekly average of cases in the country at a seven-month low.On Friday, January 15, India’s seven-day average of cases was 15,876, a number last seen on June 26 last year. The seven-day average of deaths on January 15 was 186, a number last seen on May 29. Cases are low, as are deaths; the vaccination drive has been launched; and over the next six months, around 300 million people will be vaccinated. The feared second wave, which ravaged the United States (which had now been further savaged by a third) and Europe, may well not happen in India.India shouldn’t have a problem with vaccination drives. It has an immunisation programme that covers more people than similar ones in other countries, although the Covid-19 vaccination drive is clearly many times larger. This is simply because it has experience of managing exercises involving a large of number of people — such as the general elections.There are bound to be glitches — a power breakdown that ruins some doses; delays in the vaccine reaching some remote corners of the country; at least, some jumping of queues. But this is an exercise that India will manage well, perhaps a lot better than the US and the United Kingdom (UK) have. If all goes well, a month from now, the country could well have more people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine than any other country.But even as it is important that the Centre and states micromanage every aspect of the drive to vaccinate 300 million people, the health ministry has to start planning for what lies beyond — the task of vaccinating the country’s entire population.To do this, it needs to focus on three areas, all aimed at increasing supply of vaccines and maximising their administration – for this is a disease where no one is safe till everyone is safe.One, India’s health ministry and regulator need to work on identifying and approving other vaccines. For instance, it has now emerged that Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine,— like Covaxin, this too was initially under a cloud, although in its case, some efficacy data was available — is very effective in combating the virus. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is carrying out clinical trials of this vaccine, and Hetero Drugs has signed an agreement to locally manufacture 100 million doses of the vaccine. Is there a way to expedite their availability? The regulator could also consider automatically approving any vaccine approved in the US, the European Union (EU) or the UK (this isn’t ideal; but nor was Covaxin’s rushed approval).Two, the government needs to take a call, if not now, then at least by the middle of February, on open-market availability of the vaccines. Sure, every vaccine sold will have to be tracked, but this is easily done by making minor edits to the dashboards and information systems already in place. Making enough doses of the vaccine available in the open market by June, if not earlier, will help.Three, the government should also make it possible for institutions and organisations to launch vaccination drives for their students, employees, or members by defining the protocols for sourcing, financing (for instance, can corporate social responsibility funds be used?) and administering vaccines.India is off to a good start, but it now needs to plan ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-india-the-story-of-covid-19-vaccines-101610804809663.html
16-01-2021||Today's||Making privacy a mainstream debate||In the wee hours of a rather cold Delhi winter morning, I received a phone call from my rather anxious 83-year-old uncle. He asked, “What should I do? I just accepted the new WhatsApp terms without reading too much into it. How can I withdraw it now? WhatsApp has been my only means to communicate with my kids in US. What do I do if they shift to Telegram? What happens to my data on WhatsApp?”This was not an isolated conversation, indicating that we are at a potentially seminal moment of consumer understanding of privacy and what it entails.Since its inception, WhatsApp has claimed security and privacy as its core DNA. With its new “take-it-or-leave-it” policy, Whatsapp essentially threatened users of deleting their accounts, unless they accept the new terms before May. The earlier deadline was February 8, but was deferred. Consumers are now recognising that there is a price attached to the service.Since 2016, WhatsApp has been sharing data with Facebook, with the caveat that users could opt out by manually editing their settings within 30 days. So, this new policy is not about WhatsApp sharing more data with Facebook than it already did until now. It is, rather, about Facebook leveraging user data and engagement on WhatsApp to build a platform where businesses can start sharing and selling products and services to WhatsApp users. None of this is a surprise. Facebook’s acquisition was always with an intent to monetise WhatsApp for its data.WhatsApp, with its new “take-it-or leave-it” privacy policy, may not have anticipated the severe consumer backlash against it. Consumers often miss reading the rather small fine print of the terms of the services. However, the fact that the new terms are mandatory made all the difference.Telegram and Signal are the two platforms that consumers are embracing, with installs flying off the charts for both of them. Telegram offers extensive features such as larger groups, heavy files, and unlimited cloud storage along with end-to-end encrypted secret chats. Signal, on the other hand, is a relatively new name for most consumers in India. It offers a simple UX and some basic features with default end-to-end encryption. As network effects shape the future of messaging and communications apps, the question of which of the platforms emerges as a sustainable alternative needs to be seen.If you are still on the fence, and contemplating what to do next if you are on WhatsApp, here is my answer. Over the short-term, nothing much has changed. WhatsApp remains secure. WhatsApp remains end-to-end encrypted. And it will continue to share data as it has been doing all along. However, all of this is immaterial if users keep shifting to other apps before May. You need to be on the same platform where most of your peers, business partners, and most importantly, your loved ones are.If you take a long-term view, the future will never be the same from here on for WhatsApp. The messaging service has now moved into a different trajectory — one focused on monetisation. It will now find it tough to regain or retain user trust. While messages remain secure and encrypted, as Facebook seeks to build tighter cross-platform integration across its ecosystem, the user data on WhatsApp could fall prey to it through data-sharing, or, for instance, targeted and precise advertising. There is no assurance that there will not be any further changes to the terms of use going forward. It all boils down to whether one is WhatsApp’s consumer or rather its product offering.The conversation around WhatsApp policy has moved beyond just those engaged in the world of tech policy and privacy. When consumers, like my 83-year-old uncle, seek to grasp and work out the issues around what privacy means and entails, you know change is in the air.Prabhu Ram heads the Industry Intelligence Group (IIG) at CyberMedia ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/making-privacy-a-mainstream-debate-101610804390043.html
16-01-2021||Today's||Budget 2021: Balance economics with politics||With the budget just over two weeks away, economist after economist is calling on finance minister (FM) Nirmala Sitharaman to spend, spend and spend. The renowned 20th-century economist, John Maynard Keynes, whose economic theory is being quoted in justification of government spending, once said: “No part of man’s nature or his institutions can be outside an economist’s regard”. There must be a question mark on whether the economists offering advice to the finance minister have taken into account politics, so very much part of the nature of most Indians.The basic problem that the FM faces is to reinvigorate the economy after the Covid-19 setback. To achieve this, she is being urged to revive demand by spending more. But where is the money for spending to come from? As I see it, every answer to that question has worrying political consequences for the government.One suggestion being offered by economists is to cash in public assets by privatising them. But there is bound to be opposition to this because it will be seen as selling out to the corporate sector. If there is one thing which the farmer protest has demonstrated, it is a deep-seated distrust of the corporate sector, one might say hostility to it. Hostility to the corporate sector goes far beyond farmers. Of the many jibes Rahul Gandhi has hurled at the Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, the only one which has hit home is his “suit-boot sarkar” one. It led the PM to realise the political consequences of his government being too closely identified with business interests.Privatisation is a particularly easy policy for an opposition to attack because it can be likened to “selling off the family silver”, as the former British PM Harold Macmillan did in his famous attack on Margaret Thatcher’s privatisation drive. This, he saw as the consequence of “modern economists having decided there is no difference between capital and income”. Macmillan was alleging that privatisation was profligacy, spending capital rather than earning income.Another method for the FM to find the money to spend, being suggested by economists, is to be less cautious about the fiscal deficit and borrow to spend on productive investments. They do not accept that this would necessarily be unduly inflationary. With private investment and consumption low, they believe the government can spend more without creating excess demand and inflation. But the FM may still be held back by the traditional fear of politicians of inflation. Indira Gandhi believed voter anger over inflation was a major reason for her coming back to power in the 1980 general election. She made the high price of that essential component of Indian cuisine, the humble onion, the symbol of inflation. This government showed its sensitivity to the price of onions by banning their export last year.Then, of course, there is the standard remedy for a government short of funds — raising taxes. Raising personal tax would be unpopular with the Bharatiya Janata Party’s middle-class voters. When corporate leaders met the FM, they advised her to reduce income tax so that taxpayers would have more money to spend and, thereby, create demand.When Sitharaman weighs up the short-term political consequences of following the advice she is receiving, I’m sure she will be aware of the longer-term political consequence of getting the arithmetic wrong. The indications coming from this very early stage of recovery are ominous. Capital and profits are growing, wages are not, nor is employment. The incomes poorer Indians have lost have not been recovered. The more prosperous have sustained their incomes and grown their savings. Unless this trend is corrected, India will become an even more unequal country and that could lead to politically disastrous social unrest.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/budget-2021-balance-economics-with-politics-101610804029394.html
16-01-2021||Today's||Where the State should step back||Modern governments have a distressing tendency to morph into nanny states. Members of Parliament and ministers, whose educational qualifications are often negligible or questionable, presume to possess the wisdom to decide for the rest of us what we can or cannot do. Two areas where this is most irksome and least justified is the age at which we can legally smoke and drink.We’re considered adult enough to vote at 18 but no government in India permits smoking at that age. Only six out of 37 states and Union Territories (UTs) allow you to drink at 18. In Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and the UTs of Delhi and Chandigarh, you have to wait till you’re 25. Maharashtra, just to be different, permits light beer — whatever that may be — at 21. For Kerala, the legal age is 23. For the rest, it is 21.Now the national government proposes to tamper with the age at which we can legally smoke. In 2003, it was set at 18. But the draft Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Amendment Bill 2020 seeks to raise it to 21. The only hope this won’t happen lies in the fact the health ministry is seeking public responses to the proposed change. So here’s mine.Don’t do it! It’s not an area where governments know better and certainly not an issue on which you should decide for each of us.I can understand bans on smoking in areas or circumstances where, inevitably or unavoidably, others who are not smoking get affected. So outlawing smoking in public places such as hotels, restaurants, cinema halls and bars is something we have accepted. But when an adult smokes on his own, or in the company of others who have no objection, the government has no business to intervene.After reaching adulthood, if I wish to slowly poison myself to death by smoking — or if others around me wish to do the same by inhaling my cigarette fumes — we have a moral right to do so. There’s a limit to how far governments can legitimately protect us from undesirable habits.Remember each time politicians try to do so, they diminish our individuality. In fact, they infantilise us. The presumption that governments know better is not just arrogance, it’s also hypocritical and often untrue.For instance, beedis are taxed very differently to cigarettes on the grounds they are smoked by poorer Indians. But look at what the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government did in its first budget of July 2014 — cigarette excise was increased in the range of 11 to 72%, while that on beedis was left untouched.If cigarettes are so bad for one’s health it justifies a sextupling of their excise, why not ban them altogether? That would be the rational thing to do. But the government didn’t because it would have lost a huge amount of revenue. On the other hand, eight times more people smoke beedis. Yet, if you don’t increase the excise on them, aren’t you saying you don’t care about the health of beedi smokers? On the grounds that they’re poor, it would seem the government is less concerned if they smoke themselves to death.This points to a second problem with the government’s tinkering with the rules of cigarette smoking. You often discover its misplaced moral concern is vitiated by a hidden avarice to protect the exchequer’s revenue. The 2014 budget was a perfect illustration. Nanny’s determination to protect us from ourselves stops when it becomes too expensive to do so.Now I’m not saying other governments are different or better. But as an Indian citizen, I have a right to tell my own to stop being silly. There’s an awful lot Narendra Modi and his ministers have to worry about before barring 18-year-olds from smoking. And, anyway, most self-respecting 18-year-olds will ignore them. It’s foolish to create laws you can neither morally justify nor credibly enforce.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/where-the-state-should-step-back-101610803549941.html
