08-01-2021||News||What India should, and shouldn’t, do in Nepal||Nepal has drifted into a political crisis following its Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli’s decision to dissolve Parliament. The constitutional validity of Oli’s move has been questioned, and is awaiting decision by the Supreme Court. Unlike on previous occasions, Oli has refrained from blaming India for destabilising his regime. The PM’s ire has been directed at his senior party colleagues for not allowing him to govern smoothly. The others, in turn, blame Oli for non-governance, corruption, concentration of power, and refusal to honour commitments made on sharing power.India has played its cards cautiously and craftily. With an assiduously cultivated façade of non-interference, it let China smear itself into the mud of micromanaging the ruling party’s internal conflicts. Anti-Oli forces were quietly cheered to dump him, but when they failed, India subtly extended a helping hand to a desperate Oli struggling for survival. Prime Minister Narendra Modi positively responded to Oli’s telephonic greetings on India’s Independence Day. A series of important visits from India followed. The Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief, army chief and the foreign secretary visited Nepal on October 22, November 4 and November 23, respectively. These visits were in the midst of Oli’s intra-party strife. Energy and trade officials from the two countries have met each other, border talks are on board, and Nepal’s foreign minister is visiting India for the joint commission meeting next week.Through these moves, India has achieved its immediate tactical goals. Oli has been emboldened to stick to power even by breaking the party. In the process, the shallowness of Oli’s opportunistic and politically driven anti-Indian nationalism has been exposed. The unity and dominance of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) has been shattered, and China, as its patron, has been embarrassed. On the sidelines of these developments, India has also fuelled and fed Hindutva forces under the leadership of a discarded monarchy, possibly as a ploy in the unfolding realignment of political forces in Nepal. Towards that end, India has now come out openly in favour of fresh elections.All this puts India on the side of undemocratic, unconstitutional and opportunistic players in Nepal, which South Block strategists think is a small price to be paid for the significant gains otherwise made.Seeking a friendly regime in the neighbourhood is a recognised norm in the realist world of international relations. India is no exception. It has often invested heavily in Nepal to have a friendly, even a pliant, regime. But in the long-term, this approach has largely resulted in the erosion, rather than consolidation, of India’s vital security and economic interests. With China deeply pitched in the regime change business in Nepal, prospects of this approach in coming years seem expensive and uncertain.Irrespective of whether Nepal has elections or witnesses the restoration of Parliament, a prudent course for India would be to let Nepal cope with its internal political mess. As no major development in bilateral relations appears likely during the prevailing uncertainty, India must encourage consolidation of a people-driven polity, and improve its own popular profile. It can pick up pending controversial issues such as the 1950 treaty, the Kalapani border dispute, and trade and investment matters, and categorical state its position, drawing red lines that Nepal should not cross.Nepal has asked for a revision of the 1950 treaty, and this has been accepted by India. But the issue remains stuck because Nepal does not clarify how to strike a proper balance between India’s security concerns and Nepal’s developmental aspirations. Without this balance, no new treaty is possible, and Nepal, seemingly, is not prepared to abrogate the old treaty. The question of the Kalapani border dispute has also vitiated popular perceptions in Nepal about India. While Nepal has taken unilateral and extreme decisions on this dispute, drawing new maps, India has not even clearly stated its stand. The available evidence, also backed by India’s security stakes and civilisational connectivity with Kailash Mansarovar (in China), weighs strongly in India’s favour. Nepal must be persuaded to assess the claims of both the sides objectively and independently. India’s policy towards immediate neighbours has never been driven by territorial nationalism. This has been evident in the case of Sri Lanka (Katchatheevu), Bangladesh (territorial waters), and even Pakistan and China.On trade and investment issues, India needs to be more accommodative. Nepal sells less than $1billion worth of products to India while importing nearly $8 billion of them. This is unsustainable, despite the fact that trade deficits are governed by the nature of economies. India can and must move to remove structural and procedural impediments to the entry of genuine Nepali goods into Indian markets. It should also encourage Indian investments in such industries, including hydropower production, that can boost Nepali exports.In redefining its approach to Nepal, India also needs to shed a great deal of its Sinophobia. China is no doubt politically assertive and financially spread out in Nepal, but most of its promises, such as transit through Chinese ports and railroad connections, are politically driven. Even China’s own Belt and Road Initiative experts have termed some of these projects as economically unviable. Let China sink itself more into Nepali internal politics, which will only help India reclaim its contested strategic space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-india-should-and-shouldn-t-do-in-nepal/story-UJ0tUcogvwdkaeqKdSWn8I.html

There are 18-20 heritage buildings on the stretch that have to be restored as per heritage rules. But for the rest of the buildings, SRDC can provide a standard template, based on which restoration work can be done.”Meanwhile, there are discussions going on to make SRDC an autonomous local body. The SRDC was constituted under the Companies Act (1956), by the Delhi government. It’s main objective is to “promote conservation of built and natural heritage in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.”Gupta said, “It is in the discussion stages. No proposal has been made in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chandni-chowk-revamp-nearing-end-facade-of-buildings-along-stretch-may-get-restored-101610130197846.html

While officials of the municipal corporation and residents of Mayur Vihar Phase 3 said about 150 crows had died in the past three or four days, the Delhi government said the number of birds found dead at the three places was below 50. On Friday morning, after receiving reports of crow carcasses being found in Mayur Vihar Phase 3, a team of doctors from Delhi government’s animal husbandry department reached A-2 Central Park and collected samples to check if the deaths were caused by the cold or due to avian flu. The test report is expected on Monday. The Delhi government in a statement said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia sent officials immediately to the spot in Mayur Vihar and the team found 17 dead crows in the park. Four samples were collected for testing from among these carcasses. But a senior official of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which manages the park, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Nearly 150 crows have died over the past three days in the Central Park. As this is a matter pertaining to the Delhi government’s animal husbandry department, we informed the authorities concerned. A team of doctors from the animal husbandry department inspected the park and collected samples of dead birds,” the EDMC official said. HT visited the Central Park on Friday evening and found carcasses of at least four to five crows there. According to residents, the other carcasses were removed on Friday morning but those found in the evening could be from fresh deaths. As news about the bird deaths spread, there was panic among residents and shopkeepers. “Crows are dying and falling off trees for the past four days but the authorities are not paying heed. We had raised the issue with the civic body employees deployed at the park two days ago but action was taken only today (Friday). We fear that it may be an outbreak of bird flu, which has already been reported in other states,” Devendra Kumar, a resident of A-2 block in Mayur Vihar-3, said. Another resident of the area, Dinesh Pratap Singh, said the death of such a huge numbers of crows was frightening. “This mysterious death of crows indicates the presence of bird flu in the city. At least 150 crows have died in the past four-five days. We have stopped going for walks in the park,” Singh said.Traders in the market said in the previous years, there were sporadic cases of birds dying due to the cold. “But crows dying in such large numbers is new. The government officials should check if crows are dying due to bird flu. We don’t know how this disease spreads, and so there is panic among the residents. We are not ready to face another virus or pandemic,” Viru Gupta, who runs a garment shop in the market, said. The Delhi government in a statement on Friday said as part of the exercise to prevent the ingress of avian influenza to the capital, multiple samples have been collected and sent for tests. The collected samples have been submitted to the laboratory in Palam and these will send to the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, ICAR, Bhopal, on January 9. “All remaining carcasses were disposed of by deep burial following bio security measures and the area was sanitised. Instructions were also given to attendants of the park to report further mortality of birds, if any. Two crows were found dead at a DDA Park in Dwarka and one sample was collected from there for tests,” a government spokesperson said, adding that at DDA park in Hastsal village reported 16 dead birds. Of this, four samples have been sent to the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, for tests. Dr Rakesh Singh, animal husbandry department, said until Friday, a total of 104 samples were sent from Delhi to Jalandhar. Five more samples have been collected by the department which will be sent to the laboratory in Bhopal on Saturday. “Of the 104 samples that have been sent already, 100 are faecal and blood samples and four are dead crows. Of the five samples that will be sent on Saturday to Bhopal, one will be an oral swab and the remaining four are dead birds,” he said. Dr Singh said the first set of results will come by Monday. “Actions like restricting the number of trucks and regulating shops will be taken only if a bird flu outbreak is confirmed. The results of the samples will start coming from Monday. As of now, Delhi has no case of bird flu,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dead-crows-in-dozens-at-mayur-vihar-park-spark-panic-some-more-found-in-dwarka-and-hastal-101610130197292.html

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Four wards in Mumbai are free of Covid-19 containment zones||Once considered as the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, Mumbai is gradually seeing improvement in the situation.As on Thursday, four wards have been declared free of containment zones by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). These are B (Dongri), G-South (Elphinstone and Worli), H-West (Bandra West), and R-Central (Borivli) wards.According to the Union health ministry, a containment zone refers to a specific geographical area where positive cases of coronavirus are found. Strict movement restrictions are put in place at such areas to prevent any further spread of the virus.The total number of containment zones in the 24 wards has dropped to 211 on January 7 from around 2,600 during the early months of the pandemic. BMC has released 2,405 containment zones across the city.Officials have attributed the decline in the containment zones to the drop in the daily cases. In the past one month, daily Covid-19 cases have remained constant between 400 and 600.Of the four containment-free zones, the situation in R-Central and G-South wards had posed concerns for ward officers owing to the large presence of slum dwellers. To control the cases, the ward officers followed two main strategies — mass isolation from slums and sealing buildings in non-slum areas.Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of G-South ward said after the pandemic broke out in March and the virus gradually spread from high-rise buildings to the slums in Worli Koliwada, his main strategy was to seal the slums completely.“As soon as we sealed the slum pockets, we started screening all the symptomatic residents and their relatives. We systematically traced their closed contacts and isolated them in our Covid care centres (CCC). This helped us to break the chain of infection in the slums, which was our first win,” said Ughade.Till January 7 this year, the ward has recorded 10,400 Covid-19 cases with 0.12% weekly growth rate.During this time, civic officials with the help of social workers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) arranged for food and daily groceries for the residents. However, in July, after the lockdown rules were relaxed, more number of residents from the high-rise buildings started contracting the infection. This turned into the biggest challenge for the ward officers due to the lack of cooperation among the non-slum population.“Due to the fear of contracting the virus, slum dwellers had become extremely cautious. But handling the residents from the high-rise buildings had turned into a nightmare for us. There was so much resistance and opposition from them. They wouldn’t even follow proper safety rules,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer, R-Central ward. Till January 7, the ward has reported 21,328 Covid-19 cases. The weekly growth rate of the wards stands at 0.18%.Later, civic officials arranged meetings with secretaries of the buildings. To restrict movement of residents, the ward officers started sealing buildings with any case of Covid-19.“If we found any society with repeated new cases of coronavirus, we would hold the secretaries responsible for it. This helped in streamlining the regulations and residents became more responsible,” said Kapse.Among the other wards, E (Byculla) and A (Fort) wards have only one containment zone each.The three wards with the highest number of containment zones are S (Bhandup), K-West (Andheri West) and N (Ghatkopar) wards with 25, 21 and 20 zones, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/four-wards-in-mumbai-are-free-of-covid-19-containment-zones/story-LaGa7tLIK8m9xc30zcdYLO.html

The State Health Society will support us in training by deputing a few more master trainers tomorrow. We will have 10 teams. Each team will vaccinate 100 people in a day,” said Dr Karak.An average 45-minute, including the 30-minutes in the observation room to assess Covid appropriate behaviour after vaccination, was required to vaccinate a person during the dry run at the PMCH, the superintendent added.“Training of personnel for vaccination is an ongoing process. We have identified over 3,000 potential vaccinators apart from the regular vaccinators engaged in the routine immunization process,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh.Around 44,000 healthcare workers have enrolled in Patna alone, said Dr Singh. She, however, could not specify how many among them were doctors.The vaccination officers carried out the thermal screening and checked the identity proof of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries were then verified on the CoWIN portal. Twenty-five beneficiaries per session site participated during the dry-run.Four locations were selected in Patna for the dry-run. These included the PMCH, Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Paras Hospital and Research Centre and Girls Middle School in Khagaul.Three session sites, including a medical college or a district hospital, private health facility and urban or rural outreach centre were selected for the dry-run across 38 districts of the state.Many district magistrates (DMs) visited session sites during the dry-run.Darbhanga DM Thiyagrajan SM visited the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and took stock of the arrangements, including the observation room.The DM also talked to the vaccination officers and gathered information about verification of select beneficiaries. He also directed the civil surgeon to prepare a list of potential beneficiaries while asking DMCH principal to provide a list of remaining health workers.In Purnia, three centres were selected - Red Cross society, Kasba primary health centre - besides district hospital for the dry-run. A total of 13,894 beneficiaries have registered on the CoWin application.“Dry-run exercise went off without any hitch,” Purnia district magistrate Rahul Kumar said while expressing happiness over the successful dry-run.In Kishanganj, the dry-run was undertaken at MGM Medical College and Hospital, district hospital and community health centre, Bahadurganj.In Araria, besides the district hospital, the dry-run went off at Forbesganj and Jokihat sub-divisional hospitals.In Katihar, the dry-run was undertaken at Sadar hospital, Tajganj Fasiya primary health centre in town areas and Katihar Medical College and Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-ready-to-vaccinate-over-4-lakh-healthcare-workers-against-covid-19/story-zY5fgavcKgYMmnN2CM0AAN.html

Sukhdev’s wife Kamlesh has been hired as a Class-4 employee in the municipal corporation (MC) and the offer letter was handed over by mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal on Friday. Kamlesh, who has been living with her parents since her husband died tragically while fighting the flames, said her three daughters and she had been dependent on her parents all this while. Though ecstatic over getting a government job, she said it came too late.“Even though my parents took care of us, it was a burden on their shoulders. Now that I have got a job, I can confidently raise my daughters myself,” said Kamlesh. As many as 16 people, including nine firefighters, were killed in the plastic factory tragedy that took place near Suffiyan Chowk in November 2017. While jobs were given to the families of six firefighters, the families of three contractual firemen – Manpreet, Vishal and Sukhdev – continued to run from pillar to post for compensation. The jobs were announced by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh as part of the compensation for the families of the nine firefighters killed in the incident. But, the cases of the three firefighters got delayed after objections over providing permanent jobs to the family members of contractual employees.Wait continues for two families The long wait for government jobs still continues for families of firefighters Manpreet and Vishal, as MC has not received approval from the Punjab local bodies department. While Manpreet’s family has been seeking a job for his sister, Vishal’s family wants work for his brother. The families rued that the authorities had been delaying the files by pointing out different objections, but no one was committed to providing relief to the families, who had suffered the tragic loss of their loved ones. Mayor Sandhu said MC was regularly pursuing the cases and the family members of the firefighters will soon get offer letters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2017-ludhiana-fire-tragedy-desperate-struggle-for-job-ends-wife-of-firefighter-finally-gets-work/story-i2r3q3cTmX5txFM4JqiALO.html
08-01-2021||Lucknow||‘No decision on film city location’: Uttar Pradesh govt tells HC||A public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the film city project of Uttar Pradesh government was quashed by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court after the petitioner withdrew the PIL when the government informed the court that no decision had been taken as yet on the project’s location. The double-judge bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Saurabh Lavania on Thursday quashed the petition and allowed the petitioner to file the petition again, if required. The Kalakaar Association in Lucknow had filed the PIL seeking a stay on the proposed film city project in Noida. Lawyer CB Pandey appeared on behalf of the petitioner and lawyer Anand Dwivedi on behalf of the Union government as Noida is part of the National Capital Region (NCR). Appearing on behalf of the state government, lawyer Siddharth Dhawan and other lawyers apprised the court that as of now there was only a proposal for building the film city in Noida. Reports have been sought regarding availability of land and other facilities which are being examined, therefore, the writ petition at this stage is premature, said Dhawan.Pandey stated that at this stage, he would not press for the petition and sought liberty to file a fresh plea as and when, if at all, an occasion arose. “As we have not entered into merits of the controversy in view of the statements made on behalf of the state and the opposite party, all pleas are open for being raised at the appropriate stage, if a cause exists,” said the court.“In view of the statement made by CB Pandey, the petition is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty as aforesaid,” added the court.The film city project is planned to be one of the most prestigious projects of the Yogi Adityanath government with an aim to develop Uttar Pradesh as an alternative to Bollywood based in Mumbai, Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/no-decision-on-film-city-location-uttar-pradesh-govt-tells-hc/story-mUBPg1MxrPAjjcYCQU7quK.html
08-01-2021||City||Sale of poultry products takes a dive in Ludhiana amid caution over bird flu||Residents’ caution in the wake of bird flu cases across the country has started reflecting in sale of poultry products in the city.While no unusual bird deaths have been reported in the state so far, over 4.37 lakh poultry birds have died in the Barwala belt of neighbouring Haryana – home to Asia’s second largest poultry belt. Avian influenza was confirmed in five samples collected from the belt on Friday, and culling of birds at five poultry farms that house over 1.66 lakh birds will follow.Even though as per the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and cooked poultry food, in Ludhiana, poultry traders say clearly fewer customers were turning up to buy raw chicken and eggs, severely impacting their business.“The poultry sector suffered majorly during the lockdown, but things had started returning back to track, as weddings and other late night events started taking place after lifting of restrictions. However, now the bird flu scare has hit the industry again,” said Bhupinder Singh, president of Punjab Poultry Wholesale association.ALSO READ: Bird flu outbreak: Here’s all you need to knowPrices drop With lower demand for poultry products, raw chicken, which was being sold for Rs 95 per kg a few days back, is now being sold at Rs 55, say traders, while the rate of 100 eggs has also reduced from Rs 572 to Rs 470 in the past few days.“Every time there is news regarding bird flu, the demand decreases, which reflects in lower prices. Even after the government has announced that there is no case of bird flu in the state, people are refraining from purchasing chicken and sales at the meat shops have reduced by around 50% in the last few days,” said Sanjeev Kumar of the Ludhiana Non-Veg Shopkeepers Association.‘Cooked food safe to eat’There are many strains of the bird flu virus and most of them are mild and may only cause low egg production or other mild symptoms among birds. However, some are severe and cause deaths of large number of birds.Generally, people coming in close contact with infected alive or dead birds contract the flu, and it does not usually spread from person to person, according to the World Health Organization, which also says that as the virus is sensitive to heat, consumers can safely have properly cooked poultry food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sale-of-poultry-products-takes-a-dive-in-ludhiana-amid-caution-over-bird-flu/story-ABDUyv4NOadVUrI6vT4u0J.html
08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Asked police to give intelligence updates on farmers’ protests: Punjab CM Amarinder||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday said he had “naturally asked” police to give him regular intelligence updates related to the farmers’ protest in the national capital. He said this while rejecting the Opposition claim that he deputed police officers to “negotiate” with farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws at Delhi’s borders. Dubbing the accusations as “completely baseless and malicious”, the CM in a statement said there was no question of deputing police officers to negotiate with farmers. The CM said he had made it categorically clear that the ball was in the Centre’s court, with the Punjab government having no role to play in the negotiations. With farmer protests going on in his state since long before the agitation started at the Delhi border, he had “naturally asked” police officers to give him regular intelligence reports and updates on the situation not just from the national capital but also across Punjab, said Amarinder Singh. He trashed the “twisted and senseless” interpretation being given to the presence of a few Punjab Police personnel at the farmers’ protest site. It is the job of the state police to keep tabs on the evolving situation and it is his job as both chief minister and home minister to remain updated about all developments, he added. “Anyone who believes that a couple of police officers can negotiate with farmers or persuade the kisan leaders to accept the Centre’s suggestions on amendments to the farm laws is really naive,” the CM said. The Aam Aadmi Party while citing some media reports on Thursday had alleged that the CM had assigned two Punjab IPS officers at the Singhu border to engage with the farmer leaders to persuade them to accept the Centre’s offer. The CM said both SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, as well as their party colleagues, were resorting to “lies and deceit in their desperation to cover up their own failures” in the entire crisis triggered by the farm laws. Pointing to Sukhbir’s claim that the resolutions passed in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha against the three farm bills had not been sent to the governor, he said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president had clearly lost it. “Or perhaps he is suffering from serious amnesia since his party colleagues, including his own brother-in-law Bikram Majithia, had accompanied me to the governor’s house for submitting the resolution and the three state amendment Bills,” said the chief minister, advising Badal to seek medical help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/asked-police-to-give-intelligence-updates-on-farmers-protests-punjab-cm-amarinder/story-troXNRv9z3XxQm9OzyXPHN.html
08-01-2021||Kolkata||JP Nadda to launch BJP’s poll campaign for Bengal farmers on Saturday||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda will launch the party’s first campaign aimed at farmers in poll-bound West Bengal when he visits East Burdwan district, which is considered as the state’s rice bowl, on Saturday. With the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government planning to hold a special session of the legislative assembly to introduce a resolution against the Centre’s recent farm laws that led to unrest in Punjab, the BJP’s focus on Bengal’s farmers prior to the crucial assembly polls is a significant move, BJP leaders feel. The BJP central office in Delhi announced in a statement on Friday that Nadda will visit Jagadanandapur village in Katwa at 11.50 am where he will address a ‘Krishok Surokkha’ (farmers’ protection) meeting. This will mark the beginning of 40,000 such meetings to be held across Bengal before the elections, the party announced. Nadda will also kick-start a door-to-door rice collection programme which has been named ‘Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah’ (collecting a fistful of rice) campaign in Jagadananadapur village after offering prayers at a popular temple. He will also have lunch at the home of a local farmer. “The ‘Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah’ campaign is to reassert the party and its government’s commitment and conviction towards the growth, progress and prosperity of farmers. Before the 2021 Vidhan Sabha elections in West Bengal, the BJP will reach out to the homes of all the 73 lakh villagers across the state,” the BJP central office said in the statement. The TMC reacted by calling the campaign “ridiculous and meaningless.”“This is ridiculous. At a time when thousands of farmers are agitating outside the gates of Delhi against the Centre’s farm laws, going for a symbolic procurement of rice at a village in Katwa is meaningless. There is no problem with procurement in Bengal. Nadda should rather stay in Delhi and talk to the farmers whose problems are yet to be resolved,” said TMC Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Saugata Roy. At the receiving end of attacks by the BJP since 2014 for not implementing the Centre’s social welfare projects for farmers, chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to the Centre on September 9 that she was open to the implementation of the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme for farmers as well as the Ayushman Bharat Yojana healthcare scheme if the funds were transferred directly to her government for disbursement. This has been opposed by the Centre and the BJP. Nadda will also offer prayers at the historic Sarbamangala temple in Burdwan town and lead a roadshow from Burdwan Clock Tower to the Curzon Gate. Later, he will address the media and the party’s core committee members before returning to Delhi. Nadda’s plane will land at Andal airport in West Burdwan district in the morning and leave late in the evening. He is scheduled to fly from Andal to Katwa in East Burdwan in a chopper. This is Nadda’s first visit to Bengal since his convoy was stoned at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district on December 10. Security arrangements for Nadda has been tightened manifold in view of the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/jp-nadda-to-launch-bjp-s-poll-campaign-for-bengal-farmers-on-saturday/story-W8fUFB7ghkQuKk0dgOyMJN.html
08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Bird flu: 40 samples collected in Ambala||The Ambala animal husbandry department on Friday collected 40 samples from poultry and wild birds to test them for avian influenza. Two of the three samples sent from poultry farms in Panchkula’s Barwala belt to High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal tested positive on Friday. More than four lakh poultry birds have died in Panchkula’s Barwala and Raipur Rani belts, that are just 30 kilometres away from the Naraingarh subdivision in Ambala. This has prompted the administration to constitute 26 teams comprising doctors, paramedic staff and other officials, who will keep an eye on nearly 46 lakh poultry birds at different farms in the district.However, no unusual death of domesticated or wild birds has been reported anywhere in the district, said Dr Devender Dhull, assistant poultry development officer. “As a precautionary measure, we have collected 40 samples from different poultry farms and wild ponds where migratory birds are found, mostly in Jalbera area of Ambala City. The samples will be sent to the Jalandhar-based Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on Saturday morning to test them for bird flu,” Dhull added. Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said instructions have been issued to the department to keep a close eye on poultries. Special teams are also inspecting the wetland areas in Naraingarh belt and other areas where migratory birds had arrived last year, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bird-flu-ambala-on-high-alert/story-qODgBMPlcGe2sTJaTamd8O.html

The industry in Punjab is already being supplied electricity at rates dearer than the neighbouring states. This move will add to the woes of struggling units,” he said.It was also alleged that PSPCL has been taking a U-turn on waiver of fixed charges for two months. The power corporation’s latest decision that fixed charges will be levied on the industry, though they can provide these in instalments, will increase the problems of the industry already struggling for revival, said the FICO delegates.“How can the industry pay the fixed charges when the factories were locked? We had not locked our industries on our own. It was the government’s decision. It is requested to completely waive off the fixed charges for the period of lockdown and beyond. Moreover, the PSPCL had notified that who so ever paid bills on time during the lockdown, would enjoy 1% discount. But that amount too has been processed till date. You are requested to look into the matter and do the needful,” Kular said.The FICO also demanded that night tariff be introduced at a rate Rs 2.50 per unit to the industry, as Punjab is surplus state in terms of power and due to winter, power demand at night is not high, so the benefit of surplus power should be provided to the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/exclude-electroplating-units-from-power-intensive-category-fico-to-pspcl/story-gLWnwKF5Aw0kSEKvSTxDcM.html

The earlier deadline was January 8. The education department had also allowed students to apply for bifocal courses as per their wish, and consult their respective colleges for the admission process. While Friday was the last day to secure admissions under the second special list, several students who were not able to confirm their seats had requested for an extension. As of Friday, 11,664 of the 21,835 students who were allotted seats under the second special round confirmed their admissions. This has taken the total list of vacant seats to over 1.25 lakh. Meanwhile, the department will release the schedule for the first-come, first-served (FCFS) admission round soon. While the department had earlier declared that there would be no FCFS rounds and only special rounds this year, it later revoked its decision as several students were left without a seat even after four admission rounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-extends-deadline-to-confirm-fyjc-admissions-under-special-round/story-ICWMSu2DkWwPDh74xG6xnO.html

Through the decades, both governments have also made various plans for utilising these lands, which have remained on paper.Salt manufactureIt is said that the story of salt manufacturing can be traced to the first human settlements in the seven islands of Mumbai. According to the Thane gazetteers department, the Agris, Kolis and Native Christians were engaged in salt manufacturing and were known as “mithagris” or “salt workers”. “The Agris were found in Bassein, Ghodbander, Panvel and Uran; the Kolis in Trombay and the Christians in Ghodbander and at Kurla near Bombay,” according to the records available on the website of the department.In 1816, the British government realised the potential of salt and decided to raise revenue from it. Kaevan Umrigar, a heritage evangelist from the Mumbai-based Khakhi foundation, said: “Originally, the salt workers would give a toka or a share of the produce to the rulers. However, the British realised the potential of salt tax as regular source of revenue.”Salt manufacturing no longer has a significant active role in the city’s economy, salt pans do act as a natural barrier during flooding. A 2016 report by the MMRDA states: “Salt pans are not only important from a livelihood, economy and salt production perspective but are critically important from the point of view of flood-protection as they are shallow depressed areas holding sea water. The salt pans today face a serious threat from the construction lobby of the region leading to a mild decline in the overall area and production.”The tug of warAccording to the Union ministry of commerce, Mumbai has 5,378 acres of salt pan lands allotted to 31 salt works (six on lease and 24 licensed) in 13 revenue villages. The government had also stated that the lease of these six salt works expired in October 2016. According to a 2010 report by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), 1,206 hectares (please convert to acres for sake of consistency) comes under the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) and 204 hectares of these lands in the eastern suburbs can be developed.The 102-acre Kanjurmarg shed falls along the Eastern Express Highway and was also considered by the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena government as an option for the location of the car shed. When the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government shifted the plot from Aarey to Kanjurmarg, the Centre filed a petition against the transfer and the Bombay high court (HC) stayed the transfer. The court, in fact, called the collector’s action of passing the transfer order as bordering on “committing a fraud on power.”In 1985, a Central government committee had come to the conclusion that these lands had become unsuitable for salt manufacture and should be transferred to the ministry of urban development. A reply by the ministry of urban development to the then member of Parliament from Mumbai North-East Kirit Somaiya stated: “Accordingly, the Ministry of Industry, Department of Industrial Development issued orders dated 9th January,1986, 30.12.1987 and 22.2.1990, transferring 5,378 acres (approximately) of lands in Greater Bombay, on `as is where is` basis with all the assets and liabilities, to the Ministry of Urban Development, for use as considered appropriate.”After that, for a brief period, the Union government and the state government of Maharashtra were also looking at jointly developing these lands to meet the ever-growing needs of Mumbai. “Both the governments had reached a consensus to use the land for affordable housing and public amenities,” said Somaiya. A group of ministers had also visited Mumbai to take a decision on utilising the salt pan lands.In 2014, the Mumbai suburban collector issued an order in respect of 2,978 acres of salt pans in Mumbai as belonging to the state government. The Centre’s Salt commissionerate appealed against this order before the Konkan divisional commissioner. In 2018, the then BJP revenue minister Chandrakanth Patil, while reviewing this petition, vested the 2,978 acres to the state government. A senior official said: “The order was issued under the revenue minister’s quasi-judicial capacity, which the Salt commissioner did not challenge.”Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant had earlier also said that the salt commissioner had not provided any documents in the last three years to substantiate its claim, but opposed it only when the land was allotted for the car shed.What now?In December, chief minister Thackeray appealed to the Centre and the BJP in Maharashtra for a dialogue to resolve the issue. He also criticised the centre for creating “hurdles” in the project. People familiar with the situation say that Thackeray is keen on going ahead with the plan to build the car shed in Kanjurmarg.The MVA government on Wednesday formed a nine-member committee under Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar to look at alternate plots for the car shed. The committee has to submit its report in a month’s time. According to the government resolution, the committee has to mainly look at two plots — Aarey and Kanjurmarg.A senior state official said that the 25 hectares in Aarey will prove to be insufficient for future traffic requirements. “The Kanjurmarg plot will be utilised as a common car shed for line 3, 4 (Wadala-Kasarwadavali) and 6 (Swami Samath Nagar-Vikhroli). In fact, it will also be integrated with Line 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). This means the state will save on both land and cost by constructing a car depot here (in Kanjurmarg).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/metro-car-shed-project-revives-debate-over-salt-pan-ownership-in-mumbai/story-FVF4qpspKAGpaLwDtY3HSN.html

The case pertains to the Mendhar subdivision of Poonch. The accused worked as a prime agent of Hablas e-Commerce Pvt. Ltd. and remained associated with the illegal collection of public money and swindled the same. The raids were conducted after arrest warrants were issued for the arrest of accused Ali Mohammad of Chak Banota and Mohammad Sayeed Khan of Dhakki Behra. “Both the accused were involved in swindling money worth crores of rupees from the residents by acting as prime agents of the said infamous e-commerce company on the pretext of doubling their money in a short period of time,” said a spokesman. Crime Branch teams conducted raids and arrested accused Ali Mohammad from Bakshi Nagar on Thursday after developing specific inputs regarding his presence in the area. The accused was since long evading his arrest by changing his locations and he had also fled to Saudi Arabia after his name surfaced in the multi-crore fraud that took place in 2019. Another raid was also conducted to arrest co-accused Mohammad Sayeed Khan in Mendhar. “The accused is a notorious fraudster and is involved in many criminal activities. His name also surfaced for his involvement in the multi-crore fraud during the investigation. The accused has also illegally and forcibly encroached upon the house of Mohammad Aziz in Chhugan village of Mendhar,” the spokesman added. “The notorious criminal with the help of accomplices attacked the crime branch team. In this regard an FIR under relevant sections of law has been registered against them at Mendhar police station,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/habalas-e-commerce-fraud-cbi-conducts-searches-at-multiple-locations-in-j-k/story-JROGYeusXnTaO9sGK2sRQM.html

The ban was announced on Thursday and comes into effect from Friday and it will remain in force till January 14. Principal secretary of animal, sheep husbandry and fisheries department Navin K Choudhary said, “The J&K government has imposed a complete ban on import of live birds including poultry and unprocessed poultry meat for any purpose into the Union territory of J&K with immediate effect till January 14. The decision will be reviewed based on the evolving situation.”Answering a query, he said, “The field staff has been visiting poultry markets across the UT to conduct checks and they are also lifting samples from the markets as well as wetlands. There is no ban on the sale of poultry because there are no reports of contamination so far. If such a situation emerges then we will act accordingly.”Jammu’s wildlife warden Anil Atri said, “On Thursday our teams lifted samples from various enclosures of birds at Manda Wildlife Sanctuary in Jammu. Their samples have also been sent to Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Jalandhar for testing.” Atri said that wildlife sanctuaries and zoos were still open to visitors in the UT but enclosures of birds have been closed. It may be stated here that 161 birds that include 153 crows have died so far in Jammu’s Udhampur and Rajouri districts. At least 153 crows were found dead on Wednesday in Udhampur district and eight birds were found dead on Tuesday in Rajouri district. “The samples of dead crows have been sent to the laboratory in Jalandhar. Droppings of 25 bar-headed geese from Gharana wetland along the international border in RS Pura of Jammu district have also been sent to Jalandhar. The reports are awaited,” said Ranjeet Katoch from the animal and sheep husbandry department. Gharana Wetland Conservation Reserve in the R S Pura sector near the international border was notified in 1981 and is home to more than 170 species of birds like bar-headed geese, gadwalls, common teals, purple swamp hens, Indian moorhens, black-winged stilts, cormorants, egrets and greenshanks. During the winter, the wetland is visited by thousands of birds from Central Asia and some of the migratory bird species visiting this wetland are endangered.Katoch, however, said that considering the mass mortality of crows in Udhampur, the possibility of avian influenza could not be ruled out. A bird flu alert has been sounded in states, including Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Gujarat, which are already fighting the battle against the Coronavirus pandemic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-bans-import-of-poultry-till-jan-14-after-161-birds-found-dead-in-two-districts/story-lpj2KB8mYIy4PKv0LsjggI.html

The rainfall began at 1pm in the afternoon and went on until late evening yesterday with heavy spells reported between 5pm to 7pm. Rohan Nalawade who owns a shop near the Hatti Ganpati temple in Sadashiv peth reported water entering his shop premises in the evening. “I was inside the shop when it began raining, initially I thought it was normal rain but after some time suddenly the water started seeping inside the shop. When I saw outside on the road, it had turned into a river and water was even gushing out of the drainages. A similar situation was reported in Sadashiv peth,” said Nalwade. Around two feet of waterlogging was reported on many roads across the city and pedestrians faced the wrath of wading through the marshy territory. Many avoided the risk of walking in the rain and took shelter in shops, buildings and parking areas. While it was raining heavily in the evening, the traffic movement went to a snail’s pace on the city’s key roads like Tilak road, Bajirao road and Shivaji road. Vehicles were moving slowly on Tilak road and there was a traffic jam for some time. “It took me around half an hour to reach Swargate from Alka Talkies chowk through Tilak road due to the rain. While going on the road I saw a couple of bikers falling from the road and even some of the vehicles stuck in the rain,” said Abhishek Khole, a resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/waterlogging-and-traffic-jams-across-pune-as-city-witnesses-historic-january-rainfall/story-9BTv2wnIws12R0PzFEvWLP.html

The civic body is set to lose Rs 350 crore revenue in 2021. The PMC is already facing a financial crunch due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and now the civic body faces heat after the MVA decision. In an attempt to boost the real estate sector, the state government took a decision to reduce development and premium charges. On average, the PMC gives more than 2,500 building permissions a year. Usually, PMC gets around Rs 700 to 750 crore from development and premium charges every year. In 2020-21 annual budgets, the PMC set a target of Rs 800 crore. Until date, the corporation has collected Rs 250 crore. According to officials of the building development and construction department, the PMC will get another Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore up to 31st March 2021. Prashant Waghmare, PMC city engineer said, “We cannot predict the impact on the civic body’s revenue on the background of the state government’s decision to reduce development and premium charges.” One of the senior officials of the PMC said, “The PMC is already facing a financial crunch and now the state government has reduced a 50 per cent development charge. It will impact the annual budget of 2021-22.” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee said, “I don’t think it will affect the corporation revenue collection. The PMC is exploring different avenues to generate income.” ====================================== Development charges Development charges are packing of a Property or Mortgage, including the negotiation and approval of plans and any assistance in obtaining zoning and necessary variances and financing for a specific Property, either initially or at a later date. Under Section 124A of the Act shall be deposited with the Planning Authority before issuing of development permission/ commencement certificate. What is a premium? Premium typically refers to the multiple charges that are levied by the state with respect to approvals for initiating, progressing, and completing the area or additional area in a project.

08-01-2021||Pune||Only two forest guards protect 5,000 acres of reserved forest land in Pune||The Pune forest department has only two forest guards to protect its official 5,000 acres of reserved forest land located under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) area. The forest department has appealed to the citizens to participate wholeheartedly and in large numbers in the Joint Forest Management (JFM) programmes to protect and conserve the forest as it unable to protect the rich biodiversity which is under attack by multiple forces like rapid urbanisation and land sharks during the past few decades. Vast tracts of urban reserved forest land in around Pune metropolitan region are lying unattended and unprotected for decades together with complaints of encroachment, vandalism, illegal log cutting, obscenity, trespassing and dumping of garbage and cement concrete waste. The hill ecology of Katraj forest area is under threat from rising construction menace. The rich forest biodiversity houses rare flora and fauna and the forest hills of Pune are regarded as an offshoot or extensions of the protected Western Ghats eco-sensitive zone. The 85-acre reserve forest land in Tilekarnagar in Kondhwa Budruk has become home to anti-social elements and vandalism with no forest guards in sight. A visit to the spot revealed that the fence has been broken at sides and mushrooming slums along the approach road made it difficult for morning walkers to reach the forest. Similarly, no effort has been made by the forest department to protect the biodiversity and instead, it has turned a blind eye to the rich resource which is fast depleting, according to citizens. Similarly, green activists and neighbourhood citizen groups have demanded protection of 200 acres of NIBM reserve forest by the construction of a protection wall. Besides, the vast 300 geographical spread of protected forest area of Wanowrie-Hadapsar-Mohammwadi also need urgent protection from the vandalism and trespassing. Praveen Kumar Anand, a green activist said, “We want to develop several urban forests and connect all of them through bridges. We want a regular supply of water tankers and financial assistance from the government and corporates to ensure that this rich forest heritage is protected for the entire humanity.” According to Satish Gujar, acting in charge and chief conservator of forests (Pune), around 5,000 acres of forest land falls under the PMC area and for 1,500 to 1,000 acres of land, there is only one forest guard. “We cannot keep new persons as there is a freeze on recruitment. We have initiated urban Joint Forest Management (JFM) committees and it is their responsibility to protect the forests. Fortunately, we have constructed 35 kilometres of protection walls around the reserved forest. If people are ready to contribute, a minimum of Rs 1 then JFM can do good work. There are challenges before us and we are working towards protecting the biodiversity with citizens’ participation. We are having only two guards to protect the entire forest land which falls under the PMC area. Similarly, it is also the duty of the citizens to protect the forests located in their respective areas,” Gujar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/only-two-forest-guards-protect-5-000-acres-of-reserved-forest-land-in-pune/story-BFwLB0rRuE3mTJu2Aa7ScL.html
08-01-2021||Pune||Swargate chowk, a nightmare for commuters and pedestrians||Commuters and pedestrians at the Jedhe Chowk, popularly called “Swargate” have been facing difficulties from the last few days with illegally parked auto-rickshaws, ST buses and passengers plying in and out, bottleneck traffic movement, no zebra crossing markings and overspeeding vehicles. Due to the ongoing Pune Metro work the infrastructure, vehicular movement and overall operations of the MSRTC and PMPML buses from this chowk have gone for a toss. More congestion is expected at the spot if the Swargate - Katraj BRTS resumes service The HT team visited Swargate on Friday and found glaring issues for commuters and pedestrians. On one side of the chowk is the Swargate ST stand, while on the opposite side is the PMPML main bus stop. Due to the ongoing Pune Metro work, barricading has been done from the side of the ST stand cutting down the road width into half. In addition to the reduced width, illegally parked auto-rickshaws at the entrance gate of ST stand have further significantly reduced the size of the roadPassengers stepping out of the ST stand from the Satara road entrance have to risk their lives to cross the road, as there are no proper zebra crossing markings. Also, auto-rickshaws, ridesharing and private vehicles that drop or pick-up passengers from the ST stand add to the traffic congestion. A similar scene was witnessed on the opposite side of the road where the PMPML bus stop is located. Half of the road is barricaded to make a dedicated lane for buses when the PMPML buses arrive from Satara road towards the chowk, there is a long queue of buses creating a hurdle for other vehicles. In all this mismanagement, pedestrians have to risk their lives while walking through the road. “I daily travel through this road to go to my office, since the Metro work barricading has been placed, the traffic at the chowk has increased during peak hours. The ST buses randomly drive from anywhere in the chowk and create more problem to the vehicular movement. Also, the illegal hawkers and auto-rickshaws standing all over the chowk should be removed permanently,” said Bipin Gandhi, a citizen. According to advocate Kishore Rahile of Pune Safer Roads organisation, before beginning the Metro work at Swargate, it was necessary to partially shift the PMPML and ST bus operations to another side of the chowk. “Auto rickshaws are parked all over the chowk in a quest for passengers. There is a need to review and revamp the entire chowk’s infrastructure on a temporary basis until the Metro work is complete. The entry and exit of ST buses from the ST stand is one of the crucial issues which needs to be resolved, for which all parties need to take a joint meeting and find a solution. Also, pedestrians need to be taken into consideration as there is a heavy vehicular movement around the chowk and daily thousands of people pass through here,” Rahile said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/swargate-chowk-a-nightmare-for-commuters-and-pedestrians/story-ZP14GSMNOZPDxdGZKPl26N.html

However, with the social distancing norms in place we have additional restrictions which need not be followed for cargo,” he said.With the current ongoing re-carpeting work going on, the airport runway is only available from 8 am to 8 pm for the next few months.Singh also added that “Once someone approaches us for cargo, we just need to check for suspicious material and if everything is cleared it will take about 30-40 minutes for the cargo loading process.”During Wednesday’s meeting, SII assessed the preparedness of the airport and the officials were asked to keep its manpower and equipment ready which will be put to use when required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-airport-prepared-to-transport-vaccine/story-pzTsogWaJEDNxa2b6a18KO.html

Mere isolation of the virus doesn’t confirm the occurrence of the disease in the body. He said the lab reports are also showing negative results in samples, which shows that the birds aren’t dying of flu but of cold shock or other reasons. The interpretation of the lab reports is required for the declaration of the disease. The first-ever incident of bird flu in Rajasthan is a serious concern of the government, especially at a time when people are already struggling with Covid-19.

08-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses woman’s bail plea in case related to murder of head constable||A Delhi court on Friday dismissed the bail plea of a woman accused in connection with a case related to the murder of head constable Rattan Lal during northeast Delhi riots last year.Additional Session Judge Vinod Yadav rejected the bail plea of Tabassum, a resident of Chand Bagh Area of Delhi, observing that the Call Detail Records (CDRs) of the mobile phone of her revealed that she was in constant touch with several co­-accused persons.The judge further said that the charges against the applicant were serious in nature.“Considering the facts and circumstances of the case in totality vis­-à­-vis gravity of offence, I do not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail to the applicant. The bail application is accordingly dismissed,” the judge said.The judge noted that “it is clearly evident that the protestors and organizers had motivated persons in the mob and certain unscrupulous elements had surrounded the scene of crime and they appeared to be fully equipped with rioting material like stones, sticks, sharp ­edged weapons and other sort of raw weapons.” “Even burqa­ clad women are clearly seen attacking the police party with sticks and other material in their hands and they clearly appeared to be charged up.  “It has also come on record that some of the persons of the mob had taken possession of the rooftops of high­ rise buildings at or around 25 feet road, having firearms and other rioting material with them,” the judge noted.He said that “all this prima facie indicates that everything was being done under a well­ hatched conspiracy, the common object whereof was to cause blockade of the main Wazirabad Road and if resisted by the police, then to go to any extent to liquidate them by use of force.” The police had opposed the bail plea saying Tabassum used to share stage with other protestors and instigate the gathering against the Government which ultimately led to violence on February 24, 2020 thereby resulting in death of more than 50 people in North­ East District of Delhi, including head constable Rattan Lal.According to the prosecution, during the incident, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Shahdara, Amit Sharma, Anuj Kumar, ACP Gokalpuri and 51 other policemen had also suffered severe injuries at the hands of rioters.In her application, the accused had admitted having participated in the protest, however, she reiterated that protesting against some legislation was her “legal and fundamental right” and that it could not be snatched away from her as it was her “legitimate belief and perception that Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) and National Register for Citizens (NRC) were against a particular religion.” She further submitted that the investigating agency had not been able to establish the contents of her speech and whether they were inflammatory or instigating.Regarding the allegation of criminal conspiracy, the accused said that “participating in the protest against a particular law/enactment does not amount to conspiracy of incitement of violence where head constable Rattan Lal had died.” Her counsel also argued that the applicant was a lady, aged about 38 years and permanent resident of Chand Bagh, Delhi.  “The applicant is having two minor school going children, whose future/career is at stake as they have been deprived of the care and custody of their mother.  “She has been falsely implicated in the present matter by the investigating agency; she was not present at the scene of crime on the date and time of incident and as such she has nothing to do with alleged incident,” the application said.At least 53 people lost their lives and hundreds of others were injured in the violence, which erupted between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the norteast area of the national capital in February last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-court-dismisses-woman-s-bail-plea-in-case-related-to-murder-of-head-constable/story-3kiHjQGnwTd35ihO3SUZRN.html

They know what conditions to impose in the tender,” Justice Kulkarni said.“Who are you (Shelar) to complain if the bidders are alright and have no problem with the conditions imposed,” said Chief Justice Datta. The court posted the plea for further hearing next week and asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to file its affidavit in response to the petition.Shelar’s plea said that during the pandemic, medicines and disinfectants procured by civic-run hospitals should be of the highest standards.There was “infringement of the norms of accountability, rationality and manifestation of arbitrariness and perversity in the tendering process”, it alleged.The BMC keeps changing the eligibility criteria, Shelar claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-seeks-bmc-reply-on-pil-alleging-rigging-of-tenders-for-medicines/story-bC24S5PYj5Iw5bM6Y7NTmN.html

There was time to get help from the state government. When the BJP was ruling in the state, it did nothing, but now it is asking for help from the state government.”“The BJP is still ruling in the PMC. Why did they not carry this work out on their own? The PMC floated tenders worth Rs70 crore before the monsoon, but no works took place on the ground,” Deshmukh added.Recently, BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil met the municipal commissioner and to submit a pro-posal for getting aid from the state government to erect retaining walls in private properties and societies.Patil said, “To erect retaining walls along the nallahs which got damaged due to floods, it would require around Rs300 crore.

08-01-2021||City||Brooms as the paintbrush to sweep away gloom of 2020||PUNE Aditya Shirke, an artist from the city, has done paintings on large, 16ft canvasses, with unconventional tools such as household mops and brooms. Through this paintings he has illustrated his vision for 2021. These experimental paintings were created and exhibited at Karkhana, an art-co-lab, designed and owned by Studio Mars. Shirke has created five different paintings portraying various themes. When asked what inspired him, Shirke said, “The last year, 2020, has been a dark year for us. The idea in these paintings is hope that this year will turn into a dark horse. A dark horse in a race is the one nobody bets on, but still wins. We hope the coming year will be like this.” To create these paintings Shirke used mops and household brooms of all sizes, instead of brushes. He didn’t put the canvas on a stand. He laid it down on the floor and used these instruments to paint out his ideas. “I started working on this idea in the last week of December. It took me two-and-a-half days to complete these,” Shirke said. One of the paintings is called “Airborne”. It captures the moment when a horse gains momentum and its torso gets lifted off the ground. The horse’s body in this painting is uplifted. This horse is a race horse and has a blinders which helps it focus. Through this painting Shirke has highlighted the importance of the ability to focus this year. Another painting is named “Cherry Blossom”. The idea of this painting is drawn from Japanese and Chinese cherry blossom brush paintings . This indicates calmness. Emphasising the importance of calmness in mind. These paintings are acrylic on canvas.Shirke emphasises the need for such experimentations. “Initial impulse of humans is to make a mark. Through experimentations we can be instinctive and intuitive. A broom is such an unusual tool to paint with. While using it, all layers of civility go away. We can act instinctively,” said Shirke. Shobhna Hadap, founder and creative director of Studio Mars, underlined the need of such spaces for experimental art. “A lot of artists do not have such avenues where they can experiment with their art. We encourage all kinds of creative explorations and promote ingenious artists. In Europe such co-work spaces are common. Artists should have such avenues,” Hadap said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brooms-as-the-paintbrush-to-sweep-away-gloom-of-2020/story-wOMhcT7qvKVqCbN1Dv3YfJ.html
08-01-2021||Pune||‘A major boost for the real estate sector, relief for buyers’||The Maharashtra government, on Wednesday, slashed premiums and levies charged on construction by 50 per cent till December 31 2021, an initiative expected to boost the real estate sector in the state and city. Real estate developers feel that the state government’s decision will boost the real estate industry which has been affected by months of lockdown and subsequent decline during the last one year. Omprakash Deshmukh, Inspector General of Stamps and Registration, stated that it would give a strong impetus to the sector. Deshmukh said, “This decision by the state government will give a major boost to the real estate sector. It is a relief to customers as one of the GR clause states that builder will have to pay the entire stamp duty. This will positively impact the market and buyers will increase.” Suhas Merchant, president, Credai Pune termed the decision as a welcome step. Merchant said, “It can provide great relief to cash-stressed real estate projects. In the past two years not many projects were launched due to shortage of funds. Though we need to study the decision in detail, I definitely feel that more projects will be launched now.” Rohit Gera Managing, director, Gera Developments said, “The move to reduce the premiums is extremely welcome. It will provide respite to cost burdens for developers, thereby spurring on more supply at lower prices. It is, however, important to realise that the charges paid for approvals include development charges and other charges under other heads. Effectively this means the total benefits will be much less than 50%.” Nitin Gupta, senior vice-president, sales, marketing and CRM, Mantra Properties, said, “With reduced stamp duty charges and now this rationale by the government brings in great relief to the developers wherein ever increasing costs of construction can be offset to an extent. The environment today with low interest rates and reduced stamp duty was pushing the demand for homes and with the reduction in premium charges, we’ve got a catalyst to help the sector grow.” Vineet Goyal, joint managing director, Kohinoor Group, said, “We all are seeing the positive impact of stamp duty reduction. Similarly, we feel that this step will also prove to be beneficial for both, the real estate developer and the home buyer. It will provide considerable relief to the ailing real estate sector, where cash flows are affected due to lockdown and will provide a direct cost benefit to the home buyer. The state government is concerned about the real estate sector which directly indirectly helps many other business segments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/a-major-boost-for-the-real-estate-sector-relief-for-buyers/story-BpIqBNPFO61u8qUW7GM9PL.html

I would ask the state’s chief secretary to come up with a notification today so that 100% seats can be occupied,” Banerjee said while addressing the inauguration of the 26th edition of the KIFF. On January 4, the Tamil Nadu government had issued a similar order to increase the occupancy in cinemas, theatres and multiplexes to 100% capacity. The centre, however, has asked the Tamil Nadu government to revoke its order saying it diluted the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA). “I would urge cinema hall owners to ensure that people wear face masks and use hand sanitizers. Sanitization should be done after every show. Every audience should carry his own sanitizer or a tissue paper. Now-a-days you also get machines with which you can sanitize the entire hall in just five minutes,” she added. Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan was virtually present for the inauguration. This year, 81 full-length feature films and 50 short films and documentaries from around 45 countries would be screened in eight venues over the next one week.

Even though citizens can book the tickets online, three helpdesks have also been set up at Nandan, Tollygunge and Salt Lake for those who find difficulty in booking tickets online. “Not everyone can purchase e-tickets. Many people think that if they have the card of the festival they would be allowed. I think the authorities should allow every card holder,” Banerjee said. She also urged the authorities to put up LED screens outside the cinema halls so that more people can see without entering any closed spaces such as cinema halls and theatres, where chances of infection are more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-allows-100-occupancy-in-cinema-halls/story-AjQcPlLfww6mflXxZsmvVP.html

When a similar situation was faced by the non-teaching staff of Delhi University’s St. Stephen’s College, a group of students rose to the occasion to lend them a helping hand. “They’ve helped and supported us, and we felt if it was in our power to do anything for them, we should,” says Neha Jacob, a second year student of BSc (Hons) Mathematics. Describing how the initiative came into being, Jacob adds, “We were aware of the financial difficulties faced by the non-teaching staff on campus. The pandemic, and the lockdown that ensued, ate into their savings. Hence we spoke to the partners of our staff members, and floated the idea of raising funds for them by selling hand stitched masks made by them.” Students of second and third year from the college are involved in this initiative, to help facilitate an additional source of income for the family members of their college’s non-teaching staff. Currently, three women are stitching these masks, and one individual is appointed to deliver them across Delhi, after orders are placed online. Providing income and even dignity of labour, to those involved in making masks, this project has shone a ray of hope to quite a few. Laxmi Devi, one of the women who is stitching the masks, says, “My husband is employed as a washerman in the college campus. During the initial months of the pandemic, we managed. But of late, it’s been hard to make ends meet. Ek din college ke bachchon ka phone aya aur unhone pucha ki kya apko madad ki zarurat hai. Jaise hi unhe pata chala ki hume sach me paison ki pareshani ho rahi hai, they arranged for cloth and asked me to start stitching masks. Before my marriage, I used to teach people how to stitch clothes, so I did have some experience in stitching. Best is that the students are helping us in selling these masks online, and this in turn is has helped us feed our two kids.”This team of youngsters has also donated around 166 masks till now, to those in need. Shubham Belwal, a final year student of BSc (Hons) Mathematics, says, “There are two aspects to this project. Firstly, the team sells masks on the basis of an order placed beforehand, and we are providing delivery in not only Delhi but across India now. Secondly, we are also engaging in pledge donations, wherein people can donate money for masks that are then distributed to members of the non-teaching staff and their families on campus, as well as others who need them. Each mask costs ₹35 on order, and if the purchase is intended for donation, then we charge ₹30 per mask.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-s-stephanians-lend-a-helping-hand-to-non-teaching-college-staff-amid-pandemic/story-G9oUpqBz7gRBSOqqdhUeDI.html
08-01-2021||Pune||Slam Dunk: Going from good to best to elite||The sport of basketball is generally considered one of the top 5 sports in the world, by participation numbers. Breaking down the numbers, the FIBA organization (the governing body of worldwide basketball), estimates that approximately 450 million people worldwide play the sport. Currently, NBA teams are allowed 15 players on a team roster, which means that there are a total of 450 NBA players. Globally, there are estimated to be approximately 75,000 professional basketball players. Obviously, this is a miniscule percentage which speaks to how competitive and difficult it is to play at the elite professional level. Harbouring dreams of playing basketball at a level that is as competitive as the NBA and other professional leagues requires a clear understanding of the skills needed to get recognised as an elite player in the world. In part one of this series, I will cover the most important intangible skills a young player needs to possess to make it to a competitive level of basketball. 1. Mental Focus - Growth Mindset The ability to learn from failure and adversity is what separates many of the elite basketball players from those who do not make it to an elite level. A “growth mindset,” as defined by Carol Dweck, thrives on challenges and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence, but as an exciting springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. This mindset allows players to see and maximise every opportunity they get as a chance to improve their basketball skills, no matter the competition . 2. Practice Habits - Deliberate Practice The phenomenon of “deliberate practice” is defined as “practice that focuses on tasks beyond your current level of competence and comfort”. Most basketball players will remain engaged when practicing skills that they are good at or comfortable with. The most elite players, such as Stephen Curry, consistently practice skills they need to improve at. An example would be a player continuously shooting free throws in an empty gym, without running or any activity between. The player may score 90% or more of their free throws in this scenario, which means they are staying within their comfort zone of practice in order to have a consistently successful outcome. At this point, the player has to ask if practicing in this manner is deliberate practice or not, since converting 90% of free throws in this scenario would appear to be well within their current level of competence and comfort. Deliberate practice may involve shooting two free throws at a time, while running in between attempts, similar to what would happen in an actual game. In this way, the addition of other variables creates a task that is beyond the player’s current level of comfort. 3. Character Trait - Self-Awareness Self-awareness is a crucial intangible for players to master, since this will usually lead a player to close examination of their strengths and weaknesses. In looking throughout basketball history, the best players, who are consistently great, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses honestly because of their self-awareness. Once they have done this, they are able to understand their weaknesses and work on them to improve them, thus making them better players. 4. Character Trait - Coachability After recognising strengths and weaknesses, the next step is for a player to surround themselves with coaches or people who can help them to work on their weaknesses. While criticism from a coach can be difficult to accept, it is one of the key ingredients that leads to improvement of basketball skill. The most elite NBA players continuously accept coaching observations which greatly assists their improved performances in games throughout a season. Focusing on these intangible skills will help any player in the sport of basketball understand their strengths and weaknesses in order to maximise their potential in the sport. Next week, I will focus on the most essential tangible basketball sport skills necessary for success in the sport.Adi Vase is the first Indian to work in the physical coaching and sport science departments of NBA teams.

08-01-2021||Pune||Pune’s CFR rate dropped in December 2020 to 2.61 %||From a Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.62 per cent in May, the highest for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the CFR rate now has come down to 2.61 per cent as of December 2020. The CFR tracks the number of deaths from those patients confirmed as having Covid-19. To add to this, the positivity rate has also reduced in PMC limits, giving some relief to the strained healthcare infrastructure. Speaking about the reduced fatality Rate, Dr Sanjeev Wavare, assistant chief with the health department of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said that CFR at present is 2.58 per cent in the city limits. “Due to early detection and more awareness about Covid, the fatality rate has reduced since May. Many patients approach hospitals soon and seek treatment sooner, leading to better recovery,” said Wavare. He further added that now that the fatality rate is low, residents should not be complacent about precautionary measures. “Earlier there was less awareness about wearing masks, hand sanitisation and social distancing. Now we can see that many people are following this. Even if the rates go down, citizens should continue following precautionary measures,” said Wavare. Of 4,677 hospital beds in the city, as of December 31, 2020, 1,314 were occupied by Covid patients with 3,363 vacant. The PMC has closed 27 Covid Care Centre (CCC) till December 31, with 20 hospitals and 2,432 beds released and converted from Covid to non-Covid use, by the PMC. Along with the CFR, the PMC stated that doubling rate for the infection has now increased to 463 days. The positivity ratio in the PMC limits has also reduced to 8.60 percent on December 30 from 10.15 percent on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-s-cfr-rate-dropped-in-december-2020-to-2-61/story-76MZeDHLMfF2T2zx4piUkJ.html

According to the Maharashtra Highway State Police (HSP), Pune division in 2020 (January to December), a total of 42 accidents were reported and 26 people lost their lives, while in 2019 (January to December) a total of 87 accidents were reported and 37 people lost their lives.According to Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of Police, Highway State Police (HSP), Pune, during the unlock phase last year the police officials focused on creating road safety awareness among masses and will continue to take strict action against violators. He speaks to Dheeraj Bengrut about the plan ahead.1. What would you say about overall expressway operations in 2020 and the decline in the number of accidents and fatalities?For at least four months due to complete lockdown, there was a fewer number of vehicles on the expressway. When the unlock process started, we focused mainly on creating awareness among people about safe driving. Through interceptor vehicles we are taking action on speeding vehicles, our camera action near the Kamshet tunnel and heavy vehicles action on the left lane on the expressway are some of the key measures which we had taken in 2020.Now, we have also started announcements at the tolla nakas for the public, through which we create awareness about travelling safely and following rules like using a seat belt, lane discipline, not using a mobile phone while driving among other things. Along with this road the infrastructure has also improved, rumbler strips were installed and unauthorised punctures were cut down.2. How do you plan to improve operations?We will be continuing our regular actions against speeding, lane cutting and other safety-related awareness amongst drivers on the expressway. We will also monitor the vehicular movement coming on the expressway from the nearby villages and conduct an audit of roads. Accordingly speed breakers will be installed on these roads.Another focus area for us will be to keep a track on heavy vehicles. We want to keep the left lane only for the use of heavy vehicles. Most of the times these heavy trucks move from the middle or first lane and other small vehicles while overtaking them go in a zig-zag formation, which is risky or leads to accidents.3. What is you appeal to commuters using the expressway?Commuters should keep a watch on the speed limit while driving on the expressway. Rather then we taking action against them they should be responsible and follow norms. Everyone should realise that back home our family wants us to be safe so we should take our own responsibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/keep-a-watch-on-speed-limit-while-commuting-on-pune-mumbai-e-way-sanjay-jadhav/story-NVlBgq0cNUt1Vi8p2J2MtK.html

Continuous action is been taken against people speeding vehicles and flouting norms” said, Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent of police, HSP, Pune.“During the lockdown period, meanwhile, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) carried out several infrastructure works,” he said.“Also, the response time of our team has improved during this period, so the accident victims got aid on time,” he said.“It was expected that there would be less number of fatal accidents on the e-way in last year. But certainly, the behavioural change was noticed amongst the drivers, when they found the e-way not crowded drivers go in high speed leading to accidents,” said Tanmay Pendse, road safety activist.“As there was a lockdown for almost four months and only emergency vehicles were allowed to travel, still the accidents didn’t reduce to that extent,” he said.Kiran Pisal, a regular traveller on the expressway, said, “Since the unlock process has started, I regularly travel to Mumbai via the expressway. Till now I have gone to Mumbai more than 15 times in the last six months and I found it safer than earlier.”“The presence of police on the highway has increased and even the Amrutanjan bridge has been demolished. I even noticed some infrastructure development on the highway,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-mumbai-expressway-dip-in-number-of-accidents-fatalities-in-2020-as-compared-to-2019/story-vOzsV9VRcjD8MWj1pOtacJ.html

He has the best relationship with the BJP-led Union government since ever since he formed the government in Punjab,” Sukhbir said in reply to a query. The SAD broke ties with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a week after party MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the new agriculture laws in September. Sukhbir said that following instructions from Union home minister Amit Shah, Capt Singh was attempting to weaken the farmers’ protest. “Why have IGs and SSPs of Punjab Police been participating in meetings between the Centre and farmers? The CM is trying out all options to weaken the farmers’ protest and has now started registering cases against singers and farmers just for dumping cow dung outside the BJP leaders’ house,” Sukhbir said, alleging that it all has been done by the chief minister as he is under the BJP’s pressure due to his ED investigations and visa (indicating to his Pakistan friend). “The resolutions passed against three farm bills in the Vidhan Sabha have not been sent to the governor for the final nod which shows intentions of the CM that he is against the farmers,” Sukhbir added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/captain-acting-as-bjp-s-cm-attempting-to-weaken-farmers-protest-sukhbir/story-Kx75lQaW9PiZ2vuU9oJjpL.html

Government officials said the rule may be extended after reviewing the situation. “As a matter of abundant precaution, in view of the increased transmissibility of the new variant, it is decided that all travellers coming from the UK to India would be mandatorily subjected to self-paid RT-PCR tests on arrival at the airport.

The central team, which visited the Community Health Centre at Raipur Rani, is discussing the line of action with the Panchkula district administration. Culling of birds is to take place within 1 km area of Kheri and Ghanauli villages from where the samples tested positive. The death of poultry birds has been taking place since the first week of December and the Panchkula administration has come under criticism for inaction. The state animal husbandry and dairying department sent samples twice to the Jalandhar lab but the reports were inconclusive. It was only after the central team got the samples sent to Bhopal that the report came positive for bird flu overnight. Dr Saroj Aggarwal, deputy civil surgeon, Panchkula, said that arrangements have been made at CHC, Raipur Rani, and isolation wards have been set up, while Tamiflu tablets have been procured to check human-to-human transmission of the influenza. “We are ready to deal with any situation,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/death-of-over-4-lakh-poultry-birds-in-panchkula-s-barwala-belt-due-to-avian-influenza/story-wWm82yEnFkrsbtXuqTRnzO.html

08-01-2021||Kolkata||Owaisi’s politics won’t work in Bengal: Muslim clerics react to AIMIM’s poll debut||Hyderabad-based All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s strategy to forge an alliance with Pirzada Abbasuddin Siddiqui, the scion of the Siddiqui family, the custodian of the famous Furfura Sharif shrine in Bengal’s Hooghly district, will not yield electoral dividend in the coming polls, prominent Muslim clerics, imams and political experts have said. Accused by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), Congress and the Left parties of helping the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by splitting Muslim votes in the perviously held Uttar Pradesh and Bihar assembly polls, the AIMIM, several Muslim clerics and imams told HT, will not be accepted by voters in Bengal. Siddiqullah Chowdhury, a minister in the TMC government and president of the Jamiat Ulema - e –Hind’s state branch has also declared that Owaisi has no place in Bengal politics. Also Read: Nadda to launch new campaign on farm laws during Bengal visitThe reaction from heads of the minority community against the AIMIM’s entry into Bengal is significant because all political parties are aware that it not possible to come to power solely with the support of Hindu voters. Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01% during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30% now. Among the districts where the Muslim population is substantially high are Murshidabad (66.28%), Malda (51.27%), North Dinajpur (49.92%), South 24 Parganas (35.57%), and Birbhum (37.06%). There is a large number of Muslim voters in East and West Burdwan districts, North 24 Parganas and Nadia as well. The BJP, which has been accusing chief minister Mamata Banerjee of appeasing the minority community for years, has said that AIMIM is an independent party and can contest anywhere. According to surveys done by the TMC and the BJP, a swing in Muslim votes can influence poll results in as many as 120 assembly seats. Union home minister Amit Shah has announced that his party will oust the Mamata Banerjee government by winning over 200 of the state’s 294 seats while Banerjee’s election strategist Prashant Kishor recently tweeted that he will give up his job if the BJP’s tally crosses 99. Making his first noticeable move to emerge as a threat to the TMC in the polls due in a few months, Owaisi, on Sunday, met Abbas Siddiqui, who has emerged as a critic of the ruling party in recent months. Siddiqui has even talked about his plans to launch a broad political platform with Hindu Dalits and tribal communities for contesting the polls. Owaisi said on Sunday that Siddiqui will decide how AIMIM will contest.The Furfura Sharif shrine is one of the most popular pilgrimage olaces in Bengal. It is built around the mausoleum of Pir Abu Bakr Siddiqui. It also has a mosque built in 1375. Furfura Sharif draws millions during the Urs festival and the annual fair dedicated to the Pir. The West Bengal Imams’ Association has reacted to Owaisi’s plans, saying there is no place for communal politics in Bengal. Of about 40,000 mosques in Bengal, clerics from at least 26,000 are members of the association. “Whether Hindus or Muslims, people in the state have only one identity. They are all Bengalis. On one hand, Bengalis are being branded as ghuspetiya (infiltrators in Hindi) by the BJP while on the other, some leaders from Hyderabad and Gujarat are coming to Bengal to divide the population on communal lines. This will not be accepted,” said Md Yahiya, chairman of the imams’ association. In April last year, Yahiya made news by writing to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, accusing him of “trying to disturb the communal harmony from a constitutional position” and seeking the retraction of his remarks on the Nizamuddin markaz in Delhi in a letter to the chief minister. In a significant development, other members of the Siddiqui family, including Pirzada Toha Siddiqui, the most prominent among the elders whose support helped the CPI(M) and TMC in the past, has made it clear that he will not support any move that can help the BJP. “Hindus comprise 70% of the state’s population. If they wanted, the BJP could have come to power long ago. We will not do anything to let our Hindu brothers down,” he said after Owaisi met Abbas Siddiqui at Furfura Sharif. On Thursday evening, Pirzada Jiauddin Siddiqui, another scion of the family told HT that Furfura Sharif cannot be dragged into politics. “Neither Pir Abu Bakr Siddiqui nor any of our ancestors joined politics. This is a religious place and so shall it be. What Abbas is doing is entirely his business,” he said. Maulana Md Shafique Qasmi, the imam of Nakhoda Masjid, said no party can benefit by propagating the politics of religion. “I am a religious man. I don’t know what happened in politics before my birth but today people of Bengal do not accept communalism. No political party, whichever it may be, can benefit from it,” he said. Built a century ago as a replica of the mausoleum of emperor Akbar in Agra, the Nakhoda Masjid is the biggest and most important mosque in Kolkata. Kolkata-based political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said a tie-up with Abbas Siddiqui can help Owaisi in only a few pockets of Bengal. “Siddiqui’s influence is limited to some parts of Malda, North Dinajpur and South 24 Parganas. Unless the imams support him, Owaisi won’t benefit much. However, even if they manage to get only 1% of the Muslim votes it will be substantial,” Bandopadhyay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/owaisi-s-politics-won-t-work-in-bengal-muslim-clerics-react-to-aimim-s-poll-debut/story-muiFk2Vw0zw9ReheKEXbBL.html
08-01-2021||Chandigarh||BJP’s Ravi Kant Sharma is new Chandigarh mayor||Bharatiya Janata Party managed to keep its flock together, making a clean sweep in the Chandigarh mayoral elections on Friday.Ravi Kant Sharma, a first-time councillor and the outgoing senior deputy mayor, has been elected the mayor, and will succeed Raj Bala Malik. Other party nominees, Maheshinder Singh Sidhu and Farmila, have been elected the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, respectively. BJP leaders gave a sigh of relief after the results, as despite fears, no cross-voting took place. The party’s choice of candidates had led to resentment within its councillors, and party state chief Arun Sood and other senior leaders had been holding meetings with them till Thursday night. BJP has 20 members in the House, Congress has five and Shiromani Akali Dal has one. Local MP can also vote, being an ex-officio member, taking the total number of votes to 27. While MP Kirron Kher and BJP councillor Heera Negi did not turn up due to health reasons, SAD councillor Hardeep Singh was present but boycotted the election. Sharma managed to get 17 of the 24 votes polled, while Congress mayoral candidate Devinder Singh Babla could muster only five. Two votes were declared invalid, as the councillors concerned had marked in front of both mayor candidates’ names, said returning officer Anil Kumar Garg. This is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s sixth consecutive term on the mayor’s post, and the last before the House goes to the polls again later this year. Congress cries foul over use of mobile phonesAfter Sharma was elected mayor, Congress councillors boycotted elections of the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor. Even as voting was going on in the MC House, Chandigarh Congress leaders and councillors addressed a press conference. “Despite the ban, mobile phones were used by BJP councillors. There is discontent in BJP, and if there were no mobiles, Congress candidate Babla would have won by a large margin,” said Congress chief Pardeep Chhabra. Mobile phones are said to be used for clicking pictures of the ballot paper after voting to rule out cross-voting. Babla alleged that MC officials favoured the ruling party by not adhering to stipulated rules. Notably, before voting started, Garg had directed all councillors to deposit their mobile phones with the House officials. Councillors were seen to be following the directions, but Congress later alleged that BJP councillors had bought two mobile phones and submitted only one. Meanwhile, both Sidhu and Farmila got 19 votes, equal to the number of those present and voting. BJP to take action against erring councillors State BJP in-charge Dushayant Gautam, who was present during the election, called the two invalid votes “a serious matter”. “Even after voting for the last four years in mayoral elections, councillors are making such mistakes,” he said, while ruling out any intentional wrongdoing on their part. However, he said that Arun Sood has been asked to examine the issue, and “we will take strict action against such councillors”. Gautam also indicated that councillors who indulged in anti-party activities in the last four years could be denied ticket during the MC elections. “It is an election year. Now, we will punish those who went against the party,” he said.‘No new tax will be imposed, water tariff will come down’Ravi Kant Sharma, 53, originally from Una in Himachal Pradesh, is associated with RSS since childhood and with ABVP since his college days. After shifting to Chandigarh, he actively participated in the party’s activities and rose through the ranks, from block-level worker to a mandal president and then to a district president. Running a courier and cargo business from Sector 34, he got the party ticket for MC elections for the first time in 2016. After getting elected from ward 3, he went on to become the senior deputy mayor last year. Upon his elevation to the mayor’s post on Friday, HT talked to him about his priorities. Q. What will be your priorities? A. Completing ongoing development projects will be top on agenda. Door-to-door waste segregation and road recarpeting also remain priorities. Q. Internal party strife preceded your election. Your take? A. There is no factionalism in the party. We all work in unison for the party and city’s development. Q. Will you be imposing fresh taxes? A. We will not impose any new tax. Water tariff will also be decreased. For improving financial situation of MC, we will ensure that adequate funds are received from the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-s-ravi-kant-sharma-elected-chandigarh-mayor/story-yrKb3AsFx0ICT5b3GNZzfL.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC refuses pre-arrest bail to municipal councillor booked for extortion||The Bombay high court on Thursday rejected anticipatory bail application of Dhananjay Gawade, a municipal councillor from Nalasopara, who allegedly used information obtained under the Right to Information Act for extorting lakhs of rupees from local builders.“In the case in hand, the material clearly suggests and points out his complicity in the offences alleged against him which are serious in nature,” said justice Sandeep Shinde, while rejecting the anticipatory bail plea of the 45-year-old.Ten offences were registered against Gawade, a sitting councillor of Vasai Viral municipal corporation, at various police stations in Palghar and Thane districts between March 31, 2018 and April 12, 2018.Also Read: Bombay HC raps customs authorities for acting contrary to court ordersHe had, however, moved the high court for anticipatory bail in all the cases, claiming he was actually a whistleblower who had exposed links between senior civic officials and the builders’ lobby by filing public interest litigations either himself or through his associates seeking the demolition of illegal and unauthorised constructions in Vasai Virar municipal area, but now the police, municipal officers and the builders’ lobby had ganged up against him by filing multiple FIRs.Justice Sandeep Shinde, however, refused to accept the claim after noticing that “tangible material was available on record, which on evaluation suggested that information in relation to the construction of the building, sought under RTI was allegedly used against erring or offending builders to extort the money from them.“In other words, the applicant being a city corporator and as it appears, not only he abused the Right to Information Act for his personal gains, but also breached the trust of the citizens who elected him their representative on local municipal authority,” said justice Shinde while rejecting Gawade’s anticipatory bail applications.The court added that the evidence on record also “disclosed complicity of the officers of the corporation either by extending the protection to unauthorised construction, or turning Nelson’s eye to it.” “...Not only officers of the corporation, but also editors of local newspapers exploited the situation to gain out of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-pre-arrest-bail-to-municipal-councillor-booked-for-extortion/story-SqtDFyyMoWLQ666RdtrxKL.html

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Winter showers in Mumbai; weather likely to remain same till Saturday: IMD||Winter showers were reported across Mumbai and neighbouring areas late Thursday evening and early Friday morning. Cloudy weather and light rainfall are likely to continue till Saturday, said the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Isolated winter showers were reported in Kurla, Mahalaxmi, Borivali, Kandivali and Bandra. Neighbouring areas such as Thane, Dombivali and Badlapur also saw isolated spells of rain on Thursday evening and Friday morning. IMD attributed the unseasonal rain to a trough along the coast of Maharashtra and Karnataka.“Mumbai woke up to cloudy skies and rainfall in some parts. Under the influence of a trough in low level easterlies from Karnataka coast to Maharashtra coast in lower tropospheric levels, isolated to scattered rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning at isolated places is very likely over Maharashtra during the next two days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.

Santacruz recorded a minimum temperature of 23.4 degrees Celsius, which was 5.9 degrees above normal and Colaba recorded 23 degrees Celsius, which was 3.4 degrees above normal. The air quality in Mumbai remained in the very poor category on Friday morning with air quality index (AQI) -- a pollutant measuring indicator -- of 313. The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at ten locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Navi Mumbai reported the worst air of the 10 stations with an AQI of 329, which was closely followed by Borivali with an AQI of 326.“As winter conditions persist, a low dispersion of pollutant particles in the air is seen.

Commuters have been advised to avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road, and NH-44.Motorists can also take the Delhi-Gurgaon and Delhi-Faridabad routes between the two states.The protests have been going on for 44 days now and farmers leaders will hold another round of talks with the Centre on Friday.Thousands of farmers took out a tractor rally on Thursday near Delhi as a “trailer” of their planned march on the Republic Day if the government does not accept their demands for scrapping the laws, which they say benefit big corporations at their cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-borders-remain-closed-due-to-farmers-protest-traffic-diverted/story-gTcSxuaKM7ryae5n3wzkVL.html

08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Covid vaccination drive: Chandigarh to develop own system for allocating time slots to beneficiaries||The UT health authorities will set-up their own system to provide staggered timings to the beneficiaries during the actual Covid-19 vaccination drive.The need for such a feature was felt during the dry run conducted at the Government Multi-Speciality Hospital in Sector 16 and civil hospitals in Sector 22 and Manimajra last week, following which the authorities had also provided feedback to the Centre.“We found that the beneficiaries could be provided with time slots with around one to two hours of difference so that they don’t have to wait for too long. The whole activity can take up to 5-6 hours if all of them come at the same time. We will create another system that will apprise the beneficiaries of reduced time slots,” said Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, UT director, health services.There are nine sites for vaccination in Chandigarh: two sites each have been created at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16; others are three sub-district hospitals in Manimajra, Sector 22 and Sector 45, and a dispensary in Sector 49.On Friday, another dry run monitored by the ministry of health and family welfare will be conducted by GMCH-32 and GMSH-16. The following steps will be followed: verification to make an entry on the CoWIN app, mock vaccination is administered, validation of completed vaccination is done on CoWIN, confirmation messages are generated and received by facility in-charge, also beneficiaries were made to wait under observation for 30 minutes and finally sent home after giving them a number on which he/she could contact in case of any problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-vaccination-drive-chandigarh-to-develop-own-system-for-allocating-time-slots-to-beneficiaries/story-7kvYmd1LQYtTZUsKPsyVGI.html
08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Amid protests, CHB razes illegal constructions in Chandigarh’s Indira Colony||Amid protests by local BJP leaders and residents, the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) on Thursday carried out an anti-encroachment drive in Indira Colony here.Unauthorised constructions in two houses and fresh illegal constructions including stairs and overhanging eaves/roofs projecting on public land were razed.“In both the cases, challans to stop further construction and remove fresh violations were issued in March and October. But these were not complied with by the allottees. In the circumstances, the demolition exercise was carried out. CHB is computing the cost of demolitions, which will be recovered from the allottees, and in case of non-payment, their allotment is liable to be cancelled,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.Earlier in the day, when the CHB accompanied by the police came to undertake the drive, they were confronted by BJP leaders including state general secretary Rambir Bhatti and councillor Vinod Aggarwal. The leaders and party workers were detained by the police and later released after the drive was completed.Later, BJP leaders including Bhatti, deputy mayor Jagtar Singh Jagga, councillors Shakti Prakash Devshalli and Aggarwal started an indefinite protest outside CHB office, Sector 9, demanding that all notices sent to CHB allottees for violations should be withdrawn immediately.Bhatti said, “For some time now, CHB has been undertaking such drives on its whims and fancies. It is demolishing people’s houses in such cold weather. We will continue with our protest outside the CHB office till it doesn’t stop harassing people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-protests-chb-razes-illegal-constructions-in-chandigarh-s-indira-colony/story-ddVDJoYxWFuBunNnBScohI.html
08-01-2021||City||As Punjab reopens schools, Haryana schools demand the same||As schools for students of Class 5 onwards reopened all over Punjab on Thursday, the private schools in Ambala, too, have demanded a reopening in a phased manner.Citing losses and overall adverse impact on the education of the students during lockdown, owners, directors and principals have joined in to demand the reopening.A delegation under the banner of Haryana Progressive Schools Conference met MLA Aseem Goel to hand over a memorandum in the name of chief minister Manohar Lal on the same.Saurabh Kapoor, president of Integrated Private School Welfare Society, said, “Students’ studies have largely been compromised and they should be allowed to come to schools so that the remaining time before exams can be utilised in a productive manner. Apart from this, management is under immense financial pressure as banks have started taking EMIs.”On this, MLA Goel said, “I understand their problem and I have spoken to education minister Kanwar Pal in their presence. He has assured that a positive step will be taken soon.”Classes above 9 already operationalThe Haryana education department had already allowed reopening of government and private schools for classes 9 and 11 from December 14, and for classes 10 and 12 from December 21, for three hours.The private schools have also talked about taking full precautions as laid down by the government for students above Class 9.State vice-president of the Haryana Progressive Schools Conference Prashant Munjal said, “This pilot project of the government has trained us on how to educate students while following Covid protocols. The reopening of schools from Class 9 onwards has gotten a positive response.”An official of the Haryana education department, on the condition of anonymity, said that despite winters and rising Covid cases, the attendance had improved in government schools: “Average attendance in schools was around 5-7% in the first week of reopening in December. Now, around 20-25% students are attending physical classes daily despite a few cases of students and teachers testing positive at a school in the cantonment earlier this week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-punjab-reopens-schools-haryana-schools-demand-the-same/story-Hu3zKPPx6Cu3gojb1kz30O.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Third vaccination dry run covering all 11 districts of Delhi today||After two dry runs of the Covid-19 vaccination process over the past week at select health centres, Delhi, along with other states and union territories, will conduct a full-fledged mock drill in all its 11 districts on Friday.Senior health officials said over 600 officials, comprising a mix of physicians and district officers, will be appointed as supervisors at vaccination centres once the actual drive is rolled out.“The chief district medical officers (CDMOs) have been made the nodal officers for the centres in their respective districts. Once the actual vaccination process begins, Delhi will start with about 621 session centres where the Covid-19 vaccines will be administered to registered beneficiaries after verification. Each centre will have a supervisor. In most districts, these supervisors are doctors; in a few, officers appointed by the district administration will oversee the process,” a health official said, on condition of anonymity. Dr Suneela Garg, public health expert and professor of excellence at Maulana Azad Medical College, Delhi, said apart from checking the vaccination process, a major reason for conducting a dry run in all districts is to check the efficiency of the Co-WIN mobile application.“During the dry run, there will be several queries from the medical teams who have been trained for the exercise. The idea is to clear all possible doubts, check for problems and resolve them over the next few days,” she said.On Thursday, a day before all 11 districts were to undergo the dry run, the respective nodal officers notified the health care centres where the mock drill would be held on Friday. In the south district, 10 vaccination sites will hold the dry run. These include AIIMS Ansari Nagar, Safdarjung hospital, Phoenix hospital in Greater Kailash, Centre for Sight in Safdarjung and Focus Imaging and Research Centre Private Limited, Green Park. The south-east district identified at least 19 facilities which include Apollo hospitals, Metropolis Healthcare Limited, Fortis hospital, Batra hospital, Holy Family hospital, Escorts hospital, Moochand Khairaiti Ram hospital and so on. The north-west district will hold the dry run at 12 health care facilities such as Max and Fortis hospitals, Shalimar Bagh, Saroj hospital and so on. The New Delhi district will conduct the dry run at four locations --in the northern railway central hospital, Primus hospital, MCD school in Rangpuri which has been linked to a government maternity and child care centre in the area and Fortis Vasant Kunj. The first dry run was conducted at three select health care centres of Delhi on Saturday, while the second dry run happened at around 66 sites on Wednesday. The Delhi government said all these centres will also be vaccination centres when the final immunisation drive is rolled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/third-vaccination-dry-run-covering-all-11-districts-of-delhi-today/story-cDrfchTxrEh1oIYgDmqmHI.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Fewer reserved ICU beds in private facilities||The Delhi government has told the Delhi high court it has reduced the reservation of Covid-19 intensive care units (ICU) beds to 40% in 33 private hospitals.In an order passed on January 6 by RN Das, the medical superintendent of nursing homes, with the approval of state health minister Satyendar Jain, the government said it has accepted the recommendations made at a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) review meeting on January 5 to reduce the number of beds further to 40%.“It was further decided in the review meeting to convert four fully Covid private hospitals, namely, Fortis Super Speciality Hospital, Vasant Kunj; Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Rohini; Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, Model Town & Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Pusa Road to be part Covid hospital,” the order read.The government said these four private hospitals shall reserve 30% of their total bed capacity for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and 40% of their total ICU beds, or at least twice the number of occupied Covid-19 ICU beds as on January 5, whichever is higher, for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.On December 27, the government reduced the ICU beds reservation to 60%. However, it said they would not consider any further de-escalations in the wake of the new strain of the virus, as well as with Christmas and New Year’s celebrations in mind. The government said it will review the situation in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fewer-reserved-icu-beds-in-private-facilities/story-Epsvw47hxLuHKMWX7jOghI.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||No bird flu cases in Delhi yet, sample collection ordered to check spread||With at least four states across India reporting the spread of avian influenza or bird flu, Delhi on Thursday launched a large-scale sample collection drive to prevent its spread in the city-state even as wholesale rates of chicken dropped by ₹15-20 in a day, poultry traders said. In neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar, the divisional forest department on Thursday has restricted access to certain areas of Okhla Bird Sanctuary and closed the Surajpur wetland to visitors as a preventive measure.Thousands of birds have died in Kerala (mostly poultry), Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds), and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (crows) since the start of the outbreak in December-end.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s development and animal husbandry minister, held a meeting on Thursday to review the situation. Soon after the meeting, Sisodia put out a statement that Delhi has not reported a single case of bird flu so far. “Doctors of all 48 veterinary hospitals of the government’s animal husbandry unit are continuously monitoring the situation across Delhi. Also, 11 rapid response teams have been formed which have been asked to regularly collect samples. So far, more than 100 samples have been collected and sent to the designated lab in Jalandhar, Punjab. The report is expected on Monday,” Sisodia said after the meeting.He directed officials to keep a close watch on poultry birds being brought in from neighbouring states, and instructed them to keep a close watch on migratory bird spots, poultry markets, water bodies, zoos and other potential hot spots. The sites from where samples are being collected include Ghazipur fish and poultry market, Shakti Sthal lake, Sanjay lake, Bhalswa horseshoe lake, Delhi zoo, and smaller water bodies in parks. Traders said after the Central government issued advisories to states on Wednesday regarding bird flu, the impact was seen on Thursday — a drop in sales which also resulted in a price drop of ₹15-20 for a kilogram.“In just a single day, the wholesale price of a kilogram of chicken in Delhi has reduced from ₹90 to ₹70-75. The number of trucks arriving at Ghazipur market on Thursdays is about 80, and today, too, around 76 trucks arrived at the market. But people have stopped buying chicken even though there is not a single case of bird flu in the city as of now,” said Iqbal Qureshi, general secretary of Ghazipur wholesale poultry association.Traders said the price of chicken would fall further if bird flu cases start emerging in Delhi. They insisted that chicken sold in Delhi are “100% safe” as these birds undergo medical checks before being brought to the Ghazipur wholesale market. The divisional forest department, Gautam Budh Nagar, on Thursday restricted access to certain areas of Okhla Bird Sanctuary and closed the Surajpur wetland for visitors as a preventive measure against bird flu. Forest department officials also held an inspection at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary to check for any unusual death of avifauna and later issued a caution against bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-bird-flu-cases-in-delhi-yet-sample-collection-ordered-to-check-spread/story-8lE59h7JbQOX4RbyHsMNmL.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||486 fresh cases in capital, test positivity rate drops to 0.63%||The Capital recorded 486 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the sixth time the daily infection count stood below the 500-mark in January, while the positivity rate dipped to 0.63%.The active cases tally on Thursday dropped to 4,168 from 4,481 the previous day.The city had recorded 654 cases on Wednesday with a positivity rate of 0.88%, the only time the daily infection count has crossed the 500-mark in the first seven days of January.Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, and the World Health Organization recommends that a region with a comprehensive testing programme should maintain a positivity rate below 5% for two weeks, for an outbreak to be considered under control.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said the positivity rate had been below one per cent for the past several days, indicating an improvement in the pandemic.The new cases on Thursday resulted from the 77,522 tests conducted the previous day, including 43,347 RT-PCR tests and 34,175 rapid antigen tests, according to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.With fewer cases, the government has also decided to de-escalate the number of beds at its Covid Health Centres, with the number of beds to go down from 305 in three centres to 50 beds in one centre. The Delhi government had also ordered 115 hospitals in the city – both government and private – to de-escalate the number of beds on New Year’s Eve. “We had reduced around 2,500 beds in Delhi government hospitals and 5,000-6,000 beds in private hospitals. The occupancy currently is less than 2,000. Earlier we had 18,800 beds available, but even after de-escalation we still have 10,500-11,000 beds. We shall be repeating the exercise of de-escalation next week,” Jain said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/486-fresh-cases-in-capital-test-positivity-rate-drops-to-0-63/story-mYjNNQAfGYobl11XDjIIzJ.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s vaccine drive likely to start early next week: Officials||The immunisation of health care and frontline workers in the Capital is likely to begin by Wednesday, with the first batch of vaccines expected to arrive in the city soon, according to multiple senior officials from the Delhi government involved in the vaccination drive. Once the doses are available, the government will need a day or two to figure out the cold chain and logistics to start rolling it out, the officials said. The districts have long-listed 55 government and 105 private hospitals, each with over 100 health care workers, to receive the initial roll-out. This includes hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung, Lok Nayak, GTB, and Hindu Rao, among others. The list of private hospitals includes Max, Fortis, Apollo, BL Kapur, and Gangaram, among others. Vaccine to all the centres will be supplied by the Delhi government and will be free for the beneficiaries. The list will be finalised on Friday during the meeting of the state steering committee under the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (Negvac). “It was thought that the roll-out should begin in hospitals first, as immediate emergency care will be close at hand if there are any adverse events. From what we have seen in the US and the UK, some people had allergic reactions, fever, joint pains, and rashes. We need to be prepared for all eventualities as we still do not know how the Indian population will react to the vaccines,” said a senior district official who asked not to be named. Once the logistics are in place, the roll-out will happen simultaneously across all the selected centres, he said. “The vaccines should be with us by Monday or Tuesday, after which we will need a couple of days to figure out the cold chain and other logistics to get it from the stores to the sites. Once that happens, the vaccine drives will start across all the selected centres,” said a second Delhi government official. Even as these preparations are in full swing, the Union government is yet to sign procurement orders with the vaccine manufacturers with some negotiations on costs and paperwork still pending, according to a senior Union health ministry official who asked not to be named. Once that happens -- expected this week, according to officials -- systems are in place for the vaccine transport to start in a day or two. India’s drugs controller on Sunday granted restricted emergency approval to two companies for their Covid-19 vaccines. The first vaccine to become available in Delhi will likely be the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, called Covishield in India, and manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India. The other vaccine that has been granted approval for “restricted use in emergency situations” is Bharat Biotech’s Cavoxin.The first batches of the vaccines will be kept at Delhi’s central storage facility at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur. The facility has been prepared and security tightened in anticipation of the vaccine doses coming in. “The two-floor utility block in the hospital was earmarked as Delhi’s central store. Around 90 deep freezers were installed in the block to store the vaccine at the required temperatures. And CCTV cameras have been installed throughout the building to ensure that the doses remain safe. The police have also been contacted to provide additional security when the vaccines arrive. The vaccines are like gold at the moment,” said a third official from the Delhi government health department. He explained the transportation plan. The vaccines will be sent from the central stores -- apart from the Rajiv Gandhi hospital, there is another one in Civil Lines -- to the respective district stores. From there, they will be transported to 621 cold chain points in the city. From here, the vaccines will be carried by five-member teams to the vaccination sites in ice packs. All the vaccine sites have also been fitted with units to store vaccines at the right temperature. “Both the vaccines that have been approved by the drug controller have a 0.5 ml intramuscular dose. They are also stored in the same 2 to 8 degree Celsius. The vaccinators have already been trained for the same and no additional training is required,” said Dr Suneela Garg, professor of community medicine at Maulana Azad Medical College who is a part of the state task force. Several dry runs have been conducted across the city to prepare vaccine sites over the past week, and dry runs at four sites set to happen on Friday. “After approval to the two vaccines, Delhi Government is making all the arrangements. The health care workers, frontline workers, and people over 50 years of age, or below with co-morbidity will be injected in the first phase of the roll-out. Delhi has 3 lakh health care workers, and 6 lakh frontline workers. The vaccine will be first rolled out to these 9 lakh people,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday. He said that the government will start with 500-600 vaccination sites, and gradually scale them up to a 1,000. There are at least 4.2 million people above the age of 50 years in the city, as per the electoral rolls, and a list of those under 50 with comorbidities is being prepared by the government, HT reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-vaccine-drive-likely-to-start-early-next-week-officials/story-sD5epmbAzteD9JaKjFrK3L.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Never-ending mess at Ashram Chowk||The traffic nightmare at Ashram, one of the busiest intersections in Delhi, will continue till at least April with the Public Works Department yet again extending the deadline for the completion of an underpass that is primarily aimed at decongesting the stretch. Prolonged and haphazard construction, poor site management and extension of barricades for building the 750-metre underpass, connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and the Ashram Chowk, have turned Ashram into a commuter’s nightmare. The underpass which was scheduled to be completed in December 2020, will now take at least till April to finish. Earlier, the PWD had extended the deadline till March, but due to poor pace of work, even the March deadline could not be met. Hindustan Times on Thursday did a spot check at the intersection, where traffic jams have become the order of the day. Drivers, who had been waiting to cross the junction for several minutes, were seen honking helplessly to seek passage, as the trail of vehicles manoeuvred their way through the narrow lanes. Most of the space on the carriageways from New Friends Colony towards Nizamuddin and vice-versa has been taken up for construction work, leaving little space for the thousands of vehicles to move. Even during non-peak hours, vehicles at the Ashram intersection, which was already the Capital’s biggest choke point, are seen waiting in traffic snarls for hours only to cross the junction. Over the past fortnight, the PWD has not just extended the barricades up to the centre of the main intersection, crunching the space for traffic movement significantly, but has also simultaneously taken up space on the sides of the Mathura Road on the New Friends Colony side for the construction of pavements. The section of the Mathura Road near CSIR Apartments and on the opposite side of the carriageway has been cordoned off for the construction of pavements and digging work is on. What the construction agency has not taken into consideration, however, is that this, along with the main construction work in the middle of the main road, has left barely one lane for traffic. Surendra Singh, who owns a tea stall near the CSIR Apartments, said vehicles taking a left turn from the Ring Road to go towards NFC are suddenly squeezed for space as the barricades on both sides of the road create a bottleneck. “This construction work started around a week ago. Vehicles have three lanes till they cross the Metro station gate, but the road space shrinks to one lane a little ahead,” Singh said. Delhi PWD minister Satyendar Jain’s office said an additional two-metre space has been occupied for construction work, beyond what was originally being used. “After the construction of the retaining wall of the underpass, this barricading will be removed and an additional four-metre space will be available for traffic movement,” the minister’s office said in its response. The minister’s office said that most of the barricades on the stretch will be removed by February-end and the remaining work will be fast-tracked. While the overall traffic on the Ashram intersection is mismanaged, commuters going towards Nizamuddin have it worse. The PWD barricades, along with the vehicles parked on roadsides and encroachment at the Hari Nagar Ashram market forms a sudden and narrow bottleneck. Shalini Yadav, a regular commuter on the stretch, said crossing the portion of the road between the main intersection and the railway bridge is a test of a driver’s skill. “On one side you have the barricades, and on the other you have vehicles and cars parked on the roadside. If that was not enough, the pedestrian movement is also high in this area in the evening. Pedestrians just jump before your car unexpectedly because there is no space for them to walk,” Yadav said. Senior Delhi traffic police officials said since traffic plan for the site was approved, unforeseen events such as the closure of borders because of the farmers’ agitation has led to an increase in the traffic volume at the intersection. “When the plan was approved, there were alternative routes that could be used by commuters instead of having to cross the Ashram intersection. But with many of these now being restricted, people going towards Noida or Faridabad have to use this route. We thought this would be a temporary arrangement, but it has lasted longer than we anticipated,” said a senior traffic official, who asked not to be named.The problems, however, do not end here. The placement of temporary traffic signals to streamline traffic is causing cascading jams on the Ring Road and on the Ashram flyover. Apart from this, to avoid getting caught in traffic, commuters are now using a narrow passage between the barricades and the divider on Mathura Road on the NFC side, to crossover to reach the fuel station on the stretch. This traffic movement is further adding to the logjam. The PWD in their response said that since December 2019, when the foundation stone of the underpass was laid, the work on the project has moved slow because of multiple hurdles. “Shaheen Bagh protest started in mid-December 2019, due to which traffic load increased on Mathura Road and traffic police did not allow work on the full width of road. In March, lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic, after which work resumed in May,” the PWD said. “Only after May 2020, the work started but there was shortage of labour and shortage of material because of the pandemic,” the minister’s office said. It added that other hindrances such as shifting of underground utilities, including water and gas pipelines, and power cables, also delayed work. “As per current situation the work will be completed by end of April this year,” the office said. Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said while undertaking construction on busy roads such as the Ashram intersection is a challenge but better use of technology and site management can ensure that minimum inconvenience is caused to commuters. He said the construction agency should adhere to the deadline, as extensions would only add to traffic problems on the stretch. “Road space should be left as per the volume of traffic. Since traffic volume was increased, the site should have been managed accordingly. More resources should have been used to fast-track work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/never-ending-mess-at-ashram-chowk/story-KW17bjpd2SWR31ObTsTUnK.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Extend ban on flights from UK: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday urged the Centre to consider extending the ban on flights from the United Kingdom, amid rising concerns over a mutant strain of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in India.The Centre partially lifted the ban and resumed India to UK flights from January 6. The first flight from the UK, after the ban was lifted, will arrive in India on January 8.Calling the Covid-19 situation in the UK “extremely serious”, Kejriwal demanded that the ban on India-UK flights be extended till January 31.“Centre has decided to lift the ban and start UK flights. In view of the extremely serious COVID situation in UK, I wud urge central govt to extend the ban till 31 Jan,” he said in one tweet. In another tweet, the CM said: “With great difficulty, people have brought Covid-19 situation in control. UK’s COVID situation is very serious. Now, why lift ban and expose our people to risk?”.With the Central government going ahead with its decision to allow flights from the UK to arrive in India, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev issued an order on Thursday asking all stakeholders concerned in the city administration, as well as the police and airport authorities, to strictly follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the Centre. “Passengers testing positive shall be isolated in an institutional isolation facility coordinated by the state health authorities. Those who are found negative on testing at the airport would be advised quarantine at home for 14 days,” read SOPs by the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/extend-ban-on-flights-from-uk-kejriwal/story-QTmhB1pJraBllYAfqnsiBK.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Light rain likely in some areas, temp may fall, IMD says||A day after spells of rain and hailstorm in parts of Delhi, the temperature in the national capital on Thursday remained higher than the season’s normal, with the minimum temperature settling at 14.4 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above normal. However, despite the rise in temperature, the air quality strayed further into the “poor” category on the air quality index (AQI) scale, as wind speeds remained low. India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings show that on Thursday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 14.4 degrees Celsius, seven degrees above the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 19.9 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal. IMD scientists said on Friday, the minimum temperature could dip by a couple of degrees. “For Friday, we are likely to see a minimum temperature of around 11-12 degrees Celsius. There is a possibility of moderate fog in the morning hours,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. Even as the temperature remained high on Thursday, the air quality showed a marginal deterioration, but remained in the “poor” zone. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an AQI of 255 In Delhi, in the “poor” zone. On Wednesday, the AQI was 226, also in the ”poor” zone. On a scale of 0 to 500, a reading between 200 and 300 is considered poor. Scientists said from Saturday, the wind speed is likely to pick up significantly, which will improve the air quality. “There is a possibility of light rain in some parts of Delhi on January 9, after which the wind speed is likely to reach around 25kmph. The AQI will improve over the weekend,” said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also said the ventilation condition is expected to improve marginally in the next two days. “The AQI is likely to marginally improve and be in the “poor” or ”moderate” range on January 9 and January 10,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/light-rain-likely-in-some-areas-temp-may-fall-imd-says/story-opXVqyFOTgFHTZ0SYcx2fP.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vaccination mock drill across Thane, Navi Mumbai today||Thane district will conduct a vaccine dry run at three places on Friday – Thane Civil Hospital, Diva and Shahapur. A team of five people including vaccinators will be present for the dry run in each centre. Preparations have been made across the district with enough provisions to store the vaccines and manpower for the drive in both rural and urban areas.Dr Kailas Pawar, civil surgeon, Thane district, said, “There are five trained personnel in each of the three centres who will execute the dry run on Friday. Based on our experience in these places, we shall submit a report to the State Health Department. We have made all the necessary preparations. Rooms have been made available for this purpose in these areas. Additionally, we have some staff present at the centres if need be.”As per the state guidelines, a minimum of 25 beneficiaries will visit the centre for the dry run. Preparations have been made for separate entry and exit points at these centres. First, the beneficiaries will be registered and then taken to the vaccination booth. There will be an observation room as well where they will be kept for half-an-hour to ensure there are no after-effects of the vaccination. All of this will be done in a mock process on Friday.The beneficiaries will receive an alert through messages and will have to arrive for the dry run as per the time mentioned. “The main aim of the dry run is to understand the preparedness and the time taken to follow all the protocols.“The result of the dry run will help us plan for the actual drive. As of now, we have planned 850 vaccination centres across the district. There will be 100 vaccines administered in each centre across the district on a daily basis. Those who get an alert through the app will be given the vaccine,” added Pawar.Provisions have been made for vaccine storage across the district with 190 ice-lined refrigerators, 197 deep freezers, 199 cold boxes, 26,530 ice packs and 4,814 carriers. Across Thane district, there are 66,447 frontline workers who have registered online. Most are from within Thane city. There are around 846 vaccinators who will administer the vaccine.According to the district health department officers, Thane city has the highest number of frontline workers within the district. There will be an increased number of vaccination centres within Thane city and the civil hospital in Thane will be one of the immunisation centres where the first round of vaccination will take place.TMC dry run at Rosa Gardenia The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) will also conduct a dry run on Friday at Rosa Gardenia Health Centre on Ghodbunder Road.

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Cidco takes steps to increase water supply to Navi Mumbai||To ease the water woes of Kharghar to Panvel in Navi Mumbai, which falls under the jurisdiction of City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco), the government agency has taken several measures for the same as the fast developing regions have long been suffering from severe water shortages. The measures include plans to reserve water by making payment to concerned agency, speeding up various works and appointing consultant to advice on improving water supply in the Cidco nodes.  Cidco vice-chairman and managing director Sanjay Mukherjee said, “The board of Cidco Ltd has approved a proposal to pay ₹119.18 crore to Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation (KIDC). This will enable us to reserve water to the tune of 120 million litres per day (MLD).”  Mukherjee said that a micro-tunnelling work project to allow drawing additional water from Hetwane dam is also approaching completion.  Water from Hetwane dam often pass through slopes, due to which the water supply is of low pressure. In a bid to deal with the issue, Cidco started the work of constructing underground aqueduct for Hetwane dam last year. The excavation work of the tunnel beneath Hamrapur hill for the pipeline, connecting Hetwane dam to the city, at the depth of 20-25 metre is near completion. This project is to be completed till February-end. Thus, Cidco will receive an additional quota of 30 MLD water from Hetwane dam, an official said.  Presently, water from Hetawane dam is supplied to Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) region along with some nodes and nearby villages under the jurisdiction of Cidco. Till now, Cidco had reserved 150 MLD water from Hetwane dam.  Besides, the state government has handed over Kondhane dam of Karjat taluka with 250 MLD to Cidco. However, the planning of this dam project is under process.  The population of Panvel and Uran taluka, developed by Cidco as south Navi Mumbai, has reached 20 lakh. By considering the increasing population in the city, the water demand of the city is likely to increase to 1,275 MLD by the year 2050. Hence, Cidco is looking to get additional 120 MLD water from Hetawne dam.  Mukherjee added, “Cidco will appoint an expert agency for proper planning of water supply for Cidco colonies coming under PCMC jurisdiction, Ulwe, Dronagiri and various upcoming projects of Cidco. This agency will conduct a thorough study of the entire water supply system and water resources and accordingly guide Cidco for water supply management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cidco-takes-steps-to-increase-water-supply-to-navi-mumbai/story-8JwW3iB3Lg5L0F9E60EPTI.html

08-01-2021||Delhi||AAP starts campaign to ‘expose MCD graft’||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday launched a campaign to organise 2,500 mohalla sabhas (public meetings) to highlight the alleged corruption in the three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of Delhi. On Day One, AAP MLAs Atishi and Saurabh Bhardwaj held these meetings in Kalkaji and Greater Kailash assembly constituencies, respectively.Bhardwaj held his public meeting at Dargah Chowk on Thursday afternoon, which saw a crowd of around 100-200 people. The AAP MLA and chief spokesperson criticised the BJP and its former Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari for “lying” to the people of Delhi. Bharadwaj said during the last MCD elections, Tiwari had promised the people of Delhi the BJP would ensure the MCDs get money directly from the Central government.“Tiwari promised the people of Delhi before the 2017 MCD election that if they make the BJP win, there will be no scarcity of money in the civic bodies because the BJP will directly bring money or fund from the Central government. The BJP won the 2017 MCD election and it has been four years since they are ruling the MCD. But the situation has not changed at all. The same financial mismanagement is going on in the civic bodies with its employees going on protests every day,” Bhardwaj said.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the strike in civic bodies is the result of a lack of political intent in the state government.“Ever since Kejriwal came to power in 2015, with a political bias towards the BJP-ruled civic bodies, it has been in one way or the other curtailing the release of constitutional funds for the three MCDs. The present situation is such that the arrears of municipal funds amount to over ₹13,000 crore, in the current financial year 2020-21. The fourth quarter of the year has started but civic bodies have got one about 30% of this year’s allocated funds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-starts-campaign-to-expose-mcd-graft/story-6weP7francT3CRoKuMY1jJ.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Vaccine dry run in 30 Maharashtra districts today||Maharashtra will take nearly three months to complete the first phase of Covid-19 vaccination for 800,000 people, state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Thursday. The health minister’s statement came a day ahead of the dry run for vaccination in 30 districts and 25 municipal corporation areas. The dry run is being done to detect logistical issues that may crop up in the actual immunisation drive expected to start after January 13. Tope said, “In the first phase, we have decided to keep 80 to 100 centres. If we have to immunise 800,000 people, it’ll take about 80-90 days. We will carry out the process scientifically.” He added that the administration has already uploaded details of approximately 800,000 health workers on the CoWin app. The minister said, “The vaccination centres will be at district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, medical college hospitals and civic n hospitals, where tertiary care is available.” Tope added that the Centre has not provided them any clarity on the time between two doses. The state has also sought clarity from the Centre on the vaccine to be provided and has also demanded more ice-lined refrigerators (ILR), deep freezers and walk-in coolers for the storage of vaccines. Maharashtra, meanwhile, on Thursday reported three fresh cases of the mutated strain of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The three new cases are from Pimpri-Chinchwad, state health department officials said. The total cases of the new variant in the state have now risen to 11. On Monday, eight samples tested positive for the new variant, which originated from the United Kingdom (UK) and is said to be 70% more transmissible than the original strain. A health department update stated all 11 patients are asymptomatic, of which two — one each from Mumbai and Pune — were discharged after completing 14 days of quarantine and their two consecutive samples were found negative by an RT-PCR test.Of the 11 cases, one person is from Gujarat and the other is from Goa.The state reported 3,729 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the total to 1,95,82,82. The state also reported 72 fresh fatalities, taking the toll closer to the 50,000 mark at 49,897. Mumbai added 665 fresh cases on Thursday, taking its tally to 296,985. Mumbai reported seven fatalities, pushing the toll in the city to 11,162.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the dry run will help the administration find out any logistical issues, including the usefulness of the CoWin app, before the actual vaccination starts.“As per the guidelines of the Centre, a dry run will be carried out in Maharashtra’s 30 districts and 25 municipal corporation areas. Each district will have three centres, while the municipal areas will have one vaccine centre in the dry run,” said Tope in a statement. Last week, the state had conducted a small-scale dry run in four districts and two municipal corporation areas.A statement from the health department said the dry run will show if problems exist in storage, supply and administration, and these will be ironed out. The statement said it will help check out how convenient and useful the CoWin app. Besides that, it will help the planning, implementation and reporting of coronavirus vaccination, verification and inspection of all these matters, before starting the actual vaccination.The state health minister participated in the meeting with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan held via video-conferencing over the vaccination drive. “The meeting was to take stock of the preparation, but we do not have much clarity on the vaccine that will be provided. They [Centre] have said that they would inform us [about the vaccine]. They have categorically told us to carry out vaccination in tertiary care centres, a clarification we had sought,” the minister told HT.Tope said the state has sought several changes in the CoWin application. The state has also demanded only one of the two vaccinations, so as to maintain uniformity. “We have sought many changes in the CoWin app. We also demanded that only one vaccine should be given to us. Because one vaccine’s second dose could be after 30 days, while the other’s maybe after 45 days, it would create confusion. We have given them details about our shortage in the ILR, deep freezers, walk-in coolers. We need 667 ILCs, but so far they have provided 101, we asked for the remaining.“We asked time slots to be specified for people to arrive at Centres. In absence of timing, people may crowd at vaccination centres. Besides, in the app, we need bifurcation for ones who refuse to take the vaccine, since it is for emergency use now,” Tope added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/vaccine-dry-run-in-30-maharashtra-districts-today/story-wOGIrqgcDpO71SLvipA9aO.html

They asked the security persons to stay away. A video of the incident went viral on social media as onlookers kept watching the entire act. Chetan Badiyani, customer service manager of Torrent, Bhiwandi, said, “There was no communication from the party regarding their complaints. They directly came and vandalised the offices. We are registering a case against the incident at both our offices.”MNS state deputy president, D K Mhatre said, “People were irked by the excessive bills by the company and also power cuts. After trying several times to get a response from the company, there was no feedback from them. Hence the protest.”The Shantinagar and Narpoli police have registered a case against Manoj Gulvi, president of MNS Bhiwandi and Pravin Devkar, secretary of MNS Bhiwandi, and at least eight others under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code, Criminal Amendment Act and Covid Sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mns-party-workers-vandalise-torrent-offices/story-dji6Ap1Ut9Mc8vwcX37N5K.html
08-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A bungalow in Roshanpura||The sight is incredible. Two eras next to each other. One is more than 100 years old, and the other is just four months old. And the one uniting these two periods is a man in his 60s.“This is my granddaughter, and that used to be my neighbour’s house,” says a beaming Manoj Jain. The little girl is too young to have a name, he says, but “let’s call her Angel.” The house behind him is a bungalow in ruins. In fact, it is one of the very few edifices of such a vintage that still survive in Gurugram, a place in the National Capital Region otherwise so modern that it is known as the Millennium City. This particular locality, Roshanpura, actually has a handful of old houses, many of them in a similar shabby state. Mr Jain, who describes himself as a “retired man”, lives with his family in a house directly opposite this picturesque ruin.“My house is also old,” he declares. Waving his hand dismissively, he cheerily launches a diatribe on the newer buildings. “They are nothing compared to the old ones. Houses like ours have walls that are 18 inches thick. Imagine that in the houses of today, with their 4 inch walls!”Meanwhile, it’s warm and sunny, and Angel is lying on Mr Jain’s lap, her eyes closed, oblivious to the architecture of the past and present. Her family’s colourful laundry is drying on a wash line strung across the length of the derelict bungalow.The paint of this long-uninhibited house has peeled off the brick walls. The windows are without glass panes. The doors are open, but they are choked with overgrown wild grass. Money plant vines have spread upon the entire front facade, entangling the bungalow into a kind of fishing net. It’s difficult to see anything inside the open rooms because of the vegetation. The whole setting looks like a scene in a fairy tale.“The family that owns it now lives in another city,” says Mr Jain. He remembers playing in this house as a boy. “The kids living here were my friends.” He would go to the house—when it was still a home—almost everyday. There were taaks—arched niches—on every wall. Indeed, one can spot a few of those taaks even from the outside, if you strain your eyes and look through the vine-cover.“And it had marble floor,” adds Mr Jain. He gestures towards a multi-storey building on his right. It is very new. The walls haven’t been painted yet. “An old bungalow stood there too... all such houses are being replaced one by one,” he observes, betraying no hint of lament in his voice. “But my house shall remain.”One wonders what this place will be like when Angel will be big enough to understand the changes brought about by time. A mall perhaps? In any case, you ought to see this edifice before it disappears into history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-bungalow-in-roshanpura/story-cJ6DZa6hzJkakgbxMnn4IL.html
08-01-2021||City||40 BJP workers on way to police chief’s office detained||High drama was witnessed after 40 BJP workers, along with the party’s district president Pushpinder Sighal, were detained on their way to the office of police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal on Thursday.The local BJP unit had announced ‘gherao’ of the police chief’s office to register their protest against the him for not registering an FIR against Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu. They had been staging a peaceful protest for the past four days against Bittu for making “provocative speeches and instigating people”.However, the protest held near the Clock Tower fizzled out on Monday after the police cordoned off the area by installing barricades. Even the dharna outside the mini secretariat on Tuesday and Wednesday remained a lukewarm affair. However, party leadership decided to up the ante on Thursday and called upon their youth and women wing workers to gather outside the mini secretariat. As the BJP workers began to assemble outside the DC office, heavy police forces were called to control the situation. Upon being stopped by the cops led by ACP Jatinder Chopra, the BJP workers began sloganeering against the police and the ruling Congress regime. Soon, Singhal and his supporters were bundled up in police vehicles. Vice-president Mahash Datt Sharma and other party workers, who were left at the spot, accused the police of working at the behest of Congress leadership.“A total anarchy is prevailing in the state. The BJP is not causing any polarisation in Punjab, but the Congress and leaders like Ravneet Singh Bittu are. He is making loose remarks and terming the protesting farmers Khalistani, but no action has been taken against him,” said Sharma.ACP Chopra said as a preventive measure, the BJP workers were taken to Sarabha Nagar police station and let off with a warning.Covid safety norms went for a toss during the protest as most of the workers were not wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/40-bjp-workers-on-way-to-police-chief-s-office-detained/story-HIoP1az1xhm9SgtnibF7bK.html

08-01-2021||City||Property tax evasion: Pay ₹1.15 crore, MC tells Sacred Heart Convent||Tightening the noose around one of the renowned schools in the city — Sarabha Nagar’s Sacred Heart Convent School — over property tax evasion, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) served a notice to its management on Thursday. The school management has been directed to pay ₹1.15 crore, including 100% penalty on the evaded tax amount. The civic body had earlier received a complaint wherein the complainant — an RTI activist — sought inquiry into the property tax returns filed by the school for the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. An MC official said that after going through the case, it was found that the school had filed property tax returns for three years under the self-occupied category. “The building owner or the tenant has to pay 7.5% of the annual rent as property tax, but in the case of schools, 50% exemption is provided by the department,” the official, who is not authorised to speak with media, added. It was also found that the school management had evaded tax amounting to over ₹57 lakh by filing the tax return under the wrong category. “As per the tax evasion norms, the violator has to pay 100% penalty on the amount evaded, so the MC served a notice for the recovery of ₹1.15 crore,” the official said. MC superintendent Harvinder Bindra said, “The school has evaded tax due to which a notice has been served to its management, seeking submission of ₹1.15 crore as tax, including penalty, otherwise action will be taken against the school after discussing the matter with senior officials. We have also tightened the noose around different city hospitals, managements of which had been evading tax.” The school authorities, however, denied involvement in tax evasion. School principal Sister Rashmi said, “No tax evasion has been done by the school and the notice served by the MC is not correct. The school has paid the tax as per the norms and is not involved in any illegal activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/property-tax-evasion-pay-1-15-crore-mc-tells-sacred-heart-convent/story-F5pxepbatJhzKEkfR1ViZL.html
08-01-2021||City||Mundian rape case: Police investigation under scanner for ignoring key witness||The probe in the rape case at Mundian police post has come under scanner as the police did not involve the man who was brought to the station along with the victim on December 5, 2020. The man was suspected to be in an illicit relation with the victim by his relatives, who had thrashed both of them before dragging them to the police station.Delay in medical examination of the victim has also raised questions on the police probe. The woman had undergone medical examination at least 29 days after the crime. Any such delay in the medical examination in cases like this can lead to loss of evidence. Head constable Rakesh Kumar, the main accused who had allegedly raped the 24-year-old married woman at the police post of Mundian Kalan, is in police custody. He has undergone a test for coronavirus. After the test report, he would be sent to jail in judicial custody. The other accused — including a woman from Mundian Khurd, her daughter, son and another relative from Paramjit colony on Chandigarh Road — are still absconding. The accused are relatives of the man who was suspected of having illicit relations with the victim. The police commissioner has already formed a special investigation team (SIT), comprising additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) (City 4) Rupinder Kaur Saran, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Simranjeet Singh, Jamalpur SHO Kulwant Singh and a woman officer, Kulwant Kaur.The ADCP said that as the SIT has been constituted, they will investigate the matter from all aspects. “A hunt is on to nab the other accused. We will also involve the man in question in the investigation and record his statement,” she added. The ADCP said that earlier, the woman had withdrawn the complaint filed by her and also submitted an affidavit wherein she had requested not to take any action against the head constable. “However, after some days she pursued her application and sought registration of an FIR. We suspect that the woman had previously filed the affidavit under pressure from the head constable. We are also investigating previous cases and inquiries against the head constable, who is currently in police custody and under suspension,” she added. On January 3, head constable Rakesh Kumar posted at the Mundian police post was booked for raping and threatening the 24-year-old woman. The accused allegedly threatened her with false implication of her husband if she lodged a complaint against him.Taking cognisance of the incident, Punjab State Women Commission (PSWC) chairperson Manisha Gulati had also asked police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal to submit a detailed action-taken report.

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Second FIR against Dilip Chhabria for cheating comedian Kapil Sharma of ₹5.7 crore||Comedian Kapil Sharma approached the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch on Thursday to file a complaint against car designer Dilip Chhabria for allegedly taking ₹5.70 crore from him and not delivering his vanity van. Police have recorded Sharma’s statement. Joint commissioner of police Milind Bharambhe said, “We are in the process of registering a first information report (FIR) against Chhabria for cheating Sharma. We will verify the facts and investigate the case.” Another crime branch officer said that police are likely to arrest Chhabria again on Friday. Chhabria was arrested by CIU on December 28, 2020, after police found that he and his firm, Dilip Chhabria (DC) Designs Pvt Ltd, had allegedly availed loans from some non-banking financial companies (NBFC) by posing as customers looking to buy DC sports cars. Police raided his factory in Pune and seized 14 cars and 40 engines. After his police remand ended on Thursday, Chhabria was produced in court again and was granted judicial custody for 14 days. In his statement, Sharma said that he had approached Chhabria to design a vanity van between in 2017. Sharma paid ₹5.30 crore to Chhabria from May 2017 to May 2018, but when he found that there was no progress on his order, he approached Chhabria in July 2018, said Bharambe. Chhabria demanded ₹40 lakh more as GST (goods and service tax) and Sharma paid the amount in July 2018. However, after a few months, there was still no development on the van. Sharma then asked for his money back, said Bharambe. Chhabria said he would deliver the van but asked for an additional ₹60lakh from Sharma. The comedian then approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in 2019, following which NCLT froze Chhabria’s account, added Bharambe. Chhabria then sent Sharma a bill of around ₹12 lakh for parking the vehicle and keeping spare parts in the factory premises. After receiving the bill, Sharma approached the Mumbai economic offences wing (EOW) and registered a complaint. Now CIU is registering a separate case against Chhabria and will investigate the case.Chhabria had manufactured 127 DC-Avanti cars in the past four years, of which 120 had been sold in India and abroad. The crime branch suspects that 90 of the cars were registered with the same engine and chassis number in different states, under different registration numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-second-fir-against-dilip-chhabria-for-cheating-comedian-kapil-sharma-of-5-7-crore/story-Eubf0k8RaTYT0YbNXXP5QN.html

According to the plan, the inter-city or inter-state bus terminals will be linked with other modes of transport like BEST buses, Metro and taxis, to ferry passengers from there. This is expected to reduce the influx of vehicles and reduce traffic within the city. Thackeray assured that immediate relief funds will be released for Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST). “A request of around ₹120 crore has been made by the BEST for covering their operational cost, which will be granted from the Covid relief funds. This is apart from the ₹1,000 crore financial aid that is given to the BEST,” a senior civic official said. The BEST services were running throughout the pandemic for ferrying essential services, while other public transport modes were shut.By January-end, BMC will float tenders to appoint a consultant to conduct a study and present a long-term business plan for the BEST. “We are now looking forward to appointing a consultant to give us a 10-year business plan for BEST to come up with reforms and scope for earning revenue to make it self-sufficient,” Thackeray said.The BMC has also identified 386 flooding spots in the city and 96 tenders have been floated for initiating mitigation measures for the spots. A senior civic official confirmed that the work has already begun in some of those spots.Thackeray said that the civic body has set a target for this year to achieve proper lane markers for roads and pedestrian crossing, footpaths and refuge areas, no overhead wires, garbage dump free footpaths, cleaner underbellies of flyovers, streetlights, traffic junctions with art and walking ways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aaditya-thackeray-reviews-mitigation-plan-for-flood-spots-in-mumbai-directs-to-expedite-transport-hub-plan/story-OwxxMoxb0ScZvzypDaHyhK.html

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Hemant Nagrale takes additional charge as director general of police of Maharashtra||Hemant Nagrale, director general (legal and technical), has been given additional charge of the director general of police (DGP) of Maharashtra after the incumbent Subodh Kumar Jaiswal was appointed as the head of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Nagrale, a 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, along with 1988-batch officers Param Bir Singh and Rashmi Shukla, are believed to be the top contenders for the post. In an order issued by the state home department on Thursday, the government has stated that Jaiswal, a 1985-batch IPS officer, has been relieved from the responsibility to take up the new job in the Central agency. “Hemant Nagrale has been appointed with additional charge to the post fallen vacant after Jaiswal’s new appointment,” the order stated. The state government has begun the process to appoint a new DGP as per the Supreme Court’s directions in the Prakash Singh case. An official from the home department said Nagrale is most likely to be appointed as DGP after completing the procedure. “By picking Nagrale for the additional charge over senior-most DG Sanjay Pandey (1986-batch), political bosses have hinted at their intention. Pandey is unlikely to be considered for the post because of his slew of litigations against the government over the years. The proposal to the Central government for the appointment will be sent soon,” the officer added requesting anonymity.“We will send names of officers who have completed 30 years of service to UPSC (Union Public Service Commission) for the empanelment. Based on seniority and confidential reports during service tenure, UPSC sends back a panel of three officers to choose from. The chief minister and home minister take a final call on the appointment,” said an official from the home department. Jaiswal was appointed as the director general of CISF on December 30 in an order issued by the department of personnel and training of the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hemant-nagrale-takes-additional-charge-as-director-general-of-police-of-maharashtra/story-cVQF4pHiYEqgjqMFGs9F1M.html

However, his wife P Hemlatha has sought one week’s time to go through Rao’s medical reports. The Bombay high court (HC) allowed an extension for his stay at the hospital till January 13 and posted the hearing of the petition seeking bail for Rao on health grounds to the same date.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik, while hearing the petition filed by Hemlatha, was informed by advocate R Satyanarayan that as per the directions of the bench, the state has supplied medical reports of various hospitals where Rao had been kept since May 28 which include the report from Taloja jail hospital as well. Citing that they required some time to go through the reports, they stated that an extension of Rao’s stay at Nanavati Hospital was required. Responding to the court’s query regarding Rao’s health condition and whether he was able to walk, Satyanarayan informed the court that there was improvement and Rao has recovered substantially but added that he was not aware of whether Rao could walk.In the absence of counsels for the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the state, the court accepted Satyanarayan’s submissions and request, and posted hearing of the bail application to January 13.

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP won’t make alliances where it has strong presence, says party leaders||With maximum civic bodies in the state going to polls in next two years, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has chalked out its plan and decided to join hands with other two ruling parties where it has fewer corporators in the civic body. However, it may not go into an alliance in the areas where it enjoys a stronghold. In Mumbai, the NCP may join hands with the Shiv Sena, the party leaders said.Five major municipal corporations — Navi Mumbai, Aurangabad, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli and Kolhapur will face polls in next few months, while 27 district councils, 10 municipal corporations including Mumbai and more than 100 municipal councils and nagar panchayats will go to polls in 2022. All the political parties are preparing to wrest major pie in the local bodies.NCP chief Sharad Pawar has convened a meeting of party ministers, members of Parliament and senior leaders to chalk out the strategy and decide over the alliance with other two ruling parties — Shiv Sena and Congress in these elections. The leaders discussed various aspects for forming alliances and contesting polls on their own. “After due deliberation, it was decided that the party will contest the polls on its own where it has a strong presence or power in the local body. In the local bodies, where it has few corporators, we will go for the alliance with either or both of them,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.“The logic behind is to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) away from the power. Where BJP is strong, Maharasthra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners will come together to defeat it. But where any of us are in a stronger position then we will be contesting alone. This is to avoid the likely defection to the BJP from the ruling party members on being denied the tickets if fought in the alliance, as it reduces the number of seats available to contest. This would ultimately benefit the BJP and we want to avoid it,” said another minister, wishing not to be named.Elaborating it further, the leader said, “For instance in Kolhapur Municipal Corporation which is ruled by Congress and NCP, we would be contesting the polls independently. BJP too has a strong presence in the civic body and thus, contesting elections independently will benefit both of us.”In Mumbai, where NCP is on the weaker ground, and Congress cannot concede on less number of seats if alliance fought together, the Pawar-led party is expected to go with Sena.After the meeting, state minority affairs minister and party spokesperson Nawab Malik told reporters that the party discussed preparations for the upcoming local bodies elections and strategy to strengthen the party position in the state. “Pawar saheb’s stand for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections is very clear. Though Congress has been talking about going solo and the talks over alliance are yet to begin, all the three ruling parties should come together. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray too is positive on this,” Malik said when asked about BMC polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ncp-won-t-make-alliances-where-it-has-strong-presence-says-party-leaders/story-g3u4SX3ANOIYF4TKLU62oM.html

08-01-2021||Mumbai||Third panel by Maharashtra government to deliberate between Aarey and Kanjurmarg||tanushree.venkatraman@htlive.comAfter two committees that presented divergent views on the correct plot for the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed, a third panel appointed by the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) on Wednesday will take the final call on the Aarey and Kanjurmarg plots.A senior official from the state government said, “The earlier reports did not consider the fact that the Aarey plot would prove to be insufficient in the coming years. Therefore, the committee has been asked to study Aarey and also look at Kanjurmarg’s feasibility as an integrated car shed for Metro-3, 4 (Wadala-Kasarvadavali) and 6 (Swami Samath Nagar to Vikhroli), which was also not considered before.” While the government had also stated that it is looking at a plot in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), the terms of reference for the committee does not mention that plot.The two committees appointed earlier had studied nine plots before presenting their recommendations.In 2015, the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government had appointed a committee under the then metropolitan commissioner UPS Madan. The panel had recommended building an integrated car shed for Metro-3 and 6 at Kanjurmarg. The committee had stated that the Kanjurmarg option becomes “preferential” when seen together with line 6. “Both the lines, when developed as one system, can share the same depot facilities at Kanjurmarg and operationally complement each other,” the 2015 report stated.It had also recommended a double decker depot at Aarey in case the Kanjurmarg land is not available. “The option entails a substantially smaller impact of only 446 trees and the depot area is also reduced to 20.82 hectares instead of the present 30 hectares,” the report stated. In 2019, Thackeray, after staying the construction at Aarey, appointed a committee under additional chief secretary (finance) Manoj Saunik. The panel, which submitted its report last year in January, stated that Aarey would be the most viable option. It said, “There is no alternative site available for the car shed for line 3 which could be selected which would be environmentally suitable and available at reasonable cost.” It stated that the government must allow the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation to go ahead with the construction at Aarey and also ask the agency to take additional possible measures to expedite “work of the depot to make up for the time lost due to litigation and otherwise.”While the committee studied the Kanjurmarg option, it stated that shifting the car shed to Kanjurmarg would have huge technical, operational, financial repercussions. It also stated that “shifting of depot would not address the requirements of line 3 and would also hamper the frequency of operations of both lines 3 and line 6 (sic).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/third-panel-by-maharashtra-government-to-deliberate-between-aarey-and-kanjurmarg/story-g95utEv06JpVMrO8fCEJ5I.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Why was purchase of 19 houses in Alibag not mentioned in Maharashtra CM’s poll affidavit: BJP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya has raised questions about the purchase of 19 houses of 23,500 square feet at Korlai village in Alibag by Rashmi Thackeray, wife of chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, jointly with party legislator Ravindra Waikar’s wife Manisha. Somaiya asked as to why this deal was not disclosed in the election affidavit of the CM when government records show that these 19 properties were bought from Anvay Naik in March 2014, but were transferred in Thackerays’ name only in November 2020.Somaiya in a press statement on Thursday said, “These 19 houses valued at ₹5.29 crore remained Thackeray’s benami (anonymous) properties until 12 November 2020. I visited Korlai village and checked the land records of Thackerays’ and Anvay Naik’s family transactions.” Somaiya also produced documents of the transactions.In November when Anvay Naik’s suicide case was reopened and journalist Arnab Goswami was arrested in connection with the case under charge of abetment to suicide, Somaiya had made similar allegations about the purchase of a 9.35-acre land at Korlai village and asked why the deal was not made public.On Thursday, HT contacted Shiv Sena leaders for a comment regarding Somaiya’s allegations, but did not receive a response. Ravindra Waikar’s office told HT that Waikar has refuted these allegations time and again in public and in media. The spokesperson of the Thackerays did not respond.Waikar had in November said, “Somaiya has been trying to misguide people. Whether nine records were produced or 21, the land size (9.35 acre) remains the same. We did not buy it from 21 sellers but only from Anvay Naik. Somaiya has no business to ask relations between Thackerays and us. Uddhavji is our party chief and heads of the family and there was nothing wrong in purchasing the land jointly. Anvay had come to me through my secretary to sell the land. Neither I nor the Thackerays knew him before that and the question of having any business relations does not arise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-was-purchase-of-19-houses-in-alibag-not-mentioned-in-maharashtra-cm-s-poll-affidavit-bjp/story-OeauWycuOul6V53huu2ApK.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||AI, data science sectors attract more engineering applicants in Maharashtra||After months of delay, the first seat-allotment list for first-year Bachelor of Technology (BTech) courses was released by the state common entrance test (CET) cell on Wednesday. While computer science has been a favourite among top scorers year after year, many colleges are witnessing a growing number of students now opting for electronics and communication, as well as newly introduced courses like artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. “The electronics and communication course has managed to scoop the best of minds this year, and many have also opted for BTech in AI and data science fields. Since jobs in the electronics as well as AI sectors are gaining popularity, students are very clear about their ambition,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra. In early 2019, to attract more students to the engineering sector, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) had requested all affiliated engineering colleges to introduce new courses like data science and analytics, blockchain, machine learning and robotics, among others. Since 2020, AICTE also implemented a blanket ban on new engineering institutes across the country and instead requested colleges to apply for new-age courses. In September last year, the state CET cell recorded a rise in engineering applications, after witnessing a year-on-year drop in registrations until 2019. From 4.13 lakh aspirants who had registered for the MH-CET exam in 2019, the figure stood at 5.32 lakh in 2020. Registrations stood at 4.35 lakh in 2018. Many institutes felt the increased interest among students was due to the introduction of new-age courses. “Our institute had received several inquiries throughout the lockdown for admissions, especially asking if the institute had any plans to start new courses. More and more technically-aligned students now want to study new forms of engineering rather than the traditional courses,” said a faculty member from another city-based engineering institute. While demand for new-age courses is growing, and an increasing number of institutes are showing interest in wanting to introduce these courses, experts have highlighted how this move could be short-lived, especially for courses like AI and data science and analytics due to the evolving technology in these fields. “Most of the new-age courses introduced by AICTE this year are for application-based technology, and with every passing year, these sectors evolve, and new trends emerge. At present, these courses might be in a position to offer many jobs to graduating students, but there’s no guarantee the trend will stay for very long,” said SS Mantha, former chairperson of AICTE. “The shelf value of new-age courses could be limited, whereas basic knowledge in core engineering sectors will take students a long way,” he added. In some cases, engineering institutes have also chosen not to apply for the new courses due to lack of support from the state government. “We didn’t apply for any new courses because till date the state government has not approved faculty for the electronics and communication course that we had started in 2009. This particular course has attracted the brightest of minds over the years and is in popular demand amongst recruiters as well, which is why the institute is funding the course without any government support,” said Dhiren Patel, director, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Matunga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ai-data-science-sectors-attract-more-engineering-applicants-in-maharashtra/story-SXKKsVdeE0RhKr3CU0MTKI.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s plasma heroes come to the rescue of Covid-19 patients||With blood donations seeing record lows and worries of contracting Covid-19, finding plasma donors has been a challenge for many. Fortunately, good Samaritans in the city have been helping connect plasma donors with patients. In August, Krishnan Bhandari, 59, was rushed to the intensive care unit in Nanavati Hospital, after he contracted Covid-19 and developed pneumonia. The doctors suggested plasma therapy. “We hopelessly searched for a donor for almost two days,” said Bhandari’s daughter, Mohini. Finally, she found Plasma In Need For Transfusion (PINT), a pan-India network of plasma donors. “Within 24 hours of registration, I got a donor who came to the hospital and donated plasma under my father’s name. He was like a god to us,” said Mohini. Bhandari returned home on August 31 after recovering from Covid-19.PINT was set up by Dr Neil Pinto, 24, and Karina Thakrar, a graduate from from Loyola Marymount University, in July 2020. “We match the details of patients with registered donors. Once we get a match, we immediately send the contact details of the donors to patients,” Dr Pinto said. So far, over 240 recovered Covid-19 patients and over 3,400 patients have registered with PINT. “We have been able to save over 400 Covid-19 patients across 12 cities in India,” said Dr Pinto.He has recently started a campaign on Ketto, an online crowdfunding website, to raise money to help Covid-19 patients in their treatment and assist blood banks in conducting antibody tests that are required for donors to donate plasma.Business developer Ronak Shah, 30, has also been helping Covid patients find plasma donors. “I have been associated with blood donation campaigns for years so many social workers have my number. Between May and August, when the pandemic was at its peak, I used to get calls even in the middle of the night, seeking plasma,” said Shah, who lives in Bhayandar. Working with a few blood banks, which were grappling with shortages, Shah created a data bank for recovered patients who wanted to donate plasma. Twelve years after Bandra resident Balu Nayar started a Twitter account (@BloodDonorIndia) to help connect blood donors to patients, the handle became a lifeline for many searching for plasma. Last year, the handle received 28,000 requests of which 20% were related to plasma. “During the pandemic, we were overwhelmed with responses as we recorded almost 200% surge in demands. Some people had to struggle for days to arrange for a donor,” said Nayar. Convalescent plasma therapy uses plasma from recovered patients of Covid-19 as their plasma contains antibodies that can fight the infection. While the country’s largest trial for this therapy suggests it is not effective at severe stages of Covid-19, plasma therapy has its supporters. Dr Arpita Dwivedi, head of the critical care unit at LH Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, said, “We have seen faster recovery among moderately-ill patients who are treated with Covid-19. It helps provide relief to patients who have problems with breathing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-plasma-heroes-come-to-the-rescue-of-covid-19-patients/story-M9uSFRjFyXPdc7712SFI3I.html

Gadkari also announced new national highway projects worth ₹5,801 for Maharashtra, under his ministry’s annual plan.The new highway between Surat and Bengaluru, worth ₹6,000 crore will facilitate south-bound vehicles coming from northern Indian states, to bypass Mumbai and Pune. Gadkari said that the new highway starting at Surat connecting Nashik, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Hyderabad, Chennai will end in Bengaluru. “The vehicular traffic towards south from the northern states like Rajasthan, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh passes through these two Maharashtra cities, leading to pollution and congestion. The new highway will bypass Mumbai and Pune, and will help in reducing major congestion,” Gadkari said while addressing a press conference in Mumbai, after meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on various projects being implemented in the state, on Thursday.He also said that the ongoing four-lane work on Mumbai-Goa highway will be completed in a year. The highway which was expected to be completed last year has been delayed, due to issues related to land acquisition, forest and wildlife clearances, and poor planning. The Panvel-Indapur section of the highway was to be completed in June 2014 but is still reeling with technical issues. The Union minister said that during his meeting with State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara on Thursday, the financial issues have been resolved. “Around 70-75% work of the patch has been completed till date. The contractors for the other two patches have been replaced, ” Gadkari said.The minister said that he has ensured additional funds for the roads in Maharashtra from the annual plan of his ministry. “The annual plan for national highway works in Maharashtra was approved for ₹2,727 crore. I got it enhanced to ₹5,801 crore, which will help in developing 1,035 km of national highways in the state” he said. Gadkari said that the ₹1 lakh crore Delhi-Mumbai Expressway project will be extended till Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), to facilitate container traffic. He said the state government will partner in its construction by the means of goods and services tax (GST) exemption and royalty-free supply of steel and cement, which will be considered as its equity in the project.CM Thackeray directed state officials to resolve the issues related to land acquisition and clearances from the forest department at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nitin-gadkari-announces-new-highway-to-curtail-pollution-congestion-in-mumbai-and-pune/story-qAYSV7EnSANeq8FM07VItK.html
08-01-2021||City||Folic acid awareness week: Why folic acid is an important public health issue||It is Folic Acid Awareness Week (January 4-10) and thus a write-up about this seems timely, but a paediatric surgeon writing about folic acid — a simple B-complex vitamin — may be considered anomalous by some. The truth is folic acid, or rather the lack of it, is responsible for the many complex and long surgeries that I perform as a part of my paediatric surgical practice. And many of these surgeries are performed on new born and young infants. These are children born with a birth defect of the spinal cord and the brain – collectively termed as neural tube defects (NTDs). Neural tube defects are the commonest type of birth defects seen in India. They can result in death of the new-born (neonatal mortality) or will cause childhood paralysis in those who survive. The paralysis is much more severe and disabling than polio. Additionally, these children require several surgeries during their childhood and adolescence for associated medical problems. From published data, it is estimated that in India, up to four-five per 1,000 births are affected by this serious defect, of which 90% can be prevented by effective folic acid intervention. To prevent NTDs, adequate levels of folic acid are required in the mother’s body during the first six weeks of pregnancy when the brain and spina cord are developing. An important, original research article recently published in a leading birth defects Journal – authored by two of the world’s leading NTD-epidemiologists, Godfrey Oakley and Vijaya Kancherla from Atlanta, mentioned that in 2015 alone, proper public health interventions and policies for folic acid in India “would have prevented about 116,070 cases of folic acid preventable SBA (NTDs) ”. Can you imagine so many cases of polio in India in one year! If that were to happen, health ministers and public health officials may have to resign. Then why are we turning a blind eye to the problem of folic acid preventable NTDs, which cause childhood paralysis, which is worse than that caused by polio, and is preventable! My tryst with NTDs began as a resident doctor in the late 1980s, when often I was the first to receive these newborns who were brought in by their distraught families, with the visible protuberant swelling on the back where the spine and spinal cord was defective. Many of these babies, girls and boys alike, had varying degrees of paralysis of their lower limbs. In 1991, the famous Medical Research Council study from the United Kingdom proved unequivocally that folic acid prevents NTDs, and by 1998, the United States had implemented mandatory fortification of enriched cereal grain products with folic acid. This and other folic acid awareness programmes have enabled the US to decrease the prevalence of NTDs to 0.5/1,000 live births. Currently, about 60 countries have implemented mandatory folic acid fortification, and reported similar reductions in prevalence of NTDs. Additionally, in several countries, large folic acid awareness campaigns have been undertaken to educate women about the need to take a folic acid supplement before planning a pregnancy. This dual policy of creating awareness about pre-conceptional folic acid supplementation and fortification of suitable foods with adequate levels of folic acid must be implemented in India without further delay. In a 2016 published study conducted by the department of community and family medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Rishikesh), it was found: “Totally, 94.25% of women had planned pregnancies; however, only 4.75% of women reported FA supplementation before conception. This indicates that if these women would have been properly counselled and prescribed FA, they might have taken it.” Regarding food fortification with folic acid, we seem to be going in the reverse direction. In 2016, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) developed standards for the type and amount of nutrients that can be added to fortified wheat flour. Those were very much in line with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. But in 2018, FSSAI switched to dramatically lower standards, which will lead to no health impact. If India adapts the 2018 FSSAI standard, it will not see results as seen in other countries, where fortification with FA has been mandated because the level of folic acid included is 17 times lower than WHO recommendations. Global experts in grain fortification are questioning the 2018 FSSAI standards and feel that fortification’s success in India is in jeopardy, unless FSSAI goes back to its 2016 standard for fortified wheat flour. Almost 20 years ago, at a neural tube defects conference in Atlanta, I first met and heard Dr Godfrey Oakley, then a professor of epidemiology at CDC. His evangelical lecture opened my eyes to the fact that folic acid awareness and effective public health interventions can prevent the large number of cases of children born with severe childhood paralysis in India. Prof Oakley has since then travelled all over the world becoming the global ambassador for folic acid. I invited him to India first in 2006 and recently in 2018. Since 2006, The Spina Bifida Foundation, along with other organisations, such as the International Federation and the Flour Fortification initiative, have been lobbying with the government to become serious about NTDs prevention. Although some state governments have undertaken initial steps for fortification, on the whole, precious little has been done in this regard. The prevention of folic acid-preventable NTDs must be given high priority in India because it will not only prevent thousands of children being born with paralysis since birth, but also is a cost effective and sustainable way to achieve significant reduction in neonatal and under-five mortality rates. Dr Santosh Karmarkar is the founder trustee, Spina Bifida Foundation, and paediatric surgeon, Lilavati Hospital||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/folic-acid-awareness-week-why-folic-acid-is-an-important-public-health-issue/story-Oi86UGCGG5RTjQgsgtJk4L.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: Maharashtra education department to announce FCFS round for those without a seat||In a relief for first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants in the state, the education department has decided to have first-come, first-served (FCFS) admission rounds for those left without a seat through the online admission process. While the department had earlier decided to do away with the FCFS rounds this year, the decision was revoked owing to a large number of students still without seats after five admission rounds. In Mumbai, more than 10,000 students are without seats after these rounds, despite there being nearly 1.3 lakh vacant seats in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). “The department has granted special permission to conduct FCFS rounds. A detailed schedule of the same will be declared soon,” said Dattatray Jagtap, director of secondary and higher secondary education in the state. In 2020, the department had declared that there would be no FCFS rounds, and only special rounds would be conducted for students who do not get admission in regular rounds. FCFS rounds usually follow regular admission rounds, in which students can claim seats against vacancies across colleges in a particular city or district, and are allotted seats based on who claims them first. These rounds were introduced in the academic year 2018-19 but were criticised by many parents and experts as they allowed students with lower scores to get into top colleges against vacant seats. On Wednesday, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted, “Admissions under the second special merit list will conclude on January 8 after which the schedule for FCFS round will be announced.” According to data shared by Gaikwad, 42% of the total seats lying vacant after five admission rounds are in six regions – Amravati, Aurangabad, Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik and Pune – where admissions to FYJC is online.Similarly, 23% (nearly 1 lakh) of the total (4.15 lakh) students who have applied for seats are yet to take admission anywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fyjc-admissions-maharashtra-education-department-to-announce-fcfs-round-for-those-without-a-seat/story-UocbKJIK5TDyxCsrgTp24J.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||December saw fewest Covid-19 cases in Mumbai since April||After witnessing two sharp surges last year, December saw the lowest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths since April in the city. In end-December, Mumbai’s recovery rate was 93% and the Covid growth rate was 0.21%.Statistics released by the state health department show December 2020 recorded a drop of 60% and 84% compared to the number of Covid-19 cases in November and September respectively. Compared to May last year, December’s caseload dropped by about 70%. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), active cases in Mumbai have been below 10,000 since December 15.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner and in-charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “BMC had expected yet another surge in cases in November and December, owing to the festival season, but that did not happen.” December recorded 9,245 cases of Covid-19 and 223 deaths. This is significantly less than the figures for November (25,062 cases; 566 deaths), October (49,877 cases; 1,281 deaths), September (58,321 cases; 1,236 deaths), August (30,474 cases; 1,260 deaths), July (35,139 cases; 1,722 deaths), June (36,559 cases, 3,237 deaths) and May (31,874 cases; 984 deaths). Lower caseloads were recorded in April (5,917 cases; 109 deaths) and March (151 cases; 7 deaths) last year.The surge in cases in September-October 2020 has been attributed to lifting restrictions on public movement.BMC also scaled up the number of daily tests to 14,000 in September 2020, when the positivity rate was high (between 17% and 25%). The number of tests dropped to 11,000 a day in November 2020 and the positivity rate fell to a range of 5-10%. The positivity rate remained at 5% and lower in December 2020 despite BMC increasing testing to 25,000 tests a day.Dr Om Shrivastav, a city-based doctor working with the Maharashtra government’s Covid-19 task force, said, “The Covid graph worldwide goes through peaks and troughs. In December, Mumbai witnessed its trough. It is too early to comment on whether herd immunity contributed to the decrease in Covid-19 cases. However, it is notable that despite unlock plans, the number of cases in the city have been under control and declining.” The case fatality rate (CFR) for Covid-19 has also dropped from over 9.5% in March 2020 to between 2.1% and 2.5% between September and December 2020. BMC reconciled 862 deaths (from April-May) and 751 deaths (from May-June) in June and July respectively. Following this, Kakani ordered his department to plot the deaths that were reported late, noting the dates on which they’d occurred. This exercise showed May ( 2,269) had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths, followed by June (1,922) and July (1,773). BMC has attributed the improvement in CFR to interventions such as the Mission Save Lives and greater awareness regarding testing among Mumbaiites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/december-saw-fewest-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-since-april/story-IbUDAhVrsgashYhFxeyfSJ.html
08-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves order on plea filed by Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters to quash FIR filed on Rhea Chakraborty’s plaint||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday reserved its order on the petition filed by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh to quash a first information report (FIR) registered by Bandra police in September 2020, on the basis of a complaint lodged by actor Rhea Chakraborty. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik closed the petition for orders, observing that Rajput was a very good human being. “Everybody liked him, especially the role played by him of [cricketer] Mahendra Singh Dhoni. You can make out from his face that he was a very sober and good human being,” said the judges. On September 7, 2020, the police had registered an offence against Rajput’s sisters after Chakraborty alleged that Priyanka had on June 8 sent the late actor prescriptions given by a Delhi-based cardiologist Dr Tarun Kumar. The prescriptions contained psychotropic substances controlled under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and they were given without examining Rajput, Chakraborty had alleged. The consumption of the psychotropic substances in the prescriptions “may have caused and contributed to the suicidal death of the actor”, she further claimed. The sisters then moved HC through advocate Madhav Thorat seeking the quashing of the FIR and claimed that the statements made in it do not make out any cognisable offence. It added that Chakraborty’s complaint was nothing but a feeble attempt on her part to scuttle investigations against her by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and blame Rajput’s family for his suicide as she was on the verge of being arrested by NCB. Chakraborty had been arrested by NCB later. Their counsel, senior advocate Vikas Singh, submitted that there was gross delay in registering the offence, as Chakraborty was allegedly well aware of the WhatsApp chats exchanged between the late actor and Priyanka on June 8, but she lodged the complaint only on September 7. Singh also pointed out that the Telemedicine Guidelines issued by the Medical Council of India permitted prescription of medicines even on first consultation, and there was nothing wrong in the prescription. Singh asserted that the FIR registered by the police was non-est (non-existent) in the eyes of law for being second offence on the same cause of action, and thus, liable to be struck down on this ground as well. The senior advocate relied on the ruling in the Jacob Matthew’s case, in which the Supreme Court had held that an offence cannot be directly registered against a registered medical practitioner. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) supported the sisters by terming Chakraborty’s allegations “mostly presumptive and speculative in nature” and claimed that the FIR was “vitiated and bad in law” for being the second FIR on the same cause of action. Senior advocate Devdatt Kamat, who represented Bandra police, maintained that there was no illegality in registering the offence. Kamat submitted that the prescription (sent by Priyanka to Rajput) was on the face of it a fabricated document. He said the WhatsApp messages exchanged between the late actor and Priyanka falsified the claim that the prescription was followed by online consultation. He pointed out from the documents that someone other than the late actor had gone to the Delhi-based hospital as an indoor patient and obtained the prescription. With regards to the contention of the second FIR on the same cause of action, Kamat said the FIR in Bandra was in the nature of a counter complaint, countering the allegations levelled against Chakraborty in the FIR registered at Patna on the basis of a complaint by Rajput’s father. He added that the Jacob Matthew’s case involved issues relating to complaints of medical negligence against doctors, and was thus not applicable to this matter. Advocate Satish Maneshinde, who represented Chakraborty, insisted that the circumstances relating to Rajput’s death need to be investigated. He responded to the ground of delay in lodging the complaint, saying Chakraborty was aware of the messages exchanged between the late actor and Priyanka in June 2020 but Rajput had asked the actor to leave his home as she insisted that he should not take the illegally prescribed medicines. However, Maneshinde said she realised that the medicines were actually procured and the consumption of the same could have led to Rajput’s untimely death only after certain other messages were leaked. So she accordingly lodged the complaint. He submitted that the petition filed by Rajput’s sisters was premature as the case is handed over to the CBI, and if the agency finds no truth in Chakraborty’s complaint, it will file a closure report and urged the court to not foreclose the case. He insisted on allowing investigation into Chakraborty’s allegations, contending that in a case of abetment to suicide, proximate reasons are most important, and as the prescription was of June 8 and the actor has ended his life six days later, it could be the most proximate reason behind his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reserves-orders-on-plea-filed-by-sushant-singh-rajput-s-sisters-to-quash-fir-filed-on-rhea-chakraborty-s-plaint/story-8frSTB2A8XrD78L2NbLJ3K.html
08-01-2021||City||Ludhiana schools record 10% attendance on Day 1 of reopening||Ten months since the Covid-19 outbreak, schools reopened to thin attendance in Ludhiana on Thursday amid confusion among school heads over the requirement of written consent from parents. A majority of schools had only sent messages to parents to send their wards, but when the children arrived on Thursday, they were asked to submit the written consent from their parents. Government school authorities said the thin attendance at most schools was also due to the parent-teacher meeting scheduled for Thursday during which few students turn up in any case. Barely 10% students attended the regular classes in Ludhiana with the authorities saying many parents were hesitant to send their wards, fearing they may contract the infection. At the Government Primary School, Model Gram, only seven of the 45 students of Class 5 came to school. The students were accommodated while maintaining social distancing in classrooms. Jyoti Arora, an elementary training teacher at the school, said, “Parents have been informed to send their children with written consent. We expect more students to attend classes from Monday.” The situation was similar in almost all schools of the district.Twenty of the 130 students of Class 5 at Government Primary School, Haibowal Kalan, attended classes on Thursday. School head Shivani Sood said, “Today’s parent-teacher meeting was aimed at motivating the parents. We are hopeful they will give their consent in the days to come.”At Malwa Khalsa Senior Secondary School, Model Gram, which is a government-aided facility, 57 students of Classes 6 to 8 attended the classes physically. The school has 121 students enrolled in these classes.Entry was allowed from the main gate of the school and circles were drawn to ensure social distancing . Staff were deployed for thermal screening of each student.At least nine students were accommodated in one classroom to maintain a distance of 2 metres. Ludhiana DEO, (elementary-cum-secondary) Rajinder Kaur said, “We got an overwhelming response at the PTMs. The attendance in primary and middle schools will improve in the next few days. Parents are willing to send their children as only two months are left for the final exams.” Students, parents give mask the go-byMany students and parents reached the schools to attend PTM while ignoring the basic safety protocols, including social distancing and wearing masks, despite the guidelines. At many government primary schools, textbooks were also handed over to parents. Sharing his joy, Vishal, a Class-7 student, said, “I missed the classroom teaching and am glad to be back. I will be able to concentrate better on my studies now.”A grand welcomeThe government schools in the rural areas, meanwhile, made special arrangements to welcome the students of Class 5. At Jandali school, the authorities rolled out a red carpet at entry gate and staff showered flower petals to welcome Class-5 students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-schools-record-10-attendance-on-day-1-of-reopening/story-7UVH0K9WtMU8q5MWWilQXO.html

BMC in its complaint alleged that Sood converted a residential building, Shakti Sagar, a residential building on Juhu’s AB Nair Road, into a hotel without proper permission. The complaint was filed by BMC on January 4 under the Maharashtra Region and Town Planning (Act) for alternations, change of user and unauthorised additions.Vishwas Mote, assistant commissioner of BMC’s K West ward, said, “We are co-operating with the Mumbai Police for undertaking further police investigation into the matter.”It has come to light that the illegal construction was first pointed out by BMC in September 2018 and Lokayukta was informed about the same in October 2020. Sood had, in October, also moved the city civil court against the notice issued by BMC.Local activist Ganesh Kusmulu said, “I have written to the Mumbai Police requesting them to file a first information report (FIR) in the matter. Even BMC has filed a complaint. I have been following up on the issue since 2018 and urge BMC to act on the same.”Sood, however, has reportedly maintained that he has permissions from BMC for the work and only permission from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Authority (MCZMA) is pending.According to police officers, BMC has given complaint but no FIR has been filed. “The BMC engineer concerned should personally approach us and point out structural changes or any violations,” said assistant commissioner of police Suhas Raikar.Meanwhile, Sood did not answer repeated calls from HT. His public relations executive said there would be no statement issued by the actor on the issue.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stood by Sood and attacked the Shiv Sena, which is in power in the civic body, saying the BMC action was done out of vengeance. BJP MLA Ram Kadam alleged that BMC’s complaint to the Mumbai Police was a political decision and said, “Action has been taken against Sonu Sood only out of revenge. The state government had failed to help the people during lockdown. At that time, Sonu had done what the government should have done. Sonu helped migrants in person and as a result, Shiv Sena was not happy.”The BJP leader further said, “Earlier, it was Kangana Ranaut. Is it Sonu’s number now? It was the government’s job to send poor labourers to their villages. But Sonu did it. Also, during Covid-19, everyone used Sony’s hotel as a quarantine centre. Was the hotel not illegal at that time? Why did BMC officials not verify this?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-files-plaint-against-sonu-sood-for-turning-residential-building-into-hotel/story-WY3tJuf5yFdNB8qMGLtJ2K.html

The residents rued that the water body has already taken the shape of ‘Buddha Nullah’ as it is full of waste nowadays, and the authorities have turned a blind eye to the problem. The residents stated that the civic body is making efforts to make Buddha Nullah pollution-free but not paying heed to the deteriorating condition of the canal, which will become worse if no action is not taken soon.Former Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor Tanvir Singh Dhaliwal said,” While it is the duty of the irrigation department to clean the canal, the MC has to prevent the residents from dumping waste into it. The canal was cleaned in 2016 at Rs 25 lakh but authorities made no concrete efforts to prevent residents from dumping waste into it nor did they do anything to clean the water body since then.”“The MC should take the responsibility to clean the canal otherwise it will turn into a permanent dumping spot in a few years,” he added.The residents rued that on one hand, the MC is working on projects like Sidhwan canal waterfront and is beautifying the canal banks, on the other, no efforts are being made to clean the water body.Keerat Singh, a resident of Sarabha Nagar area, said,” No doubt MC has done a good job in developing the waterfront project alongside the canal in Sarabha Nagar area, but it will look dirty if the canal is not cleaned regularly. It will look more like a nullah moving through the city.” Jagpreet Grewal, sub-divisional officer, irrigation department, said,” In the past few years, efforts have been made to prevent the residents from dumping waste into the canal. Iron meshes were also installed at the canal bridges with the help of NGOs but it didn’t deter them from dumping waste into it. I will take up the matter with the higher authorities.” MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “We’ll start issuing challans to residents of they don’t stop dumping waste into the canal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-raise-concern-over-canal-turning-into-buddha-nullah/story-GBamg7hnRpLaIg11El5soI.html

The accused men, all aged between 25 to 40 years, visited the S Kumar Gold and Diamonds showroom in Shanti Nagar, Sector 4, on Thursday afternoon. They were wearing masks due to the Covid-19 pandemic and posed as customers. After an initial interaction with the counter staff about the jewellery displayed, one of them pulled out a revolver from a bag while the other three walked around the showroom picking up gold and diamond ornaments and putting in their bags and pant pockets.The entire robbery was captured on the store’s CCTV cameras and shows the terrified staff and customers standing by while the four accused took the jewellery. The security guard is seen sitting on a stool inside the showroom with folded hands.Within 15 minutes, the thieves cleared out most of the jewellery and walked out of the showroom.According to police, the men had arrived on two motorbikes. “While two of the accused left with a bag on a bike, the two others had to flee on foot as their bike would not start. They abandoned it outside the showroom,” said Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of police, Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) Commissionerate.Police suspect that the two-wheelers used for the theft may have been stolen ones. The men are likely to have done a recce of the showroom as there was no sign of urgency while robbing the place.The showroom staffers told police that when the men walked in wearing masks, they presumed them to be customers. A case of theft has been registered against unknown persons, and nakabandis have been set up at Palghar, Boisar, Borivli, Bhayander and other areas, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/4-thieves-rob-mira-road-jewellery-store-at-gunpoint-walk-away-with-2-crore-gold-diamonds/story-KPEaXUQ8U04xZ1CI9DWvmK.html

The event was organised at the indoor stadium, Pakhowal Road and inaugurated by mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal. As many as 20 companies exhibited their products during the event and most of them had put machinery worth lakhs on display.Apart from the informal sector, the officials of different urban local bodies (ULB) of Amritsar, Mohali, Malout and Jagraon also participated in the event. During the event, MoHUA officials said MC will also be providing work assurance to the sewermen so that they can pay back the loan to the banks.A consultant working with MoHUA, Pooja Saini said, “The loans are being provided by the National Safai Karamchari Finance Development Corporation (NSKFDC). While urban local bodies can avail a loan of up to Rs 50 lakh, those working in the informal sector can get Rs 5 lakh. The loans are being provided at 4% interest rate and have to be paid back in instalments in 10 years. The interest rate will be further reduced to 3% for women”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “This given an opportunity to the sewermen involved in the informal sector to equip themselves with modern machinery as loans are also being provided by the banks. MC will also be purchasing the required machinery in the coming time and the officials were told to make a list of requirements so that manual scavenging can be stopped.” However, workers of the informal sector said that it is not feasible for them to purchase the machinery or avail a loan for the same, due to the high cost.Ankit, a private sewermen who works in ward number 81, said , “The minimum cost of machinery put on display during the “loan mela” was around Rs 3 lakh. No private sewerman can purchase it on their own. Even if a loan is provided, how can we pay it back.”Ankit said only a contractor or MC can purchase the machinery because they deal at a large scale. Vasu, a sewerman who works in ward number 91, said, “We also want to work safely as accidents have taken place in the past wherein people have even lost their lives while cleaning the sewer lines. But, MC should provide the equipment at nominal rates.”With an eye on the first prize of Rs 12 crore under the category of the population over 10 lakhs, the civic body had stepped into the ”Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge” which was launched by the Centre in November last year. MC WITHOUT SAFETY KITS FOR ITS OWN EMPLOYEES While MC is working to equip the informal sector, the civic body itself is struggling to provide safety kits to its sewermen. One of the officials, requesting anonymity, said that around 1,600 sewermen work in the MC, but few are provided safety kits. The authorities are planning to purchase them but no final decision has been taken so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/loan-mela-organised-to-equip-ludhiana-sewermen-with-modern-machinery-evokes-low-response-from-informal-sector/story-CF7ZuDS5yCmkriqqqUaAPP.html
08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Cross-voting shadow over BJP as Chandigarh gets new mayor on Friday||The city will get a new mayor on Friday amid fears of cross-voting as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) eyes a fifth consecutive term for its candidate in a two corner fight this time for the last mayoral election of the current MC House, which goes to polls by the end of this year.Discontent is ripe within the BJP over selection of its nominees though on paper it appears to be smooth sailing for the party, which has 21 electoral votes, including that of the city MP who as ex-officio councillor can vote in the mayoral election. The Congress has five votes and the Shiromani Akali Dal one.Fissures within the party appeared to have deepened on January 4, the last date of filling of nomination papers, when BJP councillors Chandervati Shukla and Bharat Kumar revolted against the party. However, following a change of heart, they returned to its fold in a show of strength at the city party headquarters, where, except for Heera Negi, who has been hospitalised after contracting Covid-19, all party councillors were present.But party insiders say that anger among party councillors is still smouldering.“For most, there’s anger over choice of party candidates (senior deputy mayor and councillor Ravi Kant Sharma is the mayoral pick) as there’s a strong feeling that people who earlier worked against party interests are being awarded with posts now,” said a councillor requesting anonymity.For some, the recent ward delimitation has also come as a shocker. “Some of the current councillors are finding it hard to lose major areas of their older wards to newly created ones, which could mar their chances of a re-election. They are worried that they might even lose the party ticket and are questioning the intentions of the party’s current leadership on creation of new wards in areas unfavourable for them,” said the councillor.Cross-voting won’t be a first for the party, as in 2019 elections, too, rebel candidate (Satish Kainth) had managed to get 11 votes.The situation has become all the more tricky for the BJP as the magic mark of 14 can elude it and be reduced to 13 votes as BJP councillor Hira Negi and city MP Kirron Kher are unwell and unlikely to vote. SAD, a former BJP ally, is likely to boycott the elections.Aware of its weak position in the House, the Congress is hoping for cross-voting in the BJP though it is keeping its cards close to its chest.“We have not contacted any of the BJP councillors on the election. It is up to them,” said Devinder Singh Babla, the Congress’s mayoral nominee. Notably, Congress had declared support for Shukla’s candidature for the mayor’s post, but later, the MC secretary rejected her nomination papers on technical grounds.The BJP leadership, however, remained confident that voting day will go without any hitches. “We will win all three posts, with all BJP votes in favour of party nominees,” said state party chief Arun Sood.The state party in-charge, Dushyant Gautam, also arrived in city on Thursday and attended a meeting with the party councillors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cross-voting-shadow-over-bjp-as-chandigarh-gets-new-mayor-today/story-4QNovVWUClgAIE3YrBcPEJ.html
08-01-2021||Gurugram||CBI files chargesheet against four police officials in school murder case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a supplementary chargesheet against four Gurugram police officers for falsely implicating a school bus conductor and for fabricating documents against him in the 2017 school murder case.An 80-odd page chargesheet was filed before Aman Inder Singh, special judicial magistrate of Punjab and Haryana high court, on Wednesday. The agency gave a clean chit to the private school.The probe agency, which had named a juvenile as the main accused in the case and filed a chargesheet in February 2018, said in the supplementary chargesheet that “there is sufficient evidence for prosecution” against four police officials who allegedly implicated the bus conductor and accused him of murder and sexual assault.Birem Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Narender Khatana, then station house officer of Bhondsi police station, Shamsher Singh, sub-inspector and the investigating officer for two days, and Subhash Chand, EASI, are the four officials named.Khatana refused to comment on the matter, while the three other officials could not be reached for comment.Sushil Tekriwal, counsel for the father of the victim, said that the police had forced Kumar to confess and had fabricated the documents in the case. “Police officers have made fake daily diary (DD) entries. They had prepared the first document of the case in the mortuary on September 8, 2017, where they had shown Ashok Kumar as a suspect without a complaint and a case was registered. They knew since day one there was no sexual assault. Still, they forced him to accept that he had attempted to sexually assault the victim,” he said.Tekriwal alleged that the investigating officer had prepared the documents without visiting the crime spot. “They had tried to give a clean chit to the juvenile and recorded his statement before the Sohna court on September 15 as a witness under Section 164 CrPc without verifying his friend’s statement. Even the gardener had informed the police that the juvenile had informed him during the incident, but no one questioned him. Police had also tried to create pressure on the physical education teacher to record his statement in favour of juvenile, which he had denied,” he said.The bus conductor was the initial suspect in the murder of an eight-year-old student of a private school in Bhondsi. He had accused the police of assassinating his character and for torturing him. He was arrested on September 8, 2017, but was acquitted by a special court on February 28, 2018.Kumar alleged that he was tortured, beaten, hung upside down and his head submerged in water by police officials to obtain a confession. “I was asked to parade before the media and they humiliated me in front of my family and public. Since then, I have had sleepless nights and I am still trying to regain my lost self-esteem and reputation,” he said.The father of the deceased, who is the complainant in the case, said that the CBI has delayed filing supplementary chargesheet and they are yet to get justice. “The police officials are also equally guilty as they tried to mislead us and tried to implicate an innocent man instead of the real culprit. Those guilty should be punished as per the law. Such incidents tarnish the image and lose trust in police,” he said.The court has fixed January 15 for consideration of the chargesheet.The father of the 18-year-old suspect, who was a juvenile at the time of the incident, had filed an application on January 3 with juvenile justice board (JJB) seeking interim bail for his son so that he could take his class 12 examinations between January 21 and February 15. The father had also stated that since his examination centre was in Nuh, an interim bail was necessary.The hearing of the application is listed for Friday.The court has dismissed a bail plea at least 15 times over the last 37 months. In May 2019, he was shifted from an observation home in Faridabad to a place of safety in Madhuban, Karnal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cbi-files-chargesheet-against-four-police-officials-in-school-murder-case/story-etwD9pwNRm9mNZngsD3ZnO.html
08-01-2021||World||Alok Sharma made president of UN climate conference in Glasgow||Alok Sharma, who was appointed to the cabinet role of Business secretary in the Boris Johnson government following the December 2019 election, was on Friday appointed full-time president of UN COP26 climate conference scheduled to be held in Glasgow in November.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is among world leaders due to attend the key climate conference. COP26 will be the largest summit the UK has ever hosted, bringing together representatives from nearly 200 countries, including leaders, experts, and campaigners.Prime Minister Johnson appointed Kwasi Kwarteng, who was minister of state in the Department of Business, Energy and Clean Growth, as the new Business secretary. Sharma’s new role will continue to have cabinet status and he will report directly to the Prime Minister.Downing Street said in a statement that to meet the high ambitions for the summit, Sharma will solely focus on driving forward coordinated global action to tackle climate change. Officials said that a successful summit in November will be critical to meet the objectives set out by the Paris Agreement and reduce global emissions. It added that the UK has set a high bar, with recent commitment to reduce emissions by at least 68% by 2030, but also need other countries to do their bit. Sharma has been leading the UK’s climate diplomacy, since assuming the role in February 2020, and will now focus on it exclusively. The Climate Ambition Summit co-hosted by the UK in December last year saw 75 world leaders set out new commitments to climate action.Sharma said: “The biggest challenge of our time is climate change and we need to work together to deliver a cleaner, greener world and build back better for present and future generations”.“Through the UK’s Presidency of COP26 we have a unique opportunity, working with friends and partners around the world, to deliver on this goal.“Given the vital importance of tackling climate change I am delighted to have been asked by the Prime Minister to dedicate all my energies to this urgent task,” he added.Sharma is one of four Indian-origin members around Johnson’s cabinet table, besides chancellor Rishi Sunak, home secretary Priti Patel and attorney gneral Suella Braverman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alok-sharma-made-president-of-un-climate-conference-in-glasgow/story-QLW3jLr9GEUopsqxfa4MSO.html
08-01-2021||World||UK court to deliver judgement on Nirav Modi extradition on Feb 25||The judgement in the Nirav Modi extradition case will be delivered in the Westminster Magistrates Court on February 25, judge Samuel Goozee announced on Friday at the end of a two-day hearing after defence teams made concluding arguments.Claire Montomery, Modi’s lawyer, and Helen Malcolm of the Crown Prosecution Service representing India, quoted from emails, witness statements, bank and other documents, and presented their versions on issues such as prison conditions, mental health treatment facilities and the possibility of a Modi receiving a fair trial, if extradited.Under the UK-India extradition treaty, India needs to establish in UK courts that there is a prima facie case against the person requested – not a conviction – based on charges that would amount to offences in law in both countries.One of Montgomery’s major objections to the extradition is the alleged lack of a prima facie case against Modi, which was countered by Malcolm, who argued that the charges against Modi would amount to similar criminal charges under British law.“There is multiplicity of evidence”, Malcolm told the court, that Modi indulged in fraud in relation to seeking loans from the Punjab National Bank in Mumbai. The evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case against him, she said.Malcolm also reiterated India’s charges that Modi interfered with witnesses, was involved in destroying servers and mobile phones, and also threatened to kill one of the witnesses. It is not for the court to “start double-guessing” what amounts to a crime in India, she added.Besides the alleged lack of a prima facie case, Modi’s defence team has argued that he would not receive a fair trial in India, would not receive appropriate treatment for mental ailments and that there was a risk of suicide. There was no evidence on India’s charge that Modi and others conspired to defraud the bank, the team argued.Modi, 49, who is lodged in the Wandsworth prison in west London and attended the hearing remotely, wearing a jacket and sporting a beard, is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the other by the Enforcement Directorate.Charges against Modi involve PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crores. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-to-deliver-judgement-on-nirav-modi-extradition-on-feb-25/story-cBqb0CDfsGHW56ppLeolCI.html

DeVos blamed Trump’s rhetoric for the attack, calling it “unconscionable”.Matt Pottinger, a deputy National Security Adviser, and Mick Mulvaney, a former Trump chief of staff and special envoy on Norther Ireland, are among senior officials who quit. Republican lawmakers are urging others to stay, to ensure the unpredictable president was not left to his own devices, especially as he feels isolated and is in danger of being removed from office.“To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the inauguration on January 20th,” Trump tweeted on Friday, becoming the first American president to skip his successor’s inauguration sine 1869.Pence, who has shown increasing independence from the president after years of slavish loyalty, plans to attend, according to news reports. He or his office have not denied those reports. In fact, subsequent reports indicated that he is, in fact, waiting for an invitation.Former President George W Bush, a Republican who was publicly critical of Trump, will be attending Biden’s inauguration along with his wife Laura Bush, his spokesperson had said the day before US Congress met to certify Biden’s election, sending an unmistakable message to Republican lawmakers objecting to the certification at Trump’s behest.Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalyn Carter wil not attend, their spokesperson has said. They are 97 and 93 and have been largely home lately due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shocked-by-capitol-siege-more-aides-gop-backers-desert-trump/story-M3NtqxlFuodKWx9fB1ephI.html
08-01-2021||World||Murder probe opens after US police officer dies in Capitol mob attack||A US Capitol Police officer died in the attack on the building by President Donald Trump’s supporters, taking the toll up to five as local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released photos of men and women involved in the riot, seeking public’s help to identify and prosecute them.The Capitol building area was fenced off on Thursday after Wednesday’s mayhem, while authorities began investigating the siege.The officer, Brian D Sicknick, died late on Thursday, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He “was responding to the riots on Wednesday” and suffered injuries “while physically engaging with protesters”, it said. He returned to his office and collapsed shortly thereafter. He died in a local hospital where he was taken for treatment. Sicknick was reportedly struck in the head with a fire extinguisher on Wednesday while struggling with the rioters who swarmed through the halls of Congress. Ashli Babbitt, a woman who had served in the US Air Force, was shot and killed by police while reportedly trying to smash her way into the House of Representatives chamber through a window, with other rioters. Three other people died of medical emergencies.The office of the US attorney for DC has opened a federal murder investigation into Sicknick’s death, according to reports. Those convicted could get the death penalty. The case is being jointly conducted by the FBI and the DC Metropolitan Police Department, and the US Capitol Police.House speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered flags to fly at half-mast at the US Capitol in Sicknick’s honour. “On behalf of the House of Representatives, I send our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of officer Brian Sicknick, who died after defending the Capitol complex and protecting those who serve and work here,” she said in a statement. “Make no mistake. With our partners, we will hold accountable those who participated in yesterday’s siege of the Capitol,” FBI director Christopher Wray said. “Let me assure the American people the FBI has deployed our full investigative resources and is working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to aggressively pursue those involved in criminal activity during the events.”The FBI and the police released 40 photos of rioters seeking the public’s help to identify them. They included a man seen walking around with a confederate flag, and one who sat in the Senate president’s seat in the well of the chamber that was occupied just moments before on Wednesday by US vice-president Mike Pence as he had presided over the process to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murder-probe-opens-after-us-police-officer-dies-in-capitol-mob-attack/story-WcBNLWuDDMEGcIlfogxtCO.html

She also said that Congress will move to oust him from office if members of his cabinet do not invoke the 25th Amendment to do so.Pelosi will speak with her Democratic caucus members Friday about the way forward on trying to remove Trump before Joe Biden takes over as president Jan. 20. Few Republicans have yet endorsed the effort.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi alerted fellow Democrats that she is concerned that an “unhinged” President Donald Trump would access nuclear launch codes and order a military strike, and wants Pentagon officials to take precautions.Pelosi said she spoke with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley about “available precautions for preventing an unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike” in his remaining days in office.Pelosi also said in a letter to colleagues that Congress will try to remove Trump from office if his cabinet doesn’t act.“Today, following the President’s dangerous and seditious acts, Republicans in Congress need to follow that example and call on Trump to depart his office – immediately,” Pelosi said. “If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-speaks-to-us-army-chief-regarding-trump-s-access-to-nuclear-codes/story-pbHYWw444wjIk8e8KoA5AM.html
08-01-2021||World||Republican Ben Sasse would consider Democratic effort to impeach Trump||At least one Senate Republican would consider supporting a possible effort by congressional Democrats to impeach President Donald Trump for an unprecedented second time after his supporters, inflamed by his false claims of election fraud, stormed the US Capitol.Democrats in the House of Representatives, which holds the power to impeach the president, will hold a conference call at noon (1700 GMT) to discuss their next steps, according to two Democratic aides.Top Democratic leaders say they believe the House can impeach the Republican president within a week but with Trump’s term due to end anyway by Jan. 20 and the Senate still controlled by Republicans, the prospects of him then being thrown out of office are unclear.Removing a US president requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate.Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican and often a Trump critic, told CBS News on Friday he would “definitely consider” any articles of impeachment because the president “disregarded his oath of office.”“I do believe that the votes are in the House of Representatives to put forth articles of impeachment, and he’ll be the only president to be impeached twice,” said James Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat. President-Elect Joe Biden has blamed Trump for instigating Wednesday’s violence but has not said whether he supports removal. Transition spokesman Andrew Bates said Biden would focus on preparing to take power and leave it to Vice President Mike Pence, the Cabinet and Congress “to act as they see fit.”Trump had encouraged thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol on Wednesday in a fiery speech in which he repeated his baseless claims that the Nov. 3 presidential election was stolen. A crowd stormed the building, overwhelming police, breaking windows, stealing computers and antiquities and forcing authorities to transport lawmakers to secure locations for their own safety.The violence killed five people, including a police officer. As calls mounted for the president to be removed, Trump finally denounced the violence, In a video released on Thursday evening, a flat-toned Trump promised a smooth and orderly transition of power, though he stopped short of abandoning his claims of fraud.On Friday morning he praised his supporters on Twitter, saying, “They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”A Capitol police officer died from injuries sustained in the assault, the force said on Thursday. A woman protester was fatally shot by the authorities, and three people died from medical emergencies.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanded on Thursday that Pence and Trump’s Cabinet invoke the Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows them to strip the president of his powers if he cannot discharge the duties of his office. Pence opposes the idea, an adviser said.Pelosi and Schumer, along with other Democratic leaders, called for immediate impeachment proceedings if Pence and the Cabinet refuse to take steps to remove Trump from power.“The president’s dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,” they said in a statement on Thursday evening, accusing Trump of inciting an “insurrection.”RUNNING OUT OF TIME? There is a growing rift within the Republican Party in the wake of Wednesday’s siege. At least two Republicans, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and US Representative Adam Kinzinger, joined calls for Trump to go.Numerous senior Trump administration officials have resigned in protest over the invasion of the Capitol, including two Cabinet members: Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and McConnell’s wife, and Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.Congress certified Biden’s election victory early on Thursday, after authorities cleared the Capitol.With Trump’s term almost expired, it was not clear whether there would be enough time to complete the impeachment process.The Senate is scheduled to be in recess until Jan. 19. Aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, have not said whether he would reconvene the Senate if the House approved articles of impeachment.Democrats are set to take narrow control of the Senate after winning two runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday, but the new senators will not be sworn in until the state certifies its results later this month.The House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, but the Senate acquitted him in February 2020. Only two other US presidents have been impeached, and none has ever been impeached twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-ben-sasse-would-consider-democratic-effort-to-impeach-trump/story-NbQB2ktFJnHMeMgCdMh9QM.html

He added however that Iran could obtain vaccines “from other reliable places”. He gave no details, but China and Russia are both allies of Iran. “Imports of US and British vaccines into the country are forbidden ... They’re completely untrustworthy. It’s not unlikely they would want to contaminate other nations,” said Khamenei, the country’s highest authority.“Given our experience with France’s HIV-tainted blood supplies, French vaccines aren’t trustworthy either,” Khamenei said, referring to the country’s contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.Iran launched human trials of its first domestic COVID-19 vaccine candidate late last month, saying it could help Iran defeat the pandemic despite US sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since 2018, when President Donald Trump abandoned Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions to pressure Tehran into negotiating stricter curbs on its nuclear program, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces. In retaliation for US sanctions, which were lifted under the nuclear deal, Tehran has gradually violated the accord. US President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has pledged to rejoin the agreement, if Tehran also returns to full compliance. Khamenei said Tehran was in no rush for the United States to re-enter the deal, but that sanctions on the Islamic Republic must be lifted immediately.Iran’s utmost authority, Khamenei ruled out any talks over Tehran’s missile programme and Iran’s involvement in the Middle East, as demanded by the United States and some other major powers.“Contrary to the US, Iran’s involvement in the region creates stability and is aimed at preventing instability ... Iran’s involvement in the region is definite and will continue.”Shortly before Khamenei’s speech, Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards unveiled an underground missile base at an undisclosed Gulf location. The West sees Iran’s missiles both as a conventional military threat to regional stability and a possible delivery mechanism for nuclear weapons should Tehran develop them.But Iran, which has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, regards the programme as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against US and other adversaries - primarily Gulf Arabs - in the region in the event of war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-khamenei-bans-import-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-us-uk-demands-revoking-of-sanctions/story-ZP1YOeKmFk8ugRi39N98BN.html

08-01-2021||World||President-elect Biden to release every available dose of Covid-19 vaccine: Report||President-elect Joe Biden will aim to release every available dose of coronavirus vaccine when he takes office, a departure from Trump administration strategy of holding back doses to make sure second doses are available, CNN reported on Thursday.“The President-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible,” TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Biden’s transition, told CNN.“He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans’ arms now.”Biden will reveal more next week about how his administration will begin releasing the available doses once he takes office on Jan. 20, Ducklo said.The Trump administration fell far short of its goal of vaccinating 20 million Americans with a first of two required doses by the end of 2020.In a letter Friday to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed Chief Operating Officer General Gustave Perna, a group of state governors urged the federal government to tap into the “reserved doses” of COVID-19 vaccine and send them to states that need them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-biden-to-release-every-available-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-report/story-j89UlhVSmh8m0wJXkU8saL.html
08-01-2021||World||US president Donald Trump will not attend Biden’s inauguration ceremony on January 20||President Donald Trump says he won’t attend President-elect Joe Biden’s Inauguration on Jan. 20. He will be the first incumbent president since Andrew Johnson to skip his successors inauguration.In a Friday tweet Trump said, “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.”Trump offered no clues for how he would spent his final hours in office.Biden will become president at noon regardless of Trump’s plans.With 12 days left in his term, President Donald Trump has finally bent to reality amid growing talk of trying to force him out early, acknowledging he’ll peacefully leave after Congress affirmed his defeat.Trump led off a video from the White House Thursday by condemning the violence carried out in his name a day earlier at the Capitol. Then, for the first time on camera, he admitted his presidency would soon end — though he declined to mention President-elect Joe Biden by name or explicitly state he had lost.“A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Trump said in the video. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”By next morning, however, Trump was back to his usual division. Instead of offering condolences to the police officer who died from injuries sustained during the riot, Trump took to twitter to commend the “great American Patriots” who’d voted for him.“They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!” he tweeted.Thursday evening’s address, which appeared designed to stave off talk of a forced early eviction, came at the end of a day when the cornered president stayed out of sight in the White House. Silenced on some of his favorite internet lines of communication, he watched the resignations of several top aides, including two Cabinet secretaries.And as officials sifted through the aftermath of the pro-Trump mob’s siege of the U.S. Capitol, there was growing discussion of impeaching him a second time or invoking the 25th Amendment to oust him from the Oval Office.The invasion of the Capitol building, a powerful symbol of the nation’s democracy, rattled Republicans and Democrats alike. They struggled with how best to contain the impulses of a president deemed too dangerous to control his own social media accounts but who remains commander in chief of the world’s greatest military.“I’m not worried about the next election, I’m worried about getting through the next 14 days,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s staunchest allies. He condemned the president’s role in Wednesday’s riots and said, “If something else happens, all options would be on the table.”Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that “the president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America.” She called him “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office. This is urgent, an emergency of the highest magnitude.”Neither option to remove Trump seemed likely, with little time left in his term to draft the Cabinet members needed to invoke the amendment or to organize the hearings and trial mandated for an impeachment. But the fact that the dramatic options were even the subject of discussion in Washington’s corridors of power served as a warning to Trump.Fears of what a desperate president could do in his final days spread in the nation’s capital and beyond, including speculation Trump could incite more violence, make rash appointments, issue ill-conceived pardons — including for himself and his family — or even trigger a destabilizing international incident.The president’s video Thursday — which was released upon his return to Twitter after his account was restored — was a complete reversal from the one he put out just 24 hours earlier in which he said to the violent mob: “We love you. You’re very special.” His refusal to condemn the violence sparked a firestorm of criticism and, in the new video, he at last denounced the demonstrators’ “lawlessness and mayhem.”Aides said the video was also meant to slow the mass exodus of staffers and ward off potential legal trouble for Trump once he leaves office; White House counsel Pat Cipollone has repeatedly warned the president that he could be deemed responsible for inciting Wednesday’s violence.As for his feelings on leaving office, Trump told the nation that “serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime” while hinting at a return to the public arena. He told supporters “our incredible journey is only just beginning.”Just a day earlier, Trump unleashed the destructive forces at the Capitol with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally that prompted supporters to disrupt the congressional certification of Biden’s victory. After the storming of the Capitol and the eventual wee-hours certification of Biden’s win by members of Congress, Trump released a statement that acknowledged he would abide by a peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20.The statement was posted by an aide and did not originate from the president’s own Twitter account, which has 88 million followers and for four years has been wielded as a political weapon that dictates policy and sows division and conspiracy.Trump couldn’t tweet it himself because, for the first time, the social media platform suspended his account, stating that the president had violated its rules of service by inciting violence. Facebook adopted a broader ban, saying Trump’s account would be offline until after Biden’s inauguration.Deprived of that social media lifeblood, Trump remained silent and ensconced in the executive mansion until Thursday evening. But around him, loyalists headed for the exits, their departures — which were coming in two weeks anyway — moved up to protest the president’s handling of the riot.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao became the first Cabinet member to resign. Chao, married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the lawmakers trapped at the Capitol on Wednesday, said in a message to staff that the attack “has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.”Education Secretary Betsy DeVos followed. In her resignation letter Thursday, DeVos blamed Trump for inflaming tensions in the violent assault on the seat of the nation’s democracy. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” she wrote.Others who resigned in the wake of the riot: Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger; Ryan Tully, senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council; and first lady Melania Trump’s chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary.Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff-turned-special envoy to Northern Ireland, told CNBC that he had called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “to let him know I was resigning. ... I can’t do it. I can’t stay.”Mulvaney said others who work for Trump had decided to remain in their posts in an effort to provide some sort of guardrails for the president during his final days in office.“Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in,” Mulvaney said.Mulvaney’s predecessor in the chief of staff job, retired U.S. Marine Corps general John Kelly, told CNN that “I think the Cabinet should meet and have a discussion” about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment — allowing the forceful removal of Trump by his own Cabinet.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined Pelosi in declaring that Trump “should not hold office one day longer” and urged Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to act. But Chao’s departure may stall nascent efforts to invoke the amendment.Staff-level discussions on the matter took place across multiple departments and even in parts of the White House, according to two people briefed on the talks. But no member of the Cabinet has publicly expressed support for the move — which would make Pence the acting president — though several were believed to be sympathetic to the notion, believing Trump is too volatile in his waning days in office.In the West Wing, shell-shocked aides were packing up, acting on a delayed directive to begin offboarding their posts ahead of the Biden team’s arrival. The slowdown before now was due to Trump’s single-minded focus on his defeat since Election Day at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office.Most glaringly, that included the fight against the raging coronavirus that is killing record numbers of Americans each day.Few aides had any sense of the president’s plans, with some wondering if Trump would largely remain out of sight until he left the White House. But the president has asked aides to explore a possible valedictory trip next week to the southern border as a means to highlight his immigration policies.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Thursday read a brief statement in which she declared that the Capitol siege was “appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way.”But her words carried little weight. Trump has long made clear that only he speaks for his presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-donald-trump-will-not-attend-biden-s-inauguration-ceremony-on-january-20/story-JxMli1Gvn9j9j5nc4XDcsI.html
08-01-2021||World||Covid-19 ‘out of control’ in London, mayor declares ‘major incident’||Facing continuing surge of new Covid-19 cases, London mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday declared a ‘major incident’ – which is equivalent to declaring an emergency response – and urged people in the capital to stay at home and help hospitals from being overwhelmed.A ‘major incident’ is defined as an event or situation with a range of serious consequences which requires special arrangements to be implemented by one or more emergency responder agency. The ambulance service is now taking nearly 8,000 emergency calls a day now.A ‘major incident’ is beyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national security, according to regulations.Khan took the decision as the chair of the London Resilience Forum following discussions with leaders from NHS London, local authorities, Public Health England and the emergency services in the capital. It comes as the number of Covid-19 cases in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000, putting immense pressure on an already stretched NHS. Between 30 December and 6 January, the number of patients in London hospitals grew by 27% (from 5,524 to 7,034) and the number on mechanical ventilation grew by 42% (from 640 to 908). Over the last three days alone, the NHS has announced 477 deaths in London hospitals following a positive test for Covid-19.The impact is also being felt right across the emergency services with hundreds of firefighters from London Fire Brigade once again assisting London Ambulance Service by volunteering to drive ambulances as the ambulance services faces one of the busiest times in its history. Khan said: “The situation in London is now critical with the spread of the virus out of control. The number of cases in London has increased rapidly with more than a third more patients being treated in our hospitals now compared to the peak of the pandemic last April”.The stark reality is that we will run out of beds for patients in the next couple of weeks unless the spread of the virus slows down drastically. We are declaring a major incident because the threat this virus poses to our city is at crisis point. If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die”.“Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-out-of-control-in-london-mayor-declares-major-incident/story-IdHYWhLqNCIKzvBXi6JpyK.html

The UK has ordered 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine that is assessed to be 94% effective.MHRA chief executive June Raine said: “Having a third Covid-19 vaccine approved for supply following a robust and thorough assessment of all the available data is an important goal to have achieved and I am proud that the agency has helped to make this a reality”.“Once in use, all Covid-19 vaccines are continually monitored by the MHRA. This ensures that the benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 continue to far outweigh any potential side effects,” she added.As agreed when the UK originally pre-ordered the vaccine, supplies will begin to be delivered from spring once Moderna expands its production capability, officials said. The vaccine will be available to people for free.Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “Through our vaccine delivery plan we have already vaccinated nearly 1.5 million people across the UK. The Moderna vaccine will boost our vaccination programme even further once doses become available from the spring.”The Moderna vaccine will be deployed through hospital hubs for NHS and care staff and older patients to get vaccinated; local community services with local teams and general practitioners s already signing up to take part in the programme; and vaccination centres across the country, ensuring people can access a vaccine regardless of where they live.An official statement said that anyone with a previous history of allergic reactions to the ingredients of the Moderna vaccine should not receive it, but those with any other allergies such as a food allergy can have the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-approves-covid-19-vaccine-from-moderna/story-qy3tNH7CcBGQsrwd1NNN6K.html

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing, here on Friday, that the first meeting with the South Asian countries on anti-epidemic cooperation and poverty reduction was held on January 6. This is China’s third meeting held with these countries to discuss cooperation to deal with Covid-19. In July last year, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a video conference with his counterparts of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal to discuss plans to contain Covid-19, boost economic recovery and the resumption of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. Later in November last year, China conducted a Vice-Ministerial meeting on controlling Covid-19 with Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This is the first time China has included poverty relief, non-traditional security challenges besides Covid-19 cooperation in these meetings. Hua said the January 6 meeting was a follow up to the two ministerial conferences held last year. “In this meeting, the representatives shared experience on anti-epidemic and poverty relief,” she said. “They talked about dealing with the impact of the pandemic, resuming economic and trade cooperation, dealing with non-traditional security challenges and advancing sustainable development and reached initial consensus,” she said. “It shows our strong will and confidence in dealing with challenges together and achieving cooperation. China would like to work with all sides in implementing our consensus and make a greater contribution to building a regional community with a shared future for health”, Hua said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-holds-1st-meet-with-south-asian-nations-on-covid-poverty-relief-cooperation/story-pLdx5HkApaFpQHzt6sh7oN.html
08-01-2021||World||Hong Kong grants bail to arrested pro-democracy activists||Authorities in Hong Kong said Friday they have granted bail to most of the 55 pro-democracy activists who were arrested this week in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. One of the activists said they could still be charged under a tough national security law.The activists were accused of taking part in an unofficial primary election last year that authorities said was part of a plan to paralyze the Legislative Council and subvert state power. The primary was held to choose the best candidates to field as the pro-democracy camp sought to win a majority of seats.The mass arrests Wednesday were the biggest move against Hong Kong’s democracy movement since Beijing imposed the national security law in the semi-autonomous territory last June to quell dissent following months of anti-government protests in 2019.Three of the 55 arrested people were not released — activists Joshua Wong and Tam Tak-chi, who were already in jail on separate charges, and former Hong Kong Democratic Party Chairman Wu Chi-wai, who remained in custody for failing to meet bail conditions in a separate protest-related case.Wu had been granted bail last month after being charged with inciting others to join unauthorized protests in July 2019. He was ordered to surrender his travel documents, and authorities later learned that he did not hand in his British National Overseas passport.Police said none of the activists arrested Wednesday on suspicion of subversion under the security law had been formally charged.Former pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting told reporters that determinations of whether to formally prosecute people in Hong Kong are not based on evidence, but on a “political decision” by officials.“They haven’t made any charges against us yet,” said Lam, who was among those arrested on Wednesday. “But I’m quite sure that they will charge some of us sooner or later, whether they have sufficient evidence or not.”He said the purpose of the arrests was to silence Hong Kong’s people and create a “chilling effect.”Separately, three people were sentenced to up to 5 1/2 years in prison on Friday for rioting at Hong Kong’s airport and assaulting a Chinese journalist in August 2019 at the height of the anti-government protests.Protesters blockaded the city’s airport for two days. Some turned on individuals they believed were spies or undercover police, and a reporter from China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper was tied up and attacked by a group of protesters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-grants-bail-to-arrested-pro-democracy-activists/story-Mr50tDZA8303NPmedygKGN.html

Khan said that he would visit the families only after the slain miners have been buried. “We can’t do this if you set a condition for the burial of the dead,” he told journalists while speaking at a conference in Islamabad on Friday . “If you bury them today, then I will take a plane and come to meet you today.”Khan said he sent three members of his cabinet to meet the protesters to assure them that the state will take care of them and compensate them for the loss of their loved ones. However, instead of soothing nerves, the visit of the three ministers angered members of the Shia Hazara community. Special advisor Zulfikar Bokhari had asked the protestors what benefit they would get if the Pakistan PM came to visit them. Despite calls since January 3 and nationwide protests by members of the Hazara community, the Pakistan PM has refused to visit the protesting families while opposition leaders have visited the protesters, including PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz.The massacre in Machh coal mine “is part of the conspiracy that I have been speaking about since March,” Imran Khan told the media, adding, “India is trying to spread sectarian violence in Pakistan.”However, interior minister Shaikh Rasheed told a media briefing on Friday that it was still not clear who was behind the attack. “It could be Daesh [Islamic State], it could be any outfit,” he told journalists.He said the country’s intelligence agencies are still to come up with their findings.When asked about the PM’s reluctance to visit Quetta, the interior minister hinted that there were security concerns about his travel to the Balochistan provincial capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-be-blackmailed-into-visiting-hazara-mourning-slain-kin-says-defiant-pak-pm/story-YnGxDRBQIU2ueksLw8qrHJ.html
08-01-2021||World||Pak anti-terror court jails Mumbai attack mastermind Lakhvi||A Pakistani court on Friday sentenced Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the globally designated terrorist leader of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and mastermind of Mumbai attack, to three prison terms of five years each over terror financing. The sentences, under three sections of Anti-Terrorism Act, will run concurrently. The conviction and sentencing at the special bench of an anti-terrorism court in Lahore concluded in a single hearing of just few hours after Lakhvi was produced before it for the first time since his arrest on January 2. The hurried action appeared to prove the view that Pakistan was scampering to comply with Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is set to take up this month and in February the case of the country, which is currently in the ‘grey list’ of the global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering.Judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar, who pronounced the verdict, also asked Lakhvi, an operations commander of LeT, to pay a fine of Rs300,000 for running a medical dispensary to collect and disburse funds for terror activities.The Counter-Terrorism Department of Punjab Police, which had arrested Lakhvi, clarified that he was detained in relation to terrorism financing and not for a “specific militant attack”.The court on Friday announced its verdict after recording the statements of all witnesses in the case.India accuses Lakhvi of masterminding the 26/11 attacks of November, 2008 in Mumbai that killed 166 people. He was arrested by Pakistan in 2008 but later released on bail. Pakistan claims that India didn’t provide concrete evidence to convict Lakhvi.According to a UN Security Council sanctions committee, which designated him a global terrorist, Lakhvi is the chief of operations and military commander of the LeT. A close relative of LeT founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, he had a central role in planning and executing the assault on Mumbai, according to Indian and US security officials.Lakhvi was born in Okara district of Pakistan’s Punjab province, which was also home to Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only one to be captured alive among the 10 terrorists involved in the Mumbai attacks. In the 1990s, Lakhvi was a member of the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, LeT’s parent body.Lakhvi worked at LeT’s main centre at Muridke near Lahore in the 1990s. Security officials say he was actively involved in fighting in Jammu and Kashmir and later planning the LeT’s operations in the state.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-anti-terror-court-jails-mumbai-attack-mastermind-lakhvi/story-i6r0fsjMWCwR2wFHZRij0K.html
08-01-2021||World||UK approves Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||The UK’s regulatory authority on Friday approved a third Covid-19 vaccine for use in the country, made by the company Moderna.However, supplies of the new jab are not expected to be available until the spring in a few weeks’ time as the UK has pre-ordered 7 million doses. In trials with more than 30,000, the Moderna vaccine offered nearly 95 per cent protection from severe Covid-19. The Moderna vaccine works in a similar way to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that is already being offered by the National Health Service (NHS).

08-01-2021||World||Israel postpones PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial amid Covid-19 lockdown||Israel has postponed the next hearing in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial because of a tightened coronavirus lockdown that began Friday. The Jerusalem District Court said the hearing scheduled for Wednesday would be postponed indefinitely because of the number of people required to attend in person. Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust connected to three long-running investigations. He has denied any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a “witch hunt” by hostile media, law enforcement and judicial officials. In recent months he has faced weekly protests calling on him to resign over the allegations and the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Israel has seen a recent surge in cases despite unleashing one of the world’s fastest vaccination campaigns. The country has given the first of two vaccine doses to nearly 20 per cent of its population, and Netanyahu said Thursday that it has secured enough vaccines to inoculate the whole adult population by the end of March. Netanyahu has placed the vaccination drive at the center of his campaign for re-election that month, when Israel will hold its fourth nationwide vote in less than two years. In the meantime, he has called on Israelis to make “one last big effort” to halt transmission by adhering to the tightened restrictions. Most schools and businesses were closed starting Friday, with people required to remain within 1,000 meters (yards) from home except for essential needs. Public gatherings are heavily restricted and public transportation is limited. The restrictions are to last for at least two weeks. Thousands of police will be deployed to enforce them, with roadblocks set up on major thoroughfares. Israel was already in its third national lockdown since the start of the pandemic. Deputy Police Commissioner Ziv Sagiv called on people to stay home, saying police would operate in “every possible way” to enforce the restrictions. Israel has reported 474,000 cases since the start of the pandemic, including 3,565 deaths. It currently has more than 60,000 active cases, and officials had warned that without the tightened lockdown its medical facilities could be overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-postpones-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-s-trial-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-BPFhgqyjGxBGqo9kX23c0H.html

In one video, Davis says, “We’re all trying to get into the Capitol to stop this.”Davis said he was “peacefully demonstrating” the whole time, and was not trying to actively break into the Capitol. “I said ‘trying to get into the Capitol,’ meaning to voice a protest. Not in any violent way,” he wrote.Rick Saccone, a former Pennsylvania state representative, shared images on his Facebook page of himself outside the Capitol. Saint Vincent College, where Saccone served as an adjunct professor, immediately began an investigation said Michael Hustava, the institution’s Senior Director of Marketing and Communications.“As a result of that investigation, Dr Saccone has submitted and we have accepted his letter of resignation, effective immediately. He will no longer be associated with Saint Vincent College in any capacity,” Hustava said in a statement provided to CNN.Wednesday began with a Trump rally near the White House with the president telling tens of thousands of supporters to march to Capitol Hill to protest election results while repeating unsubstantiated claims that his defeat resulted from massive election fraud.Trump responded later in the day with a tepid statement urging supporters to leave the Capitol as lawmakers sheltered in locked offices and federal police battled protesters. At least four people died during the melee.In all, at least five people have died including a Capitol police officer in connection with Wednesday’s unrest, CNN reported on Thursday.In a late-night session of Congress after police secured the Capitol, lawmakers voted to certify Biden’s victory. Biden is set to be inaugurated on January 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-who-took-part-in-us-capitol-riots-reportedly-losing-their-jobs/story-NBr5mlEpTqxZYiAQMCYGQO.html

The 61-year-old Lakhvi, who was on bail since 2015 in the Mumbai attacks case, was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab province last Saturday.“The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore convicted Lakhvi for commission of offences of terrorism financing in a case registered by the CTD for 15 years under different section of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997,” news agency PTI quoted a court official as saying after the hearing.Judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar sentenced Lakhvi, who pleaded before the court that he was “falsely implicated” in the case, to five years of rigorous imprisonment each on three counts with a fine of PKR 100,000 each on three counts. “In default of payment of fine, he will have to undergo an imprisonment of six months each on three counts. He has been sent to prison to serve the sentences,” the official said, according to PTI.Also read |Global terrorist Masood Azhar is finally a wanted man in Pak. Dawood next?Lakhvi, a close relative of LeT founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, had a central role in planning and executing the assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people and injured hundreds more in November 2008, according to Indian and US security officials.Here are 10 things you need to know about Lakhvi:1. Lakhvi was born in Okara district of Pakistan’s Punjab province, the same district that was home to Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only one of the 10 terrorists involved in the Mumbai attacks to be captured alive. In the 1990s, Lakhvi was a member of the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, LeT’s parent body. 2. Lakhvi worked at LeT’s main centre at Muridke near Lahore in the 1990s. Security officials say he was actively involved in fighting in Jammu and Kashmir and later planning the LeT’s operations in the state.3. Lakhvi was arrested about a week after the Mumbai attacks when Pakistani soldiers raided a LeT camp on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. 4. A few months later, he and six other men were charged with planning, financing and executing the assault on Mumbai. Indian and US security officials say telephone and VoIP intercepts showed Lakhvi was present in a LeT control room in Karachi from where the attackers received instructions.5. Despite being in prison from December 2008 to April 2015, Lakhvi continued to be the operations commander of the LeT. Lakhvi had unfettered access to mobile phones and the internet, allowing him to direct the day-to-day activities of militants. His youngest wife was allowed to stay with him in jail and he fathered a child sometime in 2010 as a result of these conjugal visits, according to Abu Jundal alias Zabiuddin Ansari, the Indian LeT operative deported from Saudi Arabia in 2012. Also read | Pak has quietly moved 26/11 attacks accused Hafiz Saeed out of jail. He is home: Intel6. Lakhvi had several rooms next to the jailer’s office in Adiala Jail and received about 100 visitors every day who could meet him without seeking permission from authorities. Former Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Kayani refused to act on a request from US authorities to take away Lakhvi’s mobile phones.7. Lakhvi’s whereabouts had not been known since he was released on bail from a jail in Rawalpindi in April 2015. However, it was widely believed that he had continued playing a key role in directing the activities of the LeT even while he was in prison after being arrested in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage. Indian diplomats and security officials have in the past described the trial of Lakhvi and the six other suspects in a Pakistani anti-terrorism court as a farce. 8. Lakhvi was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab province last Saturday on terror financing charges.9. Lakhvi is accused of running a dispensary and using funds collected for terrorism financing. He and others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses, CTD has said.10. Lakhvi is also an UN-designated terrorist, in addition to belonging to proscribed organisation LeT.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zaki-ur-rehman-lakhvi-un-designated-terrorist-26-11-mastermind/story-HEeN4HhlWMDgYy69RecioN.html

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said the move was a “very positive development.”“We right now have access to 300 million doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine. We now have agreed with BioNTech-Pfizer to extend the contract. With the new agreement, we could purchase a total of up to an additional 300 million doses of the vaccine. In other words, this will allow us to double the number of doses,” Von der Leyen said. We make sure Europeans have sufficient doses of safe & effective #COVID19 vaccines. We now enable EU countries to buy more doses of the 1st vaccine approved in EU. They can now buy up to 300 million more doses of the #BioNTech/@Pfizer vaccine.https://t.co/vjZd0L17VLMoreover, 75 million of these new doses would be available by the second quarter of the year and the remaining doses would be delivered in the third and fourth quarters, she added. Von der Leyen also said that the vaccine has already been approved by Europe’s regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and would therefore require no new negotiations for the deal. Also, the vaccine has been authorised already thus making it easier for the member states to continue their inoculation program, she added.On Wednesday, Europe granted its approval to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, the second in European Union. “With these two authorised vaccines, we have already secured a number of doses that we need to vaccinate 380 million Europeans. This is more than 80 per cent of the European population,” von der Leyen added. She also expressed the belief that other vaccines would also be approved in the “coming weeks and months.”When asked if individual member nations of the EU would be allowed to negotiate their own deals with vaccine manufacturers, von der Leyen said “There will be no parallel negotiations; no parallel contracts. The framework we are all working in is a framework of 27 [nations]. Together we are negotiating, together we are procuring.”Click here to read our complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEarlier on Monday, Germany said that the country has signed a memorandum of understanding with BioNTech for supplying 30 million doses of their vaccine on a bilateral basis.

08-01-2021||World||Tensions mount in Thai protests as Bangkok braces for major rally||Tensions are rising around Thailand’s pro-democracy protests, with six people shot last week and police using tear gas and water cannon on the streets of Bangkok.As the Thai capital braces for the next major rally on Wednesday, AFP takes a look at the forces in play and what might come next in a country with a long history of political unrest.Protesters getting tough After four months of rallies, sometimes involving tens of thousands of demonstrators, the mood is getting tougher, with protest leaders warning they are not prepared to compromise.More than 50 people were injured during a protest near parliament last week, six of them with gunshot wounds, according to medical officials, though it is not clear who was responsible for the shooting. Police are investigating but have not made any arrests.Slogans and insults against the monarchy -- unthinkable only a short time ago -- are proliferating, while riot police showed last week they are ready to take firm action against the rallies.The student-led movement has gained a strong base on the streets and social media and experts say the “Red Shirts”, a once-vociferous group who led major street protests a decade ago, may join the ranks.The movement is calling for Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha -- who came to power in a coup in 2014 -- to quit, for constitutional changes and for reform of the monarchy.Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, professor of political science at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, told AFP the movement needs to prioritise its demands and focus its leadership on a few prominent figureheads if it is to make progress.But with their taboo-smashing demands for reform of the monarchy, Siripan said, the protesters have already “allowed the emergence of a new political culture, pushing for a freedom of expression unprecedented in the history of the kingdom”.Authorities ‘playing by ear’The authorities have had a cautious response to the movement since it sprang up in July -- announcing emergency measures then withdrawing them, arresting protest leaders then freeing them again.“Since the beginning of the movement, the government has played it by ear,” said Paul Chambers of Naresuan University.Unlike previous Thai protest movements, the majority of the demonstrators are young middle-class city dwellers.The authorities may be wary of tarnishing Thailand’s international image with a repeat of the crackdown on the Red Shirts in 2010 that left 90 people dead in the heart of Bangkok’s tourist and shopping district.However, the authorities have hardened their tone in recent days, brandishing the threat of “section 112” -- the kingdom’s famously strict royal defamation laws, which carry up to 15 years in prison.Royal charm offensiveKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, not seen much in public before the protest movement, has launched a charm offensive, making numerous appearances, talking to supporters and declaring his “love” for all Thais.But he remains a controversial figure and does not enjoy the same level of affection built up by his late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, during his seven decades on the throne, which ended in 2016.The present king has strengthened his powers by taking direct control of the royal fortune and army units. And his frequent stays in Germany have also raised questions -- some criticise him for not being concerned enough about his subjects during the coronavirus pandemic.“There is evidently a campaign to rally legitimacy. At issue is whether this should have been done much earlier, whether there is still sufficient time,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, head of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University.A violent climax?Thailand has often seen protest movements end in bloodshed -- twice in the 1970s, then in 1992 and in 2010 -- and experts warn a repeat could be brewing.Chambers said “ultra-royalist right-wing groups” are already forming to harass democracy demonstrators.Some are talking of a possible coup, to add to the dozen Thailand has seen since its move to democracy in 1932.In the short term, next week brings a potential watershed with a judgment expected in a constitutional court case against Prayut for allegedly misusing the army chief’s official residence.If he loses, he looks set to be thrown out of office -- a development that would likely take much of the immediate tension out of the unrest on the streets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-mount-in-thai-protests-as-bangkok-braces-for-major-rally/story-fqt8BaMrEJhhPfqiMWAEZM.html
08-01-2021||World||White House officials, advisers believe Capitol attack taints Trump’s political future||The violent assault on the US Capitol by President Donald Trump’s supporters and his long refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election have jeopardized the president’s political future and tainted prospects for his top lieutenants and family members, current and former administration officials said.The Republican president has dangled the possibility of running for president in 2024, and political operatives had expected him to exert influence over the Republican Party for years to come.But his behavior on Wednesday - goading supporters to march on the Capitol to encourage lawmakers to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s win in the Nov. 3 election, and then failing quickly to call on them to stand down after violence ensued - has sickened people who work and used to work for him and, they said, changed the equation for his post-presidential relevance.“It was a dereliction of duty as commander-in-chief and I think he will be mortally wounded from a political career going forward,” one former White House official who worked for Trump said on Thursday. “He has blood on his hands from yesterday. A woman died.”Trump supporters broke into the Capitol, pushed past police, and roamed through the building, forcing lawmakers and Vice President Mike Pence to evacuate. One woman died after being shot by police; three other individuals died of medical emergencies.“There’s no recovering from what happened. It was sedition. I don’t see how there’s a future,” said another former administration official, referring to Trump and his top aides. “I think the Cabinet members that stayed and that aren’t speaking out now or even quietly resigning have a stain forever.”The former administration official singled out Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump acolyte who may have presidential ambitions, for not doing more to condemn what happened. Pompeo issued a tweet in which he called the violence “unacceptable.” The State Department declined to comment further.US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced on Thursday she would resign, as did Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who cited the impact of Trump’s rhetoric in spurring the Capitol melee. Other lower level administration officials have announced their departures, too, with roughly two weeks to go before the end of Trump’s administration.The president came as close as he has to a concession in a video statement on Thursday night in which he pledged to work towards a smooth transfer of power to the new administration and called the violence at the Capitol a “heinous attack.”But the statement was late, and it came after intervention from his daughter, Ivanka, according to one current White House official, who noted that the political hit from the week’s events would extend to his family members, such as daughter-in-law Lara Trump, a potential candidate for the US Senate in North Carolina.The former officials who spoke to Reuters for this story had been broadly supportive of the president, even after leaving their posts earlier in his four-year tenure.Trump has raised massive amounts of money in the period since the election, capitalizing on discontent he has fomented by falsely claiming the election was rigged against him through widespread voter fraud.But another former White House official said the president’s ability to bring in cash would be inhibited now, too, with the exception of smaller donations from still-ardent supporters in his political base.“I think anything above low-dollar-crazy is going to be a problem,” the former official said. “Anything above the $100 giver is out.”Many elected officials within the Republican Party have turned on Trump because of the violence, a break that could lessen his leverage over the political futures of other Republicans as well as his own. Senator Lindsey Graham, a long-time defender of the president, declared on Wednesday night that “enough is enough” and said Biden had been elected lawfully.“I don’t think he’s going to be elected to anything else,” a third former White House official said of Trump. “As time goes on, he will continue to be a very strong voice and he will have a very big following, but ... I think this lessens the chances that he runs for anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-officials-advisers-believe-capitol-attack-adversely-affects-trump-s-political-future/story-bUb6yWSq4Z3XJguSFim8cL.html
08-01-2021||World||Capitol Police rejected offers of federal help to quell mob||Three days before supporters of President Donald Trump rioted at the Capitol, the Pentagon asked the U.S Capitol Police if it needed National Guard manpower. And as the mob descended on the building Wednesday, Justice Department leaders reached out to offer up FBI agents. The police turned them down both times, according to senior defense officials and two people familiar with the matter.Despite plenty of warnings of a possible insurrection and ample resources and time to prepare, the Capitol Police planned only for a free speech demonstration.Still stinging from the uproar over the violent response by law enforcement to protests last June near the White House, officials also were intent on avoiding any appearance that the federal government was deploying active duty or National Guard troops against Americans.The result is the US Capitol was overrun Wednesday and officers in a law enforcement agency with a large operating budget and experience in high-security events protecting lawmakers were overwhelmed for the world to see. Four protesters died, including one shot inside the building. A Capitol Police officer died Thursday after being injured in the Wednesday melee.The rioting and loss of control has raised serious questions over security at the Capitol for future events. The actions of the day also raise troubling concerns about the treatment of mainly white Trump supporters, who were allowed to roam through the building for hours, while Black and brown protesters who demonstrated last year over police brutality faced more robust and aggressive policing.“This was a failure of imagination, a failure of leadership,” said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, whose department responded to several large protests last year following the death of George Floyd. “The Capitol Police must do better and I don’t see how we can get around that.”Acevedo said he has attended events on the Capitol grounds to honor slain police officers that had higher fences and a stronger security presence than what he saw on video Wednesday.Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said that as the rioting was underway, it became clear that the Capitol Police were overrun. But he said there was no contingency planning done in advance for what forces could do in case of a problem at the Capitol because Defense Department help was turned down. “They’ve got to ask us, the request has to come to us,” said McCarthy.US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, under pressure from Schumer, Pelosi and other congressional leaders, was forced to resign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked for and received the resignation of the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, Michael Stenger, effective immediately. Paul Irving, the longtime Sergeant at Arms of the House, also resigned.“There was a failure of leadership at the top,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.The US Capitol had been closed to the public since March because of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed more than 360,000 people in the US. But normally, the building is open to the public and lawmakers pride themselves on their availability to their constituents.It is not clear how many officers were on-duty Wednesday, but the complex is policed by a total of 2,300 officers for 16 acres of ground who protect the 435 House representatives, 100 US senators and their staff. By comparison, the city of Minneapolis has about 840 uniformed officers policing a population of 425,000 in a 6,000-acre area.There were signs for weeks that violence could strike on January 6, when Congress convened for a joint session to finish counting the Electoral College votes that would confirm Democrat Joe Biden had won the presidential election.On far-right message boards and in pro-Trump circles, plans were being made.The leader of the far-right extremist group Proud Boys was arrested coming into the nation’s capital this week on a weapons charge for carrying empty high-capacity magazines emblazoned with their logo. He admitted to police that he had made statements about rioting in Washington, local officials said.Both Acevedo and Ed Davis, a former Boston police commissioner who led the department during the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, said they did not fault the responses of clearly overmatched front-line officers, but the planning and leadership before the riot.“Was there a structural feeling that well, these are a bunch of conservatives, they’re not going to do anything like this? Quite possibly,” Davis said. “That’s where the racial component to this comes into play in my mind. Was there a lack of urgency or a sense that this could never happen with this crowd? Is that possible? Absolutely.”Trump and his allies were perhaps the biggest megaphones, encouraging protesters to turn out in force and support his false claim that the election had been stolen from him. He egged them on during a rally shortly before they marched to the Capitol and rioted. His personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor known for his tough-on-crime stance, called for “trial by combat.”McCarthy said law enforcement’s intelligence estimates of the potential crowd size in the run-up to the protests “were all over the board,” from a low of 2,000 to as many as 80,000.So the Capitol Police had set up no hard perimeter around the Capitol. Officers were focused on one side where lawmakers were entering to vote to certify Biden’s win.Barricades were set up on the plaza in front of the building, but police retreated from the line and a mob of people broke through. Lawmakers, at first unaware of the security breach, continued their debate. Soon they were cowering under chairs. Eventually they were escorted from the House and Senate. Journalists were left alone in rooms for hours as the mob attempted to break into barricaded rooms.Sund, the Capitol Police chief, said he had expected a display of “First Amendment activities” that instead turned into a “violent attack.” But Gus Papathanasiou, head of the Capitol Police union, said planning failures left officers exposed without backup or equipment against surging crowds of rioters.“We were lucky that more of those who breached the Capitol did not have firearms or explosives and did not have a more malign intent,” Papathanasiou said in a statement. “Tragic as the deaths are that resulted from the attack, we are fortunate the casualty toll was not higher.”The Justice Department, FBI and other agencies began to monitor hotels, flights and social media for weeks and were expecting large crowds. Mayor Muriel Bowser had warned of impending violence for weeks, and businesses had closed in anticipation. She requested National Guard help from the Pentagon on December 31, but the Capitol Police turned down the January 3 offer from the Defense Department, according to Kenneth Rapuano, assistant defense secretary for homeland security.“We asked more than once and the final return that we got on Sunday the 3rd was that they would not be asking DOD for assistance,” he said.The Justice Department’s offer for FBI support as the protesters grew violent was rejected by the Capitol Police, according to the two people familiar with the matter. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.By then, it was too late.Officers from the Metropolitan Police Department descended. Agents from nearly every Justice Department agency, including the FBI, were called in. So was the Secret Service and the Federal Protective Service. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent two tactical teams. Police from as far away as New Jersey arrived to help.It took four hours to evict the protesters from the Capitol complex. By then, they had roamed the halls of Congress, posed for photos inside hallowed chambers, broken through doors, destroyed property and taken photos of themselves doing it. Only 13 were arrested at the time; scores were arrested later.In the aftermath, a 7-foot fence will go up around the Capitol grounds for at least 30 days. The Capitol Police will conduct a review of the carnage, as well as their planning and policies. Lawmakers plan to investigate how authorities handled the rioting.The acting US attorney in the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said the failure to arrest more people is making their jobs harder.“Look, we have to now go through cell site orders, collect video footage to try to identify people and then charge them, and then try to execute their arrest. So that has made things challenging, but I can’t answer why those people weren’t zip-tied as they were leaving the building by the Capitol Police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-rejected-offers-of-federal-help-to-quell-mob/story-1lXXs7THZKpqIE2izhoyjM.html
08-01-2021||World||Israel in deal with Pfizer to speed up vaccine deliveries for data||Israel agreed a deal with Pfizer Inc. to expedite deliveries of its Covid-19 vaccine so that all citizens over 16 can be inoculated by the end of March, in return for extensive data on the inoculation program.More 1.7 million Israelis, or about 18% of its population, have already received their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a larger proportion than in any other country. Officials had warned that pace would slow with new vaccine supplies not expected before February.But late Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement the next Pfizer shipment was now expected on Sunday, and that deliveries would be increased. The deal came after 17 conversations with Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla, he said, adding Israel would serve as a “global model state” and share data with the company and other countries to “develop strategies” to end the outbreak.Israel credits its universal health coverage, centralized system and extensive digitized records for enabling the fast distribution and analysis of the vaccine effort.The country was also due to get its first shipment of doses from Moderna Inc. on Thursday.While the vaccine effort is progressing rapidly, officials are contending with a surge in coronavirus cases that has led to a tightened lockdown starting Friday. Restrictions put in place from late December failed to tame the virus. Schools and non-essential businesses will now be closed.Netanyahu, whose corruption trial will soon move into a higher gear, is hoping the vaccine program will enable him to reopen Israel’s economy in time to get a boost ahead of the country’s fourth election in two years on March 23.Bank of Israel researchers said this week that a rapid vaccination effort could lead to output expanding 6.3% this year and 5.8% in 2022.So far, only Israelis over 60 or with chronic conditions have been eligible for a shot -- and about 75% of vaccines have gone to that group so far, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told Bloomberg TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-in-deal-with-pfizer-to-speed-up-vaccine-deliveries-for-data/story-Z7nqgk52PaULw4yxM2fPnO.html

Sicknick was injured “while physically engaging with protesters” during the Wednesday riot. He is the fifth person to die because of the melee.The rampage that has shocked the world and left the country on edge forced the resignations of three top Capitol security officials over the failure to stop the breach. It led lawmakers to demand a review of operations and an FBI briefing over what they called a “terrorist attack.” And it is prompting a broader reckoning over Trump’s tenure in office and what comes next for a torn nation.Protesters were urged by Trump during a rally near the White House earlier Wednesday to head to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were scheduled to confirm Biden’s presidential victory. The mob swiftly broke through police barriers, smashed windows and paraded through the halls, sending lawmakers into hiding.Five have died because of the Capitol siege. One protester, a white woman, was shot to death by Capitol Police, and there were dozens of arrests. Three other people died after “medical emergencies” related to the breach.Despite Trump’s repeated claims of voter fraud, election officials and his own former attorney general have said there were no problems on a scale that would change the outcome. All the states have certified their results as fair and accurate, by Republican and Democratic officials alike.Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said news of the police officer’s death was “gut-wrenching.”“None of this should have happened,” Sasse said in a statement. “Lord, have mercy.”Sicknick had returned to his division office after the incident and collapsed, the statement said. He was taken to a local hospital where he died on Thursday.Two House Democrats on committees overseeing the Capitol police budgets said those responsible need to be held to answer for the “senseless” death.“We must ensure that the mob who attacked the People’s House and those who instigated them are held fully accountable,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Ct., and Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. in a statement.Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said any remaining day with the president in power could be “a horror show for America.” Likewise, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the attack on the Capitol was “an insurrection against the United States, incited by the president,” and Trump must not stay in office “one day” longer.Pelosi and Schumer called for invoking the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to force Trump from office before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. Schumer said he and Pelosi tried to call Vice President Mike Pence early Thursday to discuss that option but were unable to connect with him.At least one Republican lawmaker joined the effort. The procedure allows for the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office. The vice president then becomes acting president.Pelosi said if the president’s Cabinet does not swiftly act, the House may proceed to impeach Trump.Trump, who had repeatedly refused to concede the election, did so in a late Thursday video from the White House vowing a “seamless transition of power.”Two Republicans who led efforts to challenge the election results, Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, faced angry peers in the Senate. Cruz defended his objection to the election results as “the right thing to do” as he tried unsuccessfully to have Congress launch an investigation.nIn the House, Republican leaders Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California and Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana joined in the failed effort to overturn Biden’s win by objecting to the Electoral College results.With tensions high, the Capitol shuttered and lawmakers not scheduled to return until the inauguration, an uneasy feeling of stalemate settled over a main seat of national power as Trump remained holed up at the White House.The social media giant Facebook banned the president from its platform and Instagram for the duration of Trump’s final days in office, if not indefinitely, citing his intent to stoke unrest. Twitter had silenced him the day before.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said “the shocking events” make it clear Trump “intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power.”U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, under pressure from Schumer, Pelosi and other congressional leaders, was forced to resign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked for and received the resignation of the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, Michael Stenger, effective immediately. Paul Irving, the longtime Sergeant at Arms of the House, also resigned.Sund had defended his department’s response to the storming of the Capitol, saying officers had “acted valiantly when faced with thousands of individuals involved in violent riotous actions.”Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called the police response “a failure.”Lawmakers from both parties pledged to investigate and questioned whether a lack of preparedness allowed a mob to occupy and vandalize the building. The Pentagon and Justice Department had been rebuffed when they offered assistance.Black lawmakers, in particular, noted the way the mostly white Trump supporters were treated.Newly elected Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., said if “we, as Black people did the same things that happened ... the reaction would have been different, we would have been laid out on the ground.”The protesters ransacked the place, taking over the House area and Senate chamber and waving Trump, American and Confederate flags. Outside, they scaled the walls and balconies.Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a former police chief, said it was “painfully obvious” that Capitol police “were not prepared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-hill-storming-police-officer-s-death-intensifies-siege-questions/story-gXEXCyEZBf4GlZuLt36kxI.html
08-01-2021||World||Migrant workers in Thailand suffer as coronavirus cases surge||Migrant workers in Thailand are struggling to find work and survive after coronavirus cases in the Southeast Asian nation reached record highs and employers imposed new restrictions, human rights groups said on Friday.In Samut Sakhon, a province south of Bangkok where the current outbreak began at a seafood market late last year, local charities say many migrant workers - especially those in the seafood and service sectors - are unable to work or access government aid.“We are concerned about what will happen if (the outbreak) cannot be controlled,” said Papop Siamhan, director of the Human Rights and Development Foundation, which provides free legal aid to migrant workers.Thailand is dealing with its worst coronavirus outbreak, with more than 200 new infections each day, raising the total so far to 9,841 cases, including 67 deaths.Many people have blamed migrant workers from Myanmar - a major source of labour in the seafood industry in Samut Sakhon.The province has about 260,000 registered migrant workers, according to government data, but activists estimate the number could be more than 400,000, including undocumented workers.Three migrant worker charities in Samut Sakhon said they had received complaints from workers who had been asked to obtain medical certificates showing negative Covid-19 test results in order to return to their jobs.The Thai government has ensured that anyone with Covid-19 symptoms, who has visited known hotspots, or who is suspected to have been infected, can access free coronavirus testing and treatment.But some migrant workers were deemed low risk and denied tests at government hospitals, and could not afford to get tested at private hospitals that can charge more than 4,000 baht ($133), migrant worker advocates said.Pakpoom Sawangkhum, president of the Proud Association, which helps vulnerable communities in Samut Sakhon, said some migrants are reluctant to get tested because of their illegal status, and those who tested positive refused treatment in an effort to remain in jobs.The UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) said all employers should meet their legal obligation to uphold equal treatment for all employees.“A migrant worker on minimum wage in Samut Sakhon contributing 100% of their salary for testing would have to work for an estimated nine days to cover the costs of a single Covid-19 test,” Geraldine Ansart, IOM’s chief of mission in Thailand, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“These prohibitive costs serve as a significant barrier to ensuring migrants are included in efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.Suchat Pornchaiwiseskul, director-general of the Department of Employment, said he was unaware of any employers asking migrant workers to provide medical certificates in order to return to work, but would investigate.One migrant worker at a factory in Samut Sakhon, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had been asked to stop working without pay after being unable to afford a Covid-19 test and obtain a negative certificate to show his employer.“I can’t find a new job, I can’t travel and there are costs I need to pay for my family to survive,” he said by phone from Samut Sakhon, which has been under lockdown since last month.“Even if I’m not working, I should at least receive half of my wages. I want the same rights as other workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-workers-in-thailand-suffer-as-coronavirus-cases-surge/story-bquE9KaLSzq57mhGFZP6hI.html
08-01-2021||World||Boris Johnson is embarrassed by Donald Trump||Some whirlwind romances you regret for many years. Isolated from its former European partners as Brexit approached, the UK looked for succor from the US. Two Conservative prime ministers in succession — Theresa May and Boris Johnson — tried to woo the White House in search of a revived Atlanticism and a fat trade deal. Did Johnson go too far in courting President Donald Trump?Johnson is often compared to Trump, especially in the liberal US media, which sees one blond political buffoon with a salty turn of phrase as being pretty much like another. And yet, the two men’s characters are very different. Britain’s prime minister is a hopeless optimist who dislikes giving friends, colleagues and voters any bad news, and who tends toward a Pollyannaish view that things will turn out alright. Trump’s vision of the world is unremittingly dark. He sees chaos, gloom and betrayal everywhere.Johnson can use populist language, but he does so to invigorate. Trump deploys it to agitate, and there is — as we saw this week — a vast difference.As the democratic world reacted with horror to Wednesday’s insurrection at the Capitol, Johnson tweeted “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress,” adding that “the United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.” The tweet, however, neither named the president nor mentioned his role as chief insurgent. By Thursday’s close of play Johnson shed the coyness and condemned Trump directly for “encouraging people to storm the Capitol.” He said, “For him to cast doubt on a free and fair election, that’s completely wrong.”That leaves the awkward question of why, in the weeks since Joe Biden’s election, Johnson left it so long to use Britain’s status as valued US ally to say something consequential about Trump’s dangerous refusal to go quietly.Accusations of soft pedaling don’t just apply to the British, however. Western governments rarely like to intervene in the internal affairs of an ally, least of all in the domestic politics of a friendly superpower. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel were similarly circumspect as the mayhem in Washington unfolded on Wednesday night, although they at least addressed their remarks to camera. Merkel’s “angry and sad” comment left no doubt that she was personally invested.Johnson’s allies point out that he did hail Biden as the winner of the election within hours of the result, to Trump’s evident anger. Indeed, the divide between Europe’s “progressive” leaders and its more conservative ones on tackling Trump isn’t as clear as you’d think. Macron engineered a friendly three-day state visit for the president in 2018, an event that matched Trump’s audience with Queen Elizabeth II.The disgraceful manner of Trump’s exit shows that the UK and the EU’s “Big Two” of France and Germany should have been far braver in defending democracy. This applies to how they treat other world powers, too. If Merkel is so angry and sad about the scenes in Washington, what about her embrace of China in a lucrative EU investment deal that will do wonders for German industry, and her silence on China’s treatment of Hong Kong?Johnson isn’t really as close to Trump as his enemies suggest. The president cares little for Britain other than his celebrity’s delight at hobnobbing with royalty and his fondness for Scottish golf. The two men had an almighty row about the Chinese telecoms company Huawei, during which Trump slammed the phone down. But Johnson has traded on his relationship with Trump and was thrilled about their joint mission of making leftish liberals miserable.These ties carry a cost now. A host of embarrassing Johnson quotes is being dredged up, including this gem: “If Trump can fix North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal then I don’t see why he’s any less of a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama.” After Johnson’s own shabby treatment of Parliament — he prorogued (suspended) the House of Commons in 2019 to try to unblock Brexit legislation — was vetoed by the British Supreme Court, Trump endorsed “my friend” Boris. The difference is that Johnson did eventually restore the UK’s legislative assembly, while Trump clearly has no regard at all for America’s equivalent institutions. But western leaders need to be aware of how all attacks on democratic bodies tend to look the same.Kim Darroch, who resigned as Britain’s Washington ambassador in 2019 after Johnson had failed to back him in a row over leaked emails critical of the president, said on Thursday that No. 10 “had got a bit too close to the Trump presidency” and was “too warm about Trump’s performance.”Johnson didn’t secure anything concrete from this. The truth is that Trump has been a disappointment to the prime minister. The Conservative right thought the Brexit-loving president might deliver a precious US-UK free-trade agreement to help compensate for loss of access to the EU single market. But the negotiations, particularly over agriculture, were sticky and time ran out. The White House made clear the UK would have to fall into line on its China trade policy.As always, the “special relationship” tilts toward the dominant partner. Britain may end up with an Asia trade deal before we have the delights of eating American chlorinated chicken.Realists in Johnson’s party, who disliked the president’s disregard for allies and friendships with authoritarians, could at least see some merit in Trump’s go-it-alone foreign policy. The deals between Israel and the Gulf Arab states, and the willingness to take on China made a rough-and-ready sense. Even a few idealists were happy to make common cause with Washington over Beijing’s treatment of Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Uighurs.More uncomfortably, there is also a noisy minority of Tories who admire Trump for all the worst reasons, as Paul Goodman, editor of the grassroots ConservativeHome website, admits. He cites “anti-lockdown maniacs (including prominent journalists once close to Johnson), who now claim that Covid doesn’t exist, climate change obsessives who rail not at government policy but scientific fact and conspiracists who babble on about Davos.”While some fret about the influence of these zealots on Johnson’s policy making, he’s never been a natural bedfellow of the loony right. Quite the contrary, he has become an enthusiast for net-zero carbon emissions and has always supported relaxed immigration policy. He has always been an opportunist — his rise to the top depended on it — but on social and environmental policy his instincts are more progressive.One great sadness of what has happened this week is that Trump’s rejection of the democratic verdict and his incitement to violence are doing enormous damage to the West. Moscow, Beijing and Tehran are making hay.“No interference in internal affairs” is the pat diplomatic rejoinder of China and Russia whenever their human rights violations are raised by the West. Our leaders shouldn’t be echoing that line as a cynical excuse for sitting on their hands. Johnson and the others should make it clear they stand shoulder to shoulder with millions of good American democrats — whatever their party allegiance — in a time of trial.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Martin Ivens was editor of the Sunday Times from 2013 to 2020 and was formerly its chief political commentator.

08-01-2021||World||Pakistani PM Imran Khan asks Shiites to bury coal miners killed by IS||Pakistan’s prime minister Friday appealed the protesting minority Shiites not to link the burial of 11 coal miners from Hazara community who were killed by the Islamic State group to his visit to the mourners, saying such a demand amounted to blackmailing the country’s premier.Hundreds of mourners, who despite harsh cold weather have been rallying in Quetta at the miners’ coffins, want Prime Minister Imran Khan to personally visit them to assure their protection. They have vowed they were ready to continue their protest for 100 days if Khan does not accept their key demand.“No premier of any country should be blackmailed like this,” Khan said from Islamabad in televised remarks.Under Islamic tradition, burials take place as quickly as possible after death. But Shiites from Hazara community for the straight sixth day continued their sit-in, refusing to bury the miners who were killed on Sunday after being abducted near the Machh coal field, 48 kilometers (30 miles) east of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan.Khan, speaking from Islamabad in televised remarks, said his government had accepted all of the demands of mourners, except that the dead would be buried when he personally visits them to assure their protection. He said he could travel to Quetta today to meet with the relatives of miners if they bury the miners first.Shiites rejected Khan’s offer, saying their protest will continue.More than 2,000 residents and relatives began their protest after IS militants abducted and then shot and killed the miners in Baluchistan province. Police video of the bodies revealed the miners were blindfolded and had their hands tied behind their backs before being shot.The Sunni IS affiliate claimed responsibility and since then authorities have been raiding militant hideouts to trace and arrest those who orchestrated the killing of miners, although Khan insist Pakistan’s neighbor India was behind the violence in Baluchistan. Khan has not shared any evidence to back up his claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-pm-imran-khan-asks-shiites-to-bury-coal-miners-killed-by-is/story-MDpiXHAzZLt6wi18XnrDsI.html
08-01-2021||World||2020 was Europe’s warmest year on record||2020 was the warmest year in Europe since records began, according to data published Friday by the EU climate monitoring service.Last year topped the previous temperature record in Europe — 2019 — by a whopping 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.72 Fahrenheit), the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said.It said 2020 was also tied with 2016 for the warmest year worldwide, confirming the past decade as the hottest on record.Rising global temperatures are tied to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Chief among them is carbon dioxide, which is released by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.The data showed 2020 was 1.25 C (2.2 F) warmer than during the pre-industrial period from 1850-1900.Scientists say global warming should be capped at 1.5 C (2.7 F) to avert the worst effects of climate change.The Copernicus service noted that some of the highest temperature increases were observed in parts of the Arctic and Siberia, which also had an unusually active wildfire season in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-was-europe-s-warmest-year-on-record/story-k9EKwszjeMsJUYdINPEZVI.html
08-01-2021||World||Japan starts 1st day under emergency steps to curb coronavirus||Japan began its first day under a coronavirus state of emergency Friday with much of life going on as usual, including morning commuter trains shuttling crowds of mask-wearing people at bustling stations.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga reiterated his request for restaurants to shorten business hours and for people to work from home.“We take this very seriously. By all means, I would like to overcome this difficult situation with the cooperation of the people,” Suga told reporters.The emergency runs through Feb. 7. The declaration is asking restaurants and bars to close by 8 p.m. while drinks won’t be served after 7 p.m.It applies to Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa.Nationwide, confirmed Covid-19 cases have reached some 260,000, with more than 7,500 new cases reported Friday.“Infection is the highest ever in every region of the nation,” said Suga.Suga has promised legal revisions, including allowing penalties and other measures to add more force to the requests. They will be studied in parliament later this month.The declaration is expected to have some sway in conformist Japan. Some companies have been resistant to working remotely and the emergency state may help workers assert their wishes to stay home.But much of life will stay the same, with schools, sports events, stores and movie theaters open, but with social distancing and mask-wearing measures. Crowds are expected to thin at night.The previous emergency, declared last April and May, although wider in scope and area, had some effect on curtailing the spread of Covid-19.The number of daily cases in Tokyo have been climbing, reaching a daily record 2,447 Thursday. The goal is to bring them down to 500, according to officials.Like many other Tokyo residents, Kazue Kuramitsu was already pessimistic about how long it might take for things to get back to normal.“From today, we’re basically in a battle for one month. But I don’t think the spread will stop,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-starts-1st-day-under-emergency-steps-to-curb-coronavirus/story-9NhXYcLZd0SybFXY7fdnLM.html
08-01-2021||World||Twitch joins Facebook, Instagram on banning Trump; Twitter allows him back||Popular gaming platform Twitch has banned indefinitely Donald Trump’s official channel on its platform, following the storming of Capitol Hill by supporters of the outgoing US President.“In light of yesterday’s shocking attack on the Capitol, we have disabled President Trump’s Twitch channel,” the company said in a statement according to CNN.“Given the current extraordinary circumstances and the President’s incendiary rhetoric, we believe this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to incite further violence,” the live-streaming platform said.The San Francisco-based company is the latest among social media and tech platforms that have launched a crackdown on Trump after the president’s supporters breached the Capitol Hill building bringing to a halt the congressional debate to certify Electoral College votes of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ win in the November 3 presidential elections. The chaos forced a lockdown and confrontations with police. Several police officers sustained injuries, while one woman was confirmed dead after being shot in the chest.Before the violence, President Trump had falsely told supporters in Washington that the election had been stolen.Facebook on Thursday suspended US President Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely, while Twitter had on Wednesday said Trump’s account will be blocked unless he deletes three tweets.Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, in a post on the social networking website wrote that the account blocks have been placed indefinitely and “for at least two weeks until the peaceful transfer of power is complete.”He pointed out that the risks of allowing the President to continue to use the service during this period are “simply too great.” “We are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete, he wrote. Twitter said Trump’s account will be locked until he deletes three tweets which the company said were. “severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy”. The company later confirmed that his account has been restored after he removed the tweets.It however said that “Any future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.”Trump returned to Twitter with ‘election fraud’ rhetoric”.“My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the legal result. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote; I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to believe that we must defend our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections,” posted Trump on a Twitter video.Conceding his defeat for the first time, he said, “Now Congress has certified election results, a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus is now turning to ensure a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitch-joins-facebook-instagram-on-banning-trump-twitter-allows-him-back/story-R1INJyAVNev8UtHVWyqHDP.html
08-01-2021||World||Indonesia frees radical cleric linked to Bali bombings that killed 202||Indonesian Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the suspected mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, walked free from prison on Friday after serving 10 years for setting up a militant training camp.Authorities said Bashir, 82, who was never convicted of a direct role in the bombings, would enter a deradicalisation programme amid concerns over his continued influence in extremist circles.Photographs showed him dressed in white and wearing a mask as he left the prison in Bogor, south of the capital Jakarta, before being driven to his home at an Islamic boarding school near the city of Solo in Central Java. “Abu Bakar Bashir was released from Gunung Sindur prison at 5.30 a.m.,” Rika Aprianti, a spokeswoman for the corrections department, told reporters.Bashir, 82, who is regarded as the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a jihadist network with ties to al Qaeda, was imprisoned in 2011 for 15 years for his links to a militant training camp in Aceh province.After periodic cuts in his jail term, he served 10 years. Although Indonesian police and intelligence agencies say Bashir was linked to the 2002 Bali attacks and a 2003 attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, he was never convicted of direct involvement and denied any ties.A conviction for being part of a conspiracy to carry out the Bali bombings was later overturned. The Bali bombings killed 88 Australians, and the country has pressed Indonesia to ensure Bashir does not incite more violence.On Friday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Bashir’s release was “very distressing to the friends and families of the Australians, the 88 Australians, who were killed in the Bali bombings”.Thiolina Marpaung, an Indonesian wounded in the 2002 attacks, said she wanted authorities to keep supervising Bashir.“We don’t know what he was doing in prison,” she said by telephone. Bashir pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State in 2014 while in jail.A spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby club in Sydney, which lost its president and five members in the Bali attacks, said Bashir’s release would be difficult. “Some will never forgive, there will be others who will be just angry today,” said Albert Talarico. “Others will stay silent because they don’t wish to have the old wounds opened again.”DERADICALISATION PROGRAMMESome Indonesians defended the release of the cleric, saying he had served his time and was a practising Muslim. “There are many people who discredit Muslims, thinking that we are related to terrorism, but...we are not,” said Asqar Kustiwa, 63, a resident of Depok, near Jakarta.Bashir will undergo a deradicalisation programme, Eddy Hartono of Indonesia’s anti-terrorism agency said in a statement, adding that he hoped the cleric, after his release, “can give peaceful, soothing preachings”.In the wake of the Bali attacks, Indonesia set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI and resulted in scores of suspected militants being arrested or killed.But other extremist groups have since formed and conducted attacks in the world’s biggest Muslim majority country while only last month police arrested 23 militants.Ahead of the release, Abdul Rohim, Bashir’s son, told Reuters his father would return to the Al Mukmin Islamic boarding school, which Bashir founded in the 1970s and whose graduates have been linked to militant networks and attacks.“He has completed his term,” Rohim said. “This is purely over.”JI’s prominence is fading, say analysts, to be replaced by other Islamic State-inspired groups blamed for new attacks.They say Bashir does not wield as much power over JI or other groups, but could still influence other militants.“Bashir is an ideologue, his words will be followed and made examples of,” said analyst Stanislaus Riyanta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-frees-radical-cleric-linked-to-bali-bombings-that-killed-202/story-EdoUERp2T8yKuHM6yrtMLP.html
08-01-2021||World||YouTube removes several videos posted on Trump’s channel||YouTube has removed several videos that US President Donald Trump has posted on his channel and warned that any channel found to be posting three times within 90 days with false claims on US election results will be permanently removed from the Google-owned video platform.The move comes in the wake of the unprecedented storming of the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters on Wednesday and thus disrupting the constitutional process of counting and certification of the Electoral College votes of the presidential elections. Four people, including a woman, died in the clashes between protesters and police.“Over the last month, we’ve removed thousands of videos which spread misinformation claiming widespread voter fraud changed the result of the 2020 election, including several videos that President Trump posted on Wednesday to his channel,” Google said in a statement.“Due to the disturbing events that transpired on Wednesday, and given that the election results have been certified, any channel posting new videos with these false claims in violation of our policies will now receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming,” it said.“Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube,” Google said in its statement.Trump’s YouTube channel has 2.68 million subscribers. Following the violence that erupted at the US Capitol after his supporters stormed the building, YouTube has removed most of his videos from the rally he addressed earlier in the day.YouTube believes that those videos alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 elections violated its policies.YouTube said that grace period was supposed to expire on January 21, after Inauguration Day. But since the election results have been certified, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, the Google -owned video platform says it’s ending the grace period now.Earlier, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that President Donald Trump’s accounts on its popular social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram - would remain suspended until the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on January 20.Announcing the decision, Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing President Trump to continue to use the platform during this period is “simply too great.” This is for the first time probably that Facebook has taken such an extreme step to ban and block the social media handles of a head of the State and that too of the United States.On Wednesday, Twitter also blocked Trump’s account for 12 hours and removed three of his tweets including a video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/youtube-removes-several-videos-posted-on-trump-s-channel/story-hjlUW2xU4WMP5snaShyeaJ.html
08-01-2021||World||UK to use arthritis drug for severely ill coronavirus patients||The UK will start using a Roche Holding AG arthritis drug to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients after a study showed that it reduced mortality and shortened recovery times in intensive care.Some 27% of critically ill patients who got the Roche arthritis drug Actemra or a similar treatment from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. died in the hospital, compared with about 36% of those who didn’t get them, an Imperial College London research team said. Those treated with the medicines were able to be released from the hospital an average of a week earlier, the study found.The findings could have “immediate implications for the sickest patients with Covid-19,” Anthony Gordon, chair in anesthesia and critical care at Imperial, said in a statement. Released in a preprint on Thursday, the results have not yet been peer-reviewed.The study also raised hopes in the UK, which helped fund the research, that using the arthritis medicines will ease the strain as a surge of virus cases swamps its health system. The government will encourage the use of Actemra across the country immediately and is working with Roche to ensure the medicine is available to UK patients, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement.Though drug companies have tested a range of existing treatments against Covid-19, few have proven helpful. The biggest success so far has been dexamethasone, a steroid that has been shown to reduce the risk of death by one-third for patients on ventilators.‘Bit of Optimism’Thursday’s results “injected that bit of optimism we all need” to keep trying with arthritis medicines as well, Martin Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Oxford, said in a statement.Landray helps lead another large study, called Recovery, that helped pinpoint the benefit of dexamethasone and is looking at Actemra as well. Still to be answered are questions of how well the drug works in different types of patients and whether, if given earlier, it might reduce the need for ventilators in the first place, Landray said.Roche will also continue its own studies on Actemra in Covid-19, the Swiss drugmaker said in a statement.In previous studies, Actemra had reduced the need for patients to be ventilated and appeared to help them leave hospitals earlier. Yet, puzzlingly, the drug hadn’t appeared to help reduce deaths. The earlier studies enrolled people who were less sick, Gordon said. “A crucial difference may be that in our study, critically ill patients were enrolled within 24 hours of starting organ support,” he said.After a trial with the other drug, Kevzara, failed in September, Sanofi and Regeneron had said they wouldn’t pursue the treatment further for use in Covid-19.Called REMAP-CAP, the trial reported Thursday assigned patients randomly to a range of potential Covid-19 treatments.

The US is one of the world’s major democracies. I believe that peace & respect for democratic processes will prevail in our host country at this critical time.” Dujarric, responding to questions Thursday on the attack on the Capitol, said Guterres calls on political leaders to impress on their followers the need to refrain from violence and respect the democratic process and rule of law.“It’s a very important message that political leaders need to give to those who listen to them,” he said.He added that the UN had spoken out about risks associated with social media platforms being used to propagate violence and hate speech.“I think it just increases the responsibility of the people who manage those platforms to ensure that they are not misused to do physical harm to people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-official-asks-trump-to-renounce-false-dangerous-narratives/story-DgJ1RZHX6Nvsn6vHF3LlZJ.html
08-01-2021||World||China using proxies to intimidate people across world, says Canadian minister||A Canadian minister has denounced China for “intimidation” of people around the world through Beijing’s state entities or proxies in order to silence dissent, pressure political opponents and instil general fear of state power.In a letter to lawmakers, Bill Blair, Minister of Public Safety responsible for the country’s internal security, said that “foreign states, including the PRC (Peoples Republic of China), attempt to threaten and intimidate individuals around the world, including in Canada, through various state entities and non-state proxies.”That letter was sent in response to a motion moved by the Opposition calling for the government to outline its plans for participation of the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei in Canada’s 5G infrastructure and to table a plan to counter foreign interference.In the letter, as cited by the outlet National Observer, Blair added that the government is “aware that these tactics can also be used as cover for silencing dissent, including on university campuses, pressuring political opponents and instilling general fear of state power, no matter where a person is located.” He mentioned China’s Operation Fox Hunt as “one such example.”Operation Fox Hunt was launched under the direction of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 through the Ministry of Public Security to “target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside China, around the world,” according to Christopher Wray, director of US Federal Bureau of Investigation.Citing Blair’s letter, the outlet Global News said the government was “’particularly concerned’ about giving foreign adversaries control over and access to sensitive technologies, critical infrastructure and the personal data of Canadians.”Blair also noted that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Communications Security Establishment, and Canada Border Services Agency, were engaged in combating such foreign interference.Such interference, the minister said, had worsened after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic as government agencies had “observed state-sponsored information manipulation” with such “campaigns” aimed at sowing “doubt about the origins of the Covid-19 virus and the means required to counter it; discredit responses to Covid-19 while casting their own as superior.”The motion is expected to come up for discussion in the House of Commons once it reconvenes later this month.Earlier, according to a report in the daily Global & Mail, in the strongest public denunciation of China’s bullying of the community in Canada, a spokesperson for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service had said that the “fear of state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both them and their loved ones, in Canada and abroad, can force individuals to submit to foreign interference”. Together, Canada’s spy agency felt, such activities “constitute a threat to Canada’s sovereignty and to the safety of Canadians.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-proxies-to-intimidate-people-across-world-says-canadian-minister/story-1TIk247P39AK7RbTJ2NafI.html
08-01-2021||World||Pandemic leaves many nations facing climate action catch-up in 2021||Less than half of countries that committed to strengthening their climate action targets in 2020 did so by the end of last year, as the pandemic slowed climate diplomacy and efforts to update national plans, a developing-nation group said on Friday.A tracker run by the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) showed 73 nations submitted revised climate plans to the United Nations, meeting a 2020 deadline under the Paris Agreement to tackle global warming.That was about 45% of the 160 nations that had earlier said they intended to submit plans - called nationally determined contributions - last year.Of those that filed updated plans, 69 made more ambitious climate commitments, either to step up efforts to cut planet-heating emissions, adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas, or both.They included Britain, European Union nations, many Latin American governments and some small island states, as well as a handful of African and Southeast Asian countries.The 48-member CVF said Brazil, North Korea, Japan and New Zealand had submitted updated climate action plans, but these lacked a higher level of ambition.Saleemul Huq, a Bangladeshi academic who chairs the CVF’s expert advisory group, said the low number of 2020 submissions showed the 2015 Paris accord - which stipulates national plans should be strengthened every five years - had “failed its first and most important test”.He urged governments to show “real climate ambition that communities will benefit from” in 2021 as their economies start to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.The 57 countries that in 2020 submitted stronger targets to cut their climate-changing emissions accounted for just 13% of global emissions, the CVF said.The 66 countries that committed to do more to adapt to a warmer planet, meanwhile, are home to 1.67 billion people, just over a fifth of the global population of 7.8 billion, it said.“I think we have seen the process get started, but then there is a huge amount to be done this year,” said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute.Before the global upheaval caused by the coronavirus crisis, 190 countries that submitted climate action plans under the Paris accord were due to revise those contributions in 2020, to ensure they added up to meeting the goals of the agreement.Those include keeping global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5C above pre-industrial times.But the world has already heated up by just over 1C and is on track for at least 3C of warming this century, the United Nations has said - a clear sign more ambition is needed.Lockdowns due to the pandemic forced the British hosts of the 2020 annual UN climate summit, known as COP26, to postpone it. The talks are now set to take place in November 2021.The delay, combined with uncertainty over US climate action, after President Donald Trump pulled his country out of the Paris deal, has caused some countries, including China and other big emitters, to hold back on finalising their own plans.Britain and countries in the European Union, however, did in December commit to stronger emissions reductions targets for 2030, Waskow noted.Britain said it would cut its emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, while EU states agreed to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, substantially toughening an existing 40% target.“They have raised the bar and shown what it is that major economies - and especially developed countries ... need to do,” Waskow told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office later this month and has vowed to swiftly rejoin the Paris accord and convene leaders of major emitting countries during his first 100 days in office, to push for more ambitious climate pledges.POOREST STEP UPAnna Schulz, head of the global climate law, policy and governance programme at the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, noted eight out of the world’s 46 poorest countries submitted stronger climate plans by 2020.A further 11 are expected to do so soon, despite technical and financial barriers worsened by the pandemic, she said.The plans completed so far, by Cambodia, Ethiopia, Senegal, Rwanda, Nepal and other countries, contain “really exciting increases” in planned emissions cuts, either overall or by including new economic sectors and activities, she added.“This is, of course, despite the fact that they are the most vulnerable to climate change and the least responsible” for it, she said, noting the least-developed countries want to lead by example and do their part to meet the 1.5C warming goal.They are also raising their game on adaptation, she noted, with Nepal, for example, helping local governments come up with tailored plans for their regions.Zambia outlined measures to protect its six watersheds, make better use of its water and promote climate-smart farming to boost food security.Bangladesh, meanwhile, cited its “Delta Plan 2100”, which aims to tackle flood and drought risks in hotspots along its major rivers and coastlines.Adaptation action includes everything from building higher embankments against floods to moving coastal communities to safer locations, capturing rainwater to irrigate land and switching to more drought-tolerant crops.Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Netherlands-based Global Center on Adaptation, said the fact that more countries had so far improved targets to build climate resilience than set goals for deeper emissions cuts showed “governments are more serious about adaptation than ever before”.“The climate emergency has clearly arrived,” he said.His organisation is convening a virtual global summit on adaptation on January 25-26, to galvanise high-level political will - and funding - to expand efforts to help people adjust to worsening floods, droughts and storms, and rising sea levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-leaves-many-nations-facing-climate-action-catch-up-in-2021/story-Twtl9lkYzcOk3t1Z1SHsMN.html

Taking on Twitter, the outspoken entrepreneur behind Tesla Inc. and SpaceX gave a very underwhelming response.“How strange,” Musk wrote on in response to a tweet by Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley. In the following tweet, he wrote, “Well, back to work.”Musk is known for his witty, sometimes controversial tweets which has often made the headlines. In May this year, Tesla lost $14 million in valuation hours Musk tweeted, “Tesla stock price is too high imo”.In 2018, Musk tweeted that he was thinking about taking the company private. The shares of the Tesla soared by more than six per cent while the tweet cost him his role as chairman.As per Bloomberg report, the South Africa-born engineer’s net worth was $188.5 billion at 10:15 am in New York, $1.5 billion more than Bezos, who has held the top spot since October 2017.Along with Tesla, Musk also owns SpaceX which is a rival to Bezos-owned Blue Origin LLC, in the private space race.Over the past year his net worth soared by more than $150 billion in possibly the fastest bout of wealth creation in history.Fueling his rise was an unprecedented rally in Tesla’s share price, which surged 743% last year on the back of consistent profits, inclusion in the S&P 500 Index and enthusiasm from Wall Street and retail investors alike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-strange-says-elon-musk-as-he-becomes-world-s-richest-person/story-p3zj6ZJ5pNpr6oBSvUo5PJ.html

This act of sedition, stoked by Donald Trump, is a threat to our country and to every American’s rights and wellbeing. It must not be tolerated,” said Ajay Bhutoria, national finance committee member of Biden 2020, and one of the vice chairs of the Presidential Inauguration Committee.He asserted that the scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect the true America.“The United States of America built the most powerful economy in the world in no small part due to the stability of our government and the peaceful transfer of power we have enjoyed for generations,” he said.Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF) in a statement condemned in the strongest terms the assault on the Capitol by “extremists” in a misguided attempt to overturn the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.“Violence has no place in democratic protest. Disinformation intended to sow distrust in our democratic processes has no place in a democracy. We strongly denounce those who encouraged and enabled this violence,” SALDEF executive director Kiran Kaur Gill said.The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) also condemned the violence, chaos, and anarchy that unfolded at the US Capitol building on Wednesday.It was a sad day for America and for democracy at large, it said in a statement. “Hindu Americans are uniquely attune to the foundations of and threats to democracy, as many of us trace our heritage to the Republic of India, the world’s largest democracy. Hindu values and ideals are American values and ideals and the bonds between our people, our commitment to freedom, equality, and representative democracy remain unshaken,” the HAF said.The Alliance to Save and Protect America from Infiltration by Religious Extremists and Coalition of Americans for Pluralism in India condemned the presence of Indian tricolour by rioting mobs at the Capitol Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-groups-condemn-attack-on-us-capitol/story-pf1gDQrQpwBCwIlW2PE70L.html
08-01-2021||World||‘Please take it,’ Singapore PM says after getting Covid-19 vaccine||Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, and urged others to take the jabs in a country that has largely brought the pandemic under control. Unlike other mass vaccination programmes in the United States and Britain, Singapore is administering the jabs having largely eradicated the disease and has reported only a handful of local cases in recent months.The government has said its studies show nearly 60% of residents are willing to be vaccinated. But the plans have stirred rare hesitancy among some due to the low risk of infection in the island nation and concern about any possible side effects from rapidly developed vaccines.“It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer too, so please take it when you can,” Lee, 68, said after receiving the jab at a local hospital.Singapore has only approved Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine but has said it has secured enough doses for its 5.7 million population including from other vaccine-makers like Moderna and Sinovac. The city-state did some initial vaccinations of frontline workers at the end of December. But Lee said broader vaccinations of healthcare staff would start on Friday, with the elderly to follow next month, and vaccines to be available to all residents by year end at the latest. “We got vaccinated early to show Singaporeans we are confident that the vaccine is safe and effective,” Lee said in a Facebook post, adding that he had been vaccinated alongside the country’s top health official, Kenneth Mak, and “felt fine”. The vaccinations are voluntary but authorities have said they will consider relaxing travel restrictions for people who have been vaccinated against the disease which has killed around 1.9 million people globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/please-take-it-singapore-pm-says-after-getting-covid-19-vaccine/story-WcJRbwDbgYCMhzGXJl7WsO.html

The protesters were demanding that presidential election result be overturned.In a statement posted on Twitter, Michelle described Trump as “infantile and unpatriotic” as she said, “the day was a fulfillment of the wishes” of a President “who can’t handle the truth of his own failures. “She also suggested that the protesters would have been treated differently had they been Black. “This summer’s Black Lives Matter protests were an overwhelmingly peaceful movement... And yet, in city after city, day after day, we saw peaceful protesters met with brute force.” In contrast, those who “desecrated the center of American government” this week “were led out of the building, not in handcuffs, but free to carry on with their days,” she said.Also Read | US Congress certifies Joe Biden’s win: The who’s who of president-elect’s cabinet“Yesterday made it painfully clear that certain Americans are, in fact, allowed to denigrate the flag and symbols of our nation. They’ve just got to look the right way,” she also said.Further noting that true progress can only be possible once “we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it,” she wrote, “That also means coming to grips with the reality that millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn our democracy down for his own ego.”Michelle also called on Silicon Valley which is home to many startups and global technology giants like Apple, Facebook and Google, to address its role and ban Trump from its platform for fuelling insurrection.“Now is the time for Silicon Valley companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior - and go even further than they have already by permanently banning this man from their platforms and putting in place policies to prevent their technology from being used by the nation’s leaders to fuel insurrection, “ she said.On Wednesday thousands of protesters - spurred on by a speech given by President Donald Trump - marched to the seat of the US legislature, where some broke down barriers and doors to invade the building in an unprecedented act that played out on live television. But police officers in charge of security held off using tear gas until intruders had reached the heart of the building, where they roamed freely, ransacking offices.The scene stood in stark contrast to last year’s anti-racism protests in the nation’s capital and beyond, which saw demonstrators forcibly dispersed by police, and the National Guard regularly deployed as an early preventive measure. During the Wednesday’s protests, National Guard reinforcements did not arrive until several hours into the chaos despite public knowledge of the protests.Following this, many Americans have accused authorities overseeing Wednesday’s underwhelming response of “double standards.”(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michelle-obama-breaks-silence-on-us-capitol-violence-calls-trump-infantile-and-unpatriotic/story-rwvzwQeWUXoERHV7NBPkKJ.html
08-01-2021||World||US Congress certifies Joe Biden’s win: The who’s who of president-elect’s cabinet||The United States Congress, in the early hours of January 7, officially announced Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next US president and vice president respectively. The confirmation means January 19 will be president Donald Trump’s final day in the White House, with the Biden-Harris duo set to be sworn-in the next day.Since he was announced as the president-elect by the US media in November, Biden has announced his nominees for several key portfolios. Except for the vice president, who is elected alongside the president, the cabinet nominees are appointed only after confirmation by the US Senate. Here’s a look at some of the nominees announced by Joe Biden:1. Antony Blinken (secretary of state): A former deputy national security advisor and deputy secretary of state, Blinken was nominated by Biden as the incoming secretary of state on November 23, 2020. Blinken will succeed incumbent Mike Pompeo, who is the 70th person to hold this office.2. Janet Yellen (secretary of treasury): A former chairperson of the US Federal Reserve, and the first woman in that post, Yellen was nominated by Biden on November 30, 2020. If confirmed, Yellen will also be the first female secretary of treasury of the US. She will succeed the incumbent and 77th treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin.3. Lloyd Austin (secretary of defense): Nominated on December 8, 2020, Austin served as the 12th commander of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), of which he was the first black commander. He also served as the 33rd vice chief of staff of the US Army. If confirmed, he’ll be the 28th secretary of defense, and the first African-American to hold the position. He will succeed Christopher Miller, who has been serving in an acting capacity since November 2020 after Trump’s sacking of Mark Esper.4. Merrick Garland (attorney general): On January 7, 2021, Biden announced Garland as his pick for attorney general. Garland’s nomination came on a day Biden himself was officially certified as president-elect. Garland will succeed acting attorney general Jeff Rosen who took over after William Barr, the 85th attorney general, resigned.5. Alejandro Mayorkas (secretary of homeland security): The department of homeland security will get its first full-time occupant since April 2019 when Mayorkas takes over the position. Announced as nominee on November 23, 2020, Mayorkas will be the seventh secretary of homeland security.6. Deb Haaland (secretary of interior): Nominated on December 17, 2020, Haaland will be the first native American to head the department of interior, and the first native American cabinet secretary. She will succeed David Bernhardt, who has been serving in acting capacity since April 2019.Other names announced by Biden include Tom Vilsack (secretary of agriculture), Gina Raimondo (secretary of commerce), Marty Walsh (secretary of labour), Jennifer Granholm (secretary of energy) etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-certifies-joe-biden-s-win-the-who-s-who-of-president-elect-s-cabinet/story-BVM3kbQeM67NXcnSJOhlTN.html
08-01-2021||World||Japan faces steep test to contain coronavirus spread in just a month||Japan’s second state of emergency is set to last a month, but public health experts have already expressed doubts that four weeks is enough time to sufficiently slow the coronavirus that’s spreading at an alarming rate.With residents increasingly facing virus fatigue and no legal framework to force compliance, the country could struggle to quickly turn the trend of infections downward, experts say. Japan has reported new daily records in the past two days, especially around the capital of Tokyo.“I’m not sure if the situation can become better within a month,” Hitoshi Oshitani, a professor of virology at Tohoku University and a member of the expert panel advising the government, told Bloomberg News. “It’s certainly much more difficult to control the current situation compared to the outbreak in summer.”Japan has enacted a more limited emergency this time, mainly aimed at shortening restaurant hours and encouraging remote work. The measures for now only apply to the capital of Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures. Movie theaters, gyms, karaoke parlors and theme parks, all of which closed during the emergency last spring, are set to stay open with reduced hours, while large events will still be allowed with reduced capacity.Regions under the emergency will need to emerge from “Stage 4,” the highest government designation for the pandemic, for the status to be lifted. The stages look at factors such as medical capacity, the number of patients, the test positivity rate and the weekly increase in new infections. Experts will continually examine the data to determine which areas meet which stages, they said.Shigeru Omi, the head of the panel of experts advising the government who said early this week it would be “next to impossible” for Japan to emerge from the emergency in a month, shifted his tone when he briefed the press together with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga Thursday.“It’s not very easy,” Omi said, “but I believe it’s possible to reduce the infections to a Stage 3 level within a month, if everybody does their best.” Omi said people needed to follow the suggested measures to stay home and avoid nighttime dining and drinking, but it’s been a tough task keeping the younger people out of such venues, where the virus has been spreading throughout the pandemic.Forthcoming legal changes, which will include the ability to fine establishments that refuse closure requests as well as formalize payments for cooperation, would also be needed, he added. The government will seek to amend related legislation when the Diet resumes on January 18.The emergency Japan enacted last spring began with a declaration for seven prefectures. That was later expanded nationwide, and the duration extended, before being lifted in stages toward the end of May.Japan, which had won early praise for its ability to contain the virus without strict lockdowns, saw challenges emerge to its strategy of “living with the virus” as winter approached. Cases began increasing nationwide in November, and have surged in the past week, particularly in the regions near Tokyo. Leaders in other regions, including industrial heartland Aichi and business hub Osaka, have already suggested they may also need to request an emergency declaration as cases surge.Tokyo FailureThe country has struggled to enlist public cooperation the same way it did in spring. Officials have fretted that concern over the virus was dropping, while many bars and restaurants, already pushed to the edge over the past year, may be reluctant to cooperate with requests to close.The severe situation in Tokyo is likely due to its failure to enact stricter measures earlier in December, Oshitani said. Areas including Osaka and Hokkaido requested restaurants to close as early as 9 p.m., or to close completely, as the month is a high season for drinking and dining, with social groups and workplaces holding traditional year-end parties.“In December, Tokyo could not implement aggressive measures -- that’s probably why we’re seeing the increasing trend, particularly in the Tokyo metropolitan area,” Oshitani said. “It was important to implement more aggressive measures in December because of the party season.”Although Tokyo authorities asked for people to avoid these celebrations, the effect was limited. Data from the virus task force showed that while footfall in entertainment districts in Osaka and Hokkaido fell sharply after requests to close, traffic actually rose in Tokyo.Oshitani said he was hopeful that as January and February tend to be quiet social periods in Japan, people will heed the calls to stay home and slow the virus spread.“I believe we can still manage to control the situation,” he said. “It totally depends on people’s behavior change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-faces-steep-test-to-contain-coronavirus-spread-in-just-a-month/story-tRZomNr9T5LDb9D4Zj4cVP.html
08-01-2021||World||Faced with removal and prosecution, Trump owns up defeat, slams Capitol raiders||President Donald Trump on Thursday finally acknowledged publicly that a “new administration” will be taking office shortly as calls grew for his removal from office and a top federal prosecutor said the president’s incendiary remarks to his supporters before they stormed the Capitol will be a part of an investigation into this shocking attack on US democracy.“Now, Congress has certified the results, and new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth orderly and seamless transition of power,” Trump said in a two-and-a-half-minute video in which he also condemned the attack on Congress, essentially to distance himself from his supporters who carried it out to prevent it from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. On Wednesday, he had told them he loved them.Five people died in the hours-long assault on the seat of US democracy that had forced Vice-President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification process, his family, who were also there, and lawmakers to take shelter wherever they could behind furniture and under desks.Badly outnumbered, security personnel had withdrawn, yielding full control of the premises to the rioters clad in Trump campaign gear and carrying his flag, and those of the confederacy.The outgoing president’s long overdue acknowledgement of his electoral defeat came hours after his supporters’ failed attempt to prevent the certification of Biden’s election, and amidst calls from top Democrats for his ouster, purely a punitive move to end his term just 12 days short of its expiry on January 20.“I join the Senate Democratic leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the vice-president and cabinet do not act, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment. That is the overwhelming sentiment of my caucus - and the American people by the way,” Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives told reports on Capitol Hill.She added: “By inciting sedition as he did yesterday, he must be removed for office. While there’s only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show for America.”But Pence was elusive. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer complained to reporters separately he and Pelosi had tried to call Pence to tell him to invoke the 25th amendment of the American constitution, which empowers the cabinet to remove the president for being “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. But the vice-president did not take their call as, it was reported later, he is not convinced of the judiciousness of the move given the chaos in the White House and the administration.Trump’s role in the attack on Congress will be part of a sprawling investigation that is underway to identify and prosecute the rioters. Asked if federal agents and prosecutors will look at the incendiary statements by speakers at a rally Trump’s addressed shortly before the mob set forth for the Capitol, interim US attorney for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, told reporters on a briefing call: “Yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building, but… were there others that maybe assisted or facilitated or played some ancillary role in this. We will look at every actor and all criminal charges.” Trump had explicitly incited participants at the rally to march to Congress, promising to walk along with them — which he didn’t — to cheer lawmakers speaking in support of his election fraud claims. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump had told his supporters, referring to the certification process. “And we’re probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them because you never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.”Rudolph Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, had called for a “trial by combat” at that rally. And the president’s eldest son, Don Trump Jr, had called for a “message (to be sent) to all the Republicans who have not been willing to actually fight, the people who did nothing to stop the steal”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faced-with-removal-and-prosecution-trump-owns-up-defeat-slams-capitol-raiders/story-VPCorETyesTvpPgzOPeXLK.html
08-01-2021||World||Chinese city sealed off to squash coronavirus outbreak||China has sealed off a large city near Beijing, cutting transport links and banning millions of residents from leaving, as authorities move to stem the country’s largest Covid-19 outbreak in six months.The pandemic has so far broadly been brought to heel by Chinese authorities since its emergence in Wuhan in late 2019, with small outbreaks swiftly snuffed out with mass testing, local lockdowns and travel restrictions.Around 100 new Covid-19 cases have been discovered in the past week in Shijiazhuang, a city of several million in Hebei province whose surrounding areas take the total population to 11 million.All vehicles and residents were banned from leaving the city and train services suspended, authorities announced late Thursday. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed residents being swabbed by medical workers in hazmat suits at community centres in Shijiazhuang while queues outside stretched around the block. Virus control staff stood guard at highways entering the city, which had mostly been blocked by barricades, the images released on Thursday showed.Hebei province reported 33 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Friday in addition to 51 from the day before -- pushing the nationwide daily total to the highest figure in five months.

It also triggered massive outrage among the leaders as Democrats mulled Trump ouster.The President condemned the violence, saying rioters had defiled the seat of American democracy and must be held accountable. This came a day later when Trump had told his supporters, “We love you. You’re very special,” as he urged them to go home after they broke into the Capitol.Thousands of protesters supporting US President Donald Trump breached the security of the US capitol late on Wednesday night as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. The protesters demanded the result to be overturned as they ransacked the Capitol building which houses both House of Representatives and the Senate.Here is who all have resigned so far:Members of White House National Security CouncilAs per Reuters’ report, four officials from White House National Security Council including Erin Walsh, senior director for African affairs; Mark Vandroff, senior director for defense policy; Anthony Rugierro, senior director for weapons of mass destruction; and Rob Greenway, senior director for Middle Eastern and North African affairs have resigned form their own respective posts.US Education Secretary Betsy DeVosOne of Trump’s most stalwart supporters, DeVos submitted her resignation on Thursday. She was among the longest-serving members of his administration. She was appointed to the cabinet in 2017.Transportation Secretary Elaine ChaoAlong with DeVos, Chao was also among the most loyal supporters of President Trump. She resigned on Thursday over the Capitol violence. She is married to Republican Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “It was “a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,” she said earlier on Thursday.Mick Mulvaney, the US special envoy for Northern Ireland and the former acting White House chief of staffHe has submitted his resignation on Thursday effective from Friday. Earlier speaking to the US television, Mulvaney said, “I can’t stay here, not after yesterday. You can’t look at that yesterday and think I want to be a part of that in any way, shape or form.” “Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in,” he also said.Deputy national security adviser Matthew PottingerA former journalist and one of Trump’s devoted loyalists, Pottinger resigned on Wednesday. He was appointed to the position in September 2019 and was the leading figure in the development of Trump’s China policy.Acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Tyler GoodspeedGoodspeed stepped down from his post on Thursday in the wake of violent protests. He was appointed to the council in May of 2019. With, Goodspeed leaving the department, the council is left with zero members.Deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce Department John CostelloCostello announced his departure in a blistering tweet, writing, “yesterday’s events were an unprecedented attack on the very core of our democracy - incited by a sitting president.”Chief of staff and press secretary to first lady Stephanie GrishamTop aide of First Lady Melania Trump, Grisham resigned hours after the chaos unfolded on late Wednesday night. “It has been an honour to serve the country in the White House.

08-01-2021||World||US role as democracy's champion battered by assault on Capitol||The United States will find it harder to advocate for democracy and rule of law abroad after the assault on the US Capitol unless it grapples with President Donald Trump's role in the violence, current and former US diplomats said.After a rally where the president exhorted them to fight to overturn the Nov. 3 US election that he lost, hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing legislators to evacuate as they smashed windows and looted.Scenes of lawmakers cowering and police officers with guns drawn seeking to protect them undercut the image Washington has long projected as a champion of democracy despite its past interference in the politics of nations such as Guatemala, Iran and South Vietnam.In a memo to staff on Thursday, a senior State Department official said, "As voices around the world attempt to use yesterday's events to discredit our efforts to defend democracy and human rights abroad, we must firmly reject that view.""Political leaders from across the spectrum in our country unequivocally denounced the violence yesterday," Michael Kozak, the acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, wrote in the memo, which was read to Reuters."The thugs who overran Congress" did not keep it from certifying that Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump, Kozak said, adding that the Republican president "affirmed that our nation will have an orderly transition to a new administration on Jan. 20."Serving and former US diplomats, however, said the note put the best face on events and failed to address what they saw as Trump's incitement of the violence, his initial failure to condemn it, and his repeated false assertions of victory."This was an undemocratic assault against one of the citadels ... of our democracy promoted by people who sent them up there, like the president of the United States, his lawyer and his son making incendiary statements," a senior US diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity."It's not just the assault of the mob. It's what preceded it, what caused it," he added. "We have to be honest about this ... not just repeat the standard talking points."A former senior US diplomat said Washington's ability to convince others of the virtues of democracy rested, in part, on embodying them itself. "It was easier to do that a week ago than it is today," the former diplomat said.Asked to comment on the memo, and on the views of the current and former diplomats, a State Department spokesperson said: "We do not comment on purportedly leaked internal communications."After falsely claiming Thursday morning that the election was stolen, Trump on Thursday evening acknowledged that Biden will be the next president and called the attack "heinous." A day earlier, in a video taped in the White House Rose Garden and posted on Twitter as protesters stormed the Capitol, Trump told them to "go home," adding, "...we love you, you're very special."Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said foreign leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping would exploit the assault on the Capitol to assert the superiority of their autocratic systems."Putin and Xi Jinping push the supposed stability of their dictatorships over the messiness of democracy," he said. "What happened yesterday is going to be Exhibit A in their case for a long time."In fact, China's state media, in editorials on Friday, said the storming of the US Capital reflected a failure of leadership, with the Global Times calling it a sign of "internal collapse" in the US political system.Roth, along with the serving and former US diplomats, argued that a key test for the United States would be how it handles Trump's actions and whether he is held accountable or punished."Our message to the world has never been that we're perfect. It's that we have a system that is capable of correcting its imperfections," said Democratic Representative Tom Malinowski.A former top U.S. human rights diplomat, Malinowski said he supported impeaching Trump "precisely because we need to show the American people, first and foremost, but also the rest of the world that nobody in this country is above the law."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-officer-dies-from-injuries-in-riot-by-trump-supporters/story-8ZEsxXVWePRVVr9u1lqz9J.html

08-01-2021||World||Joe Biden picks Boston mayor Marty Walsh as labor secretary||President-elect Joe Biden announced Thursday that he has chosen Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to be his labor secretary, selecting a former union worker who shares Biden’s Irish-American background and working-class roots.Walsh, 53, has served as the Democratic mayor of Boston since 2014. When he took the oath of office in 2018 for his second term as Boston’s chief executive, Biden presided over the inauguration. Biden made the announcement hours after Walsh’s selection was confirmed by two people familiar with the president-elect’s decision. The people spoke on condition of anonymity before Biden’s formal announcement.Biden planned to introduce the newest additions to his economic team to the public at an event Friday in Wilmington, Delaware.“This team will help us emerge from the most inequitable economic and jobs crisis in modern history by building an economy where every American is in on the deal,” he said in a statement. “They share my belief that the middle class built this country and that unions built the middle class.”Biden also announced that he has tapped Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo to be commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California small-business advocate, to lead the Small Business Administration.Walsh was a state representative for more than a decade before becoming mayor.Walsh, a former union worker, has a long history with labor. He served as president of Laborers Local 223 and, before becoming mayor, headed up the Boston Building Trades — a union umbrella organization.At Walsh’s second mayoral inauguration, Biden praised him for his character and efforts to create a thriving middle class, calling him a “man of extraordinary character in a moment when we need more character and incredible courage.”“We’re at a moment when mayors and governors matter more than they ever did,” Biden said at the event. “We need leaders who will stand up against the ugly divisiveness spewing out of Washington every day.”During his tenure as mayor, Walsh has overseen the city’s ongoing rejuvenation, which has led to challenges that include gentrification and rising housing costs.He’s also grappled with the city’s history of racial tensions to try to make the city more welcoming for people of all backgrounds.Most recently, Walsh has helped lead the city through the ongoing coronavirus pandemic with its myriad challenges, from helping maintain local businesses to ensuring widespread testing for the coronavirus to figuring out how to maintain access to public schools.Walsh and Biden share an Irish American background.Last year, Biden videotaped a message for the city’s annual St. Patrick’s Day breakfast. The event pulls together the state’s top elected officials, Democrats and Republicans, to enjoy Irish music and food — and cringe-worthy jokes.“We Irish, as you know, we’re dreamers, yet we’re realists. We’re spiritual, yet we are doubters. We are compassionate, yet we’re demanding. Everything in us runs deep: sadness and joy, heartache and hope, fortitude and faith,” Biden said in his message last year. “We are the only people on earth who are always nostalgic for the future.”The son of Irish immigrants, Walsh grew up in a triple-decker in Boston’s working-class Dorchester neighborhood. As a child, he survived a four-year bout with Burkitt lymphoma starting when he was 7.Walsh said one of the toughest things about his cancer treatment was losing his hair, which he said was red at the time and hard to match for a wig. He later recalled how someone living on the top floor of the three-family home clipped a bit of his hair and came back later with an identical red wig.Walsh has also been forthcoming about his early struggles with alcohol and has used his history with addiction to encourage others to seek help. He began his speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention by saying: “Good evening. My name is Marty Walsh, and I’m an alcoholic.”“On April 23, 1995, I hit rock bottom. I woke up with little memory of the night before and even less hope for the days to come,” he said at the time. “Everybody was losing faith in me, everybody except my family and the labor movement.”His nomination was praised by union leaders Thursday.Mary Kay Henry, international president of the Service Employees International Union, said Walsh brings a “pro-worker vision” to the Labor Department that is badly needed and called him a “champion for working people.”AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Walsh will be an “exceptional” labor secretary who understands that collective bargaining will combat inequality, beat COVID-19 and expand opportunities for immigrants, women and people of power.“From the Boston Building and Construction Trades Council to the Massachusetts State House to the mayor’s office to his own personal journey with overcoming addiction, Marty Walsh has always been a fighter who understands the power of working people standing together for a better life,” Trumka said.Walsh’s union history has led to some awkward moments as mayor, including when two former Walsh aides were charged with bullying music festival organizers into hiring union workers.Kenneth Brissette, the city’s former director of tourism, and Timothy Sullivan, who was chief of intergovernmental affairs, were convicted in federal court in 2019 of conspiring to extort the organizers of the Boston Calling music festival by withholding city permits.A federal judge later tossed the convictions, saying the government failed to prove the existence of a quid pro quo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-picks-boston-mayor-marty-walsh-as-labor-secretary/story-DqKVkuhsXSmjz23LpGJ9LM.html
08-01-2021||World||Donald Trump prepares pardon list for aides and family, and maybe himself||President Donald Trump has prepared a sweeping list of individuals he’s hoping to pardon in the final days of his administration that includes senior White House officials, family members, prominent rappers -- and possibly himself, according to people familiar with the matter.Trump is hoping to announce the pardons on Jan. 19 -- his final full day in office -- and his ideas are currently being vetted by senior advisers and the White House counsel’s office, the people said.The biggest question facing his legal team may be whether the president has the authority to pardon himself, as he has discussed in recent weeks with top aides, according to the people familiar with his conversations. Trump has previously claimed the power, though it’s a matter of legal dispute and has never before been attempted by a president.A self-pardon could also prove a major political liability and hamstring another presidential bid, with opponents sure to suggest the self-pardon amounted to an admission that he thought he might be prosecuted for breaking the law.Preemptive pardons are under discussion for top White House officials who have not been charged with crimes, including Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, senior adviser Stephen Miller, personnel chief John McEntee, and social media director Dan Scavino.The president’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, who both hold White House positions, are also under consideration, the people said. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has also discussed the issue of a pardon with the president.Preemptive pardons are also under consideration for other members of the president’s family, as well as friends and allies. For instance, Trump has floated a preemptive pardon for Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News host who is dating his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.The president wants the preemptive pardons to shield recipients from prosecutions for any federal crimes committed before the pardons were issued.He’s also considering a traditional pardon for Albert Pirro, who previously worked with the president on real estate deals and was convicted of tax fraud. Pirro is the ex-husband of Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, a former district attorney of Westchester County in New York.Celebrity PardonsTrump is similarly considering pardoning celebrities including rapper Lil Wayne -- with whom he posed for a photo during the presidential campaign --as well as rapper Kodak Black, who is serving time for falsifying paperwork to obtain a firearm.Other prominent celebrities including rapper Lil Yachty and Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson have publicly lobbied Trump to pardon Kodak Black, who said in a now-deleted tweet that he would donate $1 million to charity if the president freed him.Trump’s list is currently being vetted by lawyers who are concerned that pardons could create new allegations of obstruction of justice for members of the administration. The process is being managed in part by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.While some of the proposed pardons have moved through the legal steps needed inside the White House, the idea of a self-pardon is far less developed, the people say, and so far only at the discussion stage.Shielding TrumpA self-pardon could shield Trump from prosecution over a myriad of issues his political opponents have suggested could be worthy of prosecution, from his federal income tax filings to hush money payments to an adult film star to his inaugural committee’s spending at venues owned by the Trump family.Some Democrats have continued to say Trump should face legal scrutiny over the Russian interference campaign during the 2016 election, despite Special Counsel Robert Mueller finding no evidence the president colluded with the Kremlin. And in recent days, Trump has drawn scrutiny over his effort to pressure officials in Georgia to overturn the results of the presidential election there, as well as inciting what became a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.The Constitution says that a president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” That sprawling authority is seen as absolute by some, though a Department of Justice legal opinion from 1974 stated that “the president cannot pardon himself,” because of what it described as a “fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case.”Brian Kalt, a professor at Michigan State University College of Law who has written extensively about self-pardons, said it’s not clear whether the president can do it.“The main argument in favor of the self-pardon power is that the Constitution does not expressly rule it out, and that the pardon power is extremely expansive,” he said.“The argument against self-pardonability starts with the idea that granting a pardon is, by definition, something one can only do to another person,” Kalt said. “There is also a general principle in the law against being the judge in one’s own case.”Ford and NixonTrump would not be the first person to issue pardons preemptively, though the action is rare. Gerald Ford did so for Richard Nixon only a month after his resignation over the Watergate scandal, granting him a “full, free, and absolute pardon” for offenses he “has committed or may have committed or taken part in” during his entire term as president.Trump’s pardoning power only extends to federal crimes, meaning he could not protect himself or his family from legal trouble on the state level. New York Attorney General Letitia James had opened a civil fraud inquiry into the president’s businesses while Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance is pursuing a criminal investigation.Trump has already issued pardons to several political allies and friends, including in the weeks since he lost re-election.Among those pardoned in recent days were Trump’s 2016 campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who’d been convicted of financial crimes and illegal lobbying, and Charles Kushner, the real estate developer and father of the president’s son-in-law. The elder Kushner was convicted of charges that included preparing false tax returns and witness retaliation.(Updates with politics of self-pardons, in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-prepares-pardon-list-for-aides-and-family-and-maybe-himself/story-vCvH4imniJjz7rUFCvrvMJ.html

Immunisation drives are currently underway in several countries, with most countries having cleared the vaccine of America’s Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE, as well as that of Moderna, another American firm. The vaccine developed by British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, in collaboration with Oxford University, too, has been granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by several countries.Here are some latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccination front:1. A second pan-India dry run will be carried out on Friday, after the first phase was conducted on January 2. The first vaccination dry run of any kind in India was carried out on December 28 and 29 across four states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab. India has granted EUA to AstraZeneca-Oxford University’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech International Limited’s Covaxin. The vaccines are likely to be rolled out across the country next week.Also Read | 2nd vaccination dry run across the country today: All you need to know2. Officials in Brazil, the world’s third worst-hit country, on Thursday announced that the vaccine candidate developed by China’s Sinovac was found 78% effective in a late-stage trial in the South American nation. Officials further said detailed results will be submitted to the country’s health regulator, Anvisa, to seek EUA for the vaccine. Brazil is yet to clear a vaccine against Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage3. Spain’s health minister Salvador Illa on Thursday said the country will receive its first batch of Moderna’s vaccine in the next seven-10 days. In the coming six weeks, Illa said, Spain will receive 600,000 doses of the vaccine. Spain has already authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has distributed 744,000 doses thus far.4. South Africa, the worst-affected country in Africa, will procure 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for its health workers, its government announced on Thursday.The first 1 million doses will be delivered later this month, with the next 500,000 to arrive in February, health minister Zwelini Mkhize said. This will also be South Africa’s first purchase of a Covid-19 vaccine.5. America’s Novavax Inc disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday an advanced agreement had been signed by Australia to purchase 51 million doses of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine. Australia can purchase up to an additional 10 million doses, with the initial delivery expected by mid-2021, the company said.6. Mexico’s government on Thursday said it had sent two top officials, including the country’s deputy health minister, to Argentina for “urgent discussions” over Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine. Argentina rolled out the vaccine on December 29. Mexico, on the other hand, has rolled out Pfizer’s vaccine. Both countries have also authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccination-second-pan-india-dry-run-today-chinese-vaccine-found-78-effective-in-brazil/story-7iy0ZmQSDoZh5FoVQCrU8I.html
08-01-2021||World||Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine appears effective against mutation in new coronavirus variants: Study||Pfizer Inc and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine appeared to work against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in the UK and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker.The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein.The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralization elicited by the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer’s top viral vaccine scientists.The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.“So we’ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact. That’s the good news,” he said. “That doesn’t mean that the 17th won’t.”Dormitzer noted another mutation found in the South African variant, called the E484K mutation, is also concerning.The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the UK and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new variants, particularly the one that emerged in South Africa.Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa “has a number additional mutations” that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc , which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-appears-effective-against-mutation-in-new-coronavirus-variants-study/story-2amszwqKLtQih15gkEdKgJ.html

We need to find every single case now,” Young added.While several cases of the variant have been found in travellers in hotel quarantine, the cleaner is the first person to be infected with it in Australia.Authorities believe the woman, aged in her 20s, was infectious from January 2. She tested positive after showing symptoms on Wednesday.Her diagnosis ends almost four months of no locally acquired infections in Queensland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-city-on-lockdown-over-uk-variant-case/story-7CoP5sSoIs9hS8b8awPnFO.html
08-01-2021||World||Donald Trump returns to Twitter as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg bans him for ‘fanning the flames’||US President Donald Trump returned to Twitter on Thursday with a video acknowledging that Joe Biden would be the next US president as other social media services including Facebook Inc blocked his accounts over concerns that his messages might spark further violent protests. Twitter unlocked the president’s @realDonaldTrump Twitter account, which has 88 million followers, after Trump removed three rule-breaking tweets. His first post back on the platform featured a video in which he said he was focused on a peaceful transition of power and which was viewed 1.4 million times within 15 minutes of posting.Tech companies have been scrambling to crack down on the president’s baseless claims about the Nov. 3 US presidential election after hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in unrest that resulted in four deaths.Trump’s accounts remain blocked on Facebook and Instagram for at least two weeks and perhaps indefinitely. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Thursday post that the risks of allowing him to use the platform were “simply too great.” Facebook’s move marked the most significant sanction of the president by a major social media company. Live-streaming platform Twitch and photo-sharing service Snap Inc issued similar bans. “The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg said in his Facebook post.White House spokesman Judd Deere said in response that the companies had censored the president at a critical time for the country. “Big Tech is out of control,” he said. Zuckerberg said the block on Trump’s Facebook page, which has 35 million followers, would last at least until Biden takes office on Jan. 20. At an all-hands meeting on Thursday, Zuckerberg told employees he considered it important political leaders “lead by example and make sure we put the nation first.”“What we’ve seen is that the president has been doing the opposite of that and instead fanning the flames of those who think they should turn to violence to overturn the election outcome,” he said, according to audio of the remarks heard by Reuters.Social media companies have been under pressure to police misinformation about the US election on their platforms, including from the president. Trump and his allies for months have amplified baseless claims of election fraud and the president told protesters to go to Capitol Hill, with both Republicans and Democrats saying he was responsible for the resulting violence. Amazon.com Inc’s Twitch disabled Trump’s channel due to the “extraordinary circumstances and the president’s incendiary rhetoric,” it said. A spokeswoman said the company would reassess Trump’s account after he leaves office. E-commerce platform Shopify shut service for stores affiliated with Trump for violations of its “acceptable use” policy, prompting e-commerce sites for both the campaign and the Trump Organization to go offline.BLOCKS ‘LONG OVERDUE’Facebook’s decision follows bans in recent years of some government officials in India and Myanmar for promoting violence. A Facebook spokesman said the company had never before blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state. In a video posted to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube on Wednesday, which was later deleted by the platforms after garnering millions of views, Trump repeated election fraud claims as he told protesters to go home.Civil rights groups including Color of Change have called for social media companies to ban Trump permanently from the platforms, where he has repeatedly violated policies.The Anti-Defamation League praised Facebook’s move, calling it “an obvious first step,” while the NAACP in a statement said the move was a “long overdue” gesture that “rings hollow.”Facebook has drawn criticism for exempting politicians’ posts and ads from its third-party fact-checking program and repeatedly said it does not want to be “the arbiter of truth.” The company has in recent months started labeling some of Trump’s statements but faced questions about why it had not acted sooner against violent rhetoric that proliferated in the past few weeks as organizers planned the rally online.Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement he was “deeply frustrated that it took a group of domestic terrorists storming the Capitol” for Facebook to take action and wondered “if the decision was an opportunistic one, motivated by the news of a Democratically controlled Congress.”Democratic Senator Mark Warner, incoming chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the social media actions did not go far enough.“These platforms have served as core organizing infrastructure for violent, far right groups and militia movements for several years now – helping them to recruit, organize, coordinate and in many cases (particularly with respect to YouTube) generate profits from their violent, extremist content,” he said in a statement. YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc’s Google, said Thursday any channel that posts videos with false claims about the election results will be temporarily restricted from uploading or live streaming. YouTube did not respond to a question about whether it would ban Trump’s account in the same manner as Facebook, while a Twitter spokesman said it was continuing to “evaluate the situation in real time, including examining activity on the ground and statements made off Twitter.” He said Twitter would inform the public if an “escalation” in its approach was necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-returns-to-twitter-as-facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-bans-him-for-fanning-the-flames/story-d1NZ1whtZpQiioACzxCWOM.html
08-01-2021||World||US Capitol chaos: Donald Trump faces calls for removal, possible impeachment after violence||President Donald Trump faced the threat on Thursday of a second impeachment, a day after his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in a stunning assault on American democracy as Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.As Democratic leaders demanded his ouster, Trump came closer than he ever has to a formal concession, acknowledging a new administration would be sworn in on Jan. 20 and vowing to ensure a “smooth transition” in a video released on Thursday evening.The president condemned Wednesday’s violence, saying rioters had defiled the seat of American democracy and must be held accountable.Just a day earlier, Trump had told supporters: “We love you. You’re very special,” as he urged them to go home after they broke into the Capitol.In his remarks on Thursday, the president said: “We have just been through an intense election, and the emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled and calm restored.“We must get on with the business of America,” Trump, a Republican, added, adopting a conciliatory tone seldom seen from the mercurial president.The statement was a stark reversal for Trump, who has spent months insisting he prevailed in the Nov. 3 election, alleging widespread fraud despite no evidence. As recently as Thursday morning, when he issued a statement via an aide, Trump was still claiming the election had been stolen.In the video, he defended his efforts to challenge the election in court, saying his goal was to “ensure the integrity of the vote.”But his exhortation on Wednesday to thousands of supporters that they march to the Capitol to protest the election results whipped up a mob that overran police officers and invaded the Capitol building, forcing members of Congress into hiding for their own safety.The violence claimed four lives, including a woman among the demonstrators who was shot by authorities. After reports that a Capitol Police officer had died, the agency issued a statement saying they were inaccurate.The top Democrats in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, called on Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s Cabinet to use the U.S. Constitution to remove Trump for “his incitement of insurrection.”The 25th Amendment allows a majority of the Cabinet to remove a president from power if he is unable to discharge the duties of the office.But a Pence adviser said the vice president, who would have to lead any such effort, was opposed to using the amendment to oust Trump from the White House.NEW IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS?If Pence fails to act, Pelosi signaled she would likely reconvene the House to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump for his role in Wednesday’s violence. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, whose committee would likely draft any articles of impeachment, voiced his support earlier on Thursday.It was not clear whether House Democrats would have enough time to initiate and complete impeachment proceedings, with less than two weeks remaining in Trump’s term. Aides to Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, did not comment on the statement by Pelosi and Schumer.The Democratic-led House impeached Trump in December 2019 after he pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, but the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him of charges of abusing his power and obstructing Congress.A handful of Republicans joined calls for Trump’s removal. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, seen as a leading voice of the Republican establishment, called on Trump to resign on Thursday evening.Several members of Trump’s administration, including Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and McConnell’s wife, resigned as a symbolic gesture against the violence.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also submitted her resignation, citing Trump’s rhetoric before the assault on the Capitol, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday night.Congress formally certified Biden’s election victory early on Thursday, after authorities cleared the Capitol. More than half of House Republicans and eight Republican senators voted to challenge the election results, backing Trump.Biden blamed Trump for the attack but stopped short of calling for his ouster.“He unleashed an all-out assault on the institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was but the culmination of that unrelenting attack,” Biden said at a news conference to announce his selection for U.S. attorney general, federal appeals Judge Merrick Garland.After Trump posted several messages about the demonstrations on Wednesday, Facebook Inc said it would ban Trump posts until Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Twitter Inc suspended Trump’s account for 12 hours.The president has increasingly isolated himself in the White House, relying on a small group of diehard loyalists and lashing out at Pence and others who dare to cross him, four sources said.A source familiar with the situation said Trump in recent weeks had discussed the possibility of pardoning himself. The White House declined comment. Constitutional scholars have said it is unclear whether the presidential pardon power can be used in that way.Trump faces potential state legal actions when he leaves office, including a criminal probe in New York, that would not be covered by a federal pardon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-chaos-donald-trump-faces-calls-for-removal-possible-impeachment-after-violence/story-zuY1EDy6sq7XLRFFwGTgsI.html
08-01-2021||World||Mike Pompeo angers China with Hong Kong threat, plan to send envoy to Taiwan||Washington may sanction those involved in the arrest of over 50 people in Hong Kong and will send the US ambassador to the United Nations to visit Taiwan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday, drawing anger and the threat of retaliation from Beijing.Pompeo said he was also “appalled” by the arrest of an American citizen in Wednesday’s crackdown and added: “The United States will not tolerate the arbitrary detention or harassment of US citizens.”Pompeo’s statement came after a day of turmoil in Washington that saw supporters of President Donald Trump storm Congress in a bid to overturn his November election defeat. Trump finally conceded on Thursday that Joe Biden, who is due to be sworn in on Jan. 20, will be the next US president. [nL1N2JI0JOEditorials in China’s state media on Friday said the attack on the Capitol reflected a failure of leadership as well as the deep divide in American society and accused US politicians of “double standards.”“In Hong Kong, violent actions are described as a ‘beautiful sight,’ in the US, people involved in this chaos are called ‘mobs’,” said The Global Times, a tabloid run by the People’s Daily, the newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.Hong Kong police arrested 53 democracy activists in dawn raids on Wednesday in the biggest crackdown on dissent since China imposed a security law last year.Among those detained was American lawyer John Clancey, who was allowed to leave a police station along with some others on Thursday.Pompeo called the arrests an “outrage and a reminder of the Chinese Communist Party’s contempt for its own people and the rule of law.”“The United States will consider sanctions and other restrictions on any and all individuals and entities involved in executing this assault on the Hong Kong people,” Pompeo said.He said it would also “explore restrictions against the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the United States, and take additional immediate actions against officials who have undermined Hong Kong’s democratic processes.”Pompeo also announced that Kelly Craft, Washington’s U.N. ambassador, would visit Chinese-claimed and democratically run Taiwan, a highly symbolic trip as the island is not a U.N. member due to the objections of Beijing, which views Taiwan as a wayward province.“Taiwan shows what a free China could achieve,” he said.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Pompeo’s comments represented a serious interference in the country’s internal affairs.“China will take all necessary steps to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,” Hua told reporters. “The United States must pay a heavy price for its mistakes.”In a later statement, China’s mission to the United Nations called on Washington “to stop its crazy provocation” and warned that “whoever plays with fire will burn himself.”Taiwan welcomed Craft’s visit, which will be the first of a sitting US ambassador at the U.N. to the island, saying it demonstrated strong US support for Taiwan’s international participation.Day of turmoilUS lawmakers called the attack on Congress an embarrassment to US democracy that would play into the hands of rivals, and deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, a leading figure in the development of Trump’s China policy, was among a list of officials who quit in protest.“They’re high-fiving in Beijing,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, told Tucker Carlson on the Fox News channel. “It kind of bolsters their claim that we’re falling apart and they’re the country of the future.”Trump has pursued hardline policies towards China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus and relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when he ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.His administration has already imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for crushing Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and other alleged rights abuses.After a series of actions against Chinese firms, US officials were expected to discuss a proposed expansion of an executive order banning investment in companies with alleged ties to China’s military at a Thursday afternoon meeting, two people familiar with the matter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-angers-china-with-hong-kong-threat-plan-to-send-envoy-to-taiwan/story-B1wNEaxainLEY0zr3Syx2J.html
08-01-2021||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un vows to improve ties with outside world at party meeting||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un underscored the need to drastically improve his nation’s ties with the outside world as he addressed a major political conference for the third consecutive day.State media said Kim also reviewed relations with rival South Korea but didn’t elaborate on what steps he said he wanted to take. Observers had expected Kim to use the first congress of the ruling Workers’ Party in five years to send conciliatory gestures toward Seoul and Washington as he faces deepening economic troubles at home.In his speech on the third day of the meeting Thursday, Kim “declared the general orientation and the policy stand of our party for comprehensively expanding and developing the external relations,” the Korean Central News Agency said Friday.Kim also examined relations with South Korea “as required by the prevailing situation and the changed times,” KCNA said.The congress is the party’s top decision-making body which review past projects, lay out new priorities and reshuffle top officials. This month’s congress was convened as Kim is struggling to overcome what he calls “multiple crises” caused by an economy battered by pandemic-related border closings, a series of natural disasters and US-led sanctions.In his opening-day speech, Kim admitted his previous economic developmental plans had failed and vowed to lay out a new five-year development plan. On the second day of the meeting, he said he would bolster his country’s military capability.The congress comes as Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump has remained stalled for about two years because of disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. President-elect Joe Biden, who is to take office on Jan. 20, has called Kim a “thug” and is unlikely to hold any direct meeting with him unless North Korea takes serious steps toward denuclearisation.Ties between the Koreas once flourished after Kim entered talks with Trump. But Pyongyang halted exchanges with Seoul and resumed harsh rhetoric against it after Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in early 2019 collapsed over Trump’s rebuttal of Kim’s push for sweeping sanctions relief in return for a limited denuclearization step.Some observers say North Korea is frustrated because Seoul has failed to break away from Washington and revive stalled joint economic projects held back by the US-led sanctions. They also speculate North Korea initially thought South Korea would help it win sanctions relief but got upset after Kim returned home empty-handed from the 2019 summit with Trump.Experts say North Korea may reach out South Korea first to promote reconciliation mood before pushing for talks with the Biden administration. The stalled Kim-Trump diplomacy began after South Korean officials met Kim in early 2018 and conveyed to Washington his intent to deal away his nuclear programme in exchange of economic and political benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-vows-to-improve-ties-with-outside-world-at-party-meeting/story-T89cQklGOprntVC74cSs7H.html

08-01-2021||World||Hurt feelings, anger linger after Mike Pence, Donald Trump clash||They were never a natural fit, the straight-laced evangelical and the brash reality TV star. But for more than four years, President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence made their marriage of political convenience work.Now, in the last days of their administration, each is feeling betrayed by the other. It’s part of the fallout from an extraordinary 24-hour stretch in which Pence openly defied Trump, Trump unleashed his fury on the vice president, and a mob of violent supporters incensed by Trump’s rhetoric stormed the Capitol building and tried to halt the peaceful transfer of power.The Trump-Pence relationship is “pretty raw right now,” said one top GOP congressional aide, who described multiple phone calls in which Trump berated Pence and tried to pressure the vice president to use powers he does not possess to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Pence, for his part, was left feeling “hurt” and “upset” by the episode, according to people close to him. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.Also Read | ‘Heinous attack left me outraged’: Trump condemns Capitol violence, concedes defeatPence’s decision to publicly defy Trump was a first for the notoriously deferential vice president, who has been unflinchingly loyal to Trump since joining the GOP ticket in 2016. Pence has spent his tenure defending the president’s actions, trying to soothe anxious world leaders put off by Trump’s caustic rhetoric, and carefully avoiding the president’s ire.He has taken on some of the administration’s most high-pressure projects, including leading its response to the coronavirus. And he has stood by Trump even as the president leveled baseless allegations of voter fraud and refused to concede the election after his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Under normal circumstances, the vote-tallying procedure that began on Wednesday would have been a mere formality. But after losing court case after court case, and with no further options at hand, Trump and his allies zeroed in on the congressional tally as their last chance to try to challenge the race’s outcome.In a bizarre interpretation of the law, they argued that the vice president had the unilateral power to reject Electoral College votes supporting Biden. The Constitution makes clear that only Congress has that power.The effort effectively turned Pence into a scapegoat who could be blamed for Trump’s loss if the vice president refused to go along with the plan. Trump and his lawyers spent days engaged in an aggressive pressure campaign to force Pence to bend to their will in a series of phone calls and in-person meetings, including one that stretched for hours on Tuesday.When Pence, who consulted with his own legal team, constitutional scholars and the Senate parliamentarian, informed Trump on Wednesday morning that he would not be going along with the effort, the president “blew a gasket,” in the words of one person briefed on the conversation.Not long after, Trump took the stage in front of thousands of his supporters at a “Stop the Steal” rally, where he urged them to march to the Capitol and continued to fan false hopes that Pence could change the outcome.“If Mike Pence does the right thing we win the election,” Trump wrongly insisted. He repeatedly returned to Pence throughout his speech as he tried to pressure the vice president to fall in line.But Trump already knew what Pence intended. And as Trump spoke, Pence released a letter to Congress laying out his conclusion that a vice president cannot claim “unilateral authority” to reject states’ electoral votes. He soon gaveled into order the joint session of Congress where his and Trump’s defeat would be cemented.Not long after that, members of Trump’s rally crowd arrived at the Capitol, where they overwhelmed police, smashed windows, occupied the building and halted the electoral proceedings. Pence was whisked from the Senate chamber to a secure location, where he was held for hours with staff as well as his wife and daughter, who had been there to support him.Trump did not call to check in on his vice president’s safety during the ordeal and instead spent much of Wednesday consumed with anger over Pence’s action, tweeting, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”Later, members of the mob outside the Capitol were captured on video chanting, “Hang Mike Pence!”For allies of Pence, it was a deeply upsetting episode that put the vice president in danger after four years of unstinting loyalty to the president and left Pence himself feeling hurt.“I just think he’s had enough,” said John Thompson, who served as Pence’s campaign spokesman and and also worked for the Republican Governors’ Association.“Yesterday just really pulled on his heartstrings,” Thompson said. “He’s been this loyal individual and the president was asking him to break the law and act outside his constitutional duties. I think it just reached a boiling point and the vice president said, ‘I’ve had enough.’”Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma told Tulsa World, “I’ve never seen Pence as angry as he was today.”“He said, ‘After all the things I’ve done for (Trump),’” Inhofe added.Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal Trump adviser, also came to Pence’s defense, tweeting that his action was “a profile in courage.”It remains unclear how the dynamic between Trump and Pence will play out over the next two weeks and how long the president will hold his grudge. The White House declined to discuss Trump’s thinking, but allies said Pence intends to spend the next two weeks focused on the transition.He is also expected to attend Biden’s inauguration.And while Pence had been banking on his close relationship with the president to propel him to top-tier status if he decides to run for president in 2024, allies said they didn’t think the vice president’s actions this week would have long-term consequences, even if some voters blame him for Trump’s defeat.“I thought that was a very courageous moment for him,” Thompson said. “And I think that’s going to help his future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurt-feelings-anger-linger-after-mike-pence-donald-trump-clash/story-Xc0I44WA5d7A4wdZO8kirO.html
08-01-2021||World||Boeing will pay USD 2.5 billion to settle charge over 737 Max||Boeing will pay USD 2.5 billion to settle a Justice Department investigation and admit that employees misled regulators about the safety of its 737 Max aircraft, which suffered two deadly crashes shortly after entering airline service.The government and the company said Thursday that the settlement includes money for the crash victims’ families, airline customers and a fine.Prosecutors said Boeing employees gave misleading statements and half-truths about safety issues with the plane to the Federal Aviation Administration, then covered up their actions.“Boeing’s employees chose the path of profit over candor,” said David Burns, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s criminal division.Boeing blamed two former pilots who helped determine how much training was needed for the Max. CEO David Calhoun said their conduct doesn’t reflect Boeing employees as a whole or the character of the company.“This is a substantial settlement of a very serious matter, and I firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations,” Calhoun said in a memo to employees.The government will drop the criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the US after three years if Boeing follows the terms of the settlement.The settlement removes uncertainty about criminal charges against the iconic US aircraft maker, which is struggling to put the Max crisis behind it. Boeing still faces lawsuits by the families of passengers who died in the crashes, it has lost more than 1,000 orders for the Max, and its once-stellar reputation for engineering has suffered.Boeing began working on the Max in 2011 as an answer to a new, more fuel-efficient model from European rival Airbus. Boeing admitted in court filings that two of its technical pilot experts deceived the FAA about a flight-control system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, that could point a plane’s nose down if sensors indicated the plane might be in danger of an aerodynamic stall — that it might fall from the sky.The system was not part of previous 737 models. MCAS was added because the Max’s larger engines, which are mounted higher and farther forward on the 737’s low-swept wings, gave the plane a tendency to tilt too far nose-up in some conditions.Boeing downplayed the significance of MCAS and didn’t mention it in airplane manuals. Most pilots didn’t know about it.The first airlines began flying the 737 Max in mid-2017. On Oct 29, 2018, a Max operated by Indonesia’s Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea. The FAA let the Max keep flying, and on March 10, 2019, another Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed nearly straight down into a field. In all, 346 people were killed.On both flights, MCAS was activated by a faulty reading from a single sensor. The system repeatedly pushed the planes’ noses down, and pilots were unable to regain control.After the planes were grounded worldwide, Boeing changed MCAS so that it always uses two sensors, along with other changes to make the automated system less powerful and easier for pilots to override. The FAA ordered other changes, including the rerouting of some wiring to avoid potential dangerous short-circuiting.In November, the FAA approved Boeing’s changes, and several carriers including American Airlines have resumed using the planes.Under the settlement announced Thursday, Boeing will pay a USD 243.6 million fine, USD 1.77 billion in compensation to airlines that were unable to use their Max jets while they were grounded, and USD 500 million into a fund for the families of passengers who were killed in the crashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-will-pay-usd-2-5-billion-to-settle-charge-over-737-max/story-kx2orx7z0GLY5CSv7hR5zI.html
08-01-2021||World||‘Will ensure smooth transition of power’: Trump concedes defeat, condemns Capitol violence||With 13 days left in his term, President Donald Trump finally bent to reality on Thursday amid growing talk of trying to force him out early, acknowledging he’ll peacefully leave after Congress affirmed his defeat.Trump led off a video from the White House by condemning the violence carried out in his name a day earlier at the Capitol. Then, for the first time, he admitted that his presidency would soon end — though he declined to mention President-elect Joe Biden by name or explicitly state that he had lost.“A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Trump said in the video. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”Also Read | Capitol police chief quits after pro-Trump mob overruns buildingThe address, which appeared designed to stave off talk of a forced early eviction, came at the end of a day when the cornered president stayed out of sight in the White House. Silenced on some of his favorite internet lines of communication, he watched the resignations of several top aides, including a Cabinet secretary.And as officials sifted through the aftermath of the pro-Trump mob’s siege of the US Capitol, there was growing discussion of impeaching him a second time or invoking the 25th Amendment to oust him from the Oval Office.The invasion of the Capitol building, a powerful symbol of the nation’s democracy, rattled Republicans and Democrats alike. They struggled with how best to contain the impulses of a president deemed too dangerous to control his own social media accounts but who remains commander in chief of the world’s greatest military.“I’m not worried about the next election, I’m worried about getting through the next 14 days,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s staunchest allies. He condemned the president’s role in Wednesday’s riots and said, “If something else happens, all options would be on the table.”Also Read | Trump condemns violence at US Capitol ‘in strongest possible terms’: SpokeswomanDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared that “the president of the United States incited an armed insurrection against America.” She called him “a very dangerous person who should not continue in office. This is urgent, an emergency of the highest magnitude.”Neither option to remove Trump seemed likely, with little time left in his term to draft the Cabinet members needed to invoke the amendment or to organize the hearings and trial mandated for an impeachment. But the fact that the dramatic options were even the subject of discussion in Washington’s corridors of power served as a warning to Trump.Fears of what a desperate president could do in his final days spread in the nation’s capital and beyond, including speculation Trump could incite more violence, make rash appointments, issue ill-conceived pardons — including for himself and his family — or even trigger a destabilizing international incident.The president’s video Thursday — which was released upon his return to Twitter after his account was restored — was a complete reversal from the one he put out just 24 hours earlier in which he said to the violent mob, “We love you. You’re very special.” His refusal to condemn the violence sparked a firestorm of criticism and, in the new video, he at last denounced the demonstrators’ “lawlessness and mayhem.”As for his feelings on leaving office, he told the nation that “serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime” while hinting at a return to the public arena. He told supporters “that our incredible journey is only just beginning.”Just a day earlier, Trump unleashed the destructive forces at the Capitol with his baseless claims of election fraud at a rally that prompted supporters to disrupt the congressional certification of Biden’s victory. After the storming of the Capitol and the eventual wee-hours certification of Biden’s win by members of Congress, Trump released a statement that merely acknowledged he would abide by a peaceful transfer of power on Jan. 20.The statement was posted by an aide and did not originate from the president’s own Twitter account, which has 88 million followers and for four years has been wielded as a political weapon that dictates policy and sows division and conspiracy.Trump couldn’t tweet it himself because, for the first time, the social media platform suspended his account, stating that the president had violated its rules of service by inciting violence. Facebook adopted a broader ban, saying Trump’s account would be offline until after Biden’s inauguration.Deprived of that social media lifeblood, Trump remained silent and ensconced in the executive mansion until Thursday evening. But around him, loyalists headed for the exits, their departures — which were coming in two weeks anyway — moved up to protest the president’s handling of the riot.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao became the first Cabinet member to resign. Chao, married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of the lawmakers trapped at the Capitol on Wednesday, said in a message to staff that the attack “has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.”Others who resigned in the wake of the riot: Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger, Ryan Tully, senior director for European and Russian affairs at the National Security Council, and first lady Melania Trump’s chief of staff Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary.Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff-turned-special envoy to Northern Ireland, told CNBC that he had called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “to let him know I was resigning. ... I can’t do it. I can’t stay.”And Mulvaney said that others who work for Trump had decided to remain in their posts in an effort to provide some sort of guardrails for the president during his final days in office.“Those who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they’re worried the president might put someone worse in,” Mulvaney said.Mulvaney’s predecessor in the chief of staff job, retired US Marine Corps general John Kelly, told CNN that “I think the Cabinet should meet and have a discussion” about Section 4 of the 25th Amendment — allowing the forceful removal of Trump by his own Cabinet.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined Pelosi in declaring that Trump “should not hold office one day longer” and urged Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to act. But Chao’s departure may stall nascent efforts to invoke the amendment.Staff-level discussions on the matter took place across multiple departments and even in parts of the White House, according to two people briefed on the talks. But no member of the Cabinet has publicly expressed support for the move — which would make Pence the acting president — though several were believed to be sympathetic to the notion, believing Trump is too volatile in his waning days in office.In the West Wing, shell-shocked aides were packing up, acting on a delayed directive to begin offboarding their posts ahead of the Biden team’s arrival. The slowdown before now was due to Trump’s single-minded focus on his defeat since Election Day at the expense of the other responsibilities of his office.Most glaringly, that included the fight against the raging coronavirus that is killing record numbers of Americans each day.Few aides had any sense of the president’s plans, with some wondering if Trump would largely remain out of sight until he left the White House. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany read a brief statement in which she declared that the Capitol siege was “appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way.”But her words carried little weight. Trump has long made clear that only he speaks for his presidency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-condemns-capitol-violence-says-the-heinous-attack-left-him-outraged/story-jkVomvi1dlfdg2RKNKwuOP.html

Violence erupted in the normally solemn home of the US legislature after hundreds of protesters seeking to overturn Trump’s election loss swarmed the building in Washington.“The woman is Ashli Babbitt, a 14-year veteran, who served four tours with the US Air Force,” San Diego TV station KUSI reported, citing the woman’s husband.“She was a strong supporter of President Trump,” the report added, saying the woman was from the San Diego area in southern California.Washington police confirmed a death, but have not identified the deceased nor offered details on the circumstances of the shooting, which is now under investigation.She was shot amid chaotic and violent scenes inside the Capitol building, where some security personnel drew their guns as protesters advanced.She died shortly after being wounded, Washington police said without elaborating.TV channel Fox 5 reported Babbitt owned a business in San Diego with her husband, who did not come with her to Washington.“I really don’t know why she decided to do this,” her mother-in-law reportedly told the station.Babbitt identified herself as a veteran on her Twitter account and noted her love for the US.

08-01-2021||World||Facebook, Twitter shut down Prez||All it took for Twitter and Facebook to temporarily bar US President Donald Trump from addressing his audience was a violent insurrection at the US Capitol, fuelled by years of false statements.On Wednesday, the two companies temporarily suspended Trump from posting on their platforms after a mob of his supporters stormed the Congress. It was the most aggressive action either company has yet taken against the outgoing US president. Twitter locked Trump out of his account for 12 hours and said that future violations could result in a permanent suspension. The company required the removal of three of Trump’s tweets, including a short video in which he urged those supporters to “go home” while also repeating falsehoods about the integrity of the election. Trump’s account has deleted those posts.Facebook and Instagram will extend a ban on Trump’s accounts, chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said, saying risk of his posts is “too great”. Zuckerberg said the ban will last “for at least the next two weeks” but could remain locked indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-twitter-shut-down-prez/story-I3QgRg9FnT8kFCq77IkugM.html
08-01-2021||World||‘Banana republic’: Shock, dismay for ex-presidents||Every living former US president on Wednesday denounced the violence of a mob that stormed the Capitol building in Washington, DC.George W Bush called out fellow Republicans for fuelling an “insurrection”, likening the situation to a “banana republic”.“I am appalled by the reckless behaviour of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions and our law enforcement,” Bush’s statement said. Barack Obama also blamed Republicans and Donald Trump, “who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election”, he said in a statement. Trump’s most recent predecessor called the incident “a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation”. “But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise,” Obama said, calling the events of the day “the consequences” of Trump and his supporters refusing to accept the results of last year’s election. Bill Clinton denounced the riot as “unprecedented assault” on the US Capitol and the nation itself. “Today we faced an unprecedented assault on our Capitol, our Constitution, our country,” the Democratic former president said. “The match was lit by Donald Trump and his most ardent enablers, including many in Congress, to overturn the results of an election he lost.”And the oldest member of the exclusive club, 96-year-old Democrat Jimmy Carter, said he was “troubled” by Wednesday’s scenes, which he called a “national tragedy”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/banana-republic-shock-dismay-for-ex-presidents/story-yapZlItxFjTygOOCSn16pO.html
08-01-2021||World||Cabinet could remove Trump before term-end||The storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump on Wednesday has prompted calls by several lawmakers to remove him from office before President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on January 20.US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday called on Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution to immediately remove Trump from office, saying that if he does not act, Congress should impeach the President. “What happened at the US Capitol yesterday was an insurrection against the United States, incited by the President,” Schumer said. “If the vice president and the Cabinet refuse to stand up, Congress should reconvene to impeach the president,” he added. A source said there have been some preliminary discussions among some Cabinet members and Trump allies about invoking the 25th Amendment. Democratic lawmakers also circulated articles of impeachment, Representative David Cicilline said. “I am circulating Articles of Impeachment that @RepTedLieu, @RepRaskin and I have prepared to remove the President from office following yesterday’s attack on the U.S. Capitol,” Cicilline said on Twitter.There are two ways to remove a president from office: the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution and impeachment followed by a Senate conviction. In either scenario, Vice-President Pence would take over until Biden’s inauguration. For the Amendment to be invoked, Pence and the majority of Trump’s Cabinet would need to declare that Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency and remove him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cabinet-could-remove-trump-before-term-end/story-i8iJqDD3gyqYq3xEaRvtMI.html
08-01-2021||World||Ignited state of America||US Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory in the early on Thursday morning, hours after it was stormed, assaulted, and occupied by supporters incited by President Donald Trump’s false and baseless claims of poll fraud, in a shocking attack on democracy that has been described as an insurrection and was watched with horror around the world.Vice-President Mike Pence, who presided over the joint session of congress to certify the election, declared Biden had won the electoral college at 3:41am (2.11pm IST), bringing down the curtain on his boss’s flagrant disregard of democratic norms. Trump, whose Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts were suspended, issued a statement shortly after through a White House social media account, saying, “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.” It took the outgoing president more than 60 days to concede defeat in the November 2020 presidential election, during which time he and his allies filed and lost more than 60 lawsuits, sought and lost many full and partial recounts, denied Biden’s team routine transition access, and, finally, incited a most shocking assault on American democracy, breaching the home of US Congress for the first time since 1812, when it was attacked by the British during a war.Lawmakers returned to the session escorted by heavily armed security personnel from a mélange of agencies, some armed with long guns, late Wednesday evening to resume the largely ritualistic constitutional process to grant Biden’s victory one final affirmation, that had been suddenly interrupted by Trump’s marauding supporters who had forced their way into the Capitol, overpowering security personnel by their sheer numbers. They reached deep inside the building, forced lawmakers to shelter in place under desks and in rooms. Many of them broke furniture to use them as clubs to protect themselves against the rioters.One woman was killed in clashes that broke out between the insurrectionists and security personnel, and three people died of medical emergencies on the Capitol grounds, several people were injured, including law enforcement personnel, and dozens were taken into custody.The rioters had been driven out of the building by late evening.But even though a nighttime curfew came into effect at 6pm, the mobs, though thinned down, continued to loiter menacingly around the complex, hurling invectives at police.“To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices, and to threaten the safety of duly elected officials is not protest,” President-elect Biden said in remarks to the nation,as the horrifying assault unfolded on live TV coverage around the world. “It is insurrection. The world is watching — and like so many other Americans, I am shocked and saddened that our nation, so long a beacon of light, hope, and democracy has come to such a dark moment.” Former President George W Bush, a Republican, also decried the mob action as an “insurrection”, as did other leading Republicans such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Mitt Romney, also a 2012 presidential nominee.Calls began to be raised shortly for Trump to be impeached, even if there were just two more weeks left of his term, or be removed from office under the 25th Amendment of US Constitution, which empowers the federal cabinet to sideline the president finding him unfit to govern.Leading legal experts such as Lawrence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, told CNN that Trump had “engaged in inciting sedition”.The world watched, and reacted, with horror. “Distressed to see news about rioting and violence in Washington DC. Orderly and peaceful transfer of power must continue. The democratic process cannot be allowed to be subverted through unlawful protests,” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Disgraceful scenes in US Congress. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a close Trump ally, wrote in a tweet.Similar statements of shock and outrage flowed from capitals of other US allies and partners.The rioters had marched to the Capitol from a rally nearby where Trump railed against his election defeat, attributing it, once again without proof, to fraud and cheating. And then he called on them to march on the Capitol, promising to walk with them.“We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women,” Trump told his cheering supporters, referring to the certification process. “And we’re probably not going to be cheering, so much for some of them because you’re never going to take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.”Trump was seething at the time. Pence had just told him, according to reports, that he will not overturn Biden’s election during the certification process. In a statement that was issued just as he reached Congress, the Vice-President said: “It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.” Trump still kept calling for Pence to come through, and then he sent off the mob, whipped up and angry by false claims that he was robbed of his re-election.But he did not accompany them, as he promised. He went back to the White House to watch the mayhem he unleashed on TV. The President seemed pleased by the what he saw, reportedly, and ignored repeated pleas by aides to condemn the assault and called off his supporters.Men and women carrying Trump’s campaign flags, a flag of the confederacy -- which fought to continue slavery but lost — and the national flag, roamed the corridors of the Capitol at will, entering rooms and chambers not open to outsiders.They made it to the well of the senate and one of them posed for pictures siting in the senate President’s seat, which was occupied by Vice-President Pence just a while ago. Another man went into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, sat in her chair and posed for pictures with his feet up on her desk. One of them left a note for her: “We will not back down”.US Congress had just started a joint session at the time to certify Biden’s election victory. And the two chambers had broken up to debate, separately under the rules, the first of the several objections Trump’s allies in Congress had planned to raise against the certification.They were soon sheltering in place as rioters took over the capital, forcing back Capitol police, some of whom, curiously, posed for selfies with the rioters.The process resumed later in the evening after the complex had been cleared of Trump’s supporters.“To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win. Violence never wins. Freedom wins. And this is still the people’s house,” Pence said resuming Congress’s joint session. Though shocked and outraged, leaders of both parties resolved to put forth a joint front to demonstrate they would not be intimidated and resumed the certification process later in the evening. Many Republican dropped their plans to object to the certification, and others just plain said it was time to move on.As news of the insurrection spread, calls were issued for Trump, as the instigator and inciter, to intervene and call off his supporters. He ignored them for a while, and then responded with an insipid tweet saying: “Stay peaceful”. He posted another weak tweet, and then, after a public appeal from Biden to “step up”, Trump posted a long message with a video, in which he reiterated his claim that the election was stolen, appealed to the rioters to go home calling them patriots and saying he loved them.Several White House aides resigned in frustration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ignited-state-of-america/story-eUZaKSacDSg76hXzCp5DwI.html
08-01-2021||World||Joe Biden blames Donald Trump for violence at Capitol that’s shaken US||President-elect Joe Biden on Thursday denounced the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol as “domestic terrorists” and he blamed President Donald Trump for the violence that has shaken the nation’s capital and beyond.The riot by Trump supporters who breached the security of Congress on Wednesday was “not dissent, was not disorder, was not protest. It was chaos.”Those who massed on Capitol Hill intending to disrupt a joint session of Congress that was certifying Biden’s election victory over Trump “weren’t protesters. Don’t dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob — insurrectionists, domestic terrorists. It’s that basic,” Biden said.In solemn tones, Biden said the actions Trump has taken to subvert the nation’s democratic institutions throughout his presidency led directly to the mayhem in Washington.“In the past four years, we’ve had a president who’s made his contempt for our democracy, our Constitution, the rule of law clear in everything he has done,” Biden said. “He unleashed an all-out assault on our institutions of our democracy from the outset. And yesterday was the culmination of that unrelenting attack.”The mob of hundreds of Trump backers broke into the Capitol and roamed the halls looking for lawmakers, who were forced to halt their deliberations and seek safety. The violent protesters were egged on by Trump himself, who has falsely contended that he lost the election due to voter fraud.Trump’s claims were repeatedly dismissed in the courts, including the Supreme Court, and by state election officials from both parties, and even by some in his own administration. But the president went to greater and greater lengths to try to subvert the election, culminating this week in efforts by some Republican members of Congress to object to the certification of the results and the violence at the Capitol. After the disruption, Congress returned to work late Wednesday and affirmed Biden’s victory early Thursday.Biden ticked off a list of Trump’s assaults on American norms, including his attacks on the press and the intelligence community and his pressure on state and federal officials and judges to submit to his efforts to overturn the election. Biden said that on Wednesday, Trump tried to “use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 Americans” who voted in November.And both he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris spoke about the police treatment of the largely white protesters on Wednesday, compared with the heavy-handed way in which police have handled Black Lives Matter protests.“We witnessed two systems of justice, when we saw one that let extremists storm the United States Capitol and another that released tear gas on peaceful protesters last summer,” Harris said.Biden declared that “no one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol.”He expressed hope that images comparing the police presence Wednesday to that marshaled to prepare for Black Lives Matters protests would open Americans’ eyes to the needs for reform.The remarks came during an event in Wilmington, Delaware, to introduce Biden’s Justice Department team, to be led by federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland as attorney general. Biden also announced Obama administration homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco would serve as deputy attorney general and former Justice Department civil rights chief Vanita Gupta as associate attorney general, the No. 3 official. He also named an assistant attorney general for civil rights, Kristen Clarke, now the president of Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, an advocacy group.The Justice Department is expected to dramatically change course during the Biden administration, with a greater focus on civil rights issues and a review of policing policies. Both Biden and Harris spoke Wednesday about the importance of an independent judiciary.Biden said some of the most important work for the nation remains “committing ourselves to the rule of law in this nation, invigorating our domestic and democratic institutions carrying out equal justice under law in America.”“There is no more important place for us to do this work than the Department of Justice,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-blames-donald-trump-for-violence-at-capitol-that-s-shaken-us/story-aSFU8IvQWEy72JCVWmrjjN.html
08-01-2021||World||Security failure led to rioters running amok||The chaos inside the US Capitol on Wednesday came after the police force that protects the legislative complex was overrun by a mob of Donald Trump’s supporters in what law enforcement officials called a catastrophic failure to prepare.The siege of the Capitol, home to both the US Senate and the House of Representatives, represents one of the gravest security lapses in recent US history, current and former law enforcement officials said.While events such as a presidential inauguration involve detailed security plans by numerous security agencies, far less planning went into protecting the joint session of Congress that convened on Wednesday to ratify the results of the 2020 presidential election, the officials said. That lapse came despite glaring warning signs of potential violence by hardline supporters of President Trump.Security initially was handled almost entirely alone by the US Capitol Police, a 2,000-member force under the control of Congress and dedicated to protecting the 126-acre Capitol grounds. For reasons that remained unclear, other arms of the US federal government’s vast security apparatus did not arrive in force for hours as rioters besieged the seat of Congress. The Capitol is a short walk from where Trump in a speech railed against the election just before the riot began.The counting of the electoral votes of the presidential election by Congress, normally a formality, was preceded by weeks of threats in social media that planned pro-Trump protests could descend into violence. Despite those rumblings of danger, the Capitol Police force did not request advance help to secure the building from other federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, according to one senior official. National Guard reinforcements, summoned by the city’s mayor, were not mobilised until more than an hour after protesters first breached the barricades.In stark contrast, those agencies were aggressively deployed by the Trump administration during last summer’s police brutality protests across the US. Capitol Police officers to protect the complex like a citadel. But there are so many windows that it is difficult to defend them all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-failure-led-to-rioters-running-amok/story-AnEbmHjx0aJPLod7vEqyGJ.html

08-01-2021||World||All the President’s men||“Where are they?” a Trump supporter demanded in a crowd of dozens roaming the halls of the Capitol, bearing Trump flags and pounding on doors.They - lawmakers, staff members and more - were hiding under tables, hunkered in lockdowns, saying prayers and seeing the fruits of the country’s divisions up close and violent.Guns were drawn. A woman was shot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glass shattered.On Wednesday, hallowed spaces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress. The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer’s chair in the Senate, the offices of the House speaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.”They mocked its leaders, posing for photos in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one with his feet propped on a desk in her office, another sitting in the same seat vice-president Mike Pence had occupied only moments before during the proceedings to certify the electoral college vote. That certification would eventually take place, but not until well after midnight.There was still a heavy police presence at the Capitol on Thursday. A large US flag flew from the presidential inaugural stand that a day earlier was damaged during the siege.Wednesday began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump’s futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse near the White House that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he didn’t. Instead he sent them off with incendiary rhetoric. “If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. Later, Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers had just been evacuated after the storming of the Capitol began, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You’re very special,” while asking them to go home.Authorities eventually regained control as night fell. Armed officers brought in as reinforcements started using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving towards the door, then combed the halls for stragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash bangs and percussion grenades.Video footage also showed officers letting people calmly walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. They said a woman was shot earlier as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the other side. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died.Early on, some inside the Capitol saw the trouble coming outside the windows. Soon after, Trump supporters clashed with police who blasted pepper spray in an attempt to hold them back. It didn’t work. Throngs of MAGA-hatted demonstrators tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’s steps. Later, police evacuated the chamber at 2.30pm. After making sure the hallways were clear, police escorted the members down a series of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria. “This is how a coup is started,” Representative Jimmy Gomez later said. “This is how democracy dies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-the-president-s-men/story-E7LWSqBFHJ3Jxy7tUhPPcI.html
08-01-2021||World||US Vice-President Mike Pence finally shuns his boss Donald Trump||US Vice-President Mike Pence finally came through, but not as directed by his boss, outgoing President Donald Trump.Pence withstood mounting pressure from Trump to reject US Congress’s certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory, and early on Thursday declared the Democrat and his running mate Kamla Harris winners of the electoral college with 306 votes each, to 232 for Trump and himself, ending their term in office.“The whole number of electors appointed to vote for president of the US is 538, of which a majority is 270… Joseph R Biden, of the state of Delaware received for president of the US, 306 votes. Donald J Trump of the state of Florida has received 232. The announcement of the state of the vote by the president of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected president and vice-president of the United States. Each for the term beginning on the 20th day of January, 2021, and shall be entered together with the list of the votes on the journals of the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Pence said on early on Thursday, ending a day that will long be remembered for the infamy visited upon it by the outgoing president, who unleashed an attack on US Congress.Pence’s unquestioning public loyalty to Trump in the past even in the face of the president’s most egregious behaviour had been a cause for mounting concern as Trump, having gotten nowhere with lawsuits and vote recounts, came to pin on him his hopes of a second term despite having lost to Biden decisively in the electoral college and by more than 7 million popular votes.“If Vice-President @MikePence comes through for us, we will win the presidency,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, just as he was heading out to address a “Save America March”, where he incited his supporters to march on to Congress. He tagged on one of his many false claims of poll fraud - “Many states want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect and even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their state legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!”Mike couldn’t, Pence had told Trump in a meeting in the White house the day before, according to reports. The vice-president, who served many terms as member of the House of Representatives before becoming governor of Indiana state, his last job before Trump had asked him to join his ticket, is said to be acutely conscious and respectful of democratic norms. He told Trump it was not within his constitutional authority to reject Biden’s victory when presided over a joint session of the two chambers of Congress for the final stage in a presidential election, to certify the electoral college results.“It is my considered judgement that my oath to support and defend the constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,” Pence wrote in a statement that was circulated just minutes before he started the joint session. The New York Times reported Pence had reiterated the same argument in a conversation on Wednesday morning.Pence had not been as forthright in remarks in days before. He had sought to portray his views as aligned with the president’s even if did not go as far as to say what he will do. At an election rally in Georgia, the vice-president had said, “We’ve all got our doubts about the last election. I share the concerns of millions of Americans about voting irregularities.” Though he did add, wriggling out of a commitment, “we’ll have our day in Congress. We’ll hear the evidence.” He did not say what he will do with the evidence, which never qualified to be called that.Pence had planned to not overturn Biden’s election, and would probably have done so anyway. But did the outrage triggered by the storming of Congress by Trump’s supporters embolden him enough to go through with this resolve to defy the president openly and actually do it?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-mike-pence-finally-shuns-his-boss-donald-trump/story-YY9O9PITOnVr5trfmy3hAI.html
08-01-2021||World||Emergency in Tokyo as Covid cases surge||The Japanese government declared a month-long coronavirus state of emergency in the greater Tokyo area on Thursday as the capital reported another record surge in daily infections.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga described a “great sense of crisis” as he announced the measure, which begins on Friday, but is less strict than the harsh lockdowns seen elsewhere or even the country’s first virus emergency last spring.It primarily targets restaurants and bars, which will be asked to stop serving alcohol by 7pm and close an hour later.Tokyo recorded 2,447 new cases on Thursday - shattering the previous record of 1,591 logged a day earlier, and representing a sizeable chunk of the 7,490 new cases reported nationwide. Still, Japan’s outbreak remains comparatively small, with around 3,700 Covid-19 deaths overall.Meanwhile, coronavirus cases in Europe surpassed 25 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally. Europe has recorded at least 25,016,506 cases and 559,863 deaths since the start of the pandemic, recently reporting over a million new cases about every four days. With just a tenth of the world’s population, Europe remains the worst-affected region, with nearly 30% of global cases and deaths.The World Health Organization’s European branch on Thursday said more needed to be done to deal with the alarming situation brought on by recently discovered variants of the novel coronavirus.Speaking at a press conference, the WHO’s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge, called the current situation “a tipping-point in the course of the pandemic,” as Europe was both challenged by surging cases and new strains of the virus causing Covid-19. “Without increased control to slow its spread, there will be an increased impact on already stressed and pressurised health facilities,” Kluge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emergency-in-tokyo-as-covid-cases-surge/story-mYv1EPMSqMP1vWjZvkUszO.html
08-01-2021||World||It’s official now: US Congress certifies Joe Biden’s election victory||Escorted back to their chambers by heavily armed security personnel, US lawmakers took their seats late on Wednesday evening, looking grim but determined to finish their task: and they did. At around 3.41am on Thursday, US Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory.All Democrats and most Republicans voted to reject two objections raised by Republican allies of outgoing President Donald Trump - electoral college results reported by Arizona and Pennsylvania, two of the seven key states that caused the president’s defeat. Some Republicans who had planned to object announced they had changed their minds.“When I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes,” said Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican. “However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider and I cannot now, in good conscience, object.” Loeffler and David Perdue, both incumbent Republican senators from the state of Georgia, lost to their Democratic rivals Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, which transferred control of the Senate to Democrats.“Trump and I’ve had a hell of a journey,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Republican ally of Trump. “I hate it being this way. Oh my god! I hate it... but today, all I can say is, count me out. Enough is enough. I tried to be helpful.”The objection to Arizona was defeated in a 303- 121 vote in Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and by 93- 6 in the Republican-controlled Senate, which was a stinging rebuke of the president and his Republican backers. And the objection to the certification of the Pennsylvania result was defeated 282-138 in the House and 92-7 in the Senate.Most Republicans had been opposed to the objections, calling them an unconstitutional overreach, as an attempt to replace people’s right to elect with the will of the Congress. “The constitution gives Congress a limited role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national board of elections on steroids,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had said in remarks in the chamber when it broke from the joint session to discuss the Arizona objection, before the rioters broke in. “The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.”McConnell had set the tone for Republican lawmakers after they had reconvened. “The United States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs… We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. We are back in our posts. We will discharge our duty under the constitution. Of our nation.

The issue whether a prima facie case exists against him will be the focus on Friday, with a judgment expected in weeks.Helen Malcolm of the Crown Prosecution Service representing India said the court could ask the government of India for a fresh assurance on facilities for mental health treatment in Barrack number 12 of the Mumbai jail. According to Montgomery, the court was not obliged to ask for such an assurance after a certain time limit.Malcolm did not see equivalence between the Assange and Modi cases, as claimed by Montgomery, since the former reportedly suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome and depression. She also denied that there was any plan to keep Modi in solitary confinement in the Arthur Road jail, as claimed.Besides medical facilities available in the jail, Malcolm reminded the court that India had submitted details of at least three hospitals nearby where he could be treated. He would also be able to seek private treatment of his choice, she added.According to Malcolm, there is no difference between Modi’s case and that of businessman Vijay Mallya; the court had recommended Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. She also refuted claims that India’s judiciary is not independent or that Modi would not receive a fair trial if extradited.Montgomery said the government of India had submitted an “utterly worthless” assurance that Modi would have access to necessary medical facilities. Judge Samuel Goozee heard both sides and concluded against that the government of India had “ample opportunities” to respond to concerns previously raised by a medical doctor who had examined Modi. Modi, 49, who is lodged in the Wandsworth prison in west London and attended the hearing remotely, wearing a jacket and sporting a beard, is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Charges against Modi involve PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements) - the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-depression-suicide-risk-raised-in-court-to-block-extradition-to-india/story-4Yd4QHQYqWz8pbT5QP2kgK.html

Updated guidance on the use of the drugs will be issued on Friday, encouraging hospitals to use tocilizumab while treating Covid-19 patients immediately.Health secretary Matt Hancock said, “Today’s results are yet another landmark development in finding a way out of this pandemic and, when added to the armoury of vaccines and treatments already being rolled out, will play a significant role in defeating this virus.“We have worked quickly to ensure this treatment is available to NHS patients without delay, meaning hundreds of lives will be saved. I am hugely proud of the significant role our NHS and its patients have played in this international trial.”Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said, “The fact there is now another drug that can help to reduce mortality for patients with Covid-19 is hugely welcome news and another positive development in the continued fight against the virus.”In June last year, the UK government approved dexamethasone as the world’s first treatment proven to reduce mortality for Covid-19. The REMAP-CAP trial found that the rate of death for those in intensive care units on corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, and respiratory support alone was 35%, which was reduced to 28% when tocilizumab was also administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-trial-finds-2-more-drugs-reduce-deaths-icu-stay/story-2fXh5Ylyu22Z90r1S1MgkO.html

Read CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s full statement here||Facebook and Instagram have placed a ban on posts by US president Donald Trump ‘indefinitely on Thursday for encouraging violent rioters who had barged into the US Capitol building when US Congress was certifying the US election results.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday released a statement saying that it is a matter of huge risk to allow the US president to use Facebook. Here is the full text of his statement:The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.Also Watch | Facebook, Instagram ban Donald Trump ‘indefinitely’ after US Capitol breach His decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world. We removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect -- and likely their intent -- would be to provoke further violence.Following the certification of the election results by Congress, the priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13 days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with established democratic norms.Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech. But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-instagram-ban-trump-read-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-s-full-statement-here/story-NphOo56d6ILMYu8LQdGdkI.html
08-01-2021||World||Facebook, Instagram ban US president Donald Trump ‘indefinitely’||Facebook banned President Donald Trump from the platform “indefinitely” due to his efforts to incite the violence in the US capital this week, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday.Zuckerberg said the 24-hour ban announced Wednesday was extended because of Trump’s “use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.”The announcement came the day after the outgoing US leader was locked out of all major social media platforms due to his false claims about the legitimacy his loss to President-elect Joe Biden, and for inciting the angry mob that stormed the US Capitol.Also Watch | Facebook, Instagram ban Donald Trump ‘indefinitely’ after US Capitol breach His favorite megaphone, Twitter, blocked him for 12 hours, but it was unclear Thursday if the ban had been lifted.Snapchat confirmed Thursday that it locked Trump out of the photo sharing platform amid concerns over his dangerous rhetoric.“We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page.“Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.”The crackdown came after Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday in an unprecedented attack that led to one woman being shot and killed by police, interrupting the normally ceremonial procedure to certify Biden’s election victory.Trump, who had addressed the mob and urged them to march on the Capitol, later released a video on social media in which he repeated the false claim of election fraud -- even telling the mob “I love you.”YouTube removed the video in line with its policy barring claims challenging election results.Twitter said Trump’s messages were violations of the platform’s rules on civic integrity and that any future violations “will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account.”The messaging platform said Trump’s account would be locked for 12 hours and that if the offending tweets were not removed, “the account will remain locked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-bans-us-president-donald-trump-indefinitely/story-7gpYrJUa82XMiChPulFNiP.html

The Russian side has said the deal for five S-400 systems is progressing according to schedule despite the threat of possible sanctions. “India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests,” he said in response to a question on the S-400 deal.Outgoing US envoy Kenneth Juster said this week that sanctions under CAATSA weren’t aimed against friends of the US, though India might soon need to make hard decisions regarding the acquisition of military hardware.Also read: PM Modi to meet all chief ministers on Jan 11 to discuss Covid-19 vaccination rollout India has sought to keep its options open on arms purchases and the country’s leadership has signalled its intent to continue with the acquisition of military hardware from Russia, which accounts for more than 60 per cent of the weapons systems of the three services. Responding to another question on the US administration’s plans to modify the selection process for H-1B visas by giving priority to salary and skills instead of the current lottery, Srivastava said India is in communication with the American side to ensure “increased predictability” in the visa regime.Almost 70 per cent of the 65,000 H-1B visas issued by the US each year go to Indian nationals. “We are engaged with the US government for increased predictability in the visa regime and to minimise inconvenience to Indian nationals in the US or those proposing to travel to the US for bonafide reasons, including the movement of Indian professionals,” Srivastava said. India has also noted the US government’s recent proclamations extending by three months the suspension of entry of certain immigrants and non-immigrants, he said.“People-to-people relations are a vital part of the partnership between India and the US. There is recognition in the US of the fact that Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth of the US economy and helped the US retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mea-s-clear-cut-message-to-us-a-reminder-on-s-400-deal/story-UQMd43MEwrNvz4QGXxdcVI.html

National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic advisor to the French president, participated in the dialogue in New Delhi on Thursday. Bonne, who is France’s Sherpa for the G7 and G20, also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla. The agenda for the strategic dialogue included defence and security, key international and regional issues, including the Indo-Pacific, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, and cooperation in space and civil nuclear energy. “On each topic, the two sides noted the high degree of convergence of views and agreed on concrete steps to further enhance their cooperation. In particular, they reiterated their attachment to an inclusive, rules-based Indo-Pacific which contributes to a multipolar Asia in a multipolar world,” the French embassy said in a statement. In his meetings with the Indian leadership, Bonne conveyed President Emmanuel Macron’s wish to further strengthen the relationship of trust and friendship with India. “Indo-French cooperation will be key to tackling global challenges in 2021, such as ensuring equal and universal access to Covid-19 vaccines, protecting climate and biodiversity, and building a renewed multilateralism,” the statement said.

At a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on December 18, the two sides reviewed developments on the LAC and agreed to hold another meeting between senior military commanders at an early date. However, the commanders are yet to meet, reflecting the differences between the two sides. “As you are aware, the latest round of WMCC was held on December 18. The two sides have agreed to hold the next round of senior commanders meeting and are in constant communication through diplomatic and military channels in this regard,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “In the meantime, both sides have maintained communication at the ground level to avoid any misunderstandings and misjudgements even as discussions continue for achieving complete disengagement in all friction areas in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements to restore peace and tranquillity,” he said, without giving details.Also Read: What India should, and shouldn’t, do in Nepal The two sides had earlier acknowledged that talks between the military commanders had contributed to stability on the ground.

He was shifted to the director’s bungalow in August last year, purportedly due to the spread of covid-19. Prasad returned to the hospital ward after two months in October.It was alleged that Prasad had violated the provisions of the jail manual to avail facilities not available to any prisoner.Hearing the matter on Friday, the bench of justice Aparesh Kumar Singh observed, “The government functions as per law and not by individual wishes.”The bench said that RIMS management failed to clarify what other options they had looked into before deciding to shift Prasad to the hospital’s director’s bungalow.“Why have they selected this bungalow only. They should have considered other options also. Any such decision should have been taken in accordance with the law,” the bench said.Earlier, the court asked under what provisions Prasad was provided these ‘extra’ facilities. It also asked the government to clarify under which provision Prasad, a prisoner, kept helpers when in jail. What are the rules and how are these helpers selected and appointed, the court asked.Inspector general (IG), prison, filed a reply stating that the hospital management had shifted Prasad to the bungalow to safeguard him from Covid-19 infection. The jail manual doesn’t clarify as to what different facilities should be made available for a prisoner who is undergoing treatment in custody outside jail, the IG’s report said.“It is also silent on whether such ailing prisoners should get helpers. There is no SOP (standard operating procedure) for this as well. The government is in the process of bringing changes in the jail manual and to prepare SOPs too,” the IG said in his report. Considering this, the bench adjourned the matter asking the government to furnish a copy of the SOP by January 22, the next date of hearing.Also Read: Man held for threatening ex-deputy CM of Jharkhand Sudesh MahatoPrasad had suffered a major jolt in the fodder scam case on September 30, 2013, when a trial court in Ranchi held him guilty in the first of the six cases against him. The conviction got him five years in prison, disqualification from the Parliament and a ban on contesting elections. He was given bail by the Supreme Court in December that year.His troubles renewed in 2017-18, when he was convicted and sentenced to different terms of imprisonment in three separate fodder scam cases in quick succession. He has secured bail in two of them and his bail application in the third and the last case is under the high court’s consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-hc-pulls-up-govt-for-shifting-jailed-lalu-prasad-to-bungalow/story-8hwqmTfQctfI7kpf4CkicK.html

Captain Gupta is the commander of 10 Para Special Forces, which was selected as the best unit of the year (2020) in the Indian Army. As a part of a drill, he jumped from a helicopter into the Takhat Sagar reservoir on Thursday. Three other commandos also jumped with him, but Captain Ankit could not come out. The army’s search operation in the lake started Thursday afternoon but had to be halted after dark. “The teams of NDRF, SDRF, civil defence and army are continuously searching for the submerged captain, but he is still missing. As part of the exercise, some jawans jumped into the lake from the helicopter to improve their skills in rescuing drowned people,” said SHO Jaikishan Soni. He added that 10 Para personnel initially tried to locate Captain Gupta but informed their seniors after they failed. Search operations were carried out throughout Friday with no luck. During the exercise, the commandos of the 10 Para had to throw their boats in the water and jump from a helicopter. “After this, they were to attack the enemy by riding on a boat. Under this mission, four commandos led by captain Ankit threw their boat first into the Takhat Sagar reservoir and then jumped into the water themselves. Three commandos reached the boat, but Captain Ankit could not. After waiting a bit, the commandos started searching for him,” said a senior police official from Jodhpur. 28-year-old Ankit, a resident of Gurugram, got married less than two months ago on November 23, 2020.“His passion for the army can be gauged from the fact that he stayed with his wife for a very little period after marriage and returned to complete his special training,” the police official said. The unit, famously known as the Desert Scorpions, is among the most battle hardened units of the Indian Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/special-forces-captain-ankit-gupta-remains-missing-search-on-at-jodhpur-lake/story-CEyDiBrsGROYmEBlMMXc0J.html

Birla talked about the campaign while chairing an event organised by the Uttarakhand panchayati raj department on the subject, Panchayati Raj System - Empowering Decentralised Democracy. The event was attended by the gram pradhans and members of various panchayats of the state, panchayati raj minister Arvind Pandey and Uttarakhand assembly Speaker Premchand Agarwal. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat attended the event virtually. “The ‘Know Your Constitution’ campaign would be held in schools, colleges and universities of the country for which the framework has been created. It was somewhat delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but now when the pandemic is getting under control, it would soon be commenced,” said Birla. He said that the initiative will “largely help the youngsters getting aware of the various aspects of our Constitution.” “Most of us know about the rights given by the Constitution but not about the duties. This initiative will explain the significance of the duties also. This would make our democracy stronger,” said Birla.

We would take measures to prevent such acts in future and promote resorting to democratic and peaceful ways to raise voice.” Earlier, CM Rawat while addressing the gathering at the event said, “Our democracy will become strong with the decentralisation of rights in the panchayati raj system.” “Today our democracy is standing strong in the world because the panchayats are providing strength to it. This shows the importance of the villages without which the cities can’t develop,” said Rawat. He said, “We need to make the economy of villages strong and make sure more money is flowing there because a majority of the buyers are there while the manufacturers are in cities. If the rural buyers will be strong then the economy would be effectively driven towards development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-hold-know-your-constitution-campaign-in-schools-colleges-om-birla/story-uB4cPkCNZRnqCHX01IctAL.html
08-01-2021||India||Pak court jails LeT’s Lakhvi for terror financing, India calls it ‘farcical’||A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Friday convicted and sentenced Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi on charges of terror financing, though India dismissed the development as a “farcical” action made with an eye on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The anti-terrorism court in Lahore found Lakhvi guilty under three sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act for running a dispensary to raise funds for terror financing. The judge gave Lakhvi separate five-year prison terms under each section, to be served concurrently. The court also imposed fines totalling Pakistan Rs 300,000 on Lakhvi and said he would face additional jail time of 18 months if he failed to pay up. Lakhvi was present in court during the hearing and judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar directed police to send him to jail to serve his sentence. This is the first time that Lakhvi, accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, has been convicted of a terrorism-related offense. However, a spokesman for the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province told media he had been arrested for terror financing and not for any “specific militant attack”. In New Delhi, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, told a regular news briefing hours after the sentencing, that Pakistan’s “farcical actions” appeared to be aimed at an upcoming review by the FATF of the country’s efforts to counter terror financing. He also called for “credible action” by Pakistan against terror groups. “The timing of these actions clearly suggests the intention of conveying a sense of compliance ahead of the APG (Asia-Pacific Group) meeting and the next FATF plenary meeting in February. It has become routine for Pakistan to come up with such farcical actions prior to important meetings,” he said. “UN-proscribed entities and designated terrorists act as proxies for the Pakistani establishment to fulfil its anti-India agenda. It is for the international community to hold Pakistan to account and ensure that it takes credible action against terror groups, terror infrastructure and individual terrorists,” he added.

The judge said in his order that the prosecution had proved Lakhvi was using the dispensary to raise funds to finance terrorism and that there was “sufficient evidence in the form of oral testimonies”. The court also directed authorities to arrest Lakhvi’s associate, Abu Anas Mohsin, who was involved in running the dispensary. The court’s order said Lakhvi will serve his sentence in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he was held earlier after he was arrested in connection with the Mumbai attacks. He was freed on bail in 2015 but reports had suggested that he had continued to guide the LeT’s operations even when he was in jail earlier. Last year, LeT founder Hafiz Saeed was convicted and sentenced in five separate cases of terror financing. He was given prison terms ranging from five years to fifteen-and-half years that will run concurrently. Several close aides of Saeed were also sentenced in cases of terror financing. Pakistan was retained in FATF’s “grey list” last year for failing to fully deliver on an action plan to fight terror financing, and the multilateral watchdog has given the country time till February to address what it said were “very serious deficiencies”. The FATF’s plenary and working group meetings during February 21-26 will review Pakistan’s case, and this will be preceded by another assessment by APG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-court-jails-let-s-lakhvi-for-terror-financing-india-calls-it-farcical/story-hT9cuyMgVKRkmsyvRkbMoI.html

The next round of talks between representatives of the Centre and the farmers is scheduled to be held on January 15 after their eighth round of meeting ended in a stalemate. The Centre told the farmers that it “cannot and will not repeal” the laws while the farmers have made it clear that the demonstrations would not stop until they were repealed.“There was a heated discussion. We said we don’t want anything other than the repeal of laws. We won’t go to any court. This (repeal) will either be done or we will continue to fight. Our parade on January 26 will go on as planned,” Mollah was quoted as saying by news agency ANI after the eighth round of talks.Watch: Farmers, Centre hold 8th round of talks to find ‘solutions’ amid protestAccording to farm leader Kavitha Kuruganti, farmers shouted slogans inside, saying, “We will either die or win.” Another farm leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said they had also raised the issue of BJP leaders branding the protesters from Punjab ‘Khalistanis’, referencing the Sikh separatist movement. “We told the government that this is highly objectionable. On one hand, the government is negotiating with farmers, while the ruling party’s leaders are trying to tarnish our movement all the time,” he said.Also Read: It’s not just repeal of farm laws, other issues involved too: Haryana CM Manohar Lal KhattarThe eight rounds of talks between the farmers’ representatives and the Centre have yielded no solution. However, the Centre had said it will accept two of the farmers’ demands during the talks held on December 30. The government had agreed not to pay direct cash to farmers instead of power subsidy for agricultural use, which the farmers argue would increase power costs for them. It also agreed to keep farmers out of the ambit of an anti-pollution law that prescribes harsh penalties for crop-residue burning.Thousands of farmers have been protesting around the borders of the national capital for well over a month against the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre in September last year. Their demands are a repeal of the three laws as well as a legal guarantee for federally fixed minimum support prices. The laws remove restrictions on the purchase and sale of farm produce, lift constraints on stockpiling under the 1955 Essential Commodities Act and enable contract farming based on written agreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-fight-if-laws-not-repealed-says-farm-leader-hannan-mollah/story-LgF8pdSGJvN9sRe8ZmlMLN.html

The results are based on the genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples released by the Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) labs.The Central government created a network of 10 advanced labs across the country last month to step up disease surveillance in the wake of mutations detected in the Sars-Cov-2 virus that cause Covid-19.The designated 10 INSACOG labs are - NIBMG Kolkata, ILS Bhubaneswar, NIV Pune, CCS Pune, CCMB Hyderabad, CDFD Hyderabad, InSTEM Bengaluru, NIMHANS Bengaluru, IGIB Delhi and NCDC Delhi.Out of these laboratories conducting genome sequencing, six have found samples positive for the new UK variant.All patients have been kept in a single room isolation at designated health care facilities of respective state governments. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine. Comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Genome sequencing on other specimens is currently going on.Also read: Bird flu confirmed in 6 states; unusual avian deaths in Delhi being checkedFrom November 25 to December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK.

According to the health ministry data, only 18,139 people were found to be Covid-19 positive on Friday in the country.The number of new deaths due to Covid-19 has also remained under 300 for the past two weeks.“The overall numbers are on a decline, but there are some states where a sudden surge in cases during the past few days has been reported, this highlights the need for people to strictly adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, particularly wearing a mask and maintaining a distance of at least 6-feet with others,” said a health ministry official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-82-positive-cases-of-new-covid-19-strain-health-ministry/story-8qd8aw5W9jSyODocUBtOLK.html
08-01-2021||India||‘It is a good day to act’: SC urges Centre to decide Rajoana’s mercy plea before Jan 26||The Supreme Court on Friday urged the Centre to decide on an eight-year old mercy plea of a death row convict in two weeks. The convict, Balwant Singh Rajoana, has been in jail for over 25 years after being convicted for triggering a bomb blast that killed former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh in August 1995.Rajoana had approached the Supreme Court last year, complaining about the delay on part of the Central government to process his mercy petition, filed on March 25, 2012 with the President of India. The Supreme Court on December 4 enquired about the delay with the Centre and came to know that the proposal for his commutation was yet to be processed.The ministry of home affairs reasoned that since other co-accused involved in the crime with Rajoana had filed appeals, which were pending before the apex court, a decision on Rajoana’s mercy petition was put on hold. Rajoana had not filed any appeal challenging his death sentence before the apex court.On Friday, additional solicitor general (ASG) KM Nataraj told a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde that the file has been processed by the home ministry. “We have processed the file from our end. It has been sent to the competent authority to take a decision.”The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked the law officer, “Give him (Rajoana) some relief before January 26. It is a good day to act. If possible, pass an order before January 25.” Hopeful of a positive outcome, the bench posted the matter for hearing on January 25.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for Rajoana said, “The delay of eight years in processing the mercy petition is fatal. This is enough for commutation of death sentence to life as decided by the Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan case in 2014.” In this judgment given by a Constitution bench, undue, inordinate delay in deciding mercy petitions was held to be a ground to commute punishment of death row convicts.

Later, on October 12, 2010, the Punjab and Haryana high court confirmed the death penalty on Rajoana, while sparing Hawara from the guillotine. In his petition filed through advocate Rupesh Kumar, Rajoana informed the court that on September 27, 2019, the centre wrote a letter to Punjab chief secretary where it said that the mercy plea of Rajoana is to be processed under Article 72 of the Constitution coinciding with the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. When the same was not done, Rajoana knocked the doors of the apex court to remind the Centre of its resolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-a-good-day-to-act-sc-urges-centre-to-decide-rajoana-s-mercy-plea-before-jan-26/story-RBo44iAoMX2icPgJa9v0GM.html

The meeting, which lasted over two hours, also addressed the need for improvements in the party to better provide an effective opposition. “The government is delaying repealing the laws,” Congress MP Jasbir Singh Gill, who attended the meeting, said. “It is deliberately using these tactics because it wants to tire out the farmers and drive them away without addressing their concerns.”Also Read: It’s not just repeal of farm laws, other issues involved too: Haryana CM Manohar Lal KhattarThe Congress MPs and legislators have been protesting at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi since last month to draw the government’s attention to the plight of the farmers.

The government has, however, offered to set up a committee to examine the laws. The Congress has been vehemently opposing the government’s stance, with interim party chief Sonia Gandhi calling for a complete revocation of the “black laws”.

The union home ministry in a notification told the Tamil Nadu government that its recent order is in dilution of Covid-19 preventative guidelines issued by the ministry. “Government of Tamil Nadu order of permitting increase the seating capacity of Cinema/theatres/ multiplexes from existing 50% to 100% is a dilution of MHA order. States and UT shall not dilute guidelines issued under DM act in any manner,” the notification said. “In view of the above, Govt of Tamil Nadu is requested to immediately issue necessary order to bring their Guidelines in line with the MHA guidelines dated 28 December 2020 and inform compliance to this Ministry,” the notification further added. Cinemas across Tamil Nadu reopened in November allowing 50% occupancy but movie theatres failed to attract people due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The state government after holding meetings with theatre owners association decided on January 4 to allow movie theatres to operate at full capacity. It had also asked the theatre owners to strictly follow Covid-19 preventative measures during showtimes. Theatre owners across Tamil Nadu were concerned with reduced footfall in movie theatres as concerns surrounding a mutated strain of Covid-19 has gripped the nation. 82 people across the country have been detected with the mutated strain of coronavirus which is believed to be more infectious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-reverses-100-occupancy-order-in-movie-theatres-after-centre-s-notice/story-tra0dohOxj9vm26h1f31XP.html
08-01-2021||India||Customs officials set to grill Kerala Speaker in gold smuggling case||The customs department, which is part of the multi-agency team probing the sensational gold smuggling case, is set to question Kerala assembly Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan after it obtained legal advice that house privilege won’t be applicable in such cases.It sought the opinion of senior constitutional lawyers in the Supreme Court and later the assistant solicitor general who is camping in Kochi, a senior official of the customs said. The official added that the investigation into gold and dollar smuggling case is at a crucial stage.“We are summoning an individual, not a post. Privilege is only applicable while carrying out an official duty. Privilege is not meant to cover any illegal activity,” said the official, adding that the Speaker will be summoned soon. The customs got the advice that it can wait till the ongoing budget session is over. He said if his summoning poses any problem, the customs department will move the court to obtain its permission. “We have certain leads. We want more clarity on them. It is the duty of persons holding high positions to come on their own and explain rather than bunking it,” he said. Meanwhile, the Speaker’s secretary K Ayyappan appeared before the customs on Friday after it toughened its position. Earlier, it sent summons to him twice but he ignored them citing certain privileges of the assembly staff. Also read: ‘Cannot and will not repeal laws,’ says Centre as farm talks hit another stalemateLater, the assembly secretary also sent a letter to the customs saying it needed the Speaker’s permission for questioning assembly staff which triggered a big outrage. Legal experts also said employees of the assembly were not covered under privilege shield. Last month, while hearing the bail plea of one of the accused, a court dealing with economic offences in Kochi had expressed ‘shock’ at the involvement of “big sharks” in the case and observed that people holding high positions had misused their power and authority. There are also media reports that some of the accused gave confessional statements taking big names. Later, main accused Swapna Suresh sought special protection in the jail complaining her life was in danger. After the gold smuggling case surfaced in July, there were reports allegedly linking the main accused Suresh with the Speaker. He later admitted that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and attended some functions on her invitation. But opposition Congress and BJP leaders alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and that Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to West Asian countries.They also alleged that the accused smuggled US dollars to the Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. A major portion of the smuggled US dollar was commission obtained from various projects, they further alleged. The Speaker denied these allegations and said he was ready for any probe. But when customs officials approached his secretary he retracted flaunting privilege card. When the customs busted the gold smuggling racket, Suresh was working as a senior consultant with the Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited. Before this, she worked at the UAE consulate at the state capital as its public relations officer. After the gold smuggling case surfaced, her degree was also found to be fake. Last month, Suresh told a court in Kochi that her life was in danger and sought special protection for herself and her family members. She said she was under pressure not to take big names and some people met her in the jail a couple of times to pressurise her. Later, the court directed the prisons department to provide her with adequate security. Detained under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (Cofeposa), Swapna is lodged in the women’s jail in Thiruvananthapuram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kerala/customs-officials-set-to-grill-kerala-speaker-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-eLzxdO3k02CMuH0VEBWaWI.html
08-01-2021||India||Govt issues guidelines for transportation of Covid-19 vaccine by air||Centre on Friday issued guidelines for the packaging and transportation of the Covid-19 vaccines by air directing airlines and airport authorities to ensure the vaccines are packaged in dry ice and refrigerated material in a bid to maintain low temperatures ranging between -8° C to -70° C essential for its transportation.The guidelines issued by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) state all scheduled operators who have been currently authorized to carry dangerous goods may carry Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice, meeting the regulatory requirements, the guidelines reviewed by HT state.The civil aviation ministry on Friday held a round of meetings with airlines executives and airport authorities to finalise the logistics needed for the transportation of the Covid-19 vaccines.“All arrangements have been made at airports for the transportation who are on standby and are ready to carry the consignment as and when the orders are placed,” a senior official said.The aviation ministry had directed all airlines in December to begin preparations and had instructed airport operators, including state-run Airports Authority of India (AAI), ground handling service providers and airlines to put in place standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the transportation of Covid-19 vaccines that will be approved by the government.“Carriage of Covid-19 vaccines from the manufacturing units to the place of administration gains significant importance especially in the light of the high expectations of the government(s), health care personnel and the general public. It is needless to say that amongst the various modes of transport, air transport is the most efficient option. Hence, it is imperative that air logistics provide a well-defined procedure that meets the global safety standards and requirements based on local conditions,” the DGCA noted.“Non-scheduled operators including aircraft engaged in general aviation that are required to participate in the carriage of Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice shall seek specific approval before commencing such operations. Compliance with ICAO Doc 9284 (Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air) is the responsibility of each operator,” it added.Elaborating on the need to package the vaccines with dry ice the DGCA noted that the temperature maintenance requirement for Covid-19 vaccines is reported to be varying from -8° C to -70° C and hence, the use of refrigerant material during the transportation becomes essential.“Though there may be different refrigerant options, use of dry ice (Carbon Dioxide Solid) is the most commonly used, affordable and readily available refrigerant material available in the country for transportation of perishables by air. Dry ice continually sublimates (Dry ice that is solid, transforms into Carbon Dioxide gas (COz)) at temperatures higher than -78°C (-108.4O F) under normal atmospheric pressure. At reduced pressures, the sublimation rate of dry ice will increase while all other factors being the same,” it noted.The DGCA said all operators while engaging in transportation of Covid-19 vaccines packed with dry ice shall establish the maximum quantity of dry ice that can be loaded in a given cargo hold and/ or compartment or in the main deck (passenger cabin) when a passenger version aircraft is deployed for all cargo operations.“This maximum quantity shall be based on the aircraft manufacturers’ information on maximum recommended dry ice quantities that the aircraft ventilation can support, depending on the sublimation rate and also the requirements of the operators’ Safety Management Systems,” it noted.TransportationThe guidelines state vaccines packed in dry ice should preferably be transported in lower-deck of the cargo compartments of the planes, however in case the operators desires to carry vaccines packed in dry ice in the passenger cabin area the operators will have to ensure that the occupants on board are limited to the flight crew while other passengers should not be allowed.“The operator should take all necessary steps to ensure that the flight crew is not harmed by carbon dioxide incapacitation or intoxication. Flight crew should be properly trained on the hazards and risks of transporting dry ice and on the procedures related to the operation. Any other occupants on-board should only be allowed if required under demonstrated urgent operational needs (e.g., additional flight crew for the return flight or additional persons needed for the cargo handling),” it said.Occupants, that are not considered flight crew, should be protected against a potential CO2 intoxication by the following means: Have access during all phases of flight to approved supplemental oxygen equipment ready to be used. Have been properly trained on the use of oxygen equipment,” it added.Adequate number of CO2 detectors should be available in the cabin, it noted.For the transport of vaccines in dry ice in excess of the limit specified in the operations manual or other applicable aircraft manufacturer documents, the operator should perform a specific risk assessment. The risk assessment should ensure that all relevant technical and operational aspects have been taken into account, it noted.Ventilation pressurisation systemFor aircraft dispatch, the air conditioning, air supply and the distribution/ventilation system should use configurations recommended by the manufacturer, DGCA stated.“The operator’s standard operating procedures should also include lowering of temperature in the cargo compartment as much as possible to minimise the sublimation rate of dry ice.To mitigate the risk of higher concentrations of CO2, the ventilation and pressurisation system shall be fully operational, i.e. all air-conditioning packs should be running at all times,” it noted.“In case of partial failure of the ventilation system in flight, the situation has to be carefully evaluated in order to decide if the flight may continue to destination. The OEM guidance should account for a single next critical failure to enable continuation of the flight, while total failure of the ventilation system in flight should lead to an immediate diversion to the nearest suitable airport,” it added.For aircraft dispatch the crew oxygen systems should be fully operative, it noted. “It is recommended to use the cargo compartment that is located next to the outflow valve, in order to effectively ensure that even in the case of partial or complete failure of the ventilation and pressurization system during flight, the CO2 will be ventilated overboard,” DGCA said.Packaging and handlingThe operators have to ensure that the shipments containing Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice shall be accepted and handled by appropriately trained personnel only. Operators will also have to prepare a ‘Dos & Don’t’ guidance and circulate among those handling personnel the specific requirements that may be applicable for handling shipments containing Covid-19 vaccines.“Adequate precautions need to be taken at the end of a flight, as compartments or a Unit Load Device containing dry ice will tend to have high concentration of CO2 and also the area immediately outside the door experiences high concentration of CO2 for several minutes,” it noted.Operators also have to ensure that each package containing Covid-19 vaccines packed in dry ice is clearly marked —’ Dry ice or Carvon Dioxide Solid .’ Operators also have to inform the Pilot-in-command in writing of the quantity of dry ice loaded including loading locations.“In line with our business model and cost leadership strategy, we are happy to evaluate the shipment of the Covid-19 vaccines onboard our aircraft and will promise to contribute to the best of our abilities,” a spokesperson for Indigo said.Aviation ministry secretary Pardeep Kharola had last week said the SOPs will be drafted in coordination with the ministry of health and the department of pharmaceuticals, which will be spearheading the formation of a multi-mode cold chain that will ensure the refrigerated production, transport, storage and distribution of the vaccines.India’s vaccine roll-out is set to begin by next week. Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri had last month said that the Centre aims to inoculate at least 300 million people until July 2021 for which at least 600 million doses will be required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-guidelines-for-transportation-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-air/story-CHaGdh7rBmVNk51UQwcmzH.html

Tomar also pointed out that the government urged farmers’ unions’ representatives to propose alternatives other than demanding a total rollback.“Discussion on the laws was taken up but no decision could be made. The government urged that if farmers’ unions give an option other than repealing, we will consider it. But no option could be presented, so the meeting was concluded and it was decided to hold the next meeting on January 15,” Tomar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Tomar, along with Piyush Goyal and other Union ministers, has conducted eight rounds of discussions with the representatives of the farmers’ unions but both parties have failed to reach an agreement over the farm laws. Ahead of the meeting, Tomar had reiterated that both sides need to take steps to reach a solution. “I am hopeful that talks will be held in a positive atmosphere and a solution will be found. During discussions, each side has to take steps to reach a solution,” Tomar had said before reaching Vigyan Bhavan.While the government has previously indicated that it is ready for the long haul and is not keen on repealing the laws, farmers’ unions’ representatives also remained stolid on their stance. The farmers, who are agitating at Delhi’s borders since the last 45 days, have warned that the protests will further intensify and more tractor rallies will be organised to protest against the government’s stance.Rakesh Tikait, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader, said that farmers will continue to remain at Delhi’s borders unless the laws are repealed. “Farmers won’t relent before the laws are repealed. We’ll come on Jan 15 again. We’re not going anywhere. The government wanted to talk about amendments. We don’t wish to have clause wise discussions. We simply want a repeal of the new farm laws,” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Hannan Mollah, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) leader, who had earlier in the day said that he is ready for any eventuality, echoed similar sentiments and said that the protest scheduled for January 26 will go ahead as planned. He said, “There was a heated discussion, we said we don’t want anything other than repeal of laws. We won’t go to any Court, this (repeal) will either be done or we’ll continue to fight. Our parade on January 26 will go on as planned.”Tomar also said that there are several farmers’ groups who are supporting the farm laws and are ready to discuss concerns with them. The government believes that the introduction of these laws will help the agricultural sector in the country and allow farmers to double their incomes.Farmers believe that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 will affect the procurement of yields under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and allow multinational companies to use the sector to maximise their profits at the expense of the farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-tomar-asks-farmers-unions-leaders-to-offer-alternative-other-than-total-repeal/story-fE4Tbxo95PsbTeomz0W2iO.html

This time Air India has given responsibilities to a woman captain for the journey from San Fransico to Bengaluru via polar route,” an Air India official said.AI Captain Zoya Agarwal, who will be commanding the flight, and her team is very eagerly waiting to create history on January 9. “Most people in the world will not see the North Pole or even its map in their lifetime. I feel truly feel privileged and humbled by the trust posed in me by the civil aviation ministry and our flag carrier. It is a golden opportunity to command a Boeing 777 inaugural SFO-BLR, one of the world’s longest flight over the North Pole,” Captain Zoya Agarwal told ANI.“I am extremely proud to have with me experienced women team comprising Captains Thanmai Papagari, Akanksha Sonawane and Shivani Manhas. This is the first time an all-women pilots team will fly over the North Pole and create a history of sorts. It’s indeed a dream come true for any professional pilot,” she added.According to aviation experts, flying over the North Pole is extremely technical and requires skill and experience.“The thrill of actually realising that you will be passing the North pole where the compass will flip 180 degrees...something which is fascinating indeed,” Captain Zoya said.The longest flight over the North Pole will be another feather in her cap as she was the youngest woman pilot to fly a Boeing-777 in 2013.“I am the youngest woman commander in the world on Boeing 777. Women should have self-belief even if they face societal pressure not consider any task impossible,” she said.She will become the first woman commander of Air India to command flight over the North Pole. Though Air India pilots have flown over polar route earlier also, it is for the first time a team women pilots will fly over the North Pole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-s-all-women-pilot-team-to-fly-over-north-pole-on-world-s-longest-air-route/story-vkmELZUvI3Qvzhh0Ch09iI.html

The next round of talks is now slated to take place on January 15. Tens of thousands of farmers are on protest for over a month, demanding the government scraps its pro-reform farm laws approved by Parliament in September.“The government has said it cannot and will not repeal the laws,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader who was present at the talks. ALSO WATCH | Farmers, Centre hold 8th round of talks to find ‘solutions’ amid protest The first session of the talks, which ended a short while ago, saw the farmers hardening their stand, who said they were interested only in a repeal of the laws. According to Kuruganti, farm leaders raised slogans inside the meet to make their stand clear, “We will either die or win.” Also read: Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi: UN-designated terrorist, 26/11 mastermindThree Union ministers — Narendra Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash - who are representing the Centre had met Union home minister Amit Shah before heading into the talks. Farm minister Narendra Tomar, opening the negotiations, said that the three federal laws to open up agricultural markets apply to the whole of the country and many farmer organisations support the laws. “The government said it couldn’t repeal the laws and is ready to discuss anything farmers find objectionable,” Balbir Singh Rajewal, a farm leader, told HT from inside the venue. Rajewal, who opened the negotiations from the farmers’ side, said the farmers won’t give up their agitation unless the laws are repealed. The farmers raised the issue of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders from Punjab calling protesting farm leaders names and branding them Khalistanis, a reference to the Sikh separatist movement. “We told the government that this is highly objectionable. On one hand, the government is negotiating with farmers, while the ruling party’s leaders are trying to tarnish our movement all the time,” Rajewal said.

The seventh round of talks, held on January 4, had ended in a stalemate too. While the farmers pressed the government to repeal the three agricultural laws, farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not possible to commit to a repeal.  In the previous round of talks, held on December 30, the government agreed to two demands of the farmers. One, the government had agreed not to pay direct cash to farmers instead of power subsidy for agricultural use, which the farmers argue would increase power costs for them. Two, the government had agreed to keep farmers out of the ambit of an anti-pollution law that prescribes harsh penalties for crop-residue burning.  Farmers are demanding a repeal of three pro-reforms laws as well as a legal guarantee for federally fixed minimum support prices.  The laws remove restrictions on the purchase and sale of farm produce, lift constraints on stockpiling under the 1955 Essential Commodities Act, and enable contract farming based on written agreements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cannot-and-will-not-repeal-laws-says-centre-as-farm-talks-hit-another-stalemate/story-eRQEIanpllKQcvV2AsWVqN.html

As if to counter the opposition parties, which sought to link his Christian faith to his government’s alleged failure to prevent the attacks on Hindu temples, Jagan performed the ‘Bhumi Pujan’ ceremony of the Sri Seethamma Vari Padalu (Sita’s feet) temple on the banks of Krishna river. Wearing a traditional Hindu attire of silk ‘dhoti’ and ‘uttareeyam’ (scarf) and sporting a ‘tilak’ on his forehead, Jagan laid the foundation stone for the temple amidst chanting of Vedic hymns. He also unveiled another plaque for the construction of Shaneeshwara Swamy temple close by. Later, the chief minister visited goddess Kanaka Durga Temple atop Indrakeeladri hill in Vijayawada and launched eight development projects worth Rs 77 crore from inside the temple premises. After having a ‘darshan’ of the goddess, he received Veda Asheerwachanam (Vedic blessings) from the temple priests, before unveiling the annual calendar of endowments department. Several ministers, AP Brahmin Corporation Chairman Malladi Vishnu, other MLAs, endowments secretary Girija Shankar and others were present. According to official figures, as many as 40 temples and two Muslim religious structures were demolished, all along the Krishna river near Vijayawada, by the then Chandrababu Naidu government for road widening during the Krishna Pushkarams held in 2016. The demolitions triggered a lot of protests from Hindu groups at that time. Now, the Jagan government took the decision to reconstruct nine major temples, out of these 40, in the wake of large scale protests from the TDP, BJP and various Hindu groups over the vandalization of temples in the recent past.Also Read: Arrested ex-Andhra minister prime accused in kidnapping case, say policeThe desecration of Lord Rama idol at Ramatirtham temple in Vizianagaram district on the night of December 28 triggered a nation-wide outrage, landing the government in an embarrassing situation and forcing it to order a CID inquiry. On Thursday night, the government issued an order constituting a state-level eight-member communal harmony committee with the chief secretary as its chairman and the director general of police as its vice-chairman. The panel would monitor the security at all religious structures and monuments, besides, formulating an action plan to ensure communal harmony, among other things. Similar communal harmony committees will also be constituted at the district-level, headed by respective district collectors. Meanwhile, the TDP ridiculed Jagan’s move to reconstruct temples and described it as a big drama to divert the people’s attention from the recent attacks on various temples. TDP general secretary Panchumarthi Anuradha said all the temples demolished during the road widening project were relocated and developed during the TDP regime. “If the chief minister has so much concern for Hinduism, why did he stall the construction of Lord Venkateshwara Swamy temple by TTD at Amaravati?” she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/andhra-pradesh/jagan-answers-criticism-over-temple-vandalism-with-bhumi-pujan-for-9-temples/story-6aNkXLN1i8P14E8IWwJTnO.html

A 50-year-old Anganwadi worker was gang-raped and murdered by a priest and his two aides in Budaun district on January 3. All the accused have been arrested by the state police.“Will we be able to ensure women’s safety with this behaviour? Members of the Women’s Commission are blaming the victim for the rape. The Budaun administration is concerned about who leaked the post-mortem result of the victim,” Priyanka Gandhi wrote on Facebook in Hindi.NCW’s Chandramukhi Devi had stoked controversy when she reportedly blamed the Budaun rape victim, saying if the woman did not go alone, the crime could have been avoided. “I think if she (the victim) had not gone out in the evening or was accompanied by a family member, maybe this incident could have been avoided,” Devi said while addressing reporters after she met the victim’s family. She added that the victim could also have been saved if the police showed swiftness.Also Read| Temple priest, prime accused in Badaun rape-murder case, arrestedGandhi cited another incident of rape reported from Moradabad and said that women would never forgive this administrative system. “Remember that at this time, the victim of Moradabad is fighting a battle against death in another horrific rape case.

The Delhi government order has stated that this protocol will be strictly followed in Delhi on a trial basis for a week till January 14.The new variant of coronavirus disease – B.1.1.7 – has been dubbed as highly infectious by scientists and medical experts as the UK government has confirmed that the infection rates have increased faster than expected in the affected areas where the new strain has been circulating and stronger measures are required to get the virus under control.Four more Delhi residents had tested positive for the new coronavirus strain, news agency PTI reported on Thursday, even as health minister Satyendar Jain appealed to the Centre to extend the ban on flights between India and the UK till the end of January.The total number of people found infected with the mutant variant of Covid-19 that was first detected in the UK now stands at 13 in Delhi.Four more samples sent for genome sequencing have been found positive, as part of the door-to-door medical checkup of people who had recently arrived from the UK and persons who came in their contact in the city, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-protect-delhiites-delhi-govt-announces-rules-for-uk-returnees/story-GvrtHmwTHBhuaqDD9SOO2K.html
08-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand HC stays wildlife board nod to de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve||Uttarakhand high court on Friday stayed the approval given by the State Wildlife Advisory Board on November 24, 2020, for de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve. The board had taken the decision to pave the way for the expansion of Dehradun airport project. The high court has sought reply from the state government, Centre, State Biodiversity Board and State Wildlife Board in the matter. A division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice Lok Pal Singh issued these directions while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Dehradun-based activist Reenu Paul. Abhijay Negi, counsel of the petitioner, said the PIL pointed out to HC that “Supreme Court in a recent decision delivered by a three-judge bench led by the Chief Justice of India on October 14, 2020, had passed several guidelines for elephant conservation and the decision of the Uttarakhand State Wildlife Board was in the teeth of the said decision of the apex court.” Also read | Unusual wildfires in Uttarakhand: Officials blame scanty rain, combustible materialCiting provisions of the Biological Diversity Act 2002 and the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, the petitioner argued that “it was not open to the State Wildlife Board to denotify the Shivalik Elephant Reserve in such a summery manner without assessing the ecological catastrophe that it can push the state and the entire region into”. In September last year, the state government had written to the Union environment ministry for obtaining prior approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 87.0815 hectares of forest land for “Expansion of the Jolly Grant Airport.” This land falls within the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. Officials estimate that about 10,000 trees will be felled for the expansion. In October, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change wrote to the state government that it “may explore alternatives for the proposal such as acquiring area lying north of the existing runway…the entire proposed forest area for diversion falls within the Shivalik Elephant Reserve and elephant corridors within its 1km radius. Moreover, the notified Kansaro-Barkot Elephant Corridor is located within 5km radius. The state government should consider avoiding these sensitive areas and explore alternative lands.” In November, responding to ministry’s letter, the state government said an alternative land will not serve the purpose as the existing runway needs to be expanded and with alternative land, a completely new airport will have to be established. Following the board’s decision on de-notification in November, state forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had said, “The State Wildlife Board, during its 16th meeting, approved the de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve as there is no law to define an elephant reserve. In the late 90s and early 2000s, the state government had sent a proposal to the Centre seeking a clarification regarding the said area, after which it was notified as an elephant reserve in 2002. But as per the norms of the Central government, there is no law or Act yet under which the legal status of an elephant reserve is defined.” Uttarakhand has over 2,000 elephants at present, according to the elephant census released in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-stays-wildlife-board-nod-to-de-notification-of-shivalik-elephant-reserve/story-gFb1B6WolEbtY4SNlnTQxO.html

The ban on flights to the UK was lifted on January 6. 30 flights will operate each week - 15 each by Indian and UK carriers. This schedule will continue till January 23, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had informed earlier.

The government of India should reconsider the decision to resuming flights from Britain after January 7,” the Rajasthan CM said. Kejriwal asked why the ban had been lifted and urged for it to be extended till January 31. “With great difficulty, people have brought the COVID situation in control. UK’s COVID situation is very serious. Now, why lift the ban and expose our people to risk? Centre has decided to lift the ban and start UK flights. In view of the extremely serious COVID situation in the UK, I would urge the central government to extend the ban till January 31,” he wrote. The total number of people who tested positive for the new UK strain of the Coronavirus in India reached 75 on Thursday, the special surveillance report issued by the central government said.As per the report, a total of 4,858 people have been traced who traveled between India and the UK after the cases of infection by new variant came to light.“A total 1,211 travellers from the UK have completed 28 days from their arrival in India. out of 75 people infected with UK variant of Covid-19, 33 were found in Mumbai, 14 in Pune, eight in Thane, nine in Nagpur, two each in Nashik, Aurangabad, Raigad and Buldhana, and one each in Osmanabad, Nanded and Washim,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-from-uk-resume-today-amid-scare-about-new-coronavirus-strain/story-K9lf3oQ8lJKyLBlSUTIulI.html

08-01-2021||India||‘Repeal farm laws today itself’: Farmers message to govt ahead of talks||Adamant on the repeal of three contentious farm laws, farm union leaders on Friday reiterated their pointed demand seeking rollback of the legislations ahead of their eighth round of talks with the government.“There is no scope of clause-wise talks. The government should hold a meeting to repeal these laws today itself,” says Balvinder Singh Raju, a farmer told news agency ANI on Friday.Signalling hope, Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, “We are going for talks with the hope that there will be a resolution today.”The eighth round of talks between three Union ministers - Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash - and the farmer unions to end the more than a month long agitation is scheduled to begin at the Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi at 2 pm. Tomar is likely to call on Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the issue before the talks begin, reported news agency ANI.So far the farmers and the government have engaged in seven rounds of talks to end the deadlock but inconclusively. Thousands of farmers have been camping on Delhi’s borders in bitter cold as a statement of protest against the three agricultural laws cleared by the Parliament in September last year. Another farm union leader stated that they are hoping for the best but are prepared for the worst. “The minister yesterday categorically declared that repeal of farm laws is not accepted. I don’t know what will happen during the discussions today. Anyway, we hope for the best and prepare for the worst,” Hannan Mollah, general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha said.Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhury hoped that a resolution will come out of Friday’s meeting. Talking to PTI, Choudhury said, “I am hopeful that a resolution will be reached at Friday’s meeting. We could have ended the deadlock by now had the protesting farmer unions discussed the issues raised at the first meeting.” There was no demand for a repeal of the three farm laws at the first meeting, he added.The protests - longest such demonstration in decades of Independent India - have entered the seventh week and shows no signs of abating as the farmers have refused to halt them till their demands are met. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law. The government has made it clear that it won’t scrap these laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repeal-farm-laws-today-itself-farmers-message-to-govt-ahead-of-talks/story-tZFSlduVKuKEzArmxEgnbN.html

08-01-2021||India||Global terrorist Masood Azhar is finally a wanted man in Pak. Dawood next?||The arrest warrant issued against Maulana Masood Azhar, the chief of the proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), is the first small step against the global terrorist who was claimed by Islamabad to have disappeared. Pakistani diplomats last year told the global anti-terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that it hadn’t been able to take action against Masood Azhar because he was missing. Indian officials had then rebutted Pakistan, pointing that he was still holed up in his bomb-proof house behind the terror group’s Bahawalpur headquarters at Markaz-e-Usman-o-Ali, Railway Link Road, in Pakistan.The FATF kept Islamabad in its ‘grey list’ that continued to make it difficult for Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government to get financial aid from international lending agencies such as the IMF. As he faces the most serious challenge from a combined opposition that has been mobilising public opinion against him, Pakistan watchers say that Imran Khan’s best chance to hold power is to get the economy back on rails to ensure that the opposition campaign doesn’t find traction with the people. By most accounts, it isn’t easy.Indian officials explain Pakistan’s recent steps - a warrant against Azhar who had been shielded for a decade at UN Security Council meetings by Islamabad as well as Beijing and the arrest of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s operations commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi - to indicate Islamabad’s desperation to get off the ‘grey list’.Pakistan watchers believe that Islamabad would use its leverage with the Quetta-based Taliban Shura in Afghanistan to conclude a deal with the incoming Joe Biden administration to seek the US support for Islamabad at the FATF meetings in exchange for its support for the peace talks. Pakistan’s deep state is also expected to use its capacity to calibrate violence in Afghanistan to convince the US administration.Also Read: ‘Brief the boss’: The backstory of Masood Azhar’s global terror tagOfficials underline that neither of the two of Pakistan’s most prominent faces of terrorism faces charges for terrorism and killing scores of people but for terror financing. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi was the Lashkar commander who had plotted and supervised the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.“But the baby steps are also important for the message they hold,” an Indian counter-terror official said, a reference to the pressure on the Imran Khan government to get off the FATF’s grey list. At the last meeting, the FATF had repeated its warning to his government to take more steps or risk being blacklisted.The official said it was true that the arrest warrant against Azhar and Lakhvi’s arrest were reversible steps. Lakhvi did spend time behind bars after the 26/11 attacks - he lived in “relative luxury” and fathered a child while in prison on terror charges - but was set free when the global pressure on Islamabad eased.“But at the same time, these steps also imply progress, however gradual it may be,” the official said.It is in this context that Indian officials believe that pressure is mounting to take steps against Dawood Ibrahim, once the Mumbai don who crossed the line when he plotted the March 1993 bombings in the city before fleeing the country.Dawood Ibrahim has been living in Karachi from where he has controlled South Asia’s biggest crime syndicate for most of the last two decades. Islamabad has all along claimed that Dawood Ibrahim was not in Pakistan despite documentary evidence produced by India that places him in Karachi.Also Read: Why one of India’s most wanted Dawood Ibrahim continues to be a fugitiveIndian officials said action against Dawood Ibrahim would be the acid test for the Imran Khan government’s efforts to project that it was serious on acting against terrorism. Dawood Ibrahim is well-entrenched in Pakistan’s power circuit. In 2005, Dawood - also designated as a global terrorist by the UNSC and US - married off his daughter Mahrukh to Junaid Miandad, son of former Pakistani cricketer Javed Miandad. According to Indian intelligence, Mahrukh and Junaid have secured Portuguese passports that would let them leave the country if things get too hot.Abu Salem, who was once a close associate of Dawood Ibrahim and had escaped to Pakistan after the 1993 before he fell out, had also moved to Portugal where he was finally arrested in 2002 and extradited to India three years later.Incidentally, Masood Azhar had entered India on a fake Portuguese passport in January 1994 when he was arrested in Jammu and Kashmir two weeks later. He had dodged immigration officials’ queries about his Portugese passport, claiming that he was a Gujarati by birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-terrorist-masood-azhar-is-finally-a-wanted-man-in-pak-dawood-next/story-3KXKEO37mDaEd2BREvggiJ.html

For Europe, it was the warmest year on record, 0.4 degree Celsius (°C) warmer than 2019 which was previously the warmest year on record for the continent, according to the latest data from Copernicus Climate Change Service of the European Union.Also read | Climate change-led migration in India could treble by 2050: ReportScientists observed that 2020 ties with 2016 despite the cooling effect of La Niña, whereas the latter was a record year that began with the strong warming effect of El Niño. This essentially means that the impact of global warming has become more pronounced.“The fact that 2020 tied with 2016 as the warmest year on record is another stark reminder that human-induced climate change continues unabated. This is particularly remarkable, as 2020 was not under the influence of an El Niño, a mode of natural climate variability in the tropical Pacific which ‘supercharged’ 2016 with extra heat. 2020 did not have such a ‘boost’, yet it almost exceeded the previous record holder. In fact, only a notably colder December (compared to November) prevented 2020 from becoming the new stand-alone warmest year,” said Karsten Haustein, Scientist at the Climate Service Center Germany (GERICS), in a statement.The carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have continued to rise at a rate of around 2.3 parts per million/year in 2020 reaching a maximum of 413 ppm during May 2020. Last year was 0.6 °C warmer than the standard 1981-2010 reference period and around 1.25 °C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial period, according to Copernicus service. This makes the last six years the warmest six on record.The highest warming was recorded over the Arctic and northern Siberia where the mean temperature was over 6°C above the average for the reference period of 1981-2010.Last year was the eighth warmest for India also since the country started keeping records in 1901, according to the India Meteorological Department’s statement on Climate of India in 2020.During the year, the annual average temperature in the country was 0.29°C above normal (29-year average from 1981-2010). In 2016, India recorded the warmest year when the mean land surface temperature was 0.71°C above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2020-was-as-warm-as-2016-despite-cooling-la-nina-effect-study/story-W2qJkPw5HNmCuSDMUfuCuL.html

08-01-2021||India||PETA urges Tamil Nadu government to withdraw jallikattu order||People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has appealed to the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw the order to conduct jallikattu (bull taming sport) citing a letter written by 52 doctors from across the country to chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and health minister C Vijayabhaskar. The letter calls the sport a non-essential activity which will lead to Covid-19 spread.“If huge crowds gather to torment bulls, society will be tormented,” said PETA India research associate Dr Anikta Pandey in a statement. Incidentally, minister for revenue and disaster management RB Udhayakumar on Thursday said that Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam, along with senior ministers, will flag-off a jallikattu event in Madurai’s Alanganallur on January 16. He spoke to reporters after inspecting the location. Activists have called this a political decision as Tamil Nadu goes to assembly polls in April or May this year.The letter shared by PETA is signed by doctors and healthcare professionals predominantly from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand besides Tamil Nadu, New Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. “The highly contagious nature of the disease and the way participants and spectators inevitably come into contact in such mass gatherings, even with precautions planned by the Tamil Nadu government, the risk of infection is high,” the letter from the medical representatives said. On December 23, the state allowed jallikattu to be conducted during the Pongal festival following Covid-19 restrictions. Participants must undergo an RT-PCR test from government recognised labs and submit a negative certificate. The number of players will be limited to 150 per event. The spectators cannot exceed more than 50% of the capacity of the premises so that social distancing norms are followed and all viewers will have to wear masks. All entrants will be screened using a thermal scanner to check body temperature. The doctors’ statement warned that a clinical sample which shows a false-negative could be a source of infection. They added that the state which banned public celebrations from December 31, 2020 to January 1, 2021 should apply a similar logic to this event.In 2017, huge protests erupted across the state for the ban against jallikattu by the Supreme Court to be lifted. The Tamil Nadu government unanimously enacted a legislation to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, to “preserve the cultural heritage and ensure the survival and continuance of native breeds of bulls”. PETA stated that since 2017, at least 22 bulls and 57 people have died while 3,632 people were injured during jallikattu events organised across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/peta-urges-tamil-nadu-government-to-withdraw-jallikattu-order/story-SCPKLIHTo8sIy8Il0R7A2L.html
08-01-2021||India||Shiv Sena criticises Bihar govt over rising crime rate, lawlessness||Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ on Friday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party and Nitish Kumar over the increasing crime and deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar.Talking about the recent incident of murder of the 22-year-old son of a teacher in Muzaffarpur, Shiv Sena in its editorial said “The shocking thing in this incident is that the cousin of the deceased is an IPS officer, yet the criminals did not take have fear before executing the incident.”Taking about another incident from Muzaffarnagar itself, where a class 10th girl was raped at gunpoint and when the family reached to the police for an FIR, the police did not take the complaint seriously like all other incidents.This picture is not only of Muzaffarpur but this situation same everywhere in Bihar. Then be it Darbhanga or Jehanabad, Bhagalpur or Araria, Supaul or Purnia or Gopalganj or the capital Patna. Criminals are fearlessly orchestrating a crime in the state, it said.In Bihar, the figures of murders, gangrape, rape, extortion, kidnapping, abducted marriage, molestation and bullying are competing with Uttar Pradesh, if the public starts to feel like this, then there are facts in it, the editorial alleged.Whether it is Chief Minister Nitish Kumar or the Bharatiya Janata Party in power, both do not seem to have any special concern with this ground reality, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece said.Both parties are still engaged in setting mutual political scores. Some are doing political harvesting, while some are making the audio viral and tarnishing the image of the other, it said.The BJP is engaged in gathering the MLAs of its allies and supporters, but as it appears every citizen of Bihar felt as with this exercise it is rapidly losing the trust of its allies and the people of the state. Criminals and mafia are taking advantage of this situation of this anarchy in Bihar, it alleged.The graph of crime organised under the protection of the police is rising rapidly. The rate of crime in Bihar has overtaken the pandemic.The publication goes on to state that the condition in Bihar is that on average, 4 cases of murders and rapes are being reported here every day. According to the SCRB i.e. State Crime Records Bureau, as of September last year, a total of 2,406 murders and 1,106 rapes were reported in the state.During the election, crime was at the top and the government and its associates were busy in play the election game by showing the dream of crime-free Bihar.Even after the elections, crime figures kept on increasing and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar could not do anything beyond the high-level meeting with the police officers.Nitish Kumar has probably realized the worsening situation in the state. So now he is trying to show the fear of CID to police by saying CID has eyes on the law and order situation in the state, on the other hand, by breaking the protocol, he is also interacting with the public on the streets of Patna.The Bihar Chief Minister may get a photo opportunity from this interaction, but to regain the lost faith of the public, he will have to use a stronger dose of vaccine for crime than corona because the statistics have proven that the crime rates ae more as compare to corona in Bihar, it said.Therefore, he should understand that if he is not able to provide safety and security to the crowd in which he is standing and having a photo session with women, students and children and trying to compensate for his political loss, then his future lies in the same crowd of people, the publication added.“It is the wish of all Biharis to have a happy Bihar and to have a vaccine to control both corona and crime. It is also the wish of the people that there is ‘Good Governance’ in Bihar!” it went on to state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-criticizes-bihar-govt-over-rising-crime-rate-lawlessness/story-bclJAqOq6QUeaRrBIrpkkN.html
08-01-2021||India||‘PM Modi should take first shot of Covid-19 vaccine’: Tej Pratap Yadav||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tej Pratap Yadav joined the growing voices of opposition leaders who are against taking the coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine shot when it becomes available in the country. Yadav said on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should lead and take the first shot of Covid-19 vaccine, following which others will also get it.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take first shot of Covid-19 vaccine, then, we will also take it,” said the Bihar politician, reported news agency ANI.The RJD leader’s comments come in the backdrop of staunch disapproval from several leaders from the opposition including Congress’ Manish Tewari and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav.Earlier this week, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said that the state government was all prepared for administering Covid 19 vaccinations across the state.“We are prepared for administering vaccination in Bihar,” he said at a function and spelled out the priority list for Covid-19 vaccination.“The vaccination will be done in accordance with the Centres guidelines and priority will be given to those who are more than 50 years of age or are involved in professions like health care, frontline workers, priority age groups, public representatives, all people engaged in government works, contract workers, shopkeepers, traders and all vulnerable groups, etc.,” the CM had said.Congress leaders Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh have expressed concerns regarding Covaxin, the vaccine made by Bharat Biotech and recently approved by Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). “A number of eminent etymologists and other medical practitioners have expressed surprise with regard to the fact that this vaccine has been cleared without phase III trials having been completed,” Tewari said. “This obviously raises questions with regard to the efficacy of the vaccine.”“In other words, those Indians who would be administered Covaxin would, in effect, be volunteers for the required third stage clinical trial - without the mandatory ‘informed consent’. This is, to put it mildly, highly unusual. It is also ethically dubious,” Tharoor said.In a tweet, Ramesh said, “Bharat Biotech is a first-rate enterprise, but it is puzzling that internationally-accepted protocols relating to phase 3 trials are being modified for Covaxin. Health Minister @drharshvardhan should clarify.”Congress leader Anand Sharma-led parliamentary standing committee on home affairs has also advised caution in granting emergency approval to the vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-take-first-shot-of-covid-19-vaccine-tej-pratap-yadav/story-jEZgbspBVHHYSPG3uYpBgI.html

But this was pre-planned as she was called through a phone call. She went (out) and then returned in such a state,” Devi said.The prime accused in the case, a temple priest, was arrested in a late night crackdown by the police in Thursday along with his two aides.The 50-year-old anganwadi worker, who had gone to a temple on the outskirts of her village, was found dead on Sunday. According to the police complaint, the temple priest and his aides brought her body to her house in a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and told her family members that she fell into the dry well on the temple premises.Also Read: Akhilesh Yadav sets up 3-member panel to ‘probe’ Badaun gang-rape and murderThe victim’s family members accused the temple priest and his aides of raping and murdering her and a case was registered against them.Devi met the family of the victim and took stock of the action taken by officials in the case. The Station House Officer (SHO) of the area has been suspended.The incident was “most sickening and unfortunate”, she said, pointing out that suspending the SHO was not enough. “The incident was most heinous and strict action should be taken.

They had taken police protection to seal the building on Wednesday but the operation was suspended after TNTJ protested saying it was not served any notice.TNTJ, an Islamic organisation founded in 2004, said they have been paying Rs4 lakh rent annually for 12 years to the government-appointed custodian of the property.The Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI), which is empowered to appropriate properties of Pakistani nationals in India, took over the building after its owner, Tuba Khaleeli, settled in Pakistan in the 1960s.Also Read: Wilson murder case: NIA arrests accused man from Chennai airportI Ansari, the group’s state secretary, said TNTJ’s former general sectary R Rehamatullah runs a wholesale lungi business from the building. “...social welfare activities of TNTJ have also been on-going for 12 years. All the rental bills are in his name and we have been ready to purchase this after the 2017 amendment (to the Enemy Property Act, 1968). So how can they suddenly come to seal the building with no notice or prior information? We are readying our legal recourse.”A CEPI official said issuing notices is not part of their procedures. “They [TNTJ] asked for two days... we agreed and that will serve as the notice period. Following that we will seal the building because they have violated the rules.”The Centre in January last year formed a panel to monitor the sale of enemy properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-thowheed-jamath-s-office-faces-sealing-for-violating-rules/story-OqA89KYnSek3TE5Q360NOI.html

08-01-2021||India||UP Congress leaders camp in districts, Priyanka Gandhi monitors progress||In an effort to take the Congress to the grassroots in Uttar Pradesh, a team of about 80 to 100 leaders have begun camping in different districts for the party’s “sangathan srajan” programme, which was launched on January 3. The programme runs till January 25.Under the programme, the party proposes to set up its units in all the 8,000 ‘nyay panchayats’ wards in urban areas to bolster the party’s chances in the state polls to be held next year. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is monitoring the exercise and may soon visit a district in any zone to make an on-the-spot assessment. “We are following the exercise of setting up and holding meetings of nearly 8,000 nyay panchayat units under the programme. This programme has been organised all over the state at the behest of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. We also propose to set up nearly 60,000 village level units by next month,” said UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu who camped in Sultanpur and Faizabad districts on Thursday. Lallu though did not give any programme of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit but said there were indications of her visit to any district soon. Five All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretaries Jubair Khan, Dheeraj Gujar, Bajirao Khade, Sachin Naik and Rohit Chaudhary along with teams of UPCC office bearers and other youth leaders have also begun camping in districts allotted to them. “We are closely following the exercise. No meeting of nyay panchayat is considered complete unless attendance of party’s representatives of all the villages under the respective nyay panchayat is verified. As nyay panchayats will lead to setting up of nearly 20,575 member committees in 823 blocks of the state the party will have a verified and committed team of more than 28,000 leaders ready at the grassroots level soon,” said UPCC organisation secretary Anil Yadav. Besides setting up the units at nyay panchayat levels, the Congress also proposes to focus on setting up ward units in the cities. Yadav said, “Our city units have begun setting up party structures at the ward levels. We hope to complete the same after completion of nyay panchayat level exercise.” Taking a cue from the exercise being carried out in rural areas the city unit presidents in many districts have already begun setting up ward units. “We have already set up our units in 45 out of 110 wards. We will complete the exercise in all the wards by the deadline,” said Lucknow City Congress Committee president Mukesh Chauhan. As the Congress proposes to change its district president in some districts, the announcement about setting up nyay panchayat units there may be delayed. “Four district units may see new presidents soon. Any announcement about setting up the nyay panchayat units or the ward units in these districts may not be made now,” said an office bearer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-congress-leaders-camp-in-districts-priyanka-gandhi-monitors-progress/story-AN5iL0nnD0PG1vH7ATGlzK.html
08-01-2021||India||Kerala’s spurt in Covid cases due to robust surveillance: Health Minister||After managing to flatten the Covid-19 curve within months of reporting the country’s first coronavirus case last year, Kerala is now grappling with a sharp surge in its daily infections, prompting the Centre to send a high-level team to assist it.However, the state government maintains the “high numbers” are a result of robust surveillance and reporting system, while pointing to its low fatality rate.Close to 40,000 cases have been reported from the southern state in the last week alone, with a daily addition of around 5,000, even as its neighbours and other high prevalence states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have started seeing a reversal.As of Thursday, Kerala recorded 5,051 new coronavirus cases, including four UK returnees and 5,638 recoveries as the total caseload inched towards the eight lakh mark.The toll stood at 3,234 while the active cases are nearly 65,000.“The rise in the number of cases in the state is due to a robust surveillance and reporting system. We managed to delay the peak of the pandemic and upgraded the threshold of our health system.” “Our ultimate aim is to save the lives of the people and reduce the mortality rate. Even with this high number of cases, we managed to reduce the death rate,” Health Minister KK Shailaja told PTI.She said the upward graph could also be attributed to the recently concluded local body polls, swept by the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF.The state saw the virus curve flatten in April-May last year, even as it witnessed an increase in the cases later in the wake of the return of Keralites from abroad following the lockdown.Shailaja said Kerala managed to maintain a very low case fatality rate in the state even as it was in a vulnerable position with high population density, high number of old-age population and the most number of diabetic patients.“Yes there is an increase in cases due to the recently concluded local body polls and all. But we need to understand that the pandemic is still here and the lockdown restrictions were eased. The most scientific method of approach in connection with a pandemic is to delay the peak of it.” “Many nations faced a shortage of beds as the cases peaked and choked their health system resulting in high mortality rates,” she added.When asked about the state accounting for over 25% of new cases in the country, she said “it is meaningless to say that Kerala’s situation is worse.” “In certain other states, when they reached the peak of the pandemic, thousands had lost their lives and their health systems were choked. It is meaningless to say that Kerala’s situation is worse as we have a high number of positive cases. They are not considering the case fatality rate.“Look at the example of Dharavi (in Mumbai). They have done a good job there. But the pandemic was contained there after nearly 400 deaths,” the minister said.She inissted the state delayed the peak of the pandemic by “maintaining a stable plateau” without a sudden surge in cases and “the advantage is that we could maintain the number of cases within the potential threshold of our health care system giving us breathing space”.By delaying the peak of the pandemic, the government increased the number of ICUs, ventilators in the hospitals and oxygen supply has been ensured to all beds.“Even though there was an increase in the number of cases, it has only taken up 50% of our hospital capacity. Similarly, we are using only 50% of our ICUs, and only 40% of our ventilators are filled. Our case fatality rate is at 0.4%,” she said.On the Centre deputing a team, headed by the Director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr SK Singh to support public health interventions for Covid-19 management in Kerala, Shailaja welcomed the move.“It is always good to have a central team visiting the state. We can explain to them the steps taken by us in containing the virus,” she added.Public Health officials of the state say the percentage of active cases is high in Kerala because of the state’s discharge policy which stipulates that the patient should record a negative result before discharge.“Our increased number of cases at this period of time is rather a reflection of our success of implementing the delaying of the peak of the pandemic rather than our failure.That is the way we deal with a pandemic. The only question that will be asked at the end of the pandemic is how many lives we have saved and at what cost,” Dr Mohammed Asheel, Director of Social Security Mission said.A senior public health official from the state told PTI that along with the case fatality rate, “it is equally important to keep the system from being over stretched.” The official said Kerala never had any issue of shortage of beds in ICUs in the hospitals.“We never had any issue of shortage of oxygen. Such lapses are being reported even from developed nations. In Kerala such a situation will never arise as we are all prepared. Still we need our numbers to come down and for that public should take the responsibility,” the official said.While the total virus caseload in the state has mounted to 7,95,933, recoveries have touched 7,28,060 and the active cases stand at 64,445, as of Thursday.At least 1,93,370 people are under observation in various districts, including 11,435 in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kerala/kerala-s-spurt-in-covid-cases-due-to-robust-surveillance-health-minister/story-aQQOY72ur7wmBG9ankfu8K.html
08-01-2021||India||India to chair Taliban sanctions committee, to keep focus on terrorists, sponsors||India on Friday took a tacit swipe at Pakistan for backing cross-border terrorism as it announced it would be chairing three key UN sanctions committees, including the Taliban sanctions committee, during 2021-22. TS Tirumurti, India’s envoy to the UN, said the country had been asked to chair three important subsidiary bodies of the Security Council – the Taliban sanctions committee or the 1988 sanctions committee, the counter-terrorism committee and the Libya sanctions committee. The move follows India joining the Security Council as a non-permanent member for 2021-22. India will chair the Taliban sanctions committee – also called the 1988 sanctions committee as it was formed through resolution number 1988 in 2011 by splitting the 1267 sanctions regime on al-Qaeda – at a time when there is growing concern worldwide at alarming levels of violence in Afghanistan that has been blamed on the Taliban. Also Read: Afghanistan busted Chinese spy ring, kept it a secret. NDS chief explains why“The Taliban sanctions committee, also called the 1988 sanctions committee, has always been a high priority for India, keeping in mind our strong interest and commitment to peace, security, development and progress of Afghanistan,” Tirumurti said in a video message. Without naming Pakistan, he added: “Our chairing this committee at this juncture will help keep the focus on the presence of terrorists and their sponsors threatening the peace process in Afghanistan. It has been our view that peace process and violence cannot go hand in hand.” After a recent visit to Pakistan by a Taliban delegation led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, videos emerged of the group’s leaders visiting terror training camps on Pakistani soil and meeting injured fighters at a hospital in Karachi. One of the videos showed Baradar – the group’s main negotiator at the peace talks in Doha – telling Taliban members in Karachi that the group makes all decisions related to the peace talks after consulting its leadership and clerics’ council based in Pakistan. Referring to the counter-terrorism committee, which will be chaired by India in 2022, Tirumurti noted that the panel was formed in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York and that India had led it during its last stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council during 2011-12. He also noted that India would chair the counter-terrorism committee on the 75th anniversary of the country’s independence. “The chairing of this committee has special resonance of India, which has not only been in the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, but has also been one of its biggest victims,” he said. The Libya sanctions committee, also known as the 1970 sanctions committee, is a “very important subsidiary body” of the Security Council that implements a sanctions regime, including a two-way arms embargo, assets freeze, travel ban and measures to prevent illicit export of petroleum, Tirumurti said. India will chair this committee at a “critical juncture, when there is international focus on Libya and on the peace process” in that country, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-chair-taliban-sanctions-committee-envoy-says-will-keep-focus-on-terrorists-and-sponsors/story-wvqUHFGroJjNu1ivy7g07O.html

Chairing this Committee at this juncture will help keep the focus on the presence of terrorists and their sponsors, threatening the peace process in Afghanistan, he added. It is also called the 1988 Sanctions Committee.• The Libya Sanctions Committee is a very important subsidiary body of the council, which implements the sanctions regime, including a two-way arms embargo on Libya, an assets freeze, a travel ban, measures on illicit export of petroleum. “We will be assuming the Chair of this Committee at a critical juncture when there is an international focus on Libya and on their peace process,” Tirumurti said in a video message.• India will also chair the Counterterrorism Committee in 2022, which coincides with the 75th Anniversary of India’s Independence. It was formed in September 2001 soon after the tragic terrorist attack of 9/11 in New York. India had chaired this committee in the Security Council in 2011-12. “The chairing of this Committee has a special resonance for India, which has not only been at the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism but has also been one of its biggest victims,” said Tirumurti.India won the eighth term in an election last June securing 184 of the 192 votes cast.

The seats had fallen vacant after the election of Sushil Kumar Modi to Rajya Sabha and election of MLC Binod Narayan Jha to the Legislative Assembly. Though both the seats belong to BJP quota, NDA sources say, they can go to JD (U) to accommodate ministers Ashok Chowdhary and VIP leader Mukesh Sahani. Earlier, in the afternoon, Yadav and Jaiswal had a closed-door meeting with JD (U) national president R C P Singh at JD (U) party office for 30 minutes. “It was a normal courtesy call. RCP Singh has been elected as the national president of JD(U). I came to congratulate him on the behalf of my party. He has a long administrative and organisational experience,” Yadav said after meeting Singh.The JD (U) reciprocated the gesture by downplaying the Arunachal developments.“We are not sad. We are never sad and live happily,” said Singh after the meeting. “Everything (cabinet expansion) will be done at the right time. Top leadership is in touch with the chief minister,” he added. Yadav said that no other matter was discussed. “The NDA government under Nitish Kumar is strong. The issue of cabinet expansion is not a big issue. Everything will be done at an appropriate time,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-bjp-discuss-bihar-cabinet-expansion-1st-meeting-since-arunachal-jolt/story-0Ddb4xO6ZZXYExNFYSZWIM.html

08-01-2021||India||US to modify H1B visa selection process, to give priority to wages, skill level||The United States on Thursday announced that it will modify the selection process for H-1B visa, giving priority to salary and skills instead of the current lottery procedures. The final rule to be published in the federal register on January 8, officials said, is aimed to protect the economic interests of US workers and better ensure the most highly skilled foreign workers benefit from the temporary employment programme. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Modifying the H-1B cap selection process will incentivise employers to offer higher salaries, and/or petition for higher-skilled positions, and establish a more certain path for businesses to achieve personnel needs and remain globally competitive, said US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The final rule will be effective 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The next H-1B visa filing season is slated to start on April 1. “The H-1B temporary visa programme has been exploited and abused by employers primarily seeking to fill entry-level positions and reduce overall business costs,” said USCIS Deputy Director for Policy Joseph Edlow. “The current H-1B random selection process makes it difficult for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the programme to compete for the best and brightest international workforce, and has predominantly resulted in the annual influx of foreign labor placed in low-wage positions at the expense of US workers,” he said. This effort will only affect H-1B registrations (or petitions, if the registration process is suspended) submitted by prospective petitioners seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions. It will be implemented for both the H-1B regular cap and the H-1B advanced degree exemption, but it will not change the order of selection between the two as established by the H-1B registration final rule, USCIS said. The Department of Homeland Security had previously published a notice of proposed rulemaking on November 2, 2020. It carefully considered the public comments received before deciding to publish the proposed regulations as a final rule, USCIS said. According to the final rule, a version of which was released by Department of Homeland Security, Instead, a registration system that faithfully implements the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) while prioritising registrations based on wage level within each cap will incentivize H-1B employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled aliens that are commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection and eligibility to file an H-1B cap-subject petition. Moreover, it will maximize H-1B cap allocations, so that they more likely will go to the best and brightest workers; and it will disincentivise abuse of the H-1B programme to fill relatively lower-paid, lower-skilled positions, which is a significant problem under the present selection system, it said. “While administering a random lottery system is reasonable, it is inconsiderate of Congress’s statutory purposes for the H-1B program and its administration,” said the final rule. The changes in this final rule will apply to all registrations, including those for the advanced degree exemption, submitted on or after the effective date of the final rule. As per Congressional-mandated cap, USCIS in one year can issue a maximum of 65,000 H-1B visas. It can also issue another 20,000 H-1B visas to those foreign students who have completed higher studies from a US university in STEM subjects. During the public notice period, the department said, several commenters expressed support for the rule and the need to stop visa fraud, abuse, and flooding of petitions by certain staffing or consulting companies. One commenter said the proposed rule would disincentivize companies from abusing the H-1B programme and harming US workers. Other commenters said the proposed rule would decrease potential visa abuse by employers and make sure all workers were paid according to their skillset as employers no longer would be able to lower labor expenses by hiring foreign workers. Another said that the proposed rule would have a positive impact on US employees and college educated US citizens who take out loans for their education by making it harder for technology companies to discriminate against US citizens; US workers are being laid off in large numbers because corporations are outsourcing for profits; and the proposed rule is necessary because Indian corporations are acquiring US jobs, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-to-modify-h1b-visa-selection-process-to-give-priority-to-wages-skill-level/story-fyrRZuRcyQqpbQzFsdvUyJ.html

Here is all that you need to know about the laws, protests and the talks:1. The seventh round of talks over the scrapping of the laws ended in a stalemate on Monday as three Union ministers leading the negotiations said it was impossible for them to commit to a rollback of the legislation without wider consultations.2. The two sides agreed to continue the talks on January 8 (Friday) even as farm unions hardened their stand, saying farmers will drive into Delhi in their tractors to hold their own Republic Day parade if their demands of scrapping the laws are not met by January 26.Also Read: Tractor march, ‘healthy discussion’: Where farmers’ protest stands ahead of 8th meeting3. Tens of thousands of farmers on tractors held a rally near New Delhi on Thursday to build pressure on the government ahead of Republic Day.4. Farm union leaders have said they were prepared to intensify their agitation as the government has not been prepared to budge.5. The government has ruled out a repeal of the laws and asked farm unions to point out what they considered objectionable in the legislation.6. It has also sought to discuss the demand of a law guaranteeing assured prices for 23 farm commodities known as minimum support prices (MSP).7. The government has told farm leaders that it will review any clause farmers have a problem with but farms leaders have insisted on repealing the laws and bringing a law guaranteeing MSP.8. Some headway was made in the sixth round of talks on December 30 as the Centre agreed to exempt farmers from heavy fines for crop-residue burning as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance.9. The government promised to continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use. The discussion on demands of the repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee of MSP were deferred till January 8.10. Farmers launched one of the biggest strikes in decades last month to force the Centre to revoke the three laws.11. The laws change the way farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old government marketplaces.12. They allow traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down a national framework for contract farming.13. Farmer leaders have said the government’s “ego problem” was coming in the way of resolving the issues.14. They have insisted they would not relent on their key demands for the repeal and a legal guarantee for MSP as thousands of farmers have hunkered down at various Delhi border points for over a month against the laws.15. The protesting farmers have stayed put despite heavy rains and water logging at protest sites besides severe cold weather conditions saying the laws favour big corporations at their cost.16. Farm leaders have said they will implement their new protest agenda, which includes picketing of governor houses, toll plazas and boycott of goods and services of the Reliance and Adani groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eighth-round-of-talks-between-centre-farmer-leaders-today-all-you-need-to-know/story-qWJb6izV7v1x0F6MWCK2iK.html

08-01-2021||India||Fresh round of farmer-govt talks on three laws today||Farmers on protest for over a month demanding the scrapping of three agricultural laws will hold their eighth round of negotiations with the government on Friday. The government has refused to roll back the laws farmers say will hurt their incomes; the last round of talks on January 4 failed to end the impasse. On Friday, thousands of farmers staged a tractor march from their camps on Delhi’s borders to converge on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway, ahead of a planned march to the Capital on Republic Day. “There are media reports doing the rounds that the government has formulated a new proposal. There is no such thing. This is a game to divert media attention away from our successful tractor march today,” said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India and a leader of the farmers’ agitation. At the seventh round of talks on January 4, while the farmers pressed government to repeal the three agricultural laws approved by Parliament in September, farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not possible to commit to a repeal. “...we are again reminding the government ahead of tomorrow’s meeting that these laws should be completely repealed and remunerative MSP should be made into a legal right of all farmers,” Darshan Pal, a farmers’ leader, said. “...the farmers’ agitation will continue and we will enter the capital to celebrate Republic Day without disturbing the official parade if our demands are not met,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. “The government is ready to fulfil all the demands. But farmers are now saying that the laws be repealed...I think farmer unions don’t want a solution. I think their plan is something else,” Punjab BJP leader Surjit Kumar Jyani said after meeting home minister Amit Shah.Analysts say the government and farmers have to find a middle ground. “The repeal of the laws has to be a political call but it is possible to devise mechanisms such as price deficiency payments...,” said RS Mani, a former economist with Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-round-of-farmer-govt-talks-on-three-laws-today/story-klMkODrCD5izPUnwmoQCoL.html
08-01-2021||India||Cops book protesters, Cong leaders for rioting||A day after clashes broke out between protesting residents and the Goa Police, an uneasy calm prevailed in Xel-Melaulim village where the government has proposed setting up an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Goa campus on one million square metres of land. The Goa administration kept a strong police force of over 800 personnel on standby while officials remained huddled in series of meetings in a bid to work out a solution to the deadlock.The villagers, who had besieged the local Valpoi police station on Wednesday, too decided to call off a fresh protest.On Thursday, the Goa Police filed FIRs against a person identified as Vishwesh Prabhu and other unnamed persons for inciting, rioting and preventing government officials from conducting their duties, along with some Congress leaders. “The Valpoi police booked Congress’s Goa unit general secretary Sankalp Amonkar, party’s Valpoi block president Dasharath Mandrekar, the block’s women’s cell chief Roshan Desai and social activists Rama Kankonkar, Ranjeet Rane and others for instigating the crowd,” a senior police official said.The protesting villagers, who have set up a blockade at the entrance to the proposed site for the IIT, have for several months now been refusing to allow government surveyors to demarcate the land to be handed over for the construction of an IIT. Things reached a head on Tuesday when villagers forced surveyors to retreat. When the villagers continued to squat on the site on Wednesday, the police charged them with batons, which led to clashes. The Goa government has claimed that since it is government revenue land, ownership claims by villagers have no legal basis. Villagers have said that it was a colonial injustice that the government has continued in denying them rights to forested land that have sustained their families for generations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-book-protesters-cong-leaders-for-rioting/story-UB8xtDXvQ2MQ5BPo6jCYYI.html
08-01-2021||India||SC cites Tablighi event, asks whether protesting farmers safe from Covid||The Supreme Court on Thursday cited a large congregation at the Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters in Delhi in March that was blamed for a sharp increase in Covid-19 infections and asked the Centre what guidelines had been put in place to prevent a similar situation at the farmers’ protest sites on the Capital’s borders. It issued a notice seeking the Centre’s reply within two weeks. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde remarked: “This same problem is going to arise during the farmers’ protest. We do not know if farmers are being protected from Covid. What guidelines have you issued for prevention of such things?” “Have you learnt from your experience in handling this [Jamaat] event? Have you found out how it happened?” the bench, which also comprised justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre. Thousands of farmers have massed on Delhi’s borders since November 26 to protest against three laws seeking to open up agricultural markets that cultivators say would hurt their interests, weaken their bargaining power and leave them at the mercy of large agribusinesses. Mehta told the bench that an investigation of the Jamaat congregation was still underway by Delhi Police. He added that guidelines seeking to curb large gatherings were in place and sought two weeks to file a reply. The remarks were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation by Jammu-based lawyer Supriya Pandita for a CBI probe into the Jamaat gathering. Pandita’s lawyer, OP Parihar, cited the Jamaat gathering and added that the group’s chief Maulana Saad had not yet been arrested. The bench said it is not interested in one person. “We are interested in ensuring Covid guidelines are prepared and implemented.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-cites-tablighi-event-asks-whether-protesting-farmers-safe-from-covid/story-imZioGQswH6BHSPStRf96L.html
08-01-2021||India||‘For collective good’: UP defends ‘love jihad’||Community interest trumps an individual’s right to choose a life partner and the foremost duty of a secular state is to protect citizens from unlawful conversions, the Uttar Pradesh government told the Allahabad high court on Thursday, defending a contentious new anti-conversion law that critics allege violates constitutional rights.In an affidavit responding to a clutch of public interest litigations (PILs) challenging the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020, the state government said community and social interest are on a much higher pedestal than the right of two people to enter into wedlock.“When there is fear psychosis spread in the community at large and the community itself is endangered and succumbs to the pressure resulting in forceful conversion…it becomes necessary that the interest of the community as a whole requires protection and no microanalysis of individual interest can be looked into,” the affidavit, which HT has seen, read. “Community interest will always prevail over the individual interest.” The affidavit was submitted before a bench led by chief justice Govind Mathur. The UP ordinance was enacted on November 24 and prescribes a jail term up to 10 years and fine up to ₹25,000 for conversion under marriage, fraud, coercion or enticement. The law came into force days after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to fight against “love jihad”, a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. Several activists and legal experts have argued that the law could be used to target Muslims and infringed on the fundamental rights to equality, freedom of religion, and life and personal liberty.But the 35-page affidavit contended that the law sought to protect the dignity and interest of a woman while she exercised her right of persona liberty and chose a life partner. It also said that the people were feeling safe after the legislation came into force. “Once two adults agree to enter into a wedlock but if there is a fear psychosis in the community, then it is about the community interest rather than community thinking.This community interest is on a much higher pedestal than agreement of two individuals to enter into a wedlock,” the document read. “Community interest is synonymous to social interest which is equivalent to public interest.”The state’s additional advocate general Manish Goyal requested the case be adjourned indefinitely since the Supreme Court also issued notices on similar petitions on Wednesday. This plea was opposed by petitioners’ lawyers Devesh Saxena and Shashwat Anand. The bench proceeded to turn down the state government’s request, observing pendency of the matter before the apex court cannot be the sole reason for the high court to keep its hands off the case. The bench fixed the matter for a hearing on January 15. The state government also pointed out that the words “love jihad” were nowhere used in the ordinance and claimed the law was equally applicable to all forms of forced conversion, not just to interfaith marriages.“Thinking of family or community is not the foundation but the interest of the community and interest to keep the family safe, and as a consequence, the entire social fabric in a balanced position is the objective, for which the consent of two adult individuals has to be regulated. In this regard, there being no existing law in the state of UP, the present legislation seeks to cure the mischief...In fact, people have reposed faith and are feeling safe after coming into force of the present legislation,” stated the affidavit. The document also detailed four instances to illustrate what constituted forced conversion in the government’s view.A Hindu, Sikh or Muslim boy studying in a convent school, and a Christian family living as a tenant alongside non-Christian families constituted situations that didn’t amount to a forced conversion.But if Scheduled Caste person converts after being “lured” by a group of missionaries, or a Hindu woman marries a Muslim man, that could be an example of forced conversion, according to the government. In the latter case, the document said that after marriage, the woman will find herself under pressure to give up her faith even if she didn’t wish to; and stop worshipping idols and accept Islam so that she could have a valid marriage under the personal law and enjoy the right of inheritance in her husband’s properties. “This will amount to forceful conversion.The position remains the same if a Hindu boy wants to marry a Muslim girl. The Hindu boy will have to accept Islam.Here again, there is exercise of freedom of choice but loss of dignity, and the conversion is not exercised as a choice but on account of compulsion due to personal law intervening,” maintained the affidavit. According to the government, the ordinance intended to address this “conflict of interest” by safeguarding the inter-fundamental rights of individuals. The law did not aim at putting any fetters on the right of a woman to marry as per her choice but subjected it to “certain machinery provision which are regulatory in character”, it added.Justifying the urgency behind the ordinance instead of passing a bill in the state assembly, the government maintained that a rise in cases of forced conversions led to some heinous crimes and a public outcry. It also pointed out that similar statutes existed in eight other states, and countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The government further urged the high court to leave it to the executive to decide the questions relating to validity of a marriage, as provided under the ordinance, and not decide such issues in judicial proceedings. It cited a judgment by the United States Supreme Court to buttress this argument. On the question of the law placing the onus on the accused to prove his innocence as against the common principle of presumption of “innocence till proven guilty”, the affidavit said the burden of proof had rightly been placed on the accused since they will only have special knowledge of facts in these cases and that reverse onus is justified in cases of “social evil”. The state government also criticised the November 11 judgment by another bench of the high court, which held that the right to choose a partner, irrespective of religion, was intrinsic to “ the right to life and personal liberty”. That judgment was passed in a case related to an interfaith marriage between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man.The affidavit submitted that the HC judgment was “not a good law”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-collective-good-up-defends-love-jihad/story-O4J7iBG0SsbTEKuX3m1hRO.html

India’s drug regulator on January 3 approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech vaccine for restricted emergency use in the country. Officials have indicated that vaccination drive will begin in the second week of January.Friday’s mock drills are another attempt to test the infrastructure and the logistics that will play a major role in immunising the country of 1.3 billion people, and familiarise district- and block-level officials on all aspects of Covid-19 roll-out. The exercise will also involve testing the Co-WIN digital platform that will be the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system. The app will be used to provide real-time information on vaccine stock, cold storage status and help coordinate the dates and venue for vaccination with recipients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-nationwide-vaccine-dry-run-in-33-states-uts-today/story-iO39rySm5PDL0v6N7Kk2HP.html
08-01-2021||India||3,000 tractors at farmers’ march||A day ahead of their talks with the Centre, farmers protesting against the three farm laws took out a tractor march on the two ring highways around the Capital on Thursday. According to farm union leaders, nearly 3,000 tractors participated in the march on Kundli-Manesar-Palwal or Western Peripheral expressway and at least 500 on the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal or Eastern Peripheral expressway. Together, the two expressways form a ring around Delhi and were constructed to keep non-destined traffic away from Delhi in view of the rising air pollution. With speakers mounted on tractors playing songs of resistance, the protesters from the Singhu border had started the rally towards the other protest site at the Tikri border and vice-versa at 11 am. The farmers took a U-turn from the Kharkhauda-Bahardurgarh exit on the expressway around 1pm and returned to their protest sites by the evening.The tractor march in western UP began from the UP Gate at 9.30am. They drove on the inner lanes of the Delhi-Meerut expressway (DME) for about one hour to reach the EPE’s Dasna interchange (about 23 km). The farmers had earlier planned that from the Dasna interchange they would move to EPE up to Palwal. However, they cut the route short and went up to the Sirsa toll near Dankaur in Gautam Budh Nagar and returned to the UP Gate by 5.30pm. In Nuh district of Haryana, some farmers alleged that they were prevented from joining the rally. The protesters, along with local residents. They marched within the district. The protesters said Thursday’s march was just a trailer of their planned march on the Republic Day, if the government would not accept their demands. Jasbinder Kaur, 65, a resident of Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, rode on a tractor to participate in the rally. “My kids said that it would not be suitable for me to ride a tractor on a highway in this cold weather, but I insisted on joining them. I am here to fight for my future generations and will not return till these three black laws are revoked. It’s just a trailer. The picture will be released on January 26, when we all will march towards India Gate,” she said.Amarpreet Kaur, 18, said she has been attending the protest at the Tikri border for the last 40 days. “My father had died by suicide three years ago after he failed to repay a loan of Rs 6 lakh. We have been struggling to survive since then. I wanted to go to a good college in a big city like any other girl but I had to stay back in the village to help my mother in farming. The government wants to rob us of a small land left with us. It’s a dress rehearsal today. But it’s not even close to what will happen on 26 January. Thousands of farmers are joining us for the tractor march to India Gate that day,” she said.Many women were also seen riding the tractors during the rally. Among them was Harinder Bindu, a member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan). She said, “We want to tell the government that we are ready for as long as it takes. It will be better if the government listens to our demand at the earliest. We are living on highways in this biting cold. Who likes to live like this?” Farmer leaders said they received “overwhelming” support on Thursday. “Hundreds of tractors had joined us from Punjab and Haryana during the rally. Many of them did not go back and joined us at Singhu and Tikri to participate in the January 26 march to India Gate. The government should understand the range of our protest and accept our demands,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of BKU (Punjab). Farmers camping at Burari ground also took out a tractor march.Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said they had to close the EPE for traffic in the wake of the rally. “The regular commuter traffic faced disruptions at the DME when tractors drove to Dasna from UP-Gate in morning and also when the returned back to UP-Gate. Further, we had to stop traffic on the entire EPE stretch till the time it was occupied by tractors. As per the MoRTH guidelines, no tractors were allowed on EPE. But they came. We had written to the district authorities on Wednesday about this but our EPE traffic was still disrupted,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. Gaurav Tikait, national president of youth wing of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who is leading the protests at UP Gate, said, “ It was not a ‘shakti pradarshan’ (show of strength) before the talks scheduled with the government on Friday. It was aimed at consolidating our collective fight and to meet other groups who are protesting at different sites,” Tikait said. Police and paramilitary personnel were deployed on the expressways to ensure law and order. No untoward incident was reported from any spot.A senior Delhi Police officer said, “The situation remained peaceful in the Capital. No untoward incident was reported.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-000-tractors-at-farmers-march/story-03L9M5ypiWHobN5HknEckM.html
08-01-2021||India||Govt: Begin surveillance of human population||The Centre has asked four states affected by an outbreak of avian influenza, or bird flu, to begin surveillance among human population as a precautionary measure. No case among humans has been reported in the country so far. “...It is absolutely critical that appropriate measures for effective containment among bird/poultry population and active surveillance in human population has to be ensured…,” Rajesh Bhushan, secretary of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, said in a letter to the four bird flu-hit states (Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh).The letter asked the states to identify high-risk zones and carry out surveillance among human habitats. “...further, you are requested to keep vigilance for any unusual death amongst the bird/poultry in the State,” the letter added.Thousands of birds have died in Kerala (mostly poultry), Himachal Pradesh (mostly migratory birds), and Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (mostly crows) since December-end. Officials said migratory birds are behind the outbreak. In addition, around 400,000 poultry birds have died in Haryana’s Panchkula over the past 20 days, sounding alarm bells. Their test reports were awaited. “No case of human transmission has been reported in India so far, but states have been asked to step up vigil in order to detect warning signs early. High-level teams have also been rushed to these states to take stock of the situation and devise preventive strategies, if required,” said a senior health ministry official. The ministry has deployed special teams in Panchkula, apart from Kerala’s Alappuzha and Kottayam districts.A three-member central team took stock of the situation in Alappuzha, officials said. The team comprising the Union health ministry’s public health specialist Dr Ruchi Jain, Pune National Institute of Virology scientist Dr Shailesh Pawar and Delhi RML Hospital physician Dr Anith Jindal visited the hotspots in the district.State authorities have banned the sale of bird meat and eggs in the affected regions. To provide relief to the affected farmers, the state has decided to compensate them for culling their birds.On Thursday, Madhya Pradesh reported the first cases of the flu virus spreading from crows to poultry, forcing the state government to consider culling of thousands of bird. Two samples of poultry birds tested positive for avian influenza in two districts, said JN Kansotia, principal secretary, animal husbandry department. Madhya Pradesh has already banned transportation of poultry from other states to check the spread. The state has also banned the sale of chickens and eggs within a radius of 1km of the affected areas in Indore for seven days, officials said. In Neemuch, all meat and egg shops have been shut. “Two days ago, 40 crows were found dead in Neemuch but bird flu is yet to be confirmed in the crows. As a precautionary measure, we ordered closing of all meat and egg shops,” said district collector Jittendra Singh Raje. Odisha heaved a sigh of relief after tests of 11,000 poultry birds came negative. The samples were tested after 120 birds died in a poultry farm in Kurda. In Jharkhand, the animal husbandry department has sent 700 samples of poultry birds and four crows that were found dead in Jubilee Park in Jamshedpur to the Research Disease Diagnostic Lab, Kolkata, for tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-begin-surveillance-of-human-population/story-AhpRfzjiMRpXkpwCcLvXsO.html
08-01-2021||India||‘Vista consultations to be made public’: Hardeep Puri||The Union government will put all details of consultations on the Central Vista redevelopment project in the public domain, minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said in an interview to Anisha Dutta. The minister spoke about the Supreme Court’s approval for the project and the concerns raised over the alleged lack of public hearings on the project and its environmental impact. Edited excerpts:That would have been done by now. The heritage committee is headed by our additional secretary; the process would have been finished by now.Whatever it is, it will be done very quickly.The thing to note about the Supreme Court judgment, it is a 600-page judgment. It has upheld our position on everything. One suggestion they have made is the requirement of installing smog towers into the design of the buildings for environmental consideration. We are happy to do that. That is why I welcomed it and said we will comply with it and observe the highest standards in the construction and environmental protection.Insofar as the dissenting judgment also, they have upheld everything, they have said go ahead with it but they said the public consultation should have been more comprehensive. We will now put in public domain all the consultations we have had on the project. You and I may not be aware of what consultations have been done. For instance, in Parliament, we have consulted the speakers of the House; there has been a process going on from the 1985 estimates committee’ in 2012 the speaker’s officer on special duty (OSD) had written to the urban development secretary asking for a new Parliament building. It has been an ongoing process. I have consulted members of Parliament, the speaker has taken meetings and so on. Maybe it has not been on the public domain, but we will put all that up on the public domain. And certainly going forward from now, we are very happy to make the public consultation process more comprehensive, plus in another few days’ time we will have a website which will have all the information on these projects; the new Parliament and the Central Vista avenue, the government buildings and all the other aspects of it and there people can interact even more freely.That we will go through...consultation is one thing but if somebody doesn’t agree with you, he or she doesn’t have a veto power on it. The majority opinion doesn’t uphold that. We are happy to consult and we have consulted. We will give more time, but the government is the executive which has the ability and the responsibility to take a decision...And I have said right from the beginning that we will comply with every rule in the book. We will make sure every procedure is followed. If there has been some laxity anywhere we will correct it, no issues.I don’t know what the sequence is but we will follow all the protocols.Let’s be very clear, we have just got the nod on the new Parliament and we have opened the tender on the Central Vista area. We are going step by step.We are not going to raze anything till the new ones are ready, this is not going to be a hop, step and jump move. There is not going to be two moves. I will move from this office only when the next office is ready.We will stay in our existing buildings till the new buildings are ready. Some people will need to be moved. For instance some are being moved to Janpath Hotel etc temporarily but they are the ones currently housed at IGNCA {Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts}. We are in touch with all the government departments but that sequencing is being done in consultation with them.We will have a hearing but the idea is to go ahead. Many things will be done simultaneously also but we will go through all this, yes.One criticism was also the fact that public hearing process was bypassed and the proposal was directly sent to the EAC.No public hearing process was bypassed. There may have been compressed processes or in some cases there may be a disagreement, if you can invite comments online etc, all that we will look at very carefully and we will get the project done.Can you elaborate on the compressed processes?What has happened is alright, going forward we will give notice before every segment is done and this time we will put all the information on public domain. IF we are consulting architects or town planners etc it would happen in closed rooms...what people are not understanding is it is not one big townhall meeting where 5000 people are collected. There are simultaneous processed going on we will put all that in public domain to show that even in the past consultations have been held. I have held meetings at Prasar Bharti Bhawan, we had called editors of newspapers, I’ve called few journalists, I’ve called MPs etc. We have held meetings where MPs have been invited, we have had meetings with town planners and architects. Mr Bimal Patel has met people individually. So to say that public consultations have not been held is an opinion that may be coming on the account that people are not aware about it. We must be able to document it with audios and videos. We will put all of that up.Will Smog Towers be enough to curb pollution levels of the proposed construction that the project entails?Let me tell you that we were planning it in any case because of the environment concerns etc...the hearings in the Supreme Court which were over many days and our people were there, we heard the argument and we were very confident. But at the end of the day if some additional ideas come we welcome them. They have recommended integrating Smog Towers in the design of the building and we will do that, whether or not that is enough is something that we will determine as we go along. If additional measures are required we will make them also.There were concerns raised over transplantation of trees as well.In any case we were on board for that. There is concern but we ourselves are doing. Whether it is transplanting of trees or even relocating statues, we are taking all the precautions.There was some political backlash on relocation of the statues are these going to be shifted to the new building, what is the plan?Each of them have their own dynamism...these are processes on which we are taking abundant caution.What about the icon statue of Mahatma Gandhi? Will that be moved as well?All that is being done. As you go along we have had individual discussion on each of these with MPs. It is not for me as the Minister for Housing and Urban affairs to make those announcements. Even the decision to construct the new Parliament came from the hon’ble speaker, I am merely executing agency. There will be announcements made as we go along.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vista-consultations-to-be-made-public-hardeep-puri/story-mC8nZuTtGxmKGG1b4JQM7O.html
08-01-2021||India||‘I store stories and characters in my head…’||Hailing from Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, writer, poet, screenwriter and lyricist Gaurav Solanki says being in a creative field makes people more observant and watchful. “I love observing people and storing real-life instances that finally makes a large part of my stories and scripts. I have it in me to store stories and characters in my head for years till I get an opportunity to pen them for some project,” said lyricist of films ‘Veere Di Wedding’ and ‘Ugly.’ His last co-written release ‘Article 15’ won him both awards and accolades and currently Gaurav is all set for streaming of his solo-written series. Talking about his projects, he said, “Upcoming series ‘Tandav’ has an ensemble cast and we have worked tirelessly on it for a couple of years. As a writer, I have tried adding number of interesting emotional and political elements to the story. I hope that will go down well with the audience. Also, 2021 will see the release of OTT film ‘Freedom’ that I co-wrote with Dibakar Banerjee along with another OTT series.” The IIT-Roorkee graduate is also preparing to make his directorial debut. I’m a writer and I love telling stories but, at the same time, I want to direct a project soon. I feel that when you direct, you are able to add your own vision and reflection to it. Also, you well understand how your characters should look on screen because you are the one who crafted them and is well-versed with their traits,” he said.The writer is going slow on writing stories based on lockdown. “A lot of content is being generated based on lockdown and pandemic. I too have a lot of content on the subject but I have deliberately decided to go slow on it .”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-store-stories-and-characters-in-my-head/story-OFCkzCbqBfHAeXxRqBoMGM.html
08-01-2021||India||After the lull, I have my hands full, says Atul Srivastava||Actor Atul Srivastava was one the first few actors to shoot after lockdown with Akshay Kumar for an ad. After that there was no work for him. Then the tables turned and from November he is on a roll doing back-to-back projects. On his visit to hometown, Lucknow he said, “I had a packed scheduled in 2020 but after the lockdown the projects that were scheduled to happen either got deferred or shelved. There was no work, but with God’s grace, now I have a packed schedule.” Telling more about his projects, “I went to Indore for OTT series ‘Aapatkalin Baithak’ with young makers. I shot for it with Brijendra Kala and it’s a wonderful project. Then I joined Sushant Panda’s film ‘Prachand’ in Bhubneshwar with Pitobash Tripathy and Anant Mahadevan.” Atul is most excited for ‘The Kashmir Files’ that he shot in Mussoorie-Dehradun. “The film is by ‘The Tashkent Files’ director Vivek Agnihotri and it’s a very powerful script. It has Mithun Chakraborty, Puneet Issar, Vijay and Anupam Kher — we all play parallel-lead.” Last, he shot ‘Shubh Ratri’ in Maheshwar in which he plays ‘Mirzapur’ actor Aasif Khan’s father. He has two films lined-up for release. “February will see ‘Sonam Gupta Bewafa Hai’ that was shot in Badaun (UP) with Jassi Gill. Before that, ‘Mere Desh Ki Dharti’ will release, in which I play Divyenndu’s father.” He has three projects lined up for shoot out of which two are in Lucknow. “Next, I am going to Pushkar to shoot for ‘Babu aur Chameli ki Shadi’ where I’m playing Manish Paul’s father. I will also shoot for Pushpendra Nath Misra’s next series that is scheduled to be shot in Lucknow. Besides, I’m also a part of Sailesh Srivastava’s film ‘Palak’ in the state capital. It’s all packed schedule till March.” The Bhartendu Natya Academi (BNA) alumni is happy the way his roles are shaping up. “The roles I am getting are all important ones. It’s because I have started saying no to small roles even in big projects. Even, during the lull period, I kept waiting than jumping on just anything. ‘Thodi zid kar li hai, zabardasti ka kaam nahi karunga.’ Now, I wish to play a dark shade character soon,” he concluded with a shine in his eyes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/after-the-lull-i-have-my-hands-full-says-atul-srivastava/story-skc174cpAq6f7VWyCdxJ9O.html

According to SSP, Traffic, National Highway, JS Johar although the road stretch between Nashri and south portal of Jawahar Tunnel was cleared and made motorable for one-way traffic at most of the places yet it was still to be cleared completely on the other side of the JT towards Kashmir valley. The landslide and boulders were yet to be cleared at Samroli in Udhampur. At Samroli, the authorities had to blast big boulders, which had blocked the highway since Wednesday. Johar informed that though no passenger was stranded in any of the danger zones along the highway but more than 3000 vehicles including HMVs were stranded between Udhampur and Jammu or in Qazigund area. The road between Nashri and Banihal was cleared for one-way traffic at most places. “As and when traffic is resumed, only stranded vehicles will be allowed to move. No fresh traffic will be allowed,” said Johar. He said men and machinery were on the job to clear the highway, but the road was still blocked at several places. Mughal Road, the alternate road-link which connects the valley to Jammu region through Shopian-Rajouri axis, remained closed for traffic due to heavy snowfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-srinagar-national-highway-remains-shut-for-5thday-due-to-slippery-stretches-landslides/story-whNZPTT36KWcgIGgKT9BhM.html
08-01-2021||India||NIA arrests key suspect from tn in SSI wilson murder case||New Delhi/Chennai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested a key suspect in the murder of a police officer at Chennai airport after his deportation to India from Qatar, the agency said o n Thursday. The January 8, 22 murder in Kanyakumari was part of a conspiracy by some Islamic State operatives led by Khaja Mohideen to revive the activities of the global terror outfit in the region, officials said. Shihabudeen alias Sirajudeen, 39, who belongs to Chennai, had fled from India after the killing and been in hiding in Qatar. He is accused of having arranged the gun used by another suspect in the case – Abdul Shameem – to kill special sub-inspector (SSI) of Tamil Nadu Police, Wilson. NIA, the central anti-terror agency, had taken the over probe of Wilson’s murder from Tamil Nadu police in February 2020. A charge-sheet was filed in the case July naming Islamic State operative s Mohideen, Abdul Shameem and Y Thowfeek of Kanyakumari; Jaffar Ali (Cuddalore); Mahboob Pasha and Ejas Pasha of Bengaluru. A separate charge-sheet would be filed later in the case against Shihabudeen, according to an NIA officer who didn’t want to be named. This officer said Mohideen, a member of the Islamic State who was arrested by the agency in 2017, had radicalised Shameem and Thowfeek on the jihadi (violent extremist) ideology since May 2019, and recruited them into his terrorist gang to carry out attacks against the establishment, especially the police, in Tamil Nadu.As part of the plan, in October 2019, Mohideen instructed  Pasha, Ejas and Jaffer to procure illegal fire arms and prohibited ammunition for carrying out such attacks. After mid-December 2019, on Mohideen’s instructions, Shameem and Thowfeek were sheltered in Karnataka and Maharashtra by Pasha and they were subsequently provided illegal firearms and ammunition arranged by Shihabudeen, said a second officer. By January 2020-end, when Tamil Nadu police arrested the associates of Pasha in Bengaluru and started pursuing the others, Mohideen instructed Shameem and Thowfeek to attack the Tamil Nadu police at check posts along the inter-state border in Kanyakumari district. “The assailants travelled to Kaliyakkavilai on January 8 and attacked on-duty SSI Wilson. After the murder, they escaped towards Kerala and concealed the knife and illegal firearm used in the attack near the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus stand in Thriuvananthapuram and Ernakulam, respectively,” said the second officer, who also requested anonymity. Thereafter, they fled to Kozhikode, changed their appearance and travelled to Maharashtra to live in disguise before returning to Udupi in Karnataka, where they were arrested on January 15, 2020, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-key-suspect-from-tn-in-ssi-wilson-murder-case/story-UBmypwmIyG0GR4IxE8RS7L.html
08-01-2021||India||Nadda to launch new campaign on farm laws during Bengal visit||Bharatiya Janata Party president JP Nadda will visit West Bengal on Saturday to launch the party’s ‘Ek Muthi Chawal’ campaign to dispel the opposition’s allegations that the ruling party at the Centre is anti-farmers, a functionary familiar with the matter said. Nadda will also lead the party’s door-to-door canvassing ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections scheduled to take place before May this year.According to the party functionary speaking on condition of anonymity, the BJP president will launch the campaign in Burdwan district after which party workers will visit farming households across 48,000 villages to collect rice.“It is a month-long drive to collect rice, which will then be used for a community meal for farmers, and the poor,” the functionary quoted above said. Nadda has been leading the election strategy in West Bengal after the party’s performance in Bihar, where it won 74 seats of the 110 it contested in the 243-member house and formed the government with JD(U), which contested on 115 seats and won 43.The BJP is pulling out all the stops to dispel concerns about the three farm laws even as farmers have massed Delhi’s borders since last November to protest against the laws. The party has instructed its functionaries to conduct door-to-door campaigns, write letters and hold meetings locally across the states to dismiss the allegations that the new laws will benefit corporates. “What the party president will initiate will be taken further by the functionaries at all booth levels. The party has already underlined how farmers in the state have been deprived of the benefits of the Kisan Samman Nidhi that offers six thousand a year to farmers through direct bank transfer,” said the functionary quoted above. Nadda had last visited the state on December 10 when his convoy was stoned at Diamond Harbour in South 24-Parganas district. Several BJP leaders were injured in the attack. Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP locked horns over the incident that took place in the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, nephew of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-to-launch-new-campaign-on-farm-laws-during-bengal-visit/story-B5WbqG5iv9zTx8MDBeHXCJ.html
08-01-2021||India||No evidence of forced conversion in arrest made under new law: UP to HC||The Uttar Pradesh government told the Allahabad high court on Thursday that it dropped charges of forced conversion against a 32-year-old Muslim man, who was among the first people booked under the state’s controversial anti-conversion law, after police found no proof of allegations.Police lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against Nadeem Ahmad and his brother Salman under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020 on November 29 on a complaint by Muzaffarnagar resident Akshay Kumar Tyagi, who alleged that Nadeem lured his wife to convert her to Islam and also threatened her.The high court restrained the state police from taking coercive action against Nadeem on December 18, and tagged his plea to petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the ordinance, colloquially known as the “love jihad” law in reference to a term used by right wingers to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.The state government affidavit said the police investigation did not produce any evidence that Nadeem had “any illicit relation with the woman” or that he was trying to convert her religion.“The investigating officer has recorded the statement of victim, who in her statement informed that she is only known to Nadeem, but having no relation,” the affidavit, a copy of which is with HT, read. But the police found evidence from call records that Nadeem threatened Kumar, the 13-page document added.The HC bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice SS Shamshery, fixed January 15 as the next date of hearing in the case. Nadeem was the first petitioner to approach the high court to challenge a police complaint under the new law.Muzaffarnagar police also confirmed that charges of forced conversion were found false. “No evidence of forced conversion was found, therefore, Section 3/5 of the new law (UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance 2020 )has been dropped in the case,” said K P Singh, the station house officer of Mansoorpur police station.Section 3 of the ordinance prohibits a person from converting the religion of another person by marriage. Section 5 outlaws conversion by any allurement or presents.Circle officer, Khatauli, Ashish Pratap Singh said the case against Nadeem and Salman now was under sections 504 (insult intended to provoke breach of peace) and section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and both were bailable.The police charge sheet dated December 31 alleged that Nadeem called the woman and threatened to kill her.But in court, Nadeem had denied all allegations and said he was a poor labourer who had been falsely implicated in the case by the complainant Kumar to avoid payment of some dues.Senior advocate SFA Naqvi, representing Nadeem, also argued that the ordinance violated constitutional rights, and criminal proceeding initiated under the provisions of the law should be quashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-evidence-of-forced-conversion-in-arrest-made-under-new-law-up-to-hc/story-0Cb8uI7qcZk4gQGGf7rhML.html
08-01-2021||India||Decoding the nature of economic recovery||According to the first advanced estimate by National Statistical Office (NSO), the Indian economy is expected to contract by 7.7% in fiscal 2020-21 – 20 basis points more than the 7.5% contraction projected by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India. High frequency indicators suggest greater optimism than the MPC’s forecast of 0.1% growth in the December quarter. At the same time, there are other statistics that suggest a more sober approach. Here are four charts put these mutually conflicting trends in context.NIBRI, PMI, GST collections suggest a robust ongoing recoveryThe two earliest high-frequency economic indicators – Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing and the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) – for the period ending Dec 2020 were released on Jan 4. Both of them suggest an upbeat economic environment. For the week ending January 3, NIBRI reached its highest ever value of 94.5 (100 is the pre-lockdown base). PMI manufacturing was at 56.4 in Dec 2020, making it the fifth consecutive month when it was above the critical threshold of 50, which signifies an expansion in economic activity compared to previous month. PMI Services, while it was above the threshold of 50 for the third consecutive month in Dec, has been losing momentum since Oct. Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in Dec – they are supposed to capture transactions carried out in Nov – reached ?1.15 lakh crore, the highest ever nominal monthly collection. In an interview to HT, finance secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey attributed the increase in December GST collections to “greater economic activities and better compliance with targeted approach to curb evasion”.However, both NIBRI and PMI note continuing job lossesMany economists have pointed out that the ongoing economic recovery is being led by profits and therefore has a smaller base. The latest NIBRI and PMI releases underline this trend. “Employment decreased in December, thereby stretching the current sequence of job shedding to nine months. Companies stated that government guidelines to have employees working only on shifts and difficulties in finding suitable staff were the key factors causing the latest fall in payroll numbers,” said a statement from IHS Markit, the agency which releases the PMI numbers. To be sure, “the pace of (employment) contraction was moderate and the weakest in the current downturn period”, the statement added. A research note by Nomura economists also noted a worsening on the employment front. “The labour participation rate eased to 40.3% in early January from 40.9% in December”, it said. These observations are in sync with the unemployment trends from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) database, the only high-frequency source of employment statistics in India.“Employment has been falling month-after-month since September 2020 when it was estimated at 397.6 million. As a result, employment has not only remained consistently below year-ago levels, it has also fallen far short of the two-years ago levels. Employment in November and December 2020 was lower than it was in November and December 2019 and was also lower than it was in November and December 2018, respectively” Mahesh Vyas, CMIE’s managing director and chief executive officer, said in a note published on its website.October-November revenues have increased for the Centre, but states have not gainedData from the Controller General of Accounts, which works under the ministry of finance, shows that gross tax revenues on October and November (latest available data) were greater than last year’s levels. To be sure, overall Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) up to November for fiscal year 2020-21 was still lower than 2019-20 levels. Even the monthly improvement seen in October-November GTR collections is driven by higher union excise duty collections, which are on account of increased taxes on petrol and diesel. Because the additional taxes on petrol and diesel and not a part of divisible pool of taxes, states have not seen an improvement in tax devolutions from the centre. In fact, year on year shortfall, both on a monthly and cumulative basis, in centre’s tax devolution to the states has been the highest in October and November in the current fiscal year.The Centre-state asymmetry in tax collections has also translated into spendingCentral taxes were meant to provide for 31% of states’ total receipts in the current fiscal year. As this shortfall increases, state finances are bound to come under greater strain, especially given the fact that state governments have done most of the heavy lifting in dealing with the pandemic. CMIE had cumulative spending data for 13 states up to November 2020. A comparison with cumulative spending for these states up to November 2019 shows a 6.5% reduction. For the 19 states for which cumulative spending figures are available up to Oct 2020, there was a 4.8% shortfall compared to Oct 2019 levels. The shortfall in capital expenditure for these states was even greater: 28.3% on an annual basis up to Oct 2020 and 27.9% up to Nov 2020. States incur a bigger spending than the Centre in India, especially when it comes to capital expenditure, which is crucial for future growth. Budget estimates for 2020-21 put the Centre’s total spending and capital spending at 72.2% and 46.6% of the total spending by states on these heads. Given the shortfall in states’ spending and their precarious revenue situation, the fiscal year is likely to end with a pro-cyclical cut in government spending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decoding-the-nature-of-economic-recovery/story-wttarS2jRJYPEFglgzSiWP.html

08-01-2021||India||‘Will walk to gallows’: Mamata Banerjee’s nephew on ‘tolabaj’ taunt||Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee hit back Thursday at extortion allegations leveled against him by the BJP, saying if charges against him are proved the opposition party will not have to do much as he will “walk to the gallows”. Since October last year, BJP state and national leaders, including the Union home minister Amit Shah, have been singling out Banerjee in their speeches, calling him “tolabaaj bhaipo” (extortionist nephew in Bengali) and accusing him of amassing wealth through unfair means. “Let the Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate conduct a probe. If it is proved that I have made even a penny through corruption you won’t have to do anything. I will voluntarily walk to the gallows and hang myself,” said Banerjee amid loud applause at a well-attended TMC rally at Gangarampur in South Dinajpur district in north Bengal. After defecting from the Trinamool last month, former minister Suvendu Adhikari has intensified the attack on Mamata Banerjee’s nephew. “You do not have the courage to take my name and always refer to me as bhaipo so that I cannot sue you in court. You call me tolabaaj but you are the one who was seen in the (Narada sting operation) video accepting money,” Banerjee said without naming Adhikari. Reacting to Banerjee’s remarks, Adhikari, while addressing a rally at Tamluk in East Midnapore later in the afternoon, said, “The tolabaaj bhaipo has to tell the people why all government contracts are given to some specific people in Kolkata and what is the source of his prosperity. Even school bags and bicycles given to students are so sub-standard that these have to be repaired before use.” “Despite all the criticism they face, CPI(M) and Left leaders did a lot of good work. The TMC ruined everything. In the education sector, for example, appointment of teachers has stopped and corruption has crept in,” said Adhikari. Making a radical statement, Adhikari said not all leaders from the TMC-run civic bodies in East Midnapore should be inducted into the BJP. “I personally know that some of them have made millions through corruption.”Branding the BJP’s national leaders as “outsiders”, Banerjee said, “they neither speak or understand Bengali nor know the history and culture of Bengal. “Bengal will not bow before Gujarat. Nobody can teach us (Bengalis) patriotism,” said Banerjee.The leader targeted the BJP on a host of issues, ranging from the Doklam standoff and demonetisation to corruption. “It has been four years since we had demonetisation. India’s GDP has gone down from 8% to minus 4%. Who will answer for that?” he said. “Before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, PM Modi said he will not spare any criminal and corrupt person and now the BJP is inducting all the thieves. Before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Modi made a long speech on Pulwama. We also want the Centre to crush the threats posed by Pakistan. But why are Modi and Amit Shah silent on China?” Banerjee said. “Mamata Banerjee used to live in a house with tiled roof and wear white saree and hawai chappal (sandals) before coming to power in 2011. She still lives the same life. On the other hand, Modi, who used to ride a car worth Rs 10 lakh before 2014, now goes around in a bullet-proof car worth Rs 6 crore,” said Banerjee. He also called BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s son Akash and BJP state president Dilip Ghosh “goonda” (ruffian) by taking their names. Banerjee is on a five-day tour of the north Bengal districts where the BJP won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019 and now poses a challenge to the ruling party. He is visiting the area to address infighting and organizational issues plaguing the TMC. In 2019, the TMC’s tally in the Lok Sabha came down from 34 seats to 22. In terms of the 56 assembly segments in the eight Lok Sabha seats in north Bengal, the BJP was ahead of the TMC in 35. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, too, spent three days in north Bengal in mid-December. BJP leaders of both state and national level, including national president JP Nadda, are also frequently camping in north Bengal. The West Bengal assembly has 294 seats and Amit Shah has declared that BJP will oust the TMC government by winning more than 200 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-walk-to-gallows-mamata-banerjee-s-nephew-on-tolabaj-taunt/story-6TcPLtqFta800mJcyI8lDP.html
08-01-2021||India||Tractor march, ‘healthy discussion’: Where farmers’ protest stands ahead of 8th meeting||After seven rounds of talks over three agriculture laws passed by Parliament in September 2020, farmers’ union leaders and Union ministers will sit for the eighth consultation on Friday. Both the sides have made two things clear: the laws won’t be repealed and farmers won’t reconsider their demand for a complete withdrawal of the laws. While farmers are intensifying their protest braving the cold and rain of Delhi, the Centre is hopeful that a conclusion will be reached soon. Punjab BJP leaders met Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday and said the farmers are being stubborn. “Govt is ready to listen but farmers are being stubborn. Law & order in Punjab is ruined. Sit-in protests are being done outside houses of our workers. The language being used & the kind of hooliganism in Punjab - we talked about it,” Harjit Singh Grewal said.“The government is ready to fulfil all the demands of farmers. But farmers are now saying that the laws be repealed. Why are they saying that? I think farmer unions don’t want a solution. I think their plan is something else,” he said.Supreme Court hearingThe Supreme Court on January 11 will hear a batch of pleas challenging the farm laws and also pleas which raised issues related to the ongoing protests. The Supreme Court bench on Wednesday was informed by the Centre that healthy discussions were going on between the government and farmers. Attorney General K K Venugopal said there is a good chance that parties may come to a conclusion in the near future. “We understand the situation and encourage the consultation,” the bench said.On Thursday, the apex court was hearing a plea seeking various reliefs including that of CBI probe into the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz etc. During the hearing, it asked the Centre whether farmers protesting against the farm laws are protected against the spread of Covid-19. Protests to intensifyOn January 7, the protesters took out tractor march from four different points — Singhu to Tikri border, Tikri to Kundlim Ghazipur to Palwal and Rewasan to Palwal. Terming the tractor march as a trailer of what will happen on January 26, Republic Day, protesters on Friday said when their leaders decide to enter the capital, protesters will enter Delhi. Thursday’s tractor march was only at the border points.What happened at earlier meetingsSeveral thousands of farmers started their ‘Dilli Chalo’ march on November 26. Consultation with the Centre, however, began in September soon after the bills were passed. Farmers’ leaders walked out of the first meeting as no minister was present. In the consequent meetings, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, railways and food minister Piyush Goyal, minister of state for commerce and industry Som Prakash are generally present. They explain to the union leaders the benefits of the laws. There was agreement between the two parties on stubble burning and electricity, but on MSP and on the issue of withdrawing the laws completely, there has been no headway yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tractor-march-healthy-discussion-where-farmers-protest-stand-ahead-of-8th-meeting/story-mPjt1LiBt8xidQyBpyfWZO.html
08-01-2021||Editorials||The economy is looking up | HT Editorial||The National Statistical Office (NSO) expects India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to contract by 7.7% in 2020-21, according to the first advanced estimates for GDP released on January 7. The projection is in line with various institutional and private forecasts, and paints a relatively better economic picture than the widespread consensus on a double-digit contraction up to a few months ago. While the recent recovery in economic performance — other high-frequency indicators confirm the trend — is a welcome development, it should not generate complacency on the policy front. Here is why. Even though a 7.7% contraction sounds better than what was being predicted earlier, 2020-21 will be the worst year for growth in India. An economic shock of this magnitude is likely to leave significant and deep scars on businesses, in both the real and financial sectors, and on households. That the Indian economy was caught in a protracted slowdown even before the pandemic will make coping with the current crisis even more difficult. A large part of the Indian economy is in what is referred to as the informal sector. It is entirely possible that the economic indicators which have come in so far — the GDP projections are based on extrapolations from limited statistics — have failed to capture the extent of pain in the informal sector. Anecdotal evidence and corporate earnings for the first two quarters have highlighted how smaller entities have suffered disproportionately. A substantial part of the ongoing economic recovery can be attributed to the fact that India has not faced a second wave of Covid-19 infections like the West. As the government gets ready to roll out its vaccination programme, the public health crisis will, hopefully, subside. However, it is also a fact that India’s fiscal stimulus was among the smallest for major economies in the world. Restoring growth going forward is going to be difficult without a big push from government spending. The Narendra Modi government has, to its credit, also unleashed important second-generation reforms in critical sectors such as labour and agriculture during the pandemic. These should generate tailwinds for future growth. But long-term expectations from these reforms can be compromised if the economy hits a demand-side constraint in the short-run. This should be the guiding principle of economic policy, especially in the next budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-economy-is-looking-up-ht-editorial/story-455SD3NJKbFYTn2VTMiZdI.html
