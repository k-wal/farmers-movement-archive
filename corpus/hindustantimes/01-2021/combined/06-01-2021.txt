06-01-2021||News||The new architecture of a new India||The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, cleared Delhi’s Central Vista project. A new Parliament building is being built, but it is not just about a single building, or even the upgrading of office buildings along Rajpath.There are several good reasons why India needs to invest in modernising the physical infrastructure of the government, create iconic new buildings, and renew its inner-cities. This is not a rejection of our past, or an attempt to pull down existing iconic buildings. These should be preserved, but what about the aspirations and needs of our times?The first and most obvious reason why we need to invest in new buildings is the simplest — the government needs modern buildings and physical infrastructure to better serve 21st century India, but it is difficult to upgrade old buildings in situ while they are also being used. The current Parliament building is undoubtedly beautiful and is part of our history. It should be preserved, but the wide-ranging structural works needed to preserve it will need years and cannot be done while it is also being used for parliamentary sittings. Hence, it is easier to build a new building and redeploy the old building, once renovated, for another purpose.The same can be done with North and South Block. As someone who works in one of these buildings, let me say that its grand corridors do not make for practical office spaces. While a few senior officers may enjoy large high-ceiling rooms, most of the staff sit between dark partitions with dangling wires and poor ventilation. If the Raisina ministries are relocated, government officials will get modern facilities while the general public will get access to beautiful public spaces including restaurants, cafes, and a world class complex of national museums.The above buildings should definitely be preserved, but several other buildings along the Central Vista are neither architecturally beautiful nor efficient workplaces. Shastri Bhavan, for instance, houses many key ministries but anyone who has visited it will know that it is a poor workplace. Indeed, this can be said of many government buildings across the country. Rebuilding them is the most practical solution and there is no reason for sentimental attachment.The second reason for building iconic new buildings is to renew our cities and give it a stamp of our times. When the grand buildings of Raisina Hill were built during British colonialism, India did not lack for grand buildings. There were existing buildings built by the British themselves in Kolkata. Delhi itself had many grand buildings from the Mughal era. Yet, they chose to build a whole new city for their times. With a few exceptions such as the Vidhana Soudha building in Bengaluru, the Indian Republic has made surprisingly few contributions to public architecture. Till a couple of years ago, a structure dedicated to colonial era wars (ie India Gate) was used as the National War Memorial. In short, most Indian cities are still dependent on colonial-era cores to function.This brings us to the third reason for investing in iconic new buildings. Seventy-three years after Independence, most Indian cities are still defined by colonial-era landmarks — Victoria Memorial in Kolkata, Victoria Terminus in Mumbai and so on (name changes notwithstanding). A leading British newspaper termed the new buildings as “vulgar” but how long will we continue to pay obeisance to Queen Victoria? There is nothing wrong in preserving the best of the past, including those built during a brutal foreign occupation, but what about representing the aspirations and cultural moorings of 1.35 billion Indians? This is why Mumbai will be well served by the gigantic Chhatrapati Shivaji statue build out at sea.Great cities and societies are not those that unquestioningly preserve everything from the past. They evolve and add new things while retaining the best from the past. Even that which is preserved is often repurposed for the needs of the times. This organic process of evolution is what provides the dynamism of a city and a people. This is the underlying thinking behind the Central Vista project.Ironically, many of those opposing the new buildings are also those who wax eloquent about Paris, London, and Singapore. Yet, today’s Paris is the result of Haussmann’s demolitions in the 19th century. Many of its most loved buildings — including the Eiffel tower and the Louvre pyramid — were radical departures from the past. Today’s London is the result of large-scale rebuilding following the Great Fire of 1666, German bombing during 1940s and, most recently, the Olympics. Singapore, similarly, has completely rebuilt its city-centre. Many of its iconic buildings — the Esplanade theatre domes, Marina Bay Sands and the “super-trees” of Gardens-by-the-Bay — were added in just the last two decades.In short, it is perfectly all right to have an opinion about the aesthetics or design of a particular building. That is a matter of personal taste. However, there is no case for blanket opposition to the construction of new public buildings and spaces that reflect our aspirations and current needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-new-architecture-of-a-new-india/story-wQe68QJaOhcEn9XPaNh8bP.html
06-01-2021||News||Understanding the rationale of farm protests||The recently enacted farm laws and the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act by the Union government has led to a standoff with no resolution in sight. Farmer organisations and several state governments had conveyed their opposition to the laws at the time of the promulgation of the ordinances. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government, which exhibits disdain for efforts to build consensus through wider consultations, proceeded to push the bills through Parliament without any meaningful discussion with the Opposition parties.The disinformation campaign launched by the BJP to mislead the public that the present laws accord freedom to the farmers to sell their produce to whoever they choose/desire is far from the truth. Under the current/existing Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) model, the farmers already have the choice to sell their produce to private parties. The transactions take place at APMC mandis, which are regulated and safeguard the farmer from exploitation at the hands of the multinational companies (MNCs). The Centre is seeking to replace the existing agricultural marketing system with a handful of intermediaries who will be under no obligation to pay the minimum support price (MSP) to the farmers.The Centre has overlooked a fundamental aspect that no one size of farming pattern fits all. Our founding fathers were conscious of this ground reality and placed agriculture under the State List of the Constitution. The National Agricultural Research Project divides our country into 127 different agro-climatic zones. The different zones include varying landholding patterns, weather/climate, soil content, production patterns and water levels. The present laws fail to factor in the heterogeneity in our farming patterns and attempt to impose the Bihar model of agriculture, which has failed to yield dividends to the farmers.The vilification campaign against the arhtiyas overlooks the supportive role played by this irreplaceable cog in the agricultural wheel. It is the arhtiya to whom the farmers look to for financial support for the purchase of fertilisers, short-term loans and family needs; both enjoy a relationship of mutual trust. The midnight Income Tax (IT) raids on officer-bearers of the arhtiya association in Punjab reflects the mindset of the BJP. Such high-handed measures undertaken with an objective to browbeat and intimidate supporters of this peaceful movement have become part of the BJP agenda to quell legitimate criticism and dissent. Corporates, with their profit maximisation motive and impersonal transactional relationship, can never fill the shoes of an arhitya. The unilateral imposition of the present laws, without taking the farmers into confidence, has further widened the trust deficit between the agriculturists and big business.The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 2020, gives carte blanche to hoarders and traders to engage in predatory pricing. The statement of objects and reasons for the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, was to regulate and check hoarding of essential items and black-marketing of food produce by unscrupulous traders. The recent amendment removes cereals, pulses, oil seeds, edible oil, onions and potatoes from the list of “essential items”, facilitating unlimited hoarding and speculative trade. As a consequence of the recent amendment, the government can step in to regulate the stock limit for these food items only in the event of a war, famine, natural calamity or an extraordinary price rise in retail value. Unless there is a 100% price increase in retail price of the aforesaid items, the government is proscribed from intervening to check hoarding and black-marketing of food produce and cereals. This facilitates the path for exploitation of the consumers and will lead to inflationary pressures across sectors.The labelling of protesting farmers as “anti-nationals” has led to justifiable anguish among the farming community. Every household of Punjab and Haryana has made innumerable sacrifices for the country right from the time of the freedom movement. The role played by Punjab in defending our nation’s territorial integrity and in feeding the country in the time of the food crisis is well recorded in history. Thousands of ex-servicemen, who have served at our borders, are part of the farmer protests and are seeking redressal of their legitimate grievances. Over 50 farmers have lost their lives at the protest sites owing to low temperatures and difficult living conditions. We need an empathetic government with a moral compass to urgently find a solution to the satisfaction of the farmers. Engaging in dilatory tactics and subterfuge will further exacerbate the growing trust deficit between the farming community and the Centre.

06-01-2021||News||The Delhi-Beijing battle in South Asia||There can be no doubt about China’s growing clout in South Asia. When governments are being made and unmade by a not-so-invisible hand in Beijing, it should be clear that China’s footprint is at an all-time high. It has been evident for some time now that states in South Asia and the wider Indian Ocean region cannot remain immune from the lure of Chinese political and economic muscle, much like the rest of the world. If, despite bilateral challenges, India can try to get the best bargain out of China by engaging in trade and other sorts of cooperation, so can its neighbours. It’s infantile to cry hoarse about smaller states trying to make the best of their regional environment.Yet, strategic evolution is a constant and as 2020 came to end, China seemed to be facing an interesting scrutiny about its role in South Asia from various quarters. In an embarrassing expose last month, the National Directorate of Security of Afghanistan arrested Chinese intelligence agents engaged with Pakistani agents and members of the Taliban as well as the Haqqani network in order to promote “Beijing’s geopolitical influence in the region”. They were later allowed to leave Kabul but only after China was reportedly asked to apologise for sending in these agents. That China and Pakistan would collude in Afghanistan is not news, but what is important is the new reality confronting China today that as it becomes more proactive in shaping its regional environment, the façade of promoting peace and prosperity will quickly wear off.And then there is Nepal where after Prime Minister KP Oli dissolved Parliament and called for fresh elections, China was caught by surprise. It was at Beijing’s behest that the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was formed in 2018 with the merger of Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre. China’s footprint in Nepal has been growing in recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network. China’s meddling became so intrusive that even Oli is reported to have told the Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi that he was capable of handling challenges within his party without any assistance from other countries. And last week’s high-profile visit by Guo Yezhou, vice-minister of the international department of the Chinese Communist Party’s central committee, also failed in its attempts at bringing together the two rival factions of the NCP led by Oli and former prime ministers Prachanda and Madhav Nepal. China will, of course, continue to work behind the scenes to preserve its equities in Nepal. But in a nation where citizens are highly sensitive about perceived political interference, the blowback from this high voltage diplomacy aimed at shaping domestic politics is likely to be rather strong.Given China’s widening interests across South Asia, it was inevitable that it would like to be more involved in shaping the domestic politics and preferences of the regional states. And as China has become more involved in the domestic politics of its neighbours, it is finding out that it is easy to preach to other nations from the sidelines and rather difficult to practise what you preach when you are the focal point of attention.China’s political, economic and military engagement in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region will continue to grow as regional states will want to leverage Beijing’s growing heft to their advantage. But the constant lament in New Delhi that “China is winning in South Asia” neither does justice to India’s own regional profile nor does it give its due to the agency of smaller states in the region to pursue their vital national interests in a pragmatic manner. It is easy to forget that even till the first decade of this century, the main narrative about South Asia was one of India-Pakistan dyad. New Delhi’s growing capabilities and an aspirational foreign policy outlook has ensured that as we enter the third decade of the 21st century, South Asia is being today seen as the pivotal theatre of the wider Indo-Pacific where the key faultlines of this phase of global politics will be played out.The central story of our times is an ever more dynamic interaction between the two major powers of the Indo-Pacific: India and China. Despite being the weaker of the two players, it is India that is not only challenging China when it comes to the major ideas of our times, but is also standing up and confronting China to preserve its vital interests. Whether it is the narrative surrounding Xi Jinping’s vanity project, BRI, or the discourse on the Indo-Pacific, which China tried its best to discredit, it is India’s leadership that was key to making them possible. By standing up militarily to China on the Himalayan borders, India also made it possible for smaller nations at the receiving end of Chinese aggression to envision the possibility that subservience to China is not the only option.And as the competition for influence intensifies in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region, New Delhi is making it clear that not only will it fight hard to push against the Chinese Communist Party’s malevolent agenda in its neighbourhood but will also ensure that its preferred model of working in partnership with its neighbours to develop a sustainable political and economic agenda continues to retain its centrality. The constant lament in India about China’s rising profile in its vicinity should give place to a new awareness that this is just a beginning of a long-drawn-out struggle between two regional players which is yet to acquire its full potency. And New Delhi should be fully prepared for it.Harsh V Pant is professor, King’s College London, and director of studies, Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-delhi-beijing-battle-in-south-asia/story-AWdOsnMbKTYQZ0pVGtJYnM.html

The government took the decision so that final revision can be conducted physically in schools before the annual exams. Anand Singh, principal of AVM Senior Secondary School, which is associated to PSEB, said, “We have over 750 students studying in these classes. A message has been sent to parents to send their wards to school from tomorrow. To maintain social distancing, we will accommodate one student on one bench.”Rajinder Kaur, district education officer, elementary-cum-secondary, said, “We had already opened the schools for the staff of primary and middle classes on January 1. The premises are ready for conduct of classes.”However, schools affiliated to Central Board Secondary Education (CBSE) have decided to take a few more days to prepare.Harmeet Kaur Waraich, principal of Nankana Sahib Public School, Gill Road, said, “We are holding a parent-teacher meeting to inform parents about the government’s decision to reopen schools. We will ask them to ensure that their wards are wearing masks. They will be asked to not send their child to school if he/she is unwell. We will make every child undergo thermal screening at the entrance.” School principals said that more time was needed to make necessary arrangements keeping in view the Covid norms. The schools will have to be reopened in two shifts and will have to make a seating plan, time table, and require additional rooms to accommodate students and extra staff to take classes. Many school heads said that students used to commute to school earlier by buses and vans, and now in the absence of transportation, it will be difficult for parents to pick and drop them.Vandna Shahi, principal, BCM Senior Secondary School, Basant Avenue, Dugri, said, “We will start the preparation from Thursday. The safety of students and staff will be our priority, and we will make the necessary arrangements for them. We will inform the parents regarding the reopening of schools once we are ready with all safety measures.” JK Sidhu, principal of DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, said, “We can’t reopen the school on Thursday. The final call will be taken by the school management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-schools-gear-up-to-welcome-students-after-nine-months/story-gwyElSf9asVUqwmJStQt0H.html

06-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation takes up ITMS project for Rs 47 crore||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation will implement the Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) that the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) had abandoned in 2020 citing doubts over the firm that won the contract. This time, corporation officials said they have decided to go ahead alone and will start the project afresh. They said that they have prepared its detailed project report (DPR), and is expected to cost around ₹47 crore, a steep downgrade from the earlier project’s ₹77-crore budget. The ITMS involves installation of a city-wide traffic management infrastructure which will help detect traffic violations, regulation of traffic signals besides providing a surveillance system at different traffic intersections. It also involves installation of high-tech red-light detection systems, speed violation systems and even incident detection system which will be helpful in case of accidents. “The GDA had initially planned the ITMS and we were a partner to the project. Since the authority has disowned the project, the corporation will now develop it on its own with the funds from the state smart-city mission scheme,” said M S Tanwar, Ghaziabad municipal commissioner. “The DPR will now be sent to the state government for approval in a couple of days. Once approved, we will begin the process of issuing a tender for the project and the work will likely be completed within a year of that.”The firm that had won the contract for the previous project will not be allowed to participate in the new one, said Tanwar.In September, 2019 the UP state cabinet rolled out a list of seven cities, which included Ghaziabad, whose municipal corporations would get ₹50 crore each year for five years to develop smart cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-takes-up-itms-project-for-rs-47-crore/story-376KDbCiTWSRLJTZpU8zmN.html
06-01-2021||Noida||Farmers’ ‘tractor-march’ to affect traffic on NH-9 and Eastern Peripheral Expressway||Ghaziabad: Farmers protesting at the UP Gate on Wednesday said they will carry out a dress rehearsal of their Republic Day “Dilli Chalo” tractor march on the 135-km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) on Thursday morning. The march is likely to affect commuters on the EPE and the national highway-9 (NH-9). The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which maintains both highways, said that tractors were not allowed to ply on the EPE under even normal circumstances. The district administration said they had appealed to the protesters to desist from breaking rules.The protesters have been camping at the site since November 28 and have also blocked the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of NH-9 since December 3. They, along with other protesters at various borders of Delhi, are demanding repeal of the three new farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. During the last round of their talks with the government, there was no decision on repeal of laws while the government has clarified that they were ready to discuss amendments. The next round of talks is scheduled on January 8. “As a dress rehearsal of our ‘Dilli Chalo’ call on January 26, our farmers will drive tractors and will enter the EPE from the Dasna interchange on Thursday around 10 am. The tractors will be lined up properly and no trolleys will be part of the march. Thereafter, the tractors will move to Palwal and come back to Dasna,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). They said they would move in such a way that the effect on traffic would be minimal.“Each of the tractors will bear the national flag and also the flag of the BKU. It is estimated that about 500-600 tractors will participate. Our leaders have already said that if our demands are not met, we will proceed to Delhi on January 26. So, in a way, we are conducting a rehearsal on Thursday,” he added. The NHAI officials said that the march will affect traffic on both the major road stretches. On normal days, the EPE has traffic of about 50000 passenger car unit (PCU) per day, while the UP Gate stretch has daily PCU of about 80000 vehicles per day. “Tractors are not allowed at the EPE and there will be traffic disruption if they carry out a march. We will speak to the district officials about the issue. Already, the farmers have made two major tolls at Palwal and Sonipat free and it is also affecting revenue. It is estimated that the tolls fetch us about ₹90 lakh per day but we are getting only about ₹25 lakh per day since December 25,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he has spoken to farmers and have asked them to abide by rules and regulations. “Also, our committee of officials is already in constant touch with farmers’ leaders. We will also ask the police to make more deployment to ensure that commuters do not face issues,” Pandey, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/farmers-tractor-march-to-affect-traffic-on-nh-9-and-eastern-peripheral-expressway/story-eycIcoOMxlUuzFUHvD3ocI.html

The girl was found hanging in her room at the high-rise in Sector 77, the police said, adding that no suicide note was recovered from the spot. When questioned, the couple had said that the girl’s paternal uncle was coming to Noida from Jharkhand to take her back home but she didn’t want to leave and had been upset about it for the past few days, said the police.In his complaint, the brother said that she had been working there for the past three years and they (the couple) had not allowed her to take any time off to visit us in Jharkhand. “They wouldn’t even let her keep a cellphone and would monitor her when she spoke with us using their phones. She wanted to come back home but they kept on making her work,” said the brother.Based on his complaint, a case was registered on Monday at sector 49 police station for abetment to suicide (section 306 of the Indian Penal Code).“A case was registered following the family’s complaint and on Wednesday the couple was apprehended,” said Sudheer Kumar, station house officer, sector 49 police station.He said that the girl’s body had been handed over to the family for last rites following the autopsy which was videographed.The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, the police said.The elderly man is a manager at an MNC and the couple’s son also lived with them though his involvement has not been found in the case, said the police.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are 011-23389090 from Sumaitri (Delhi-based) and 044-24640050 from Sneha Foundation (Chennai-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/employers-held-for-death-of-domestic-help-in-noida-high-rise/story-t2ovkaAM4AYAHWGHo0Q28K.html

The man was identified by a single name as Munawwar, a resident of Muzaffarnagar in UP. Vipin Mishra, Luksar jail superintendent, said that Munawwar was an inmate since June 24, 2018. “He was charged of murder in the jurisdiction of Kotwali Police Station in Muzaffarnagar a few years ago. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 and later transferred to Gautam Budh Nagar,” he said. On Tuesday night, Mishra said, he was brought to the jail hospital at 11:30 pm for treatment for chest pain and breathlessness. “When his health deteriorated, the jail doctor referred him to the Noida district hospital,” Mishra said. He was declared “brought dead” at the hospital. “The body has been sent for an autopsy. We have requested the judicial magistrate to conduct a judicial probe into the matter as per norms,” Mishra said. On October 29, 2020, a 31-year-old under-trial rape suspect had died following chest pain in Luksar Jail. The suspect Sarfaraz, a native of Meerut, was also rushed to Noida’s district hospital where he was declared brought dead.The Luksar jail, spread over 90 acres, was inaugurated in April 2014. The jail has 55 women inmates and 2,800 male inmates. The jail management had stopped meeting of inmates’ relatives with the inmates after the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020. The government has planned if the situation returns to normalcy, the meeting service can resume from February-March 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/63-year-old-murder-convict-dies-on-way-to-noida-hospital/story-MiAIBLuxW72RAuY2QnCywJ.html
06-01-2021||Noida||Air quality begins to dip, mercury to drop from Thursday||Noida: The air quality of Noida and Ghaziabad on Wednesday deteriorated again, slipping into ‘poor’ category or worsening within ‘moderate’ levels as the weather conditions begin to change. The unfavourable weather conditions from Wednesday night onwards will lead to further worsening of the air quality in the region, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The three cities of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad had been seeing ‘moderate’ air quality for the past two days – a major improvement over ‘severe’ levels on January 1 and 2. However, the western disturbance – which is now wearing out – led to drastic improvement of air quality and raised the mercury due to the cloudiness. On Wednesday, the air quality of Noida slipped within ‘moderate’ category, while that of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida became ‘poor’. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday was 200 which is still ‘moderate’ against 149 a day earlier. However, Greater Noida’s air turned ‘poor’ with an AQI of 239 against 120 a day earlier, while AQI of Ghaziabad was 234 or ‘poor’ against 140 or ‘moderate’ a day earlier. Weather experts said that the mercury is set to fall and the region to see dense fog in the coming days as the wind directions changed back to icy-cold north-westerly from the warmer easterly. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Noida recorded 1.5mm of rainfall on Wednesday against 5mm a day earlier. The average rainfall across NCR was 4.5mm based on the Safdarjung observatory against 4.7mm a day earlier. The weather department has said that the mercury will start falling from Thursday onwards this week. “The wind directions have changed from easterly to north-westerly, which will lead to drop in mercury from Thursday onwards. The minimum temperature may fall by 4 degrees Celsius over the next 24 hours,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature for Noida was recorded at 14.9 degrees Celsius same as a day earlier. The maximum temperature for Noida was recorded at 21.1 degrees Celsius, against 22.3 degrees a day earlier. For NCR, the average minimum temperature was 13 degrees Celsius and maximum was 21.6 degrees. “The mercury is set to fall that traps the pollutants, and the change in wind directions leads to calm winds for a day. So, in both the cases the ventilation will worsen and pollution levels spike,” Srivastava added. The major pollutant PM2.5 levels which continued to be under check for the past three days deteriorated to almost twice the standard limits. The PM2.5 levels in Noida worsened to 102.02 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 72.6 µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 110.97 µg/m³ against 78.75 a day earlier. The PM2.5 levels for Ghaziabad was 106.86 µg/m³ against 71.50 µg/m³ a day earlier. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), AQI will deteriorate over the next two days and may slip towards ‘very poor’ by the weekend. “Rain observed over many places in the Delhi region kept AQI in check which has touched its low and further improvement is not expected now. Surface North-easterly winds are slowly getting moderate and Ventilation condition is likely to become unfavourable for dispersion. SAFAR model predicts a gradual deterioration of AQI in the coming days. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate to the poor category tomorrow and deteriorate from the poor to the very poor category on the 8th and 9th of January,” said the SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-begins-to-dip-mercury-to-drop-from-thursday/story-HBtcnNeEX1Dbz8AgH0iy7I.html
06-01-2021||Noida||EOW’s special investigation team to probe Muradnagar incident||Ghaziabad: The Muradnagar roof collapse incident, which claimed 24 lives on January 3, will now be investigated by a special investigation team (SIT) of the UP Police’s economic offences wing, state government officials said on Wednesday.  “The chief minister has taken cognisance of the incident at Muradnagar and has sought a detailed report from the additional director general (Meerut zone). The inquiry of the incident has been given to a special investigation team of the economic offences wing and assigned to find out lapses. The entire incident and lapses will be investigated by the special team formed for the purpose,” said Navneet Sehgal, UP’s additional chief secretary (information). “The chief minister has directed for fast and strict action in the incident,” he added. The incident took place at Ukhlarsi cremation ground in Muradnagar where roof of a shelter collapsed, leading to the death of 24 persons in age group of 22 to 60 years. The Ghaziabad police have arrested five persons in the case so far. Three officials of Muradnagar Nagar Palika -- executive officer Niharika Singh, CP Singh, a junior engineer, and supervisor Ashish Kumar -- were arrested on Monday. While contractor Ajay Tyagi was arrested on late Monday night, his accomplice Sanjay Garg was arrested on Tuesday morning.“We will respond to the directions issued. Regarding the SIT, we are awaiting written directions and they will be fully implemented. The CM on way to Delhi also met us on Wednesday and directed that all help should be provided to the victim families,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate.Following arrest of contractor Tyagi, the Ghaziabad police on Tuesday had said that the suspect has told them that he allegedly bribed officials and also resorted to malpractices which finally led to the collapse of the structure at the cremation ground. Soon after the incident, the CM had sought a report from divisional commissioner (Meerut) and ADG (Meerut zone) about the incident. The police sources said that the confidential report was sent to the state administration and has highlighted the issues related to construction based on initial findings by a technical committee. During the initial inquiry, a committee of engineers found use of “substandard material” and “issues with design” which finally led to structural collapse. On Tuesday, the National Human Rights Commission issued notices to UP chief secretary and the director general of police calling for a detailed report in connection with the Muradnagar incident. Vishnu Kumar Gupta, a Ghaziabad-based social activist, has also approached NHRC, seeking the commission’s intervention for payment of compensation to the family of the deceased and other injured victims. “Issue notice to the district magistrate, Ghaziabad, calling for a report in the matter within two weeks,” NHRC said in an order on Wednesday. The UP government has announced Rs 10 lakh each as compensation for victim families, besides other help through various government schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/eow-s-special-investigation-team-to-probe-muradnagar-incident/story-VYLtcAsk1hxXjjZtMO5pqM.html
06-01-2021||Noida||Corporation blacklists contractor’s firm, stops pending payments||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation on Wednesday blacklisted contractor Ajay Tyagi who was responsible for the construction of the Muradnagar crematorium that collapsed and killed 24 people on Sunday.This comes a day after police said Tyagi had revealed to them during questioning that he had bribed municipal corporation for the work and also used poor quality materials to cut costs. Corporation officials said that Tyagi was involved in 30 other civic works -- from construction of drains, laying of interlocking tiles, revamping roads, constructing boundary walls, among others. These were allotted during the last two years and funded by the corporation, as well as other sources marked for development.These works in were spread across different wards of Kavi Nagar, Mohan Nagar, City, Vasundhara and Vijay Nagar zones. The official sources also said that he quoted the tender prices to the tune of 7.77% to 27.31% below the tender amount to bag the contracts. “We have blacklisted his firm and also stopped pending payments to other projects that he had taken up. He had been doing the works for past 10 years and now the ongoing works will be allotted to the firm that had quoted the next lowest price in the bid,” said M S Tanwar, municipal-commissioner. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he has written to the Ghaziabad municipal-corporation and development authority to blacklist contractor’s firm and also stop the pending payments for works. On Wednesday, the administration officials also sealed the Ukhlarsi cremation ground where the incident had taken place and also sealed important files of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika. “The cremation ground has been sealed and only a temporary platform for cremation has been left out. It will have a separate entry for people. The rest of the portion has been sealed after a team of senior engineers from GDA and corporation had inspected the site. They have also taken up samples of the debris for testing,” said Aditya Prajapati, sub divisional magistrate (Modinagar). “We have also sealed important files of the Nagar Palika which were related to contract works and accounts. This has been done so that they do not get tampered or damaged by anyone. These filed will now be part of ongoing investigation into the incident.” On Wednesday, the committee comprising of chief engineers of GDA, corporation and UP Rajkiya Nirman Nigam inspected the cremation ground and have recommended testing from an expert agency. “The expert agency could be any IIT or any other renowned agency which will check up the load bearing capacity, quality of material among other factors. We have not been able to get the design of the structure,” said VN Singh, chief engineer of GDA. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the expert agency will be roped in at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/corporation-blacklists-contractor-s-firm-stops-pending-payments/story-hYG8GluKqKXcaujSI8REtM.html
06-01-2021||Noida||Nominated member of Muradnagar Nagar Palika says he complained about poor material being used at crematorium 5-6 months ago||Ghaziabad: A nominated member of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika on Wednesday said that he had apprised and written to the officials of the municipality as well as the district administration at least twice about the “inferior quality” construction material being used at the Ukhlarsi cremation ground, but they allegedly paid no heed to his letters. On January 3, the roof of a shelter at the crematorium had collapsed, claiming lives of 24 people. Vijaypal Hitkari, the nominated member of the Nagar Palika, said that he wrote two letters -- one dated June 16, 2020, to the district magistrate and another dated July 10, 2020, to the chairperson and executive officer of the Nagar Palika. The nominated members of the local bodies are appointed by the state government. “In both the complaints, I had clearly stated that there was very less use of cement (ratio 1:10) in the construction mixture and also that yellow-coloured bricks (semi baked) were getting used for construction. I had requested the officials to stop construction and take up an inquiry but it was never initiated. Now, they are conducting inquiries. Will it bring back the 24 lives lost in the incident?” said Hitkari, who is also a social activist.“I had given two letters by hand to the officials and they did not give me any receipt or stamped copy. I had also marked the copies of the letter dated June 16 to state officials. Still, no action was taken,” he added. The two letters written on the letter-head of Hitkari’s social organisation, ‘Nagar Vikas Parishad’, also went viral over social media. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, however, said that he did not receive any letter written by Hitkari. “I received no such letter. If the complainant says that he gave a written complaint, he must produce the receipt of it,” Pandey said. Nagar Palika chairperson, Vikas Teotia, also said that he did not receive any such letter written by the nominated member. “Had I received any letter complaining of poor construction material, I would have stopped the work and initiated an inquiry. But I received no such complaint,” he said. Niharika Singh, executive officer of the Nagar Palika, is already under judicial custody after she was arrested by the Ghaziabad police in connection with the roof collapse incident.A preliminary inquiry of the incident site by a committee of engineers of the Ghaziabad development authority and municipal corporation found the use of “substandard” material and “design issues” which allegedly led to structural failure on Sunday. “I have already directed that the firm of the contractor be blacklisted and pending works to be stopped, along with pending payments. The directions have been given to the municipal corporation as well as to the Ghaziabad development authority officials. They have also been directed to check the construction quality of previous works done by the contractor,” Pandey added. Contractor Ajay Tyagi involved in construction of the shelter at the cremation ground was also arrested by the Ghaziabad police on late Monday night. The police said that during questioning he confessed that he bribed officials of the Nagar Palika and also resorted to malpractices, including the use of material which was not as per norms. The victims of the tragedy who survived after the incident have already said that the roof of the structure, about 40 feet in length, collapsed completely and not in phases which led to number of deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nominated-member-of-muradnagar-nagar-palika-says-he-complained-about-poor-material-being-used-at-crematorium-5-6-months-ago/story-jL72qkdouvixN2HEB7mMvO.html

06-01-2021||Gurugram||No evidence of bird flu in Gurugram yet, officials on high alert||Nearly 80 blood samples from poultry farms across the district tested negative for any strains of avian influenza or its antibodies, officials in the animal husbandry department said. However, they also said that an outbreak of bird flu cannot be ruled out given an unusually high number of poultry deaths recently reported from Panchkula district’s Barwala tehsil. The samples were tested this week at a lab in Sonepat, as part of routine zoonotic serosurveillance.A district-level meeting of veterinarians and poultry farmers has been convened in Gurugram on Thursday to review existing protocols for controlling the spread of bird flu. Guidelines for the same were first drawn up in 2005, and then implemented and revised during bird flu outbreaks in 2006, 2012 and 2015. There are presently 48 veterinarians enrolled with the animal husbandry department in the district, who regularly visit poultry farms to inspect chicken and take samples for routine surveillance. An official with the district animal husbandry department, who requested anonymity, as they are not authorised to spread to the media, said, “There is no reason to believe that poultry in Gurugram has been affected by either strain of the influenza virus, H1N5 or H5N8, confirmed be to be circulating in India. We have directly reached out to at least 100 poultry farms in the district and as of today (Wednesday), none are reporting any unusual activity. Visits will be made by vets to check on the health of the birds. They will also be on the lookout to see if the farm owners are hiding any deaths from authorities.” Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director, animal husbandry, Gururgam, declined comment. However, when asked whether it was safe to continue consumption of poultry, Gahlot responded, “No directions have been issued by the government yet to stop eating chicken.”The district wildlife department, too, has been conducting daily visits to Sultanpur national park, Basai, Najafgarh and Tau Devi Lal biodiversity park to check for excess deaths among migratory and local birds. “We found two pigeon carcasses in Tau Devi Lal Park today, but that’s quite common. We will be making daily trips to these places for the next few days. If we retrieve any bird carcasses, we will hand them over to the animal husbandry department, who will dispatch it to a lab in Jalandhar for testing,” said Rajesh Chahal, district wildlife inspector. After recent reports that nearly 400,000 poultry chicken died under suspicious circumstances in Panchkula, the state animal husbandry department has sounded the alarm across all districts to ramp up surveillance. Four states — Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh — have already confirmed outbreaks of at least one of two influenza strains (H1N5 and H5N8) which cause bird flu. However, despite this spate of poultry deaths which began in mid-December, Haryana has not yet detected a single lab confirmed case of avian influenza. “We will only know more in a few days if deaths start increasing on poultry farms in places other than Barwala,” said a senior official in the state department of animal husbandry, seeking anonymity. The official added that the cause of poultry deaths in Barwala has not yet been determined, saying, “We just don’t know yet. The report from the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL) in Jalandhar is awaited.” Dr Sukhdev Rathee, deputy director, department of animal husbandry, shared the same view. “There is no evidence of either influenza strain being present in Haryana, but we need to be careful. As far as poultry is concerned, we cannot say for sure that the deaths in Barwala were due to bird flu. We have send additional samples to Jalandhar yesterday after the first inquiry came up inconclusive. The report will come in another two days. Till then we are monitoring for any spike in deaths on poultry farms,” he said.ML Rajvanshi, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Haryana, said that all sensitive wetlands and bird habitats are being put on surveillance for the time being. “I have personally visited Bhindawas in Jhajjar two days ago. There is nothing untoward to report. But since there is evidence of a bird flu outbreak in nearby states, we will have to be very vigilant. Migratory bird populations will be monitored closely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-evidence-of-bird-flu-in-gurugram-yet-officials-on-high-alert/story-WDmgdsgyCJqmRc0V2KepLO.html
06-01-2021||Gurugram||Tractor march on KMP e-way on Thursday||Farmers from various protest sites in Delhi-NCR will be taking out a tractor march on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway on Thursday on a call given by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi’s borders. The march, previously scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed by a day due to poor weather. Farmer leaders said that the rally was a rehearsal for the Republic Day parade that they plan to take out on January 26 to protest against the three agriculture laws. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new farm laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year. They fear that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. Sanjay Madhav, member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that farmers from several districts will march with their tractors and reach the Shahjahanpur protest site on Thursday. “A batch of farmers from Maharashtra joined our agitation today. Other farmers will be marching with their tractors tomorrow. Tractors from other protest sites at the Delhi border will start marching in the morning and we will have a huge cavalcade of farmers on the KMP stretch,” said Madhav. Deepak Lamba, member of Jai Kisan Andalon, which is a part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, said that the march would start at 11am and continue through the day. “One batch of tractors will start from Singhu border and one from Tikri border. They will converge at KMP before returning to their respective protest sites. Other segments of tractors from Palwal, Ghazipur and Mewat will also come together on the KMP stretch,” said Lamba. Ramzan Chaudhary, another member of Jai Kisan Andolan from Nuh, said that tractors from various protest sites will follow different routes for the march on Thursday. “Farmers protesting at Tikri border will march till Singhu border and vice versa. Tractors from Nuh and Ghazipur will march till Palwal and return from there. Different units of tractors will cover a different stretch,” said Chaudhary.Rampal Jat, Kisan Mahapanchayat president, who is protesting at the Haryana-Rajasthan border, said that around 100 tractors from Palwal would be joining the tractor march on Thursday. “Tractors from different regions will join the march tomorrow. Due to rain, our tents at the border have been uprooted or flooded, but we will participate in the rally as much as possible. Around 100 tractors of ours will be joining the march from Palwal,” he said.Inspector Rajesh Kumar, station house officer, KMP Expressway, said that the police are on alert and would take steps to handle the traffic depending on the situation on Thursday. “ We are on alert. If the situation demands, we will make the necessary diversions,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/tractor-march-on-kmp-e-way-on-thursday/story-uvC40ZDk34jchLXussTMRJ.html
06-01-2021||Gurugram||Cops stopping supplies from reaching us, allege farmers in Haryana||Farmers protesting on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera alleged on Wednesday that the police and administration had stopped tractor-trolleys that were ferrying their food supplies and other relief materials at least 10 kilometres before the protest site.Protesters alleged that they had run out of food on Monday and most of them had to sleep on an empty stomach. They alleged that the police were not allowing vehicles to deliver raw materials and ration for them to cook food.On December 31, farmers had broken the barricades at Shahjahanpur and entered Rewari, crossing the Shahjahanpur interstate border in Rajasthan. They have stayed put at Masani and Sangwari Chowk, from where their movement was stopped by the police, who had to use mild force and tear gas on January 3.Many women and children, who had joined the protest on January 3, returned home on Tuesday due to a lack of medical aid at the site as a few of them fell ill.Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said, “There are nearly 3,000 farmers protesting at Masani village. No water tankers are allowed to reach us nor any ration. How will we cook food and consume if the situation remains the same?”Ram Krishan Mehlawat, the Rewari president of Rashtriya Kisan Union, said that roadside eateries and residents of nearby villages are supporting them by providing food but that is not sufficient for all. “We are offering food to a few people and have divided them so that each one can get at least one meal a day. We did not prepare tea on Tuesday as there was no milk. The gas cylinders are empty and we have no means to get them refilled. If the situation remains the same for the next two days, the protest will turn into a hunger strike,” he said.Vijay Yadav, a social worker from Shikohpur village near Manesar, who has been protesting since December 12, said that they tried to use tractors from fields to deliver ration but were stopped by the police. “The tractors loaded with vegetables and ration are stationed 10 kilometres away. We tried to get ration and walked down to the border but we could not unload the sacks,” he said.Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, denied the allegations and said that they had not stopped any essential supplies. However, he said that farmers are not being allowed to cross the stretch. “Food and ration is being served to them by locals and is available At stores and shops along the national highway. If they are facing any issues, they should inform us or write to us. The allegations are baseless,” he said.The police said that due to the protest, commuters travelling from Gururgam to Jaipur have to take a diversion from Dharuhera to Kotputli in Rajasthan via Khori, Pali and Kund, increasing their commute by at least 50 kilometres. The diversion for commuters from Jaipur to Delhi is through Kotputli via Alwar, which connects Tauru via Bhiwadi and connects to the national highway at Manesar.The Gururgam police said that to ensure smooth traffic flow, they are diverting heavy vehicles from Rajiv Chowk towards Ferozepur Jhirka in Nuh, which connects to Rajasthan.Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “We are keeping a close watch on protesters’ movement and will not allow them to enter Gururgam district jurisdiction. The teams are on alert and we are managing traffic situation to ensure no congestion is reported on the national highway. We have deployed enough force on the highway so that daily commuters are not affected by the ongoing protest.”Five police control room (PCR) vans and six motorbikes have also been stationed at the Kherki Daula and Bilaspur toll plazas to resolve any snarls.Farmers, who have been protesting at the three sites since December 12, have alleged that there is no running water and no toilets for them at the protest sites in Haryana and Rajasthan and they have written to the local administration several times but to no avail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-stopping-supplies-from-reaching-us-allege-farmers-in-haryana/story-IMuQDL93Q70KJwEsv27e4O.html

06-01-2021||Gurugram||Amendments to affordable housing policy notified||The department of town and country planning has notified the amendments to the Affordable Housing Policy of 2013, which allow changes to the size of housing projects, car parks and an increase in the commercial component of the project areas.Officials said that this amendment will help in expanding the footprint of affordable housing in the state, particularly in Gurugram, as there has been a high demand for such projects in the city. Last year, the department had increased the area available for the development of affordable housing projects in residential sectors, given the high interest of the buyers.The department expects a majority of developers to apply for changes under the amended policy, so that the projects become attractive for buyers and more profitable for them. At present, there are 80 housing projects being developed, with around 45,000 housing units in all.As per the detailed notification issued on Monday, the minimum and maximum areas allowed for such projects will be four acres and 30 acres, respectively. However, the department will also consider licence applications for two acres if the net planned area of 25 acres has already been licensed. The notification stated that if applications for more than 25 acres of net planned area in a sector are received, then successful applications shall be decided by draw of lots.Earlier, the minimum and maximum areas for such projects were five acres and 10 acres, respectively.Developers seeking the benefit of the present amendment shall be required to submit a fresh application, as per the notification. The norms of community sites shall remain as per the original policy, but for projects larger than 10 acres, the developer will have to provide additional community site for every 10 acres, said DTCP officials.The amendment also provides for an increase in the commercial component, from 4% to 8%. The notification states that developers of ongoing projects can also benefit from the changes, provided occupation certificates of all residential towers in a project have not been obtained. The developer also needs to obtain approvals from two-thirds of homebuyers for increasing the commercial component.The amended policy also allows developers to provide space for parking one car with each dwelling unit, at a rate not more than 5% of the flat cost. A DTCP official said that an average cost of a car park is likely to be fixed between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh, and is likely to find favour with a majority of buyers in such projects.Earlier, there was no provision for car parks in an affordable housing project and it was seen as a great hindrance for this segment, said officials.RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that amendment in affordable housing policy will help in increasing supply of such units, for which there is high demand. “With an increase in plot size, larger projects can be planned which will lead to a bigger project and more units. Even smaller patches of land, which are leftover, can be developed under this policy. Also, there was a strong demand for car parks and more shops in such projects from buyers of existing projects as most people own cars these days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/amendments-to-affordable-housing-policy-notified/story-MMZ464Wglds9j8sKtpfA8H.html
06-01-2021||Gurugram||Sale of residential units registered almost 50% annual decline: Report||Sale of residential properties in the National Capital Region (NCR) fell by nearly 50% last year from 2019, as per a report released by real estate consultancy Knight Frank India on Wednesday. Last year, 21,234 housing units were sold in the NCR, a steep fall from the 40,000-odd units sold in 2019, as per the report. The third and fourth quarters of 2020, however, witnessed a strong recovery as the pent-up demand caused by the nationwide lockdown gave a push to sales and helped improve the figures. As per the data shared in the report, Gurugram accounted for nearly 29% of all housing sales in NCR. However, the share was 18% lesser than in 2019. The slowdown in sales was caused due to the lockdown, which also changed the dynamics of the real estate market in the city. Developers, who earlier focussed on premium housing, are now expanding their offerings to mid-income and affordable housing projects, the report stated.In 2020, Greater Noida emerged as the top destination for residential sales in NCR, accounting for 39% of the housing units sakes, followed by Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Noida and Faridabad. The reason for Greater Noida’s emergence as the top destination, say experts, is that units were available in the Rs 40 lakh to Rs 60 lakh price range, in the mid-premium segment. The maximum sales were reported in the above Rs 50 lakh category, the report said. Gurugram, however, witnessed maximum launches in NCR, accounting for around 47% of the residential units launched in the city, as well as in areas along the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road. Of the total launches in NCR, Greater Noida accounted for 20%, Ghaziabad 19%, Noida 11% and Faridabad 3%. Overall, the NCR witnessed a 57% decline in new project launches last year, the report stated. It also identified Ghaziabad as the new real estate hotspot in NCR, as it has been witnessing a constant rise in new launches and sales since 2018. Another key development in real estate markets that was seen in 2020 is that there was greater demand for plotted developments due to ease of getting possession as well as lower cost of units, the report observed. Mudassir Zaidi, executive director, north, Knight Frank India said, “While Gurugram and Noida continue to lead on various residential asset class statistics, Ghaziabad is seen continuously gaining its dominance on the NCR’s residential map. This is largely due to developers trying to capitalise on the latent demand in locations where affordable and mid-segment products have been receiving good response from buyers.”Overall, the report observed that while both sales and launches remained low in the wake of the pandemic, cheaper home loans, lower pricing and pent-up demand led to a faster recovery in sales leading to a 9% annual decline in unsold inventory and predicted a brighter picture for 2021. “The substantial decline in residential sales during 2020,compared to 2019,was on expected lines as the pandemic completely washed away two quarters. But then there is a silver lining in big uptick in sales during festive months of October-December which holds great hope for a good run in 2021.Though many attribute this spurt in sales to purely pent-up demand, I believe that it has a lot to do with the genuine desire of people to own homes. This is evident from significant rise in the sale of mid-segment homes due to safety and WFH factor. With expected range bound prices and low interest rates with fiscal incentives to continue, housing should register a substantial growth in 2021 across major cities including NCR, though uncertainty about jobs still remains a challenge,” said Vinod Behl, city based real estate expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sale-of-residential-units-registered-almost-50-annual-decline-report/story-E2ux1N769Us2cCU9x2lg0H.html

This has not only put the Kangra administration on tenterhooks but also triggered concern among poultry farmers as the demand for poultry products has dipped massively. Besides migratory birds, other local species, mainly crows, have been found dead in the Pong Lake Wetland area of the district. The origin of the virus is yet to be ascertained. The first fatality among the migratory birds was reported on December 28. Among the infected birds, 90% are bar-headed geese, the world’s highest-flying birds that migrate from far-off Siberia and Mongolia. So far, the virus has reportedly spread in the poultry in the adjoining area. NO WAY OUT TO DEAL WITH BIRD MIGRATION: DC Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said there is no way out to deal with the migration of birds. “We can’t stop bird migration as it will continue till February end. Though, we can prevent the spread of the virus among the local human population as well as livestock,” said Prajapati. The situation is under control as the virus largely has been found in migratory birds only but the administration is ready to deal with any eventuality, he added. As a precautionary measure, the district authorities have sent more than 100 samples of poultry birds from different farms for testing. Prajapati said if the virus is found in the poultry, culling activities would be carried out. “We are awaiting the reports and have directed the farm owners to report any symptoms in poultry birds,” he said. As of now, there is a complete ban on the sale and export of poultry products and fish in Dehra, Fatehpur, Jawali and Indora. Activities like fishing and grazing are prohibited within the one-kilometer radius of the lake. POULTRY FARMERS STARE AT HUGE LOSSES Meanwhile, the poultry industry is anticipating losses worth crores due to the outbreak. “I have more than 40,000 chickens at my farm. If the virus spreads, culling would be carried out and that would mean losses worth lakhs of rupees,” said Pushp Barotia, a poultry farmer in Dehra. He said the losses would run into crores for the industry in the state. He said the demand for poultry products is already declined after the outbreak. The farm owners have demanded compensation on the analogy of Kerala if culling is done. Not only them, but fishermen dependent on Pong Lake also fear the loss of livelihood. “We can’t do fishing until the situation is under control. How will I feed my family?” said Roop Chand, a local fisherman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poultry-farmers-in-trouble-due-to-bird-flu-outbreak-in-himachal-s-pong-dam/story-Dn9AIQ6OhFIapnOCuK07CK.html

The delegation was led by former MPs Thiksay Rinpoche and Thupstan Chhewang. Besides Rinpoche and Chhewang, other members of the delegation include former BJP minister Chering Dorjay, chief executive councilor of Leh Council, Tashi Gyalson, sitting BJP MP and Ladakh unit president Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.“We met home minister Amit Shah who addressed our demands. Now, a panel will be constituted to look into the issue. It will be headed by a minister of state and bureaucrats from the Ladakh region,” one of the delegates, said, adding the panel will decide on the matter within three to four months.On December 21, 2020, the Apex Body of People’s Movement (ABPM) decided to reach out to the opinion-makers in Leh and Kargil districts to press for the sixth schedule to the strategic Ladakh region. The Apex Body of People’s Movement, an apolitical body, which has former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang, Dorjay, Thiksay monastery head Rinpoche Nawang Chamba Stanzin and former minister Nawang Rigzin Jora, has been demanding constitutional safeguards under the sixth schedule of the Constitution to Ladakh on lines of north-eastern states.The umbrella group includes political parties and religious organisations as well as the all-powerful Leh-based Ladakh Buddhist Association.The safeguards also guarantee more teeth to the two hill development councils of Leh and Kargil with legislative powers.It may be recalled here that Thupstan Chhewang, the former BJP MP, had resigned from his post and primary membership of the party in November 2018 for not conferring UT status to the Ladakh region and other promises made by the BJP in the 2014 general elections. The sixth schedule also guaranteed no settlement of outsiders in the strategic region. According to the 2011 Census, Ladakh has a population of 1,34,000, the majority of them being Buddhists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amit-shah-to-form-panel-to-look-into-ladakh-6th-schedule-demand/story-Fq6w7NbS1xX8pPq7dGPHiM.html

The writ petitions, therefore, cannot be considered as maintainable, at this stage, the court said. Accordingly, these petitions are dismissed reserving liberty to the petitioners to avail appropriate remedy in accordance with the law, said the division bench comprising justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Jyotsna Rewal Dua.The court, however, taking note of the methodology adopted by the state in preparing the reservation roster and contention advanced by the counsels of the parties, issued some direction to the government for future. “In cases of re-organisation or creation of gram panchayats, reservation of offices therein should be allocated afresh based upon the changed’ population structure in accordance with relevant provisions of applicable statute and the rules,” ordered the court.Also, while applying the election reservation roster, proper care should be taken so that reservation roster gets rotated to the maximum extent possible, the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-pri-elections-hc-dismisses-pleas-challenging-reservation-roster/story-nHeRiAGAGnyU3Y5uwxybDN.html

Such an act amounts to “arbitrariness”, it added.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the Centre and the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) that conducts the exam to explain how it was deciding who qualifies for the mains and interview.“When your vacancies are fluctuating, how many people will you call for the mains and interview? If you have the power to call any number of candidates for mains and interviews without declaring the actual vacancies, it is known as arbitrariness.”The court was hearing two pleases by Sambhavna and Evara Foundation, which have challenged the exam notification on the grounds that only approximate vacancies for the disabled are mentioned and not the 4% mandatory reservation mandated under the law.The court asked the authorities to explain the difference of eight seats in the vacancies for disabled calculated by Sambhavna, and the number advertised in the exam notification. According to the petitioner, the number should be 32, whereas the exam notice refers to 24 vacancies under the disabled category.“You have to explain these two aspects,” the court said.The petitioners urged the bench to stay the mains exam scheduled from January 8 to January 17 or direct the Centre to hold exams for the disabled persons later if the two petitions were allowed.The court refused to pass any interim directions and said that if the petitioners were successful, the reliefs would be moulded accordingly.On the last date of hearing in September, the court had termed as “absurd” the UPSC’s argument that while the number of vacancies in the All-India Civil Services may vary before the final selection of candidates, the number of seats for the disabled would remain fixed.Sambhavna has contended that the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act mandates that every government establishment shall reserve 4% of its total vacancies for those with benchmark disabilities. It has said that the expected approximate vacancies should be 796.The UPSC exam notice mentioned “expected approximate vacancies” -- a category that does not exist under the law.The matter would be heard next on January 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-pulls-up-centre-for-civil-services-selections-without-declaring-exact-vacancies/story-VSaaacJSx9lM9PSfEkFfcL.html

The garden will play a crucial role in bringing all the traffic safety information at one place and serve as a hub of traffic literacy for Puneites,” he said. The future additions to the garden include setting up of miniature models of educational institutes, fire brigade, petrol pumps and hospitals and institutes of public importance. The traffic department has mooted the idea of free entrance to the garden citing traffic education and literacy as the motive behind starting the initiative. The department has also communicated in writing to the PMC to start more such initiatives in open spaces across the city to educate citizens and school children.

06-01-2021||Mumbai||Cannot set aside convictions based on compromise between parties: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court has ruled it is not permissible to ordinarily set aside convictions for non-compoundable offences at appellate or revisional stage only on the grounds of compromise between the parties.A three-judge bench said the high courts should exercise powers under section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to set aside such convictions “only in rarest of rare cases,” when found necessary to prevent the abuse of the process or to secure justice. It added any compromise entered into post-conviction for a non-compoundable offence cannot itself result in acquittals. “Similarly, the court has no power to compound an offence, which is not permitted to be compounded under Section 320....”Also Read: TV channels airing ads promoting superstition liable to face action: Bombay HCThe compromise entered into, therefore, is just a mitigating factor, the bench said. It added such a compromise can be taken into account by an appeal or revisional court for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.The three-judge bench was hearing a reference on whether the power under Section 482 ought to be exercised for setting aside a conviction altogether upon a settlement between the convict and the victim.The issue was referred for consideration of the larger bench after a two-member bench refused to accept the view taken by a division bench at Aurangabad, striking down a conviction on the grounds of settlement between the parties. The two-judge bench observed that maintaining cordial relations between the convict and victim, in that case, was in the larger interest of the society and therefore inherent powers under Section 482 were required to be invoked to set aside the conviction.The three-judge bench cautioned against a casual approach in setting aside convictions on the grounds of settlement. It said if a conviction cannot be set aside in an appeal or revision on merits, such a result cannot be achieved using Section 482 when the parties have compromised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cannot-set-aside-convictions-based-on-compromise-between-parties-bombay-hc/story-BmTFzXxrqMCcq6OQFpg9BL.html
06-01-2021||City||Forest dept’s Pune circle sees 15 leopard rescues in 2020, 14 deaths||PUNE At least 15 leopard rescues were conducted in 2020, while a total of 14 leopard deaths were recorded in the Pune circle, which consists of Pune, Solapur, Junnar and Bhor.Junnar, which has a high density of leopards, recorded the highest number of deaths as well, as well as the most rescues, seven. The Junnar division also has the Manekdoh Leopard rescue centre in its jurisdiction. “Our staff, and volunteers from the village are trained as these operations happen routinely. We do not maintain data of the rescued animals; our staff members just show up whenever there is a call or a sighting. Barring the lockdown period, we take monthly workshops for those involved in rescue missions,” Jayaramegowda R, deputy conservator of Forests (territorial), Junnar division, Pune circle.On Tuesday, forest department officials rescued a leopard which had injured itself by getting caught in a fence built around a sugarcane field, that was meant to prevent wild boars from entering.“We transquilised it and took it to the rescue centre. There it will be treated and kept along with 34 others. There are animals of various ages, some are man-eaters, some are younger ones who have been recently rescued,” said Jayaramegowda.One of the two deaths reported from Manikdoh leopard rescue centre in 2020 was that of a 22-year-old female who passed away on December 13. Of the 14 deaths reported in Pune circle, 13 are from Junnar division, of which five died of natural causes, three in road accidents, three fell to their death in wells, and two were killed due to unknown reasons. “It is a leopard rescue centre, but anytime any animal is in trouble, we offer rescue. It was established here in 2002 as the man-animal conflict is high in this area. Within five years, the number of sightings shot up so Wildlife SOS was involved in 2007. We have a limit of 35 animals so we cannot take in more. We keep the animal only if it is orphaned, old, or injured,” said Dr Nikhil Bangar, Wildlife Veterinary Officer, Wildlife SOS, working with the Forest department.The forest department, along with Wildlife SOS, provides help even elsewhere in the circle when it comes to wildlife rescue. The staff members from Junnar division, due to their skillset, were involved in the killing of a man-eater leopard in Karmala, Solapur in December, while they also helped rescue a deer in the Chakan area of Pune in the same month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forest-dept-s-pune-circle-sees-15-leopard-rescues-in-2020-14-deaths/story-GoFuzVhnlNu5iFIq4RO9QK.html
06-01-2021||Patna||No threat to NDA govt in Bihar, all matters being sorted out: RCP Singh||RCP Singh, the newly appointed national president of ruling Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), has dismissed speculation about the future of chief minister Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in Bihar as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has begun asserting itself as the biggest party of the grouping. In an interview, Singh insisted the government does not face any threats and issues among NDA alliance partners will be amicably resolved. Edited excerpts:How challenging is your new role given your party now has lesser lawmakers than the BJP?The confidence level is not low. The numbers do not always matter. The [Bihar assembly election] results have been below par due to a number of factors. We are analysing everything. JD (U) remains a party with strong footprints in Bihar as well as a few other states like Arunachal Pradesh and Jharkhand. It has a charismatic leader [Kumar], who works for inclusive development. We are working on strengthening the party further.Also Read: BJP lawmaker takes part in Covaxin trial in PatnaThe BJP poached your lawmakers in Arunachal and due to a wafer-thin majority in Bihar, there could be a threat to your government too... the Rashtriya Janata Dal still hopes to form the government...In Arunachal, the BJP had a majority on its own. But six of our lawmakers switched over apparently lured by power and prospects of getting posts. JD (U) had no alliance with the BJP there. Such a thing also happened in Nagaland. But these things will not make any difference to Bihar. Here NDA is old and both the BJP and the JD (U) have been together for years.Do you see any threat to the NDA government in Bihar?The NDA has the numbers. It also has the support of Independents and the Lok Janshakti Party. There is no threat to the government, which has started working on its promises. The opposition is daydreaming. The first priority for the government is free Covid-19 vaccination. Our state executive meeting is also scheduled for January 9-10, where we will reassess the organisational situation. A tall leader like Nitish Kumar, who walks the talk, makes a huge difference. Our leader has a reputation not only in the state but at the national level. That is a big advantage for the party to build on. People trust him not because he talks, but because he delivers. I have been with Kumar for 23 years and I know he is one who cannot compromise with his ideology and principles. Ideology is what makes a party. We have remained with our ideology all through.Why is there a delay in cabinet expansion...? The expansion will happen and there is no confusion. It is natural that the BJP being the larger party will have a larger share. The ministries have been allotted to all four constituents. ...it will happen at the right time. It is for all the alliance partners to decide who they want in the cabinet. ...Union cabinet [expansion] is the Prime Minister’s prerogative. All parties want to have a bigger share. In a coalition, all sides need to respect each other’s sentiments.Why are 12 nominations to the legislative council stuck?The seats have been vacant since May 2020. [The issue] will also be resolved amicably. The opposition is unnecessarily trying to find fissures. Talks will happen in this regard soon. In the NDA, the relationship is built on trust. Who gets how many will be decided once talks get underway?Will JD (U) also contest elections in West Bengal and Assam?We do want to spread our footprints, but a decision in this regard will be taken on the basis of the reassessment by the party’s state units. We do not want to fight just for the sake of it. We will like to fight to win. Wherever the organisational base is strong, the party will take feedback and accordingly decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/no-threat-to-nda-govt-in-bihar-all-matters-being-sorted-out-rcp-singh/story-lO0KekoqSMAce3G2tI988J.html
06-01-2021||City||‘Actual number of leopards is much higher considering non-forested areas’||PUNE The report, ‘Status of leopards in India 2018’ was published by Prakash Javadekar, minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, on December 22, 2020. The report has shown an increase in the population of leopards in India, with the third largest population of the wild cat in Maharashtra. NH Kakodkar is one of two chief wildlife wardens in Maharashtra involved in the tiger and leopard status estimation between 2017 and 2019, according to the report. Following are the excerpts from an interview with Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Maharashtra.What are the conclusions from the “Status of leopards in India 2018” report?This is a periodic report that is generated. The last was in 2014. The vegetation, herbivores, carnivores, and other factors are studied in tandem. For leopard estimation, tiger-dominated forest areas were sampled. Other areas like tea, coffee plantations and sugarcane fields in Maharashtra were not sampled. Due to the limited number of staff, we could not cover those areas. Therefore, the actual number of leopards is much higher considering those living in non-forested areas.Will it be right to say that most of the leopard deaths are in non-forested areas? Is the non-sampling of non-forested areas a drawback (in this context)?Yes, that is correct, but there is no drawback. The number of leopards has increased. In Maharashtra, sugarcane fields become good habitats due to the ready availability of water, easy prey and minimum human presence. Naturally, more population would mean more deaths even though there are reasons like road accidents and leopards falling in to wells. Of the 172 deaths recorded, 86 are due to natural causes and 62 are accidental deaths.Under what circumstances is it decided to put a leopard down?If an animal is causing repeated human deaths, the Wildlife Protection Act has provisions to allow for such orders to be issued. The first attempt, of course, is to capture it. Lot of cages are laid and in most situations, with leopards, this works. Rarely will a leopard not enter a cage. In that case, it has to be shot. That is not the case with tigers. Tigers generally do not enter cages. It is risky because sometimes you do not realise when the animal is in close proximity. Tranquilising needs you to be in short range, while shooting allows for a longer range. How many sightings of the Great Indian Bustard have been reported in 2020?There have been two separate sightings from Nannaj in Solapur in 2020. We keep a watch on these sightings and our people talk to the farmers to tell us when they witness the bird. The reason for decreasing sightings are multiple. Bustards only lay 1 egg per year. For that to happen, there needs to be a male and a female. They are birds of grasslands. There are wild animals like wolves in the grasslands which affect these birds. People may have disturbed them. Electrocution is another reason given their wing span and typical placement of lines. There is also a change in the crop patterns (in areas where these birds breed); they require a certain height of grass to breed.Why is there such an uproar about Indian bison sightings? Gaurs have been seen in the outskirts before as well.It is unique for a gaur to be seen in the city. It is not normal. Yesterday (Tuesday), the animal did not enter the city, but it was very close. Had it crossed the highway, it would have been inside the city. Should city-dwellers get used to co-existing with the Indian bison?It will be very difficult for it to be taken normally. It is a heavy animal and shy too. It would not like to be around human beings. If it strays from its usual path and comes in contact with humans, it will difficult to manage. It is same as saying that city-dwellers should get used to tigers or leopards roaming around. And it is disturbing for the gaur too, to come in contact with vehicular traffic and humans. It gets confused. However, people should not chase them and create panic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/actual-number-of-leopards-is-much-higher-considering-non-forested-areas/story-sfbeAocBCUW4q78o9z6vTM.html

In an attempt to provide relief to parents and resolve the matter, Zilla Parishad (ZP) chief executive officer Ayush Prasad will be conducting a hearing on January 6. Prasad said that the schools have been asked to allow the students to fill the form and appear for class 10.“Parents approached us regarding the matter. So we have asked the parents and schools to meet us on January 6. We will be asking schools to let the students fill the form and appear for the class 10 from their respective schools as they have been students for a long time there. Because of pandemic, some parents are not able to pay the entire fees. They should be given a few more months to pay the fee. However, meanwhile the child should not suffer. And so we have called the meeting to resolve the matter,” said Prasad.Jayshree Deshpande, president of the parents’ association of Pune said that due to the pandemic, the parents were able to pay only half the fee. “But the schools have refused to fill the class 10 form of students. The children as well as parents are suffering due to this attitude. Despite several complaints launched at the DYDE and several meetings with the school management, the issue has not been resolved,” said Deshpande. She added that at last there is a hearing on this matter. Parents are hopeful that some concrete decision will be taken to give relief to parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/zp-ceo-to-intervene-in-non-payment-of-school-fees-issue/story-EgdsUNv1bWvNZJOQlmm6wL.html

Officials are planning to use drones to monitor birds in wetlands in the Terai region of the state. The Terai region in the state witnesses the arrival of many migratory birds during the winter, making it a sensitive area. Abhilasha Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) of the Terai central forest division, said that an alert has been issued and patrolling increased in wetland areas. Dr. SB Pandey, chief veterinary officer of Dehradun district, where five birds have been found dead in the past two days, said, “From the postmortem examination report of the two crows and one bird that were found dead on Tuesday, it has been revealed that they died likely due to worm infection. They did not show any signs of bird flu, however, their viscera samples have been preserved and in case large number of mortalities is reported then those samples will be sent for testing at the high-security animal laboratory in Bhopal.” Also Read: Uttarakhand BJP chief calls leader of opposition ‘Budhiya’, stirs political stormHe further said that an inspection of Asan Conservation Reserve, the state’s sole wetland of international importance, was conducted by both forest and animal husbandry department on Wednesday. “I inspected the entire premises of the Asan Conservation Reserve, which is home to maximum migratory birds in the state on Wednesday and we did not find anything suspicious.

06-01-2021||Pune||Case against Girish Mahajan transferred to Pune||A case registered in Jalgaon against former minister and senior BJP leader Girish Mahajan and 28 others for extortion, criminal conspiracy, and forgery among multiple other allegations, was transferred to Kothrud police station in Pune on Monday. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Vijay Bhaskarrao Patil (53), a lawyer and a resident of Jilhapeth in Jalgaon. He also works for the education society. Maratha Vidya Prasarak Samaj Limited, Jalgaon, is an education society that has 29 schools, 10 junior colleges, 10 skill development institutions, three graduate colleges, and one teaching college, according to the complainant. He also claims that the total valuation of the society is over Rs 1,000 crore. “Yes, a case has been registered at Kothrud. I have appointed ACP Machindra Chavan (of Kothrud division) as the investigation officer. The case has come to us only today. Once we go through it, accordingly the next step will be taken,” said Pornima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3 of Pune police. One of the accused, Tanaji Bhoite, is allegedly a former secretary of the society. The complainant has claimed that 20 people were appointed to the society office through elections in May 2015. Earlier when case was lodged at Jalgaon, Mahajan refuted the allegations saying they concocted. “There has been an attempt to drag me in vendetta politics,” he had said while speaking to news channels in December. In January 2018, Bhoite allegedly sent people to call the complainant to Pune under the guise of handing over official documents to him at Bhoite’s flat in Pune. Patil went to Pune in his Swift Dzire car after two to three days and was asked to redirect to a restaurant in Kothrud instead of Bhoite’s flat. At the restaurant, he was escorted by four men towards Bhoite who connected with former minister Girish Datta Mahajan through a video call, according to the complainant. Over the call, Mahajan allegedly asked the complainant to force every member of the society to resign and sell the society to him. Bhoite offered Rs 1 crore for it during the alleged meeting. After the meeting, the complainant claims to have been taken to a flat in Sadashiv peth in a Skoda car. The complainant and his brother were stripped and kept in the flat for a day after which he was threatened with a false case under MPDA if he refuses to force the society members to resign. Since then, the complainant was allegedly extorted for Rs 5, 00,000 from time to time, according to his complaint. A case under Sections 120(b) (criminal conspiracy), 331 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to extort confession, or to compel restoration of property), 384 (extortion), 379 (theft), 447 (criminal tresspass), 448 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking), 449 (house-trespass in order to commit offence punishable with death), 454, 465 (forgery), 467, 468, 471, 474, 504, 506(2) (criminal intimidation), 511, 109, 34 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Kothrud police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/case-against-girish-mahajan-transferred-to-pune/story-K5yX1WJAA51ModayfsC7EP.html

I was representing Anjali Damania and have court documents from the time when the proceedings were on in court. I agreed to hand over the documents provided that they pay for the photocopies. There are 1,054 documents,” said Sarode. A man had come to the lawyer’s office in Pune on Tuesday but upon failing to produce an identification of ED, the lawyer refused to hand over the documents. “For all those documents, one man showed up claiming to be from ED but he did not have an identity card,” said Sarode. The case against Khadse is of corruption registered by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on April 10, 2017, based on a 2016 complaint of Pune-based builder Hemant Gawande. The land in the industrial area of Bhosari was allegedly handed over to Khadse’s wife, who is also accused in the case, without following due procedure.

The October-December demand was down 40% 2,054 units compared to the corresponding period of 2019.Now unsold residential stock in Kolkata stands below 29,000. Demand in South and Northern part of the city was higher in the H2 of 2020 while other regions witnessed decline including Rajarhat.Dutta said now parameters are best for investment in properties even as prices for 2021 are not projected to rise unless any major sop like waiver of stamp duty is announced.But, excess stock will continue to decline.Speaking about office space trend Knight Frank said demand for office space is also picking up from smaller IT and ITeS companies who are reshuffling their premises to optimise cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-residential-property-price-eases-4-in-2020/story-GNp1jFyfZHqgZwaFeGauuL.html

As many as 170 students are enrolled in this school in classes 6 to 12. This school has three rooms: one is being used for teachers and the remaining two house library and science lab. The school falls under Badhra constituency represented by Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala’s mother Naina Singh Chautala.Neha Kumar, a student of Class 9, said they are forced to study under the open sky irrespective of any season.“We are studying in the open for the past four years. In such cold conditions, it is very difficult for us to study, but we do not have any other option. During rain, we were asked to go home as the school does not have a building for students,” she added.A Class 12 student, Nitesh Kumar, said, “We managed to save ourselves from Covid-19, but this chilly weather will someday prove dangerous. Our parents have requested senior officials to construct more rooms, but to no avail. The government’s claim of providing good infrastructure has fallen flat. I have been studying in the open since 2017,” he added. School principal Surajmal said their building was abolished in 2017 after it was declared ‘unsafe’.“Since then, not a single room has been built here and our students have no option other than studying under the open sky. We met local MLA Naina Chautala and Bhiwani-Mahendergarh MP Dharmbir Singh, urging them to construct more rooms, but they failed to fulfill their commitment. The construction of the building process has yet to start,” he added.As per the principal, 102 students of classes 9-12 are attending classes these days. Block development officer Jaldhir Singh said the government has floated a tender of Rs 4.17 crore to construct the school building and the process of construction will soon get started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-classrooms-force-dadri-govt-school-kids-to-study-in-open/story-IYSHxeecyFnIdFnKYe5eGJ.html

06-01-2021||Bangalore||Yediyurappa points fingers towards BJP high command on cabinet expansion||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Wednesday pointed fingers towards BJP high command regarding the much awaited expansion or reshuffle of his cabinet, saying the central leadership of the party will decide on it.The statement of the chief minister amid speculations that the cabinet expansion or reshuffle was likely this month, is seen as an indication of the process getting further delayed.“Regarding cabinet expansion, central leaders (of BJP) will take a decision.Someone (aspirant) might have given a statement... why should I make a promise? Naturally whoever has to become (a minister) they will become,” Yediyurappa told reporters in response to a question about promising cabinet berths.Some ministerial aspirants have thrown their hat into the ring, making no secret of their wish amid renewed speculations that the cabinet process was likely this month.BJP MLC R Shankar had on Tuesday met chief minister Yediyurappa and later claimed the expansion would happen in 2 -3 days and that he will be made a minister.However, reacting to Shankar’s claims, chief minister’s political secretary and MLA MP Renukacharya had clarified that no discussion has taken place on the expansion or reshuffle yet, and the party national general secretary (Arun Singh) has instructed them to wait for the right time.While Yediyurappa has pointed fingers towards the high command regarding the cabinet exercise, BJP national General Secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh after attending party meetings in Shivamogga on Sunday had maintained that the expansion of the state cabinet was likely soon and it was chief minister’s prerogative.Yediyurappa has been waiting for some time now to carry out the cabinet exercise, as he was asked by BJP president JP Nadda during their meeting in New Delhi on November 18, to wait for the clearance from the central leadership.The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for the chief minister, considering that there are too many aspirants, from the party old guard to Congress- JD(S) rebels who are now BJP legislators.The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/yediyurappa-points-fingers-towards-bjp-high-command-on-cabinet-expansion/story-I5163BqyBFRNOpsgZhjfiM.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||Centre politicising farmers’ protests, alleges Shiv Sena||Alleging that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government is doing politics over farmers’ protest against the three agriculture laws, Shiv Sena on Wednesday said the government at the Centre does not want to resolve farmers’ issues and is playing “meeting-meeting” with them.Through its mouthpiece Saamna, the Shiv Sena said so far 50 farmers have lost their lives on the borders of freezing Delhi, and yet they are not ready to back out without the laws being repealed.“Despite eight rounds of discussion between the farmers and the Union ministers, if there is no result. The government has no interest in it. The government is doing politics and the farmers’ movement has to continue,” the party said.“It is freezing in Delhi. It has also been raining for the last three days. Water has entered the tents of the farmers and their clothes and beds are wet. Yet the farmers are not ready to back out. Farmers are determined to get the agriculture law repealed,” it said further.Shiv Sena further said in the eyes of the government, farmers’ sacrifice has no value, and added Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have intervened to resolve the issue.“If the government had a soul then the agriculture law would be repealed and this game played with the lives of farmers would have stopped immediately,” it added.After the eighth round of talks, the Centre could not reach any “solution” as the farmer unions remained “adamant” over repealing of the three farm laws, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said after the meeting on Monday.“We wanted farmer unions to discuss three laws clause-wise. We could not reach any solution as farmer unions remained adamant on the repeal of the laws,” Tomar had said.Earlier, Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson, Rakesh Tikait had claimed that 60 farmers have so far lost their lives during the ongoing agitation. He further said one farmer is dying every 16 hours and it is the government’s responsibility to give an answer.Farmers have been protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 last year against the newly enacted farm laws -- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-politicising-farmers-protests-alleges-shiv-sena/story-l64Jg7etVGcRkT51cdPhzH.html

06-01-2021||Delhi||Ice cream craze melts at India Gate this winter: Denizens fear Covid, vendors miss regulars||One would imagine ice cream to be the last thing people would venture out for when winter is at its peak. But when it comes to Delhiites, they have a thing for cold treats, especially when savoured with the gorgeous view of India Gate in the backdrop! This year, as mercury plummets to record lows, ice cream vendors around India Gate say they are disheartened at the abysmally low sales unlike previous years, and blame coronavirus for their losses. “There is a cold wave in northern India, and rain too showed it’s magic recently. Itne degree me to gadiyon ki line lag jati abhi tak. Pichle saal isi time pe yahan khoob bheed thi kyunki sardi me ice cream khane ka alag hi maza hai... But this year, the crowds are absent. Many people who used to come regularly to buy ice cream from us are not venturing out due to the fear of coronavirus,” says Rohit Gupta, an ice cream vendor at India Gate, where almost a dozen vendors set up shop every day, and stay put for the entire year. The lockdown last year was the first blow to their income, and led to many a vendors going back to their home towns since they couldn’t make ends meet in absence of a livelihood. And now they have returned only to face low sales, in winters, too. Gupta rues, ”Pichle saal January me itni sale thi jaise June ka mahina ho (The sale of ice cream last January was the same as it’s at the peak summers in June). Tab toh raat hone se pehle hi stock khatm ho jata tha. Par is baar toh pure hafte mein sirf ₹2,000 ka saaman bechna mushkil ho gaya hai. Saturday, Sunday mein sirf ₹200-300 ki ice cream hi bik pa rahi hai!” The regular vendors at India Gate say their ice cream stands bear a melancholic, desolate look, much like the lanes that lead to the C-Hexagon. “Hum ne milk wali ice cream stock karke rakhi thi because people prefer those in winter over ice lollies. Par uske liye bhi bahut hi kam log aa rahe hain. Aur baraf ka kharcha kaafi mehenga pad jata hai ice cream ko sahi taapman par rakhne ke liye,” says Anuj Kumar, another vendor whose stall is stationed in the same vicinity. He informs that vendors here work on a 15% commission basis, and hence the disappointing sales are a source of major concern. “Ye maan lijiye ki ₹500 ki sale pe ₹100 milte hain. Par itne kam mein hota hi kya hai aajkal! Most of us have exhausted our savings already,” adds Kumar.The ongoing Republic Day parade rehearsals has also caused the vendors to park their selling booths a little far from the usual spots, which doesn’t allow the cars to halt. “Safety to zaruri hai. Par isse hume dikkat hoti hai; gaadiyan ruk nahi paati to bikri aur kum hoti hai. Is baar toh New Year pe bhi bahut kum log aaye; jitni umeed thi, uski 10% sale bhi nahi hui,” says Devinder Singh, another ice cream seller at India Gate, adding, “Kuchh college ke bachche pehle regular aate the humare paas ice cream khareedne. Par ab unko dekhe huye bhi mahine beet gaye.” Those who relished the winter treats at this popular spot share that Covid-19 is certainly raising concerns, but they do make a trip to India Gate hoping to try out cups and cones. Mahima Bharadwaj, an IAS aspirant, who recently visited India Gate only to have an ice cream with her friends on New Year’s Eve, says, “Having an ice cream in winter is an inexplicable joy! I love having ice creams here. In fact earlier my friends and I would ride our bikes to come here every week. But now, because of Covid-19, we don’t step out that frequently. It feels sad to see very few vendors around here. And we had to park very far away and walk down looking for the vendors from whom we usually buy. This is bit inconvenient.” Another regular at India Gate, Delhi-based businessman Atul Bhatnagar, says his family had restricted their weekly visits to the ice cream stalls here, but have planned to resume them in 2021. He muses, “It’s such a nostalgic feeling! We have been coming here since our childhood, and can’t stop ourselves from visiting for the pure joy of having an ice cream here. I personally like to have tea whereas my family enjoys ice creams. Before the pandemic hit, we would often spend our evenings on weekends taking a stroll at India Gate, and indulging in our favourite delights. Now, we are careful to come only when there’s absolutely no possibility of bumping into a swarm of people, and we can maintain social distancing. We are going to resume our weekend trips after a long hiatus, and are excited about it!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ice-cream-craze-melts-at-india-gate-this-winter-denizens-fear-covid-vendors-miss-regulars/story-kpvTJ9oTOGJyNTnzaFO4PO.html

His neck was tied with a thicker rope,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/man-found-dead-in-bihar-family-accuses-neighbour-of-murder/story-jlutEMrFm2icsQHoMJkzKI.html

06-01-2021||Mumbai||TV channels airing ads promoting superstition liable to face action: Bombay HC||Stating that television channels that telecast advertisements promoting superstitious material are liable to face action, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to register offences against four TV channels for telecasting an advertisement promoting “Hanuman chalisa yantra.” The division bench of justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar declared that telecasting such advertisements was illegal and punishable under provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013.The bench said Section 3 of the Black Magic Act prohibits not only the act of black magic, evil practices, etc., but also propagation and promotion of such practices and magic. Under Section 3(2) of the Act, abetment of such activities is also an offence. “Thus, TV channels, which telecast advertisements (promoting superstitious material) also become liable under Section 3 of the Black Magic Act,” said the bench.Also Read: 24 years on, Maharashtra may okay waiver for Michael Jackson concertThe bench was hearing a petition filed by Rajendra Ambhore, a teacher from Aurangabad, complaining about advertisements being telecast on several channels that promoted certain “yantras” in the names of gods and godmen, luring people to buy articles claiming that they possessed miraculous supernatural powers and helped people get rid of almost all kinds of problems and fulfil their wishes.Ambhore claimed that in March 2015 he came across advertisements promoting “Hanuman chalisa yantra” on at least four channels and sought action against not just the advertisers, but also the TV channels and the actors who supported the purportedly false claims by stating that they had experienced the supernatural powers of the “yantras.”The advertiser, Telemart Shopping Network Pvt. Ltd., had responded to the petition contending that the rituals mentioned in their pamphlet were routine Hindu Vedic practices and could not be termed as black magic practices; in any case, the firm claimed, the petitioner purchased one “yantra” and immediately sent representations to various central and state authorities because he was not satisfied with the product.The argument, however, failed to impress the bench. The bench analysed the provisions of the Black Magic Act and declared that not only the advertisers of such products, but the channels telecasting the advertisements were liable to face action under provisions if the Black Magic Act.Taking due note of the fact that unsuspecting people fall prey to such false advertisements, the high court has also directed the state government to create a special cell at the state level to stop such advertisements, if they are aired on any channel and also to ensure that no such advertisements are telecast on TVIn the course of the judgment, the bench also expressed anguish over the fact that though basic education is available to everybody in Maharashtra, people’s scientific temper and spirit of inquiry and reforms are not yet developed.“Even highly educated persons get attracted to things like mantra-tantra, black magic. Due to this superstitious approach of the rich and poor, educated and uneducated persons they are being exploited by so-called babas,” said the bench, adding that because of this, the Black Magic Act was required to be enacted in a state like Maharashtra, which is considered to be a progressive state and a state of reformists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/channels-airing-advertisements-promoting-superstition-liable-to-face-action-bombay-hc/story-NSg4Stf4SzQXLqhIVEBWNK.html
06-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP chief calls leader of opposition ‘Budhiya’, stirs political storm||A political storm is raging in Uttarakhand after the ruling BJP’s state president, Bansidhar Bhagat, called the leader of opposition and a senior Congress leader, Indira Hridayesh, a ‘Budhiya’ (an old woman) while addressing party workers in an event in Bhimtal area of Nainital district on Tuesday evening. Bhagat use of the term, which was perceived to be derogatory by the Congress party, came while he was responding to the 79-year-old Congress leader’s recent claim that several BJP MLAs were in touch with the grand old party eyeing a switch.Soon after the video of Bhagat’s address started making the rounds on social media, Congress leaders demanded an immediate apology while some party members burnt his effigy alleging he had “insulted motherhood.”Bhagat was addressing BJP workers in Bhimtal as part of his ongoing visit to all the 70 constituencies in the state. “Humari neta-pratipaksha keh rahi bahut se vidhayak humare sampark me hain...Are budhiya tujhse kyun sampark karenge??? Doobte jahaz se koi sampark karega???” (Our Leader of Opposition says that several MLAs are in touch with us. Why would they contact you old woman? What would one want to do with a sinking ship?)Reacting sharply to his statement, Hridayesh said, she was “hurt and saddened” with the kind of language used by the BJP state president and demanded that the ruling party’s national leadership takes “serious notice” of the incident.“I was deeply hurt and saddened with the kind of derogatory and highly condemnable language used by BJP state president who symbolizes the party and leads it. If he uses such language, then it is an insult to the motherhood which the women of our hills will never forgive,” said Hridayesh. “I don’t use such dirty language, so won’t reply to him by stooping to his level. But I request the BJP governments in both state and the Centre and well as their national leadership to take notice of this episode and demand answers from him. Those raising the slogan of Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao should at least take care of their language.”Also Read: Char Dham shrines, hilly areas of Uttarakhand receive fresh snowfall Congress state president Pritam Singh too condemned Bhagat and demanded an apology. “His words just show the sort of mentality BJP leaders have towards women. He should offer an apology immediately for his highly condemnable language,” said Singh. Amid the furore over the incident, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat offered an apology to Hridayesh on Twitter at midnight and said that he would call her on Wednesday to apologise again. “Respected Indira Hridayesh ji, I am very upset today. Women are very respectable to us. I personally apologise to you and all others who are saddened like me. I will speak to you personally on phone and apologise again.” Rawat said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-bjp-chief-calls-leader-of-opposition-budhiya-stirs-political-storm/story-ONHPIFa3cnMYB3fEZCloMI.html

I hope my action will dispel doubts raised by some opposition leaders over the reliability of the indigenous vaccine. I thank the Prime Minister and our scientists for developing the indigenous vaccine.”The Opposition has criticised the Centre for prematurely rolling out Covaxin without the completion of its phase III trials.

06-01-2021||Mumbai||24 years on, Maharashtra may okay waiver for Michael Jackson concert||The Maharashtra cabinet is likely to take up on Wednesday a proposal regarding a Michael Jackson concert held in the state capital way back in 1996. The proposal seeks waiver of Rs3.4 crore entertainment duty and release of the amount to the organisers of the late pop singer’s concert.The concert was organised on November 1, 1996, by Raj Thackeray-led Shiv Udyog Sena and the then Shiv Sena-BJP state government had granted waiver of Rs3.4 crore in entertainment duty to them. However, the waiver amount was deposited in the court’s treasury after it was challenged in Bombay high court by Mumbai Grahak Panchayat the same year.The state revenue department has now prepared a proposal for a decision on the waiver. It is of the opinion that the state has discretionary powers under Section 6(3) of the Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act 1923 to grant the waiver. It has now left it to the state cabinet to decide whether to uphold the previous Sena-BJP government’s decision or make the changes. It has also taken an opinion from the law and judiciary department before moving the proposal before the cabinet, said a senior official from the state revenue department.“We have taken an opinion from the law and judiciary department, which states that the waiver was granted according to the law. The organisers have also requested the state government to release the amount,” he said.The then Shiv Sena-BJP government had granted the waiver from the entertainment duty to the concert on the grounds that the profit will be used for charity purposes.However, in April 2011, a division bench of the Bombay high court slammed the state government for “non-application of mind” and set aside its order for exemption from the entertainment duty. It has further asked the state government to reconsider its decision. Interestingly, the proposal is again coming for discussion before the state cabinet headed by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/24-years-on-maharashtra-may-okay-waiver-for-michael-jackson-concert/story-9ANFkdOmtiZpFbPjFHIihO.html

Rampal also appeared before the agency in November and December last year in connection with the case following which the NCB said he might be called again due to ‘discrepancy’ in his statement, according to Sameer Wankhede, Zonal Director of NCB, Mumbai. “There was a discrepancy in Arjun Rampal’s statement. He can be called for questioning once again,” he told ANI The anti-drugs agency raided the residence of the actor on November 9 and seized some electronic gadgets. His girlfriend Gabriella Demetriades was later questioned for six hours the same day. Rampal and Demetriades were allegedly roped in by the NCB after they discovered the involvement of the latter’s brother Agisilaos Demetriades in drug cases and found that he was in touch with many Bollywood celebrities, an NCB officer said.However, in a post on Twitter on January 1, Rampal reiterated that he has ‘never been on the wrong side of the law’. “So, as we head into 2021 it is concern that makes me pen down my thoughts of a year that filled millions of lives with fear, anxiety, disruption, scandals, hypocrisy, lies, truths, realisation, enlightenment, bravery, strength, courage, charity, confusion, clarity and character. Most of these emotions I have felt myself, as I silently observed each and every one of them overwhelm me with an emotion that each of the adjectives bring,” he wrote on the microblogging site. The federal agency has been quizzing an array of Bollywood actors and their contacts regarding the investigation into the Mumbai-based film industry’s alleged drug links. The matter reportedly came to light during the probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June last year at his Bandra apartment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ncb-summons-arjun-rampal-s-sister-in-drugs-case-official/story-7nFDoQZKHuCnr3mtNaZUJP.html

On failing to make any recovery, the Karnal district food and supplies department has now attached properties of 15 millers to recover rice worth ₹60 crore. “We are making efforts as per the government policy for the recovery from mills which failed to return rice to the government as per the schedule,” said Nishant Rathee, Karnal district food and supply controller. In October last year, Haryana food and civil supplies department had sealed two mills of a Karnal-based trader for not returning 10,696 MT custom milled rice (CMR) worth ₹37 crore since 2019. In July last year, Panipat police had booked a mill owner for not giving back 3,349 MT rice. Millers were engaged in procurement of paddy for the government agencies on MSP as per the CMR policy under which, they return 67% of the rice of total allotted paddy. According to the food and supplies department, recovery from these mills is a tough task for government as last year, a similar case was reported in Kaithal district when the government had also ordered registration of criminal cases against the owners of RG Enterprises, Rajnish Miglani and Girish Miglani, who had failed to return 400 MT rice worth ₹7 crore. However, as per the officials, no recovery has been made from them till date and process to auction their properties is going on.Two officials from Haryana food and supplies department, on the condition of anonymity, said rice millers took advantage of the weak CMR policy under which they could procure rice worth several crores with surety of ₹50 lakh. In the case of millers, who have taken rice mills on lease, they will be allowed to procure paddy on a surety of ₹50 lakh each from two guarantors and two running rice mills.Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department additional chief secretary (ACS) PK Das said efforts were being made for the recovery of pending rice or equal amount from these mills. “We are now attaching their properties. These properties of rice millers and their guarantors will be auctioned for the recovery if required and criminal cases are also being registered against them,” he added.When asked if there is a need of amendment in the CMR policy to avoid such losses in future, the ACS said, “We have already tightened the noose around defaulting rice mills. We will make sure that entire rice comes back to the government as per the schedule.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/millers-did-not-return-over-2-lakh-mt-rice-worth-523-crore-to-haryana-govt-since-2012/story-4XEgxiUO06fgUZJKyokiKO.html
06-01-2021||Chandigarh||Termination of driver over Facebook post: HC summons Haryana financial commissioner||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday summoned financial commissioner, revenue, Haryana government for January 8 in the controversy surrounding sacking of a driver in Hisar district over his Facebook post against deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala. The order was passed by high court bench of Justice Anil Kshetarpal as the bench was not satisfied with the response of the state government. “Detailed order is awaited. However, the court has summoned financial commissioner, revenue, for January 8,” Anil Mehta, counsel for Panna Lal, said. On December 29, the government had admitted to sacking of a driver, Panna Lal, who was a contractual employee with subdivision officer (civil), Hansi, and was terminated from services on December 15. It had reasoned that the driver’s conduct and work were not satisfactory as he wrote a post on social media against the deputy chief minister, which is a serious offence. After conducting preliminary inquiry, his service was dispensed with. State’s response had come on the plea of Panna Lal, who had alleged that he was terminated without being afforded an opportunity of personal hearing and without following the principles of natural justice. As per the government, he was appointed in May 2018 for one year and thereafter his term was extended up to July 25, 2020. He has no right of continuity in service. On violation of Article 311 (2) by the government in his termination, which lays down that a chargesheet has to be issued and the employee has to be afforded a reasonable time to put across his stand, the government had argued that him being a contractual employee, these provisions do not apply in his case. Lal had further claimed the posts in question against the deputy chief minister were made by someone else and not him and that too in 2018-2019, when he was not even a deputy chief minister. However, state had countered it by stating that the posts in question were put out recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/termination-of-driver-over-facebook-post-hc-summons-haryana-financial-commissioner/story-cnb2gZ6EVD9bhv9di44CZO.html
06-01-2021||Chandigarh||Gurugram land release case: Contempt petition filed by appellant in apex court, TCP official asked to respond||The Supreme Court has issued a notice to a senior Haryana town and country planning (TCP) and urban estate department official in a contempt petition filed by an appellant in Gurugram land release case. The petitioner, Jai Naryana, in his contempt petition, has said that despite the apex court orders of November 1, 2017, the TCP department has not decided his representation pertaining to the release of his four-kanal land. The SC, while ordering a CBI inquiry in the release of 95% of the about 1,400 acres under acquisition land of eight villages of Gurugram, had also ordered that the representation of appellant Jai Naryana pertaining to release of his land be considered and decided objectively. “In the facts and circumstances of the case, it was submitted by the counsel for the appellant that as his land is not required, he may file a representation to the respondent for the release of land. It is assured by the counsel for the state that in case representation is filed, it would be considered and decided objectively,” the November 2017 apex court order reads. Taking up the contempt petition, the SC bench of Justice Vineet Saran and Justice Ajay Rastogi on January 4 ordered: “Issue notice returnable immediately after six weeks. In case response is filed by the next date of hearing, the respondent need not be present in person.” The petitioner contended that he had filed a representation for release of his acquired land on November 24, 2017. But despite the orders of the apex court and assurance given by the counsel for the state government, the orders have not been complied with. “Thus, the contemnor has committed contempt of the Supreme Court and liable to be punished,” the petition said. The petitioner also contended that the state government had told the apex court that this land was required to be acquired for setting up a power substation in Gurugram’s Sector 65. “ It is relevant to note that an electricity substation has already come up wherein the land of the petitioner was not even required. The possession of the land on which the electricity substation came up had been handed over by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN),” the petitioner said. The erstwhile Congress government had in 2009 issued a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act to start the process to acquire about 1,400 acres of eight Gurugram villages — Nagli Umarpur, Tigra, Ullahwas, Kadarpur, Maidawas, Badshahpur, Behrampur and Ghata — for development of residential Sectors 58 -63 and commercial Sectors 65- 67. However, while issuing the declaration under Section 6, the total area was reduced to about 800 acres. The award dated May 29, 2012 was finally passed for 87 acres only. The apex court in its order said that about 1,300 acre was released by the government in favour of private builders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gurugram-land-release-case-contempt-petition-filed-by-appellant-in-apex-court-tcp-official-asked-to-respond/story-8zh0309WoRbHcXHZyKftXP.html

As per the reports from meteorological department, rains lashed most parts of northern districts of Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and Yamunanagar. The MeT department has also predicted rain in several parts of the state in the next 24 hours. As per the experts, the prevailing cold conditions are favourable for wheat plant. “This rain is a boon for wheat crop as it will improve tailoring and growth in both the early and lateral varieties,” said Karam Chand, deputy director, Haryana agriculture department. He said light rainfall is also good for vegetables and other crops as it will lessen the impact of icing and snow. According to experts, the crop requires temperature below 22°C. “This year, weather is good for the crop and rainfall at regular intervals will help in increasing the yield,” said a farmer, Sunil Kumar, of Karnal. The agriculture experts have advised the farmers against excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides as the ongoing weather conditions will work as growth promoter. A spokesman of meteorological department Chandigarh, said thunderstorm and lightning accompanied with hailstorms are likely to be witnessed at isolated places in Haryana.“Dense fog is expected to prevail in the state on January 6 and light fog is likely to continue at isolated places till January 9,” the spokesman added.Vikas Dhatarwal, a farmer from Garwa in Bhiwani, said such unseasonal rain is helpful in the growth of mustard, wheat, barley, vegetables and gram crops.Ankit Beniwal, a farmer from Hisar, said they witnessed hailstorm for a short duration, but it would not impact the crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-brings-cheer-to-wheat-growers/story-GiYxz5MZ9GemwX00IaXZUM.html

In a detailed judgment released on Tuesday, the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh observed that even though it is not discarding the probe conducted by the SIT led by deputy inspector general (DIG) RS Khatra, the team should be headed by a different officer so as to ensure that “no element of prejudice”, whatsoever, remains in the mind of the petitioner. The judgment has come on the plea of one Sukhjinder Singh, a dera Sacha Sauda follower, who had challenged a summoning order by a trial court, passed after the chargesheet was filed against him by SIT into an registered on June 2, 2015, at Baja Khana police station in Faridkot. The bench further clarified that the petitioner cannot chose an investigating agency of his own choice and the court directing such change would not in any manner reflect on the conduct of the officer. The court also questioned how the petitioner levelled allegations of mala fide against Khatra, but did not make him a party in the case. Khatra, though associated with the probe almost since beginning, was made the SIT head on April 22, 2020. The second SIT, being headed by Bureau of Investigation head Arpit Shukla with Inspector General of Police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh as member, is looking into violence case reported after the sacrilege incidents of 2015. On Monday, the high court had asked the CBI to hand over case files pertaining to sacrilege cases within one month. It had quashed the summons issued by Faridkot court to the petitioner issued on the basis of challan presented by SIT in July 2020. The high court has also termed proceedings before special CBI court, Mohali, in this case as “unsustainable” and further directed that all material presented before it would be handed over to Punjab Police. The Punjab Police would take into account evidence collected by the CBI and file a supplementary challan in the FIR, the court has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2015-sacrilege-cases-high-court-wants-sit-head-dig-khatra-replaced/story-mrq4UyLZ3XLCIGxIPIDIrJ.html

So, we have decided not to invite him for the events being organised by us,” the SGPC chief told mediapersons here after the executive committee meeting of the apex gurdwara body. Modi was the chief guest at the event to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak. Currently, the SGPC plans to celebrate the upcoming 400th birth anniversary of ninth Sikh master Guru Teg Bahadur in a big way. Demanding immediate reopening of the Kartarpur corridor, the SGPC chief said, “The Government of India should respect the sentiments of the sangat (community). The corridor, which was temporarily closed due to pandemic, should be reopened as the situation has now improved.” The SGPC has also decided to organise a grand function to commemorate Baba Jiwan Singh, a Sikh general and companion of 10th Sikh master Guru Gobind Singh. “Guru Gobind Singh gave Baba Jiwan Singh a title of ‘Ranghreta Guru Ka Beta’. A joint function will be organised every year at Anandpur Sahib on a grand scale to commemorate his sacrifice”, said the SGPC chief. “To cut down expenditure on power, we have decided to install solar panels at gurdwaras. Besides, we are also mulling to implement the concept of a steam kitchen in the gurdwaras”, she said. The SGPC president also appealed to the sangat visiting the shrine not to do anything to offend the dignity of the shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/modi-s-stance-anti-farmer-won-t-invite-him-for-upcoming-sikh-centenary-events-says-sgpc/story-27UjgCBkh7cYA14LfSJeWK.html

06-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi winter: Soak in the sun at these scenic spots in the city||Chilly winter and on top of that a long spell of rain that recently enveloped the Capital. Wanna feel the bright and beautiful sun on your face without worrying about breaching social distancing norms? There are quite a few spots in Delhi-NCR that offer a chance to do just that. Here you can enjoy a leisurely stroll, indulge the photographer in you, or even have a picnic with your loved ones. Plant lovers’ nook: Sunder Nursery Many cracked reading the recent viral tweet that mentioned how Delhi is now divided into North Delhi, East Delhi and Sunder Nursery! The popularity of this place, since it’s revamp and from the time when the pandemic struck, has risen so much that it has become a Delhiites’ go-to spot to escape Covid-19 blues! The lush lawns beckon revellers from far and wide, with people enjoying the weekly organic market, or the cafe on its premises. You could even carry a picnic basket and revel in the beauty of beautifully manicured gardens with friends and family. Shikha Sharma, a Delhi-based postgraduate student, says, “I enjoy going to the nursery because I love plants. I go and buy small plants for my room, or just to have a day out with my college friends. We are averse to the idea of crowded places and Sunder Nursery is our slice of green haven!” An avian photographer’s paradise: Okhla Bird Sanctuary There’s nothing like being in the lap of nature to beat the stress that Covid-19 has brought in our lives. And if you get company of feathered beings, then it’s cherry on the cake! After spending most of the time indoors, a number of denizens have taken to enjoy the sight of migratory birds at Okhla Bird Sanctuary, which follows strict social distancing norms. Kiranmoy Sarangi, a Delhi-based doctor and avian photographer, informs that the place is teeming with wildlife this time of the year, and adds, “The winter sun makes the park literally come alive! During my recent visits, I’ve spotted Eurasian Hobby, Peregrine Falcon, Common Kingfisher, Oriental Darter, White-throated Kingfisher, Striated Babbler and some ducks as well. It’s a terrific place to spend a day with a pair of binoculars.” Joggers’ delight: Nehru Park With a face lift that the park recently got, and a 22 meter synthetic track, it has become a favourite among running and jogging enthusiasts. The greenery only adds to the charm of a morning well spent under the bright sun. “I would walk in my colony earlier, but now I prefer walking at the park since it has good paths. The morning air is also fresh especially after the rain. It’s certainly difficult to get out in the winter, but my wife and I have made it ritual to go for a jog and then get tea from a nearby stall,” says Anil Bali, a Delhi-based businessman. Sunny side up: Garden of Five Senses Stunning art installations and aroma of freshly-bloomed flowers make Garden of Five Senses an ideal location to soak in some sunshine on a winter morning in the Capital. Barkha Bhatia, a Noida-based corporate employee, says she likes to explore the food joints near the lush gardens after a leisurely stroll. “I often go there just to clear my head, or practise yoga. It is getting more visitors of late than earlier, but you can still find solitary spots that are ideal for meditation. Plus, a lot of really cosy eateries in the vicinity make it a perfect hangout to spend a winter weekend,” she says. Archaeology on the side: Agrasen ki Baoli Steeped in history, this stepwell situated in Connaught Place has been ever popular among the tourists and locals alike. But, for Delhiites, it offers a quiet and serene spot that often turns into a photographers’ paradise due to its scenic architecture. Malyaj Asthana, a regular at this place, says, “I cycle every morning, and while crossing Connaught Place I often go to Agrasen ki Baoli. Sometimes I simply race up and down the steps whereas on other days I sit and read here. In winters, the place isn’t as crowded as usually, and allows me to lose myself in history without worrying about social distancing.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-winter-soak-in-the-sun-at-these-scenic-spots-in-the-city/story-mQwoeEBL8KiP3SbRmq5PTM.html

A single-judge bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge, while hearing the petition of the 42-year-old candidate, was informed by advocate AP Bhandari that his client had filed the nomination form by choosing female gender for contesting the election from the ward reserved for women-general category. However, the returning officer (RO) had rejected the nomination form on December 31 on the grounds that the petitioner is a transgender and there is no reservation for the transgender category in village panchayat elections. Bhandari further submitted that it was the first occasion in which the petitioner had opted for a ‘right to a self-perceived gender identity’ and selected the female gender for all purposes during her lifetime, and therefore, her nomination form should be considered. He assured the court that the petitioner would not switch to male gender under any circumstances anytime in future during her lifetime. Additional government pleader SB Pulkundwar for the state government and advocate AB Kadethankar for state election commission said they would not make submissions contrary to the directions of the Supreme Court to the central and state governments to formulate various welfare schemes for transgender community members and grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as a third gender. They submitted that the RO had, as likely to be unaware of this law, must have been in dilemma while deciding the issue of acceptance of the nomination form of the petitioner. After hearing the submissions, the court noted that the Centre had introduced the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and permitted a transgender person to have a right to be recognised, and a transgender is permitted to have a right to self-perceived gender identity. The court further observed, “It is quite apparent that the RO was handicapped insofar as the knowledge of law was concerned, while deciding the fate of the nomination form of the petitioner.” The court held that as petitioner has opted for the female gender as her self- perceived gender identity and had given an undertaking to not change it to male in her lifetime, the RO should accept the candidature, and quashed the RO’s December 31 order. “Since the nomination form of the petitioner is otherwise complete in all respects, the same stands accepted and she is permitted to contest the election from the ward and category which she has opted for in her nomination form,” the court concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bombay-hc-allows-transgender-to-fight-panchayat-poll-as-female-candidate/story-1Kqu5gYywsz4jx0TkCkYdM.html

On Tuesday, they sold a plate of food for Rs 70, and on Wednesday the same cost us Rs 100.”Dar claimed that like him many Kashmiris were forced to spend chilly nights under the crumbling Jammu bus stand where no bedding or heating arrangements were available to them. “The bus stand does not have multiple electricity sockets to charge mobile phones and shopkeepers take money from us to charge our phones,” he added.This is even as over 250 stranded vehicles, mostly carrying passengers, were cleared after the arterial road was briefly opened for one-way traffic between Banihal and Qazigund.“While no fresh traffic was allowed to ply on the highway due to inclement weather, most of the vehicles stranded between Ramban and Jawahar Tunnel were cleared,” said ADGP (traffic) T Namgyal.Ramban district administration has set up an emergency control room to meet any contingency and redress the grievances of the public and commuters. The district administration has advised the public to remain indoors and not venture out unnecessarily in view of snowfall and rains.Meanwhile, Jammu and other plains were lashed by heavy rains, while high-altitude areas in the region experienced intermittent snowfall for the third day on Tuesday. Jammu recorded 32.4mm of rain during the past 24 hours ending 8.30am Tuesday. Bhaderwah in Doda district, Banihal and Batote in Ramban district experienced 4cm, 3.2cm and 0.5cm of snowfall during the same period, an official said.Train service from Katra, Jammu unaffected Rains and snowfall across Jammu and Kashmir had no impact on train services from Katra and Jammu, said senior divisional traffic manager Sudhir Singh. However, nine flights in all — five to Srinagar, three to Delhi, one to Ahmedabad — were cancelled from Jammu airport due to bad weather.Weather to improve from todayThe meteorological department has predicted improvement in the weather from Wednesday forenoon. IMD director Dr Sonam Lotus has issued orange weather warning for south Kashmir, Banihal-Ramban, Chenab valley, Poonch and Rajouri for the next 24 hours.“Widespread heavy to very heavy snowfall and rain with thunder in plains of Jammu have been reported for the past two days.

06-01-2021||Mumbai||Former Mumbai Dabbawala Association spokesman held for fraud||The Ghatkopar police have arrested a former spokesperson of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association for allegedly duping his 61 colleagues of Rs7 lakh in an alleged loan fraud case. The accused, Subhash Talekar, was arrested near his native home in Pune on Monday night and produced before a court on Tuesday. He has been remanded to police custody till January 9. Apart from Talekar, a co-operative bank official and two of Talekar’s associates have also been booked in the case, and the police are on the lookout for the trio. The complainant in the case, 38-year-old Sachin Gavade, along with other members of the association, approached Ghatkopar police station in February 2019 and registered a case against Talekar and his two associates, Vitthal Sawant and Dashrath Kedari. As per the complaint, the accused took a meeting with the 61 dabbawalas in September 2015 and allegedly promised to give each of them a free moped to make their commute easier while delivering lunch boxes. The accused told the dabbawalas that there is a cooperative bank which was ready to provide them with the mopeds. The accused then took the signatures of the 61 people on papers and also collected their documents, said a police officer. After a year, the dabbawalas started receiving notices from the cooperative bank stating that the loan they had taken to buy the mopeds were sanctioned. The loan amount was transferred to the vehicle company to provide the mopeds. Thirty-eight of the 61 dabbawalas received the two-wheelers, but their documents were not cleared by the regional transport office (RTO) not did they did not got proper documents for the mopeds. The remaining 23 dabbawalas did not receive the two-wheelers, deputy commissioner of police Prashant Kadam of zone 7 (covering Mulund, Bhandup, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar areas) said. However, all of the 61 dabbawalas had to repay the amount for the loan taken on their names, since 2015, which has incurred to around Rs7 lakh. “We conducted an inquiry into the matter and booked three members of the association, including Talekar, for cheating, criminal breach of trust and common intention” said senior inspector Nitin Alakhnoore from Ghatkopar police station. The inquiry against the cooperative bank involved in the matter also ongoing and the official who connived with the Talekar and his associates will be arrested once the role is verified, added Alakhnoore. “There is an allegation that Talekar had taken the money on the name of the association, but we are verifying it, added another officer. Alakhnoore said the investigations in the case had begun in 2019 after the case against Talekar was lodged, but last year, investigations faced some roadblocks owing to the lockdown. “He had also moved the Bombay high court for anticipatory bail. After the court rejected the bail, we arrested him,” Alakhnoore added. Ulhas Muke, the chairman of Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Charitable Trust (NMTBSCT), which is the official body of dabbawalas, welcomed the development and said the accused has been “ruining the good image” of dabbawalas with such fraudulent practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-mumbai-dabbawala-association-spokesman-held-for-fraud/story-1IJ4qwLJS1glwk6Yt0AmSN.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC restrains state from granting final nod to 5 junior colleges||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday restrained the state school education department from granting final permission to five junior colleges, run by Rao Educational Trust, without the leave of the court. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni also restrained the department from acting on provisional index number granted to the trust by Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education.The order came on an interim application filed by Manju Jaiswal, a city resident and trustee of an educational trust, seeking stay to an order passed by school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on December 18, 2020, granting Rao Educational Trust time till academic year 2021-2022 to comply with the infrastructural requirements of the junior colleges.Gaikwad had also directed the department officials to take further steps to grant index number to the trust, to enable about 672 Class 12 students to fill forms for the board examination. Accordingly, a provisional index number was granted for five junior colleges run by the trust at Andheri, Borivli, Sion, Kharghar and Thane.Jaiswal had taken strong objection to the order and filed the interim application seeking stay on it. Her counsel, senior advocate Anil Sakhare, pointed out that the education minister had no authority under the Maharashtra Self Finance Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2012, to pass such an order.Sakhare also pointed out that the minister’s order was completely contrary to earlier orders passed by HC on Jaiswal’s petition, especially the order of January 28, 2020, by which HC has restrained the government from considering any application, either to start a new school or for permission for additional divisions or classes.In November 2020, HC modified the 28 January order and allowed the government to consider 410 applications of existing schools either for additional divisions in junior colleges or for starting new junior colleges, after the state assured that the applications will be considered strictly in accordance with the the Maharashtra Self Finance School (Establishment and Regulation) Rules, 2020.In her petition, Jaiswal has complained about permissions granted to several coaching classes for setting up junior colleges on the ground that those institutions did not fulfil legal requirements like 500-square-metre plots either on ownership or leasehold basis and the infrastructure mentioned in the 2012 enactment.She has sought cancellation of the permissions granted to several coaching classes to start junior colleges and also a direction for restraining the government from granting any new permission for self-financed schools, without strictly adhering to the provisions of the 2012 enactment.The January 28 order was passed by HC after noticing that the government machinery was not fully functional to implement the 2012 Act, and important authorities under the enactment were not notified and appointed.In this backdrop, HC had restrained state government from considering any pending or new applications for starting new schools under the 2012 Act.The bench had also restrained the government from renewing existing approvals or permissions unless a full-fledged inspection and scrutiny was undertaken by the state or field-level authorities – as may be notified by the rules – and directed to keep on hold all applications seeking renewal of existing permissions, until such scrutiny and verification was undertaken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-restrains-state-from-granting-final-nod-to-5-junior-colleges/story-DjbAYw46SLvByEDVCXVniK.html

06-01-2021||Mumbai||Dry run for Covid-19 vaccination in all Maharashtra districts on January 8||Maharashtra is planning to demand free Covid-19 vaccine shots for its poor as it prepares to roll out its immunisation drive with another dry run to be undertaken in all 36 districts on January 8.The state government on Monday also announced stricter norms for United Kingdom (UK) returnees detected with the new virus strain, especially after the Central government’s decision of resuming flight services between India and the UK from January 8. The state government has clarified that the quarantine period for passengers found with the new variant of the virus will range between 14 and 21 days and may be prolonged, depending on clinical conditions.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that in a video conference with the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on January 7, the state government is going to request the Centre to bear the cost of the vaccine shots for the poor. He said the people below poverty line cannot afford the vaccine even if two doses of it are priced at ₹500. “People below the poverty line, persons with comorbidities and above 60 years should be given the vaccine for free. We are going to raise this demand during our conference with the MoHFW on Thursday. Though there is no clarity on it as yet, we believe that it has been made free for health workers, frontline workers. The poor, too, should get it for free,” he said.Tope said that epidemic diseases and their handling is the responsibility of the Centre and the state has followed all its instructions and protocol right from the beginning of the outbreak. “For the past three months, the Centre has not been providing us equipment like ventilators, RT-PCR kits, and tablets like Remdesivir and Tocilozumab. The state has borne the expenses of making them available through public health services...We have also been bearing the establishment cost for the drive ,including training of the vaccinators, storage of the vaccine. Now, the Centre should take the responsibility of the cost of the vaccine for the poor,” he added.The health minister said that the state is going to conduct dry runs for vaccination in all the 36 districts, including Mumbai, on January 8. “Maharashtra is all set for the vaccination, which we expect to be rolled out in the next eight-10 days. We have a cold chain system in place, 16,000 vaccinators have been trained and are ready for the drive. 780,000 health care workers have already been registered on CoWIN app, while people from other categories, like frontline workers, are being registered by the respective departments. We are all set to roll out the programme once it is announced by the Centre. We expect the release of vaccine doses by the Centre in proportion to the registrations done,” Tope said.Meanwhile, keeping with the trend of fewer than 4,000 cases for the past 20 days, Maharashtra clocked 3,160 new infections and 64 new deaths. The case tally touched 1,950,171 and toll stood at 49,759. Mumbai clocked 539 new cases and nine deaths, taking the tally to 295,525 and toll to 11,147. Nagpur city reported 300 cases and three deaths, while Pune city clocked 250 cases and four deaths. The number of active cases further fell to 49,067 after 2,828 more patients were discharged over the past 24 hours. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) remains high at 2.55%, although the weekly mortality rate has dropped significantly over the past few weeks.In the wake of eight UK returnees found with the new strain of virus, the state government has decided to implement the health protocol for such patients strictly. Dr Shashank Joshi, leading endocrinologist and member of the state-appointed task force for clinical management of Covid-19 patients, said that they have chalked out stricter norms for UK returnees testing positive for the new strain. “The institutional quarantine period will be longer, ranging between 14 and 21 days or more than that for these passengers. The period varies on the basis of the immune competent and immune compromised conditions of the patients. Unless and until the doctors treating them are not convinced that they are not a threat to the community and their contact tracing is not completed, they will not be allowed to go home. We have asked the state for an aggressive approach in case of these passengers and have revised the guidelines of quarantine after few of them found with the new variant,” he said.Dr Joshi said district and state authorities have been directed to not let their guard down as the next few weeks are crucial. “The citizens should stick to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour to avoid a second wave or any spike in cases,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dry-run-for-covid-19-vaccination-in-all-maharashtra-districts-on-january-8/story-pMGw00Gxpe7UzoDZCcCGBN.html

06-01-2021||Mumbai||Hema Upadhyay murder case: Mumbai Police produce ‘missing’ tempo before the court||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday produced the tempo, allegedly used for disposal of the bodies of artist Hema Upadhyay and her lawyer Haresh Bhambani, before the sessions court. Upadhyay and Bhambani were allegedly smothered with a chloroform-laced cloth at a warehouse owned by one of the accused, Vidhyadhar Rajbhar, on December 11, 2015. The killers then packed their bodies in boxes and dumped them in a sewer in Kandivli. The prosecution has alleged that the tempo, belonging to another accused, Vijay Rajbhar, was used to transport the dead bodies from the warehouse to the sewer. Vijay’s lawyer Hassan Ali Moomen confirmed the development but said the tempo is not in the court’s custody. The tempo was seized by the police during the investigation in 2016. On October 21, 2016, Vijay’s father Ramadhar was allowed to take custody of the tempo with the police. He was asked to sign a bond stating that he would present the tempo before the court during the trial whenever asked for it. However, when the court asked Ramadhar to produce the tempo on one of the previous occasions, he said it was sold by Vijay’s wife. As Ramadhar failed to produce the tempo, the court on November 27 had directed the police to look for the vehicle and bring it before the court and also gave Ramadhar the last chance to produce the tempo. Meanwhile, Ramadhar on Tuesday moved an application claiming that the tempo was never seized by the police during the probe and his son has been falsely implicated. The prosecution has denied the claims.The prosecution also examined another witness, who had helped Rajbhar to travel to Bengaluru in August 2015 to buy chloroform. Moomen has alleged that the witness is fake. The main accused in the case, Upadhyay’s estranged husband Chintan, was arrested on December 22, 2015. The police believe Rajbhar committed the murder at Chintan’s behest over a property dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hema-upadhyay-murder-case-mumbai-police-produce-missing-tempo-before-the-court/story-dEVydYBhdxWchQmGwwOSAL.html

Kukreja requested for a thorough probe and said her daughter’s case must be tried in a fast-track court. Janhvi’s parents asked Singh to accelerate the case so that they could get closure as well as to set a precedent for other youth.Janhvi’s boyfriend, Shree Jodhankar, and a friend, Diya Padankar, have been arrested for murder and assault. An emotional Kukreja said she and her husband had trusted Janhvi’s friends and had allowed her to go with them but they killed her daughter. “I had sent Janhvi with friends and not strangers. A friend’s job is to protect,” said Kukreja. She and her husband said that even if there was a fight between two people, it was the duty of the other friends to stop them. “The statements of all the party attendees should be taken as it is shocking that no one heard my daughter’s screams. We are also trying to find out what exactly happened between the friends that it ended up in her murder and why did Shree Jodhankar flee the spot if it was an accidental death,” said Nidhi. The police on Tuesday had collected forensic evidence from the rooftop, where the party was held, as well as from the spot (second-floor staircase) where the body was found, and sent them for analysis.

Mukerjea is lodged at Byculla jail since her arrest in August 2015, in connection with Sheena Bora murder case.On Tuesday, the prison authority of Byculla jail submitted a reply on Mukerjea’s plea stating, that as per rule undertrial prisoners booked in a murder case, fall under the category of prisoners, who have to wear a jail uniform.Mukerjea’s lawyer Gunjan Mangla opposed this and argued that there is no specified rule as to what uniform should be worn. “Indrani suffers from mental health issues since her arrest. If she is asked to wear the prison uniform, it would affect her further. Besides, the undertrial prisoners are allowed to wear their regular clothes,” Mangla argued.It was also pointed out that why after almost five years prison authority is insisting her to wear the prison uniform.On December 22, Mangla had approached the special CBI court with a plea that Mukerjea be permitted to wear regular clothes. Mangala pointed out that she was an under-trial prisoner and not a convict.Sheena Bora, 24, was allegedly strangled in a car by Indrani Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and her former husband Sanjeev Khanna, on April 2012. Her body was later burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-court-reserves-its-order-on-indrani-s-plea-to-not-wear-prison-uniform/story-ycYwBA7qgTcovh7rsYZhEL.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body polls: Snack in Sena’s tagline to woo city Gujaratis||With an eye on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections in February 2022, the ruling Shiv Sena now plans to woo Gujarati voters, who have the potential to impact a sizable number of seats in Mumbai, with a tagline involving their traditional snack – ‘Mumbai ma jalebi fafda, Uddhav Thackeray aapda’. The BMC election will be a major battle between the two former allies – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena – after the shift in the political dynamic in November 2019. Traditionally, Gujaratis and Marwaris are BJP voters. As a part of the campaign, Hemraj Shah, an organiser of the Shiv Sena, has arranged for a gathering of people from the community on January 10. The party’s campaign leaflet said the BMC election was “prestigious” for the Sena. It added that the elections in February 2022 will be held in a totally different environment because the power has been “wrestled away from the narrow-minded BJP leaders by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray” and the “BJP has become sick”. Shah said that the idea behind the gathering is to create awareness of the work done by the party and the CM for the community. He said that senior party leaders will not be present at the gathering. However, the party chief and other leaders may address the community at a later stage of campaigning, he said. The Shiv Sena has not had a great connect with the Gujarati community over the past few decades. The party targeted the community on several occasions and issues. In the past few years, under Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena shed its Mumbai-centric image to be seen as a Hindutva party. The Sena has been insisting that the trading community was protected by its cadre during the 1991-92 Mumbai riots. “The younger generation of Mumbai does not know what the party has done for the community. Among other things, I plan to tell them how Balasaheb [Thackeray] stood with the community during the Mumbai riots,” said Shah, adding that the party reaches out to all communities. Shah said that owing to the restrictions for Covid-19, only 100 people who arrive first at the hall in suburban Mumbai will be allowed to attend. He added that he will also speak to the community members about the work done by Thackeray to bring Covid-19 under control in Mumbai. Although a few Gujaratis have been elected as councillors on Sena tickets, the Sena does not have a strong leader from the community. Ahead of the 2017 BMC elections, there was an influx of leaders from the community, who were given tickets to contest. Several of the Gujarati faces were defeated by BJP candidates. Subsequently, the Sena saw many Gujarati leaders leave the party as they felt they did not get enough representation in the party. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said the move is a “humble” attempt to woo the community. “There has been soft animosity between the Shiv Sena and Gujarati community. With the rise of [Narendra] Modi, the community became politically assertive. Now, the BMC election is crucial for the Sena as it is going against the BJP,” he said. BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar, who is the party’s in-charge of the BMC polls, said the Sena only remembers Gujaratis during an election. “Let the Shiv Sena woo them, but the Gujarati community has decided to overthrow the Janaab Sena (referring to an Urdu calendar published by Sena’s youth wing where Bal Thackeray was referred as Janaab )”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-polls-snack-in-sena-s-tagline-to-woo-city-gujaratis/story-u2IZZKN59BCky7R6448wiL.html

According to traffic police officers, they received a complaint from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office to conduct a probe after Ratan Tata approached the CM’s office informing of two e-challans for traffic violations which the business tycoon had not committed. The traffic department then went through pending e-challans and found that Gitanjalli Samirr Shah, a director of a customs house agent and freight forwarding company, Narendra Forwarders Private Limited, had created duplicate number plates of Tata’s car. “There were three e-challans registered against the number which were being used by the accused,” said Yashasvi Yadav, joint commissioner of police. The traffic police then approached Matunga police. On questioning the accused, the police discovered that Shah had replaced just two numbers on her number plate to match Tata’s number plate as it was her ‘lucky’ number. Matunga police have registered a first information report (FIR) and are in the process of arresting the accused. Yadav has awarded ₹5,000 to constables Aziz Shaikh and Sandeep Phanse for investigating the case and finding out the details of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-businesswoman-gets-fake-car-number-plate-similar-to-ratan-tata-s-booked/story-z7192N1aLPwXsUm9mrnhuI.html

06-01-2021||Mumbai||163% increase in seat vacancy in Maharashtra deemed dental institutes under management and NRI quotas||Deemed dental institutes in the state have witnessed a 163% increase in seat vacancy under the management and NRI (non-resident Indian) quotas compared to last year. This can be attributed to the on-going pandemic that delayed admissions to most professional courses and the fear among students to travel far for colleges this year.According to information shared by the Directorate General of Health Sciences (DGHS) recently, close to 318 seats are vacant under the management and NRI quotas this year after three common admission and two mop-up rounds. Last year, this figure in deemed dental institutes stood at 122. Similarly, around 290 seats had gone vacant under the management and NRI quotas of medical institutes last year as compared to 318 this year. Many have blamed this increase in seat vacancies on the financial strain on families due to Covid-19 and the lockdown in 2020. “Deemed as well as private medical and dental institutes charge as much as three to five times the regular fees for seats under the management and NRI quotas, which many students might not be able to afford this year. This could be one of the biggest reasons for the seats under these two quotas to go unclaimed this year,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER). The list of vacant seats was released after the Central government extended the admissions deadline from December 30, 2020, to January 15 this year, for the 2020-21 academic year. These vacant seats will now be allotted under the stray vacant seats round, which will be conducted this week. DGHS conducts counselling for 15% of all India quota (AIQ) seats, all deemed institute seats, as well as admissions to central universities. The stray vacancy round is conducted at the institute level, for which the list of eligible candidates is forwarded by the Medical Counseling Committee (MCC) to the respective institutes. “While finance is one major reason for many students not opting for management or NRI quota seats, another reason also could be more students choosing to take a drop-year to apply for the national entrance exam again next year and better their score, with hopes of bagging a seat in a government medical or dental institute,” said Archana Purohit, parent of an MBBS aspirant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/163-increase-in-seat-vacancy-in-maharashtra-deemed-dental-institutes-under-management-and-nri-quotas/story-BCXctRXcxMUmMimqPF4hCP.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||BMC to start a separate jumbo Covid centre for those returning from UK to Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is setting up a separate a 50-bed Covid-19 centre where travellers from the United Kingdom will be quarantined for seven days. This decision comes after several returning travellers said they could not afford the cost of the mandatory institutional quarantine. Last month, a new strain of Covid-19 was discovered in UK, following which the state set up new guidelines for all travellers from the country. The amended standard operating procedure (SOP) requires all returnees from UK to be in institutional quarantine for seven days after their arrival. On the seventh day, they would undergo a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at their own cost to know their Covid status. On an average, institutional quarantine for seven days would cost a traveller approximately ₹50,000 and according to BMC, some passengers have provided false information to avoid being quarantined. “Many returnees are daily wage earners who cannot afford to bear the cost of institutional quarantine for seven days. So we are starting this facility with 50 beds, which will be provided to those who demand free accommodation. Once their test reports come negative for the virus, they will be discharged,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Following a negative RT-PCR test report, travellers must be in home quarantine for 14 days. Those who test positive will be sent to Seven Hills Hospital and the civic body will send their swabs to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for genome sequencing, to find out if they are carrying the new strain of the virus. “We are making all possible arrangements to ensure citizens act responsibly and don’t violate quarantine rules,” said Kakani. Health activists have questioned whether a separate centre is necessary as more than 75% of beds in existing Covid care centres (CCC) are lying vacant at present. “BMC should help decrease the rate of institutional quarantine since all passengers cannot afford to pay ₹40,000-₹50,000 from their pockets. Secondly, BMC should first utilise the existing vacant CCC facilities,” said activist Dr Ravikant Singh. So far, eight people in Maharashtra have tested positive for the new strain of Covid-19, of which five are in Mumbai and one each in Thane, Pune and Mira-Bhayander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-start-a-separate-jumbo-covid-centre-for-those-returning-from-uk-to-mumbai/story-DLLCo5T9n8UXheEeJzz7AM.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||60,000 cops registered so far to get Covid-19 vaccine shots||Delhi Police on Tuesday said they had completed the registration and updating the personal details of nearly 60,000 personnel of the force so far, with the process for the remaining 20,000 staff likely to be completed in a day or two.The registration and details update drive by the city police for their personnel, who are among the list of front line workers, was started last week following Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that the Delhi government had identified 5.1 million people who will be the first to get the Covid-19 vaccine shots under the Central government’s “priority category”. On December 28, special commissioner of police (operations) Muktesh Chander, who is the Covid-19 nodal officer for Delhi Police, had issued a notice along with the declaration form, asking all police personnel to update their age, mobile numbers and place of posting, apart from details of one or more comorbidities that they may be suffering from.“The updated data of 70-75 % personnel from various departments has been received so far. We are expecting to complete the entire process by Wednesday. The data is now being uploaded on intraDP, the internal network of the Delhi Police,” said special CP Chander, adding that the compiled list will further be uploaded on the government’s Covid-19 vaccination portal.About the process of vaccination, the special CP said that the personnel would receive SMS on their registered mobile numbers, asking them to be present at the vaccination centre nearest to their place of posting on the day they are called on.At least 32 Delhi Police personnel have lost their lives due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since May last year, while 7,612 personnel in total so far have been infected, show statistics shared by the police department on January 1.A senior police officer, associated with the drive, said that the registration and update drive was scheduled to be completed by January 3 (Sunday), since the police department already maintains a record of the details of all their staff including their age, mobile numbers and their current place of postings.“However, the process got delayed because many personnel had changed their mobile numbers and had not got them updated on the main record book maintained by the establishment branch. Such personnel were directed to get their new contact numbers updated immediately,” the officer said.Officials said that although all police personnel are expected to receive the Covid-19 vaccines, the priority would be given to those above the age of 50 or personnel suffering from one or more comorbid conditions.“Since the personnel have also been given a declaration form, asking them to mention the comorbidities they are suffering from, the exercise would also help us maintain a database of the health issues of all police staff and decide their nature of job and place of postings accordingly,” said another police officer.Police step up security arrangements at vaccine centresAnticipating that people, who are not being included in the first phase of vaccination, may turn up at centres and insist on getting the Covid-19 shots, adequate security arrangements is being put in place. Between 5 and 10 personnel will be deployed at each vaccination centre, depending upon how big the centre is and the number of people arriving there for vaccination, senior officials said.The city police have already started deploying personnel at the 600 plus vaccines storage centres, where arrangements for storage by the Delhi government is on in full swing. The delivery of the vaccines is yet to commence.There are 41 such centres in areas falling under the territorial jurisdiction of south district police, while west police district have 85 such centres. Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi’s Tahirpur is the only centre in Shahdara police district.“As of now two-three personnel remain deployed round-the-clock at each storage centre. The number may be increased once the storage of the vaccines starts. The security arrangements at the vaccination centre would start when the vaccination drive is started,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Apart from security personnel from Delhi Police and paramilitary forces, the surveillance of vaccine storage and vaccination centres would also be done through CCTV cameras, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-000-cops-registered-so-far-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-shots/story-Y3OX6TkV6Ag0OPSp3izBhP.html

However, the waiver amount was deposited in the court’s treasury after it was challenged before the Bombay high court (HC) in 1996.The state revenue department has prepared a proposal for a decision on the waiver. It is of the opinion that the state has discretionary powers under section 6(3) of the Maharashtra Entertainment Duty Act, 1923, to grant the waiver. It has now left it to the state cabinet to decide whether to uphold the Sena-BJP government’s decision or make the changes. It has also taken an opinion from the law and judiciary department before moving the proposal to the state cabinet, said a senior official from the state revenue department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cabinet-may-discuss-waiver-of-3-40-crore-to-organisers-of-micheal-jackson-concert/story-yqTmnAfYt9i4na227SeXMI.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||Municipal employees to go on indefinite strike from January 7 to demand pending wages||Employees of the three municipalities of Delhi have decided to go on an indefinite strike from January 7 against non-payment of their salaries and pensions. The decision was taken after a meeting with senior civic officials failed on Tuesday break the deadlock on pending payments. According to office bearers of Confederation of MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of employees’ unions — thousands of employees from the various department in the three civic body will observe “indefinite pen-down strike” from 10 am January 7. The employees union said the strike will include teachers, engineers, the staff of horticulture department, clerical staff, Domestic Breeding Checkers (DBC) workers, and class-4 employees such as beldars and labourers.Representatives of the confederation said that employees in various departments of the north civic body have not been paid salaries for the last 4-5 months, while in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) salaries are pending for the last three months.AP Khan, convener of the Confederation of MCD Employees Union, said that it was time that authorities realised that their employees are working without money for 4-5 months and are unable to look after their families. The pendency of pensions in the north corporation is beyond six months, he sid. “After many reminders about the payment of dues, we were called for a meeting with the additional commissioner in the north civic body. The meeting was not fruitful. So we decided to go ahead with our plan to go on an indefinite strike from January 7. We want our pending salaries and pensions to be cleared as soon as possible,” he said.Khan added that civic workers had withdrawn their strike twice in the past after they were given assurances for payment of pending salaries, dues and pensions by November-end. But nothing was done in this regard.Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of the Confederation of MCD Employees Union said that salaries of teachers and engineers are pending for the months August, September, October, November and December. He said that employees of all other departments were suffering similarly.“It has been five months since teachers were paid in the north corporation. The east corporation teachers have not been paid for the last three months. We can’t keep working without salaries and are compelled to go on a strike,” he said.Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that salaries are being released as and when funds are available with the civic body. “We are going through a financial crisis and still salaries of sanitation workers have been cleared till the month of September, DBC employees till October, doctors and nurses till September. Efforts are being made to clear maximum dues in a phased manner,” he said.Nirmal Jain, mayor EDMC, said, “Efforts are being made to clear pending salaries. I understand their pain but they should also cooperate with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/municipal-employees-to-go-on-indefinite-strike-from-january-7-to-demand-pending-wages/story-OaWDnZDyXFOHoQFUk8XpfO.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||Panel on Yamuna asks for a report of ammonia sources in the river by January 10||The National Green Tribunal-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to identify pollution sources leading to high levels of ammonia in the Yamuna river and submit a report by January 10. The directions were issued, after Delhi Jal Board (DJB) alleged that Haryana had not stopped discharging industrial pollutants in the river despite repeated reminders. In a letter written by the DJB last week, the department had urged the CPCB to take immediate remedial measures to control the pollution being released into the river. “It has also been reported that the reason primarily is the industrial effluent/untreated domestic sewage entering river Yamuna through drains number 6 and 8 and through the Rohtak regulator,” the panel, comprising former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra and retired NGT expert member B S Sajwan, said. It added, “Considering the recurring nature of the problem, it is incumbent upon the CPCB and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to put in place a robust surveillance system, particularly during the critical winter months, for monitoring the activities of the industries and the functioning of STPs and also take coercive action against defaulting units.” The panel asked the CPCB to associate with Haryana pollution board and depute a team to identify point sources of pollution leading to high levels of ammoniacal nitrogen in the Yamuna and submit a report by January 10. The Yamuna monitoring panel has also taken up the matter with the chief secretary of Haryana, requesting him to direct authorities to take immediate action to prevent the flow of untreated sewage and industrial effluent from Haryana into river Yamuna. The DJB said that the high levels of ammonia in the Yamuna had forced them to reduce or stop water production at its plants at least five times this year, which had affected water supply in several parts of the city. According to officials, the DJB’s water treatment plants can treat up to 0.9 parts per million ammonia concentration in the river water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/panel-on-yamuna-asks-for-a-report-of-ammonia-sources-in-the-river-by-january-10/story-g3K6SIrKoqy9HtVZi2SsTI.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra on alert but no need panic: Government on bird flu threat||Following reports of bird flu (avian influenza) cases in many states, the Maharashtra government has put the administration on high alert. However, officials assured that there is no need to panic as there is no imminent threat before the state. The government has issued an alert to all local officers from the animal husbandry department to report any unusual death of birds if found, and send samples to the Western Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (WRDDL) that has already conducted over 5,000 tests on birds in the last nine months, and found no strain of avian influenza. The National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing the disease, has also not issued any warning as of now, state officials clarified.The state government has also issued an advisory to those in the poultry business and consumers of non-vegetarian food not to panic unnecessarily.Several states such as Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh reported bird flu cases, which lead to panic and culling of ducks, hens and other domestic birds within a 1-km radius of the affected areas at a few places.Anoop Kumar, principal secretary, animal husbandry department, said that the situation in Maharashtra is different. “Going by the annual surveillance plan, we conduct tests of birds and livestock on a regular basis at WRDDL. In the last nine months (between April and December 2020), 1,715 samples of excreta, 1,913 blood samples and 1,549 oral swabs of birds were collected for RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) -based tests, and none of them were positive for avian influenza so far,” Kumar said.The principal secretary said that NIHSAD, the authority to declare a national-level epidemic, has not issued any warning. “There is no red alert issued by the Centre; also, there is no report of migratory birds dying of bird flu in the state. Hence, there is no need to panic. We may have been in trouble if Himachal Pradesh was our neighbouring state,” Kumar added.Dead migratory birds at Pong Dam lake in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh were found be infected with H5N1 (bird flu) by NIHSAD, while deaths of crows in Jhalawar and Jodhpur in Rajasthan, and Indore in Madhya Pradesh, were due to the H5N8 strain (a subtype of the influenza A virus), which can cause mortality in poultry birds, but chances of their transmission to humans are very low, said officials from the animal husbandry department.An advisory issued by the state animal husbandry department states, “We have yet not found any death of birds owing to bird flu. Hence, those in the poultry business and people who prefer to eat non-vegetarian food have no need to worry unnecessarily. They are suggested to report if found, any unusual deaths of wild animals, domestic hens and poultry birds.”Dr VV Limaye, joint commissioner (disease investigation), animal husbandry department, said, “We have issued an advisory to all the district deputy commissioners and district animal husbandry officers to report to the state government if they find any unusual deaths of birds or poultry in their jurisdiction. They have also been directed to send samples to WRDDL for testing to ascertain the actual cause of death.”“The bird flu virus doesn’t transmit to the human body directly. The virus can cause mortality only in poultry birds. However, it may transmit to human beings in case of a mutation. Even mutation is of two types, and we called them ‘antigenic drift and antigenic shift’. In the case of antigenic drift, there are no chances of the virus infecting human beings because of a slight modification. However, in the case of antigenic shift, major changes in DNA or RNA take place and the virus can acquire the capability to infect human beings. In the last 15 years, there have hardly been any instances where the virus has been transmitted to human beings from poultry birds,” Dr Limaye explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-on-alert-but-no-need-panic-government-on-bird-flu-threat/story-N2UxaDDtOzguqW0r4DLFeJ.html
06-01-2021||City||Farmers make their protest waterproof at Singhu border||New Delhi: Farmers at Singhu border launched a massive exercise on Tuesday to cover all the tents with waterproof plastic sheets following rains in the city. Large bamboo sticks and iron pipes were brought to the border with hundreds of waterproof tarpaulin sheets to cover the tents. Farmers said a mega tent is also being set up at the centre stage from where the leaders address the protesters every day.As light rains were witnessed in parts of the national capital on Monday and Tuesday, many tents at Singhu border where farmers have been staying since November 26 last year collapsed, while some started leaking. Many of these tents had to be dismantled and re-erected.On Tuesday, labourers were climbing atop the tents tying huge tarpaulin sheets around them by erecting bamboo sticks and iron pipes around them to make the tents withstand strong winds and shower. The labourers had been brought in by the gurudwara committees from various parts of Delhi. The tarpaulin sheets, commonly known as tirpaal, were either donated by people or bought by these committees.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), said all material required for waterproofing tents were brought at the border on Monday, as soon as the weather changed.“The tents have been covered with plastic sheets. These provide insulation as well as water slides down without entering the tents. Separate waterproof tents have also been set up for women. In the evening, we also brought in more mattresses and blankets as it is getting colder,” Sirsa said.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union, Ludhiana, said they also announced from the central stage on Tuesday that anyone who needs a tarpaulin can get it. “We have asked for more waterproofing material. It is also expected that the weather will improve by Wednesday afternoon,” he said.On the farmers’ next move, Lakhowal said on January 7, they will conduct a rehearsal rally in which tractors will move from Singhu to Tikri and from Tikri to Singhu, on the Haryana side and similarly between Ghazipur border and Palwal. “This is just a rehearsal for our massive rally planned for Republic Day when hundreds of tractors will participate in a national rally,” Lakhowal said.As it rained again on Tuesday, buckets, tubs or utensils had been placed in most tents which had started leaking. The rainwater was later used for washing utensils and for laundry.Sardar Singh, 53, a farmer from Ropar, said the roof of their tent had loosened as rain water got accumulated over it. “Before it fell, we had to remove it and now the cloth is being replaced with plastic sheet. We reassembled our tent where as many as 100 people sleep every night. The tarpaulin will not only stop rain but will also keep us warm. They are also fire-resistant,” he said.Those sleeping in tractor trolleys also covered both ends of the trolley with plastic sheets. They said it worked best to stop strong winds from blowing away the bedsheets that they had been using so far to cover the trolleys in order to keep themselves warm during the nights.Farmers had also used the plastic sheets to cover piles of wood that they to cook meals at langars. “Our woods are all wet. We had ration covered in time but the woods lie in the open and they are wet now. Tarpaulin are being used to cover the ration and places of langars are also being converted into covered set ups so that whether it is rain or cold wave, our langars do not stop,” said another farmer, Satnam Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-make-their-protest-waterproof-at-singhu-border/story-6Aq5901cJ4NNyCFZZO1fwI.html
06-01-2021||City||Right-wing groups protest, demand reconstruction of Chandni Chowk temple||New Delhi: Hundreds of workers of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal and other right-wing organisations took out a march in Chandni Chowk on Tuesday to protest the demolition of a Hanuman temple by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation on the orders of the Delhi high court. VHP leaders said the protest will continue till the Adami Party government in Delhi allocates land for reconstruction of the temple near the existing site.On Tuesday morning, hundreds of members of right-wing organisations, Delhi BJP and locals shouted slogans demanding reconstruction of the temple. The protest was planned on Tuesday as it is considered the day of Lord Hanuman, said a VHP member. The temple was demolished at 4am on Sunday. It was located on the road which is being redesigned only for pedestrians as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan. The structure was declared illegal by the high court and the order for its removal was passed in 2015. The protesters were restricted near the Sis Ganj Gurdwara and nearly 30 members of VHP and Bajrang Dal were detained by the police. All detainees were later released.No first information report (FIR) was registered in connection with the gathering of nearly 500 protesters even though it was in violation of the Covid-19 guidelines. The protest began around 11 am and continued for over two hours, the police said. Nearly 300 security personnel were deployed to maintain law and order in the area. The police personnel also recorded video of the entire event.Surender Gupta, state vice-president of VHP, said, “The temple could have been saved had the Delhi government planned the redevelopment project carefully. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation (which removed the temple) is just an executing agency. We want the government to allocate land on the central verge so that we can construct the temple. We don’t need any assistance from the government to construct the temple.”The AAP has maintained that it was the North MCD which had admitted before the court that the structure was encroachment and undertaken to remove it. VHP and Delhi BJP leaders said that they will meet Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to request him to intervene and allow the construction of the Hanuman temple.A four-layer security cordon was put in place to stop the protesters from marching to the demolished temple site. The gathering of the members of the right-wing with saffron flags began around 10.30 am near the Red Fort-Chandni Chowk crossing. As their number swelled up and they began marching towards the temple site raising slogans, the security personnel stopped them at the first barricade placed near the Gauri Shankar temple. However, the protesters managed to break the barricade and proceeded towards the site where the temple existed.“We used mild force to contain them at the second barricade near the Sis Ganj Gurdwara, where they continued their agitation and delivered speeches. No The crowd dispersed after 1pm. We are considering legal action in connection with Tuesday’s protest,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named. Unlike Monday, the business in the heritage market was not affected as the police had made adequate arrangements. Pradeep Gupta, president of Chemical Market traders’ association, said, “Today, all shops were open and it was business as usual. The protesters were restricted towards the Red Fort side. But people want the temple to be constructed nearby, as it is a matter of faith.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/right-wing-groups-protest-demand-reconstruction-of-chandni-chowk-temple/story-wVFSYxcL11kLXtnf9m6eYM.html

On Tuesday, the city added 442 new cases of Covid-19 to its tally, taking the total to over 627,000 cases so far. Another 12 deaths reported in the daily health bulletin took the toll to 10,609.

The positivity rate in the city has remained below 1% for nine days now indicating that the spread of the infection is in control. This comes even as the city has reported 13 cases of infections with the new UK variant, eight of whom are Delhi residents. The new variant has at least 23 mutations, one of which is in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that is used by the virus to enter the human cells. Experts believe that the new variant is 70% more transmissible that the ones currently in circulation, sparking fears of a surge again.

06-01-2021||Delhi||13 people in Delhi have mutant variant of Covid-19, eight are city residents||A total of 13 people in Delhi so far have been detected with the new UK variant of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Of the 13, eight are Delhi residents, even as all of them are currently getting treated at the Lok Nayak Hospital, senior government officials said on Tuesday. The tally in Delhi increased, after 20 more people from across the country tested positive for the new strain of the virus on Tuesday, taking the total number of UK returnees having tested positive for the mutant virus in the country to 58.Until December 30, eight UK returnees with the new mutant strain were being treated in Delhi of which four were residents of the national Capital. “As on Tuesday, a total of 13 people have been detected with the new UK strain of which eight are Delhi residents. The numbers may incrementally increasing as more results of genome sequencing arrive. Contacts of these eight people are being traced. They are being isolated at the institutional quarantine facility at Terapanth Bhawan in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur area. Some of them have also opted for the paid facility set up in Aloft hotel, Aerocity,” said a senior government official, on condition of anonymity.A senior official of Lok Nayak Hospital, where a separate isolation ward has been created for those detected with the new strain, said, except one, all Covid-19 patients caused by the mutated strain are stable.The new variant – which has 23 mutations, including one on the receptor binding protein on the spike used by the virus to enter the human cells – is thought to be 70% more transmissible, raising concerns of super-spreading events.However, doctors monitoring these patients have not found severe illnesses because of the new variant.From November 25 to December 23, 2020, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from the UK.All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to detect Covid-19.The Indian government had suspended flights from the United Kingdom from December 23 onwards after a new variant of Sars-CoV-2 was found to be circulating in London and other parts of that country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/13-people-in-delhi-have-mutant-variant-of-covid-19-eight-are-city-residents/story-CCPW4R1GVd7gQkOFGuovWO.html
06-01-2021||City||Sisodia invites U’khand minister for debate on governance model||New Delhi: A day after deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited Dehradun for a debate with Uttarakhand urban development minister Madan Kaushik, the senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader on Tuesday wrote another letter to Kaushik, inviting him to visit Delhi on January 6 and debate the “Kejriwal model” of governance.“You had told the media on December 20, 2020, that I could come to Uttarakhand whenever I wanted and you would easily list 100 works. But when I came, you were missing. When your government did not do even one thing for the public in the past four years, what would you debate on?” Sisodia wrote in his letter on Tuesday, adding that he understood Kaushik’s “helplessness”. “I will be waiting at 11am on January 6, to have an open debate with you on the Kejriwal model of governance,” he wrote, adding that he would take Kaushik to schools and mohalla clinics. In his letter, Sisodia also alleged that Uttarakhand BJP had engaged in corruption in the state in the past four years as pointed out by BJP MLA Puran Singh Fartyal and mentioned corruption case against the OSD of Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat.In his letter, Sisodia said those who fought for a separate state of Uttarakhand 20 years ago now feel cheated by BJP and Congress governments. “Those who dreamt of good education, schools, hospitals, electricity, water, and employment for their children in Uttarakhand are now looking with hope at the Kejriwal model in Delhi,” he wrote.Responding to Sisodia’s challenge, Kaushik said, “AAP’s Sisodia had come to Uttarakhand for tourism. He did his tourism politics and returned. As far as his January 6 invitation is concerned, we are not answerable to AAP but the people of Uttarakhand. We will show our development work to them, not AAP.”Meanwhile, the Delhi units of BJP, and the Congress slammed the AAP government for their “poor performance” in the education sector and accused the party of indulging in “political tourism”.In a statement issued on Tuesday, Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said, “Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia has been touring other states to fulfil expansion plans of AAP, and is challenging their CM and ministers for debate on the so-called education model of Delhi. But he is not challenging the main opposition party of Delhi, i.e. BJP because he knows that we will expose the faults in the education model of Delhi government.”The Delhi Congress alleged a drop in the number of enrolments in government schools. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Kumar alleged that the major reason behind the drop was “discrepancies” in the mid-day meal scheme under the AAP government. The AAP did not respond to the allegations by the Delhi BJP and Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-invites-u-khand-minister-for-debate-on-governance-model/story-iypvOB4ZGnDkQZ42GsWTEJ.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||Court quashes plea by CBI to examine foreign national against Jagdish Tytler||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a plea seeking permission to examine a foreign national as a witness in a case involving Congress leader Jagdish Tytler and arms dealer Abhishek Verma for allegedly writing a forged letter addressed to then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009.The agency has challenged a trial court’s October 23, 2020 order by which its plea to examine C Edmond Allen was dismissed.Opposing the plea, Verma’s counsel Maninder Singh told Justice Yogesh Khanna that the CBI had tried to summon this witness earlier and he was summoned on four occasions but he did not appear before the trial court after which the prosecution evidence was closed.He said that the apex court had fixed one year for completing the trial in the case and that has expired and allowing examination of the witness would start the trial de novo.To this, CBI counsel Anil Grover sought time from the high court to seek instructions, if they need to apply for extension of timeline for trial.The agency submitted that Allen could not be called earlier for examination since he had put in various conditions for coming to India, including business class flight ticket, but now he has agreed to depose as a witness through video conferencing.CBI wants to examine Allen to prove certain e-mail IDs, allegedly used by the accused to send the purported forged letter.However, the application was dismissed by the trial court noting that despite an order of November 26, 2018 of closure of evidence of this witness, no effort was made by CBI to challenge it and if he was really important, the CBI ought to have examined the witness by challenging the earlier order.The trial court had on December 9, 2015 put Tytler and Verma on trial after framing charges for alleged offences punishable under various sections of IPC, including 420 (cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using as genuine any forged document or electronic record) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).The charge sheet was filed by CBI on a complaint of then Minister of State for Home Ajay Maken, alleging a forged letter on his letterhead was addressed to Manmohan Singh seeking easing of business visa norms in 2009.Verma and Tytler were named in the charge sheet for the offence of attempting to cheat under IPC and a provision of Prevention of Corruption Act. Tytler was granted bail by the court after he had appeared before it in pursuance to summons. Verma, who was lodged in Tihar Jail, was later granted bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-quashes-plea-by-cbi-to-examine-foreign-national-against-jagdish-tytler/story-UpGKGYykQEay9YpmAY5HrO.html
06-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai sees light rain, air quality remains poor: IMD||Light spells of rain were reported overnight across the city and its neighbouring areas on Monday and early Tuesday. Cloudy skies continued to reduce visibility owing to a cyclonic circulation spreading from Punjab to the Arabian Sea.Parts of Mulund, Vikhroli and Thane experienced drizzles on Tuesday morning. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that south Konkan, south-central Maharashtra and some areas of Marathwada are likely to experience thunderstorms and light rainfall for the next four to five days. Mumbai is expected to see cloudy skies, but no significant rainfall is predicted over this period. “An active western disturbance lies as a middle and upper-level cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan and neighbouring areas, with its induced cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan and its neighbourhood at lower levels. A north-south zone of wind confluence continues to exist from north Punjab to the northeast Arabian Sea, with strong interaction between south-westerly winds in association with the above western disturbance and lower-level moist southeasterlies,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general of western region, IMD. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded a minimum temperature of 20.5 degrees Celsius, 3.4 degrees above normal. Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 21.5 degree Celsius, 2.2 degrees above normal. The maximum temperature at Santacruz was 29.5 degree Celsius, 1.5 degrees below normal, while Colaba recorded a maximum temperature of 27.7 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees below normal. Air quality continued to remain poor on Tuesday, with a marginal improvement. The overall air quality index (AQI) — a pollutant measuring indicator— of 242 (poor) was recorded. AQI is calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor, and above 400 as severe. Of the 10 stations at which the air quality was measured, both Mazgaon and Navi Mumbai breathed the worst air with AQI of 309 (very poor). “AQI of Mumbai for Monday was poor because of low dispersion. The air quality will remain poor for the next two days because of local emissions,” said a spokesperson from SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-light-rain-air-quality-remains-poor-imd/story-TxmASKIks6THOFeCjYgwIM.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Police to allow access to charge sheet on jail computers||The Delhi police on Tuesday agreed to allow 15 people, accused of conspiracy leading to communal riots in Delhi, access to soft copies of the charge sheet on jail computers. The accused had contended before a court that it was difficult for them to discuss the 17,000-page document during the half-hour legal interview with their lawyers.Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that they have no problem if the charge sheet was uploaded on the computer inside the jail complexes and all the accused in the case have access to it.The submissions were made when the counsel of former JNU student leader Umar Khalid told the court he has moved an application seeking permission that Khalid be permitted to access the soft copy of the charge sheet in jail.Khalid, through his counsel, said that it was difficult to discuss the legal strategy and the charge sheet, running into more than 17,000 pages, during the legal interview as it was only for half an hour.The counsel urged the court that his client may be permitted to access soft copy of the charge sheet in jail, adding either a computer is brought to jail number 2 or he is taken to the computer centre inside the jail premises. “We have half an hour interview. We cannot discuss the charge sheet or our legal strategy during that time. It is running into thousands of pages,” the counsel said, adding it was hindering Khalid’s right to a fair trial.Co-accused JNU student Sharjeel Imam also said that the order be extended for all the accused as everyone was in the same boat.“I have been trying to get access to the charge sheet. Same order be passed for all the accused in the case as we are all in the same boat. I have spent two months in prison speculating news reports,” said ImamAdvocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, appearing for accused Asif Iqbal Tanha, said she had moved an application before the Tihar jail authorities on November 18, seeking access to a computer for Tanha but has not got any response till date.SPP Prasad said similar orders would be passed for all jails in lines with Khalid’s application.“So far as Khalid’s application is concerned, similar order be passed for all the jails. I completely agree to that. I agree to it that the charge sheet be uploaded to a computer all can access it,” Prasad said.The judge concluded, “The accused needs to read what is in the charge sheet”, and put the matter for further hearing on January 19.Meanwhile, advocate Arjun Dewan, appearing for another accused Athar Khan, claimed that he was suffering from serious medical condition and was not provided proper treatment in jail. Khan’s counsel further alleged that inmates passed communally coloured remarks against him and were causing trouble for him.Khan also directly addressed the court and claimed that he was not being given the high-fibre diet in jail which the doctor had prescribed for him.He further said he was quarantined for 14 days every time he was taken out for treatment and during the entire period he was not even allowed to go out of the cell and not allowed to meet even his lawyer.The accused, including former councillor Ishrat Jahan, Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, have been charged with the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), for their alleged role in the conspiracy to orchestrate the north east Delhi riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-police-to-allow-access-to-charge-sheet-on-jail-computers/story-uaOp4u85T8lOJsK6XzQcCP.html
06-01-2021||Delhi||NDMC to give Rs 200 per month to students for internet data package||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has decided to provide a financial assistance of Rs 200 to each student of class 10 and class 12 of its schools towards Internet data package cost for attending online teaching and learning activities. This facility will continue till schools are closed.According to NDMC officials, a proposal in this connection was passed in a meeting of the council last week. Officials of the civic body said that online classes are still being conducted and there is no clarity when schools will be opened so this proposal has been approved to provide financial help to students to continue with their online classes.A senior official of the NDMC said that students studying in NDMC and Navyug Schools are generally from poor backgrounds and they do not have adequate resources to afford internet data pack required for online classes. “This data pack subsidy will motivate students of class 10 and class 12 to attend more and more online classes which will minimise the academic loss and improve their performance in board exams in 2021. Therefore, it is proposed that the scheme of payment of an amount of Rs 200 per month to students of class 10 and class 12 of NDMC schools for data package through direct benefit transfer (DBT) for online teaching learning activities may be implemented till the schools are closed,” the proposal passed by the municipality said.Online classes in the NDMC were started on April 3 last year after schools were shut due to coronavirus pandemic lockdown.A senior official of the NDMC said that there are around 3295 students enrolled in class 10 and class 12 out of which 2748 students attend online classes. “As many as 1264 students are attending online classes in class 10 while 1484 students in class 12. This amount will be given monthly to students in their accounts. Total financial estimate of the scheme for both the classes will be Rs 6.02 lakh per month,” the official said.Prior to this, the NDMC had in December distributed tablets pre-loaded with study materials to 811 students of class 10 and class 12. These tablets were distributed among students free of cost to promote e-learning especially during the pandemic.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ndmc-to-give-rs-200-per-month-to-students-for-internet-data-package/story-aqxK5XL1RwRE9SUt8Kgc2O.html

Monu had apprehensions that the brother-in-law may leave his sister for the other woman, said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya.On January 2, the DCP said, the Seelampur police received information that a person with head injuries was admitted to a government hospital, where he was declared brought dead. The person, Rajesh, was found unconscious in his jeans manufacturing factory in Seelampur by some locals. A murder case was registered and the investigation was taken up.During the probe, the DCP said, investigators scanned the CCTV cameras installed around the factory and found the movements of one employee of the dead man suspicious. The employee, Ankit Rajput,23, was taken into custody and interrogation.“Rajput confessed to killing his employer (Rajesh) by hitting his head with a cooking gas cylinder. He disclosed that he committed the murder on the behest of Rajesh’s brother-in-law Monu. We arrested Monu as well. The cylinder used in the crime was also seized,” added DCP Surya.Interrogation of the arrested men revealed that on January 1, they celebrated the New Year with Rajesh and consumed alcohol together. After the party, Rajesh remained at the factory while others left. A few minutes later, Rajput returned and attacked Rajesh’s head with the gas cylinder, said an investigator who did not want to be named.“Monu planned the murder because he was annoyed with Rajesh because of his affair with another woman. He told Rajput about his apprehensions that Rajesh may desert his sister just to marry the other woman. After gaining Rajput’s sympathy, Monu convinced him to kill his brother-in-law,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/24-year-old-man-aide-nabbed-for-murder-inside-jeans-factory-in-seelampur/story-CoKegGS28vunWPdDfJ140J.html
06-01-2021||Lifestyle||Rights to admission reserved at restaurants: Colonial hangover or a vibe thing?||Sunday evening, filmmaker Faraz Arif Ansari and their friends went to a restaurant in Benares, where they were refused entry. In a social media post, Ansari alleged that it was because of their attire. Dressed in a traditional kurta with churidar and Kolhapuri chappals, Ansari visited the restaurant for brunch at about 5.30pm. This is what they say ensued: “When we arrived, we were asked not to enter the restaurant because most of us were in Indian attire and Indian footwear. We were made to wait outside for 20 minutes, and then asked to leave. The manager was deeply prejudiced, snobbish and utterly rude to all of us. He didn’t even address us and just walked away after listening to us, telling his staff to put up a board mentioning about footwear. They only have a board for masks and weapons.” Ansari alleges that the restaurant management’s behaviour was out of line. “The manager refused to even acknowledge us or look at us while we were standing right in front of him. And this isn’t a club; it’s a regular restaurant,” they add.Upon contacting Molecule, the restaurant in question, it was found that they have a policy against open-toed slippers or sandals. “We have a policy of not allowing people with a certain dress code and we stick by it. But if the staff didn’t behave well, I apologise for that,” says co-owner Sahil Sambhi. He further elaborates, “There is no incorrect or correct dress code — we don’t allow people wearing slippers; you have to be wearing covered shoes.”Read: Delhi eatery denies entry to woman wearing ethnic wear, videos sparks anger Restaurants everywhere reserve the right to admission, which depends on certain parameters set by the management. We speak to some restaurateurs to find about their policies and how they train the staff to manage violations.Dress code is relative to the ambience and the vibe of the place, feels Suveet Kalra, owner, Ardor 2.1. “We are already suffering because of Covid, do you think we even have time to discriminate against people? In our restaurant, we allow people in Indian wear, but our lounge area is where everything is flashy and all about showing off, so we don’t allow certain dress code. It’s as simple as that,” he says adding that it all boils down to how you groom your staff. “The way you treat your staff, they will treat your guests. You will never encounter any such problems at our restaurant. Our managers conduct regular training and grooming sessions with our staff. If the staff is courteous and well-trained in their approach to the guests, then these situations are easily avoidable,” he says.Navneet Kalra, owner Townhall, says that as long as guests can carry themselves well in whatever they are wearing, no one is denied entry. “The kind of guests we get at are all sharply dressed, be it kurta pyjama, shorts or any Indian attire. There is no discrimination. There is a way to carry yourself and as long as people are decently dressed, everyone is welcome,” he says. Dinesh Arora, founder, La Roca says that both the management and the guests need to apply reason when in such a situation. “We follow different dressing rules for different concepts. For a nightclub, we follow a strict dress code as those places have more of international vibes. Our cafes, fine dining and lounge bars are open to any sort of dressing as we get guests across generations. Our staff is trained to explain to customers the reasons behind our policies and usually, people respect it. But there are times when customers also provoke the staff. However, we make sure that our staff always remains courteous,” he says.Read: All doors should open for those in traditional Indian wear: Delhi restaurateursHowever, there is a view that restaurants are built upon a certain vibe, which takes a lot of hard work and investment, so it is solely upon the management to decide whom to allow entry. “We invest a lot of time, money, and passion to bring a particular vibe to a place and the vibe is the soul of any restaurant, bar or club. If someone is dressed in a particular fashion which is not incorrect in any way, but kills the vibe and decorum of the place, then one can be denied entry as others are respecting the same. You still can’t enter a golf club or gymkhana clubs in round neck t-shirts and jeans, or t-shirts with a lot of branding. All members and guests respect and follow it,” says Akshay Anand, co-founder, Ophelia.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/rights-to-admission-reserved-at-restaurants-colonial-hangover-or-a-vibe-thing/story-3bkdeN7eVAeaiplAuZEutN.html

06-01-2021||Delhi||War of words between AAP, BJP intensifies over temple demolition||The war of words between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) triggered by the demolition of a temple in Chandni Chowk intensified on Tuesday with both parties blaming each other for the razing of the religious structure. The AAP criticised the BJP for “falsely alleging” that the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi was responsible for demolition of the temple even as BJP repeated its charge that the chief minister could have intervened and tweaked the design of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project to save the temple. Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said it was the BJP-ruled municipal corporation which had told the court that it was going to demolish the temple. He shared a copy of an affidavit filed by the North MCD in the high court to support the claim. Also Read: Rebuild Chandni Chowk temple: VHP, Bajrang Dal“The affidavit shows that the north MCD conveyed to the court that the demolition would take place on December 20. The affidavit was signed by the deputy commissioner North MCD, Satnam Singh. The BJP does not have the required police force to stop illegal constructions, but they deploy thousands of police personnel at night to demolish a temple,” Bhardwaj said. The BJP, however, blamed the Delhi government for temple’s demolition. “In all these 15 months, the Kejriwal government could have put this matter before the religious committee of the Delhi assembly to review the matter and provide relief to the affected parties. The Delhi government could also have got the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan amended. But they did nothing,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor. The AAP said the BJP indirectly took the help of an NGO, Manushi Sangathan, to file a writ petition in the court for demolition of the temple. Bhardwaj alleged that the people who lead the NGO are close to a senior BJP leader. Sanjay Bhargava, member of the NGO and president of Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal (CCSYM), rejected AAP’s allegations as “a bunch of lies”. “I am not linked to any political party. This project has been monitored by the Delhi high court since 2007 when AAP was not even born. I am the president of CCSYM and we have been trying to redevelop Chandni Chowk since 2000. I request Bhardwaj to withdraw his comments as it amounts to contempt of court orders,” Bhargava said. Bhargava added,“There were five religious structures, three were removed in 2016. This temple was one of the two left. In fact, Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra was present when the Delhi high court passed its order,” he said.Continuing his attack on the BJP, Bhardwaj said, “We would like to tell the BJP that your animosity is with the AAP. Please do not take your revenge on Lord Hanuman. If you will upset Hanuman, it will affect Lord Ram because Ram loves Hanuman, and not the BJP. Also, BJP will not be able to form a government in Delhi by doing this,” Bhardwaj said.BJP’s Kapoor said the Kejriwal government has little concern or respect for Hindu temples, citing an attack on a temple in old Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/war-of-words-between-aap-bjp-intensifies-over-temple-demolition/story-H9RvV27VovmW62huKQjJ6K.html

The society has around 6,000 flats in which nearly 25,000 people live. “We have had five cases of ceiling plaster collapse in the last two days. Two such incidents took place in common areas, but three cases occurred in separate flats. Though there were no casualty, they were still narrow escapes for the residents,” said Arun Sharma, president, Apartment Owners Association of Supertech Capetown.The information about the collapse was shared with the maintenance team, he said.Hirak Dasgupta, a resident, said that he and his wife had just moved inside from the balcony of their flat when a portion of the ceiling in the balcony collapsed. “We are thankful to god that it didn’t happen in one of the rooms. The maintenance team did the repair, but such a collapse should not happen in the first place,” said 66-year-old Dasgupta.The residents alleged that such incidents show that the quality of construction material is poor. “There are 25,000 people in the society who are worried about their safety. We have asked the developer in the past as well for a structural survey but to no avail. Action needs to be taken soon in this regard,” said Sharma.The Supertech group, developer of the society, said that the recent incidents weren’t major ones and due repairs were done for them. “It was not a serious situation. People are creating unnecessary issue for their own vested interests,” said Rajesh, assistant general manager, Supertech group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/five-incidents-of-ceiling-plaster-collapse-have-residents-concerned-about-safety-in-noida-housing-society/story-N6I2OwyjU1NcAtkuFXtrWL.html

That hardly took a minute after which I was seated inside a waiting area. In another 3-4 minutes, I was assigned a vaccine session room where the vaccination was administered in another minute.”Then, after 30 minutes in the observation room, where the real vaccine beneficiaries would be observed for any adverse reaction, she was out.Hospital’s chief medical officer Dr Sangeeta Garg said, “We have prepared two rooms for vaccination session and one more room will come up soon. The entire process for beneficiaries was expected to last 45 minutes each and the dry run went smoothly as planned.”The Ghaziabad health department completed the dry run at IDST College at Modi Nagar, ITS Dental College at Muradnagar, community health centre at Loni, Gayatri Hospital at Lohiya Nagar, Yashoda Hospital at Nehru Nagar and Santosh Hospital near old bus-stand. During the dry run process, two batches of 25 beneficiaries each were assigned to two vaccine-session rooms each at the six sites. In all, 300 beneficiaries took part during the dry run process.  The health department officials said that the actual vaccination process would be similar to the dry run. “At one vaccination centre we observed that the vaccination rooms should be assigned a colour and the beneficiaries should also be given similar coloured slips so that they easily can be identified and assigned to respective room. At another site we found that the forms with instructions written for vaccination process were not printed,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. He said that at one other site they found that the observation room was in an emergency ward. “We directed that the room be a separate enclosure in order to ensure privacy and also to ensure that other patients do not panic. At one other site we found that the home guards reached late. So, directions were issued to the competent officials to ensure timely arrival,” Dr Gupta, added. Tuesday evening, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also attended a video-conference with the UP chief minister and other district magistrates. “The CM told all officials to adhere to strict phase wise vaccination process. People must get the vaccine in the manner directed by the Centre. During the dry run, we observed some issues and they have been corrected,” he, added. The health department has identified 21,850 healthcare workers who would be taking the shots under phase 1 when the actual vaccine arrives. The second phase is for frontline workers which are estimated to be about 44000 in the district while the third category will have highest number of beneficiaries estimated to be more than 500,000. “We estimate that the first and the second phase will be conducted smoothly while we will have to make extra efforts for the third phase as beneficiaries will be much higher in number,” said an officer from the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-to-use-colour-coded-slips-during-actual-vaccination-drive/story-kvnVveWbRzXfzQSBoW3AjK.html

06-01-2021||Delhi||Rebuild Chandni Chowk temple: VHP, Bajrang Dal||Hundreds of workers of Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Bajrang Dal and other right-wing organisations took out a march in Chandni Chowk on Tuesday to protest the demolition of a Hanuman temple by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation on the orders of the Delhi high court. VHP leaders said the protest will continue till the Aam Adami Party government in Delhi allocates land for reconstruction of the temple near the existing site.Also Read: War of words between AAP, BJP intensifies over temple demolitionOn Tuesday morning, hundreds of members of right-wing organisations, Delhi BJP and locals shouted slogans demanding reconstruction of the temple. The protest was planned on Tuesday as it is considered the day of Lord Hanuman, said a VHP member. The temple was demolished at 4am on Sunday. It was located on the road which is being redesigned only for pedestrians as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment plan. The structure was declared illegal by the high court and the order for its removal was passed in 2015. The protesters were restricted near the Sis Ganj Gurdwara and nearly 30 members of VHP and Bajrang Dal were detained by the police. All detainees were later released.No first information report (FIR) was registered in connection with the gathering of nearly 500 protesters even though it was in violation of the Covid-19 guidelines. The protest began around 11 am and continued for over two hours, the police said. Nearly 300 security personnel were deployed to maintain law and order in the area. The police personnel also recorded video of the entire event.Surender Gupta, state vice-president of VHP, said, “The temple could have been saved had the Delhi government planned the redevelopment project carefully. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation (which removed the temple) is just an executing agency. We want the government to allocate land on the central verge so that we can construct the temple. We don’t need any assistance from the government to construct the temple.”The AAP has maintained that it was the North MCD which had admitted before the court that the structure was encroachment and undertaken to remove it. VHP and Delhi BJP leaders said that they will meet Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to request him to intervene and allow the construction of the Hanuman temple.A four-layer security cordon was put in place to stop the protesters from marching to the demolished temple site. The gathering of the members of the right-wing with saffron flags began around 10.30 am near the Red Fort-Chandni Chowk crossing. As their number swelled up and they began marching towards the temple site raising slogans, the security personnel stopped them at the first barricade placed near the Gauri Shankar temple. However, the protesters managed to break the barricade and proceeded towards the site where the temple existed.“We used mild force to contain them at the second barricade near the Sis Ganj Gurdwara, where they continued their agitation and delivered speeches. No The crowd dispersed after 1pm. We are considering legal action in connection with Tuesday’s protest,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named. Unlike Monday when shops opened late, the business in the heritage market was not affected as the police had made adequate arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rebuild-chandni-chowk-temple-vhp-bajrang-dal/story-r3ZNv8UxDaa1NqWvLpJtaN.html

06-01-2021||Gurugram||Six-storey office building in Sector 44 gutted in major fire; no injuries as building was unoccupied||A six-storey office building was completely gutted following a major fire in Sector 44, near Huda City Centre, early on Tuesday. No injuries were reported in the incident.More than 20 fire tenders were called into action to douse the fire. Fire department officials said that it took over two hours to get it under control, and nearly four hours to douse.Assistant divisional fire safety officer, IS Kashyap, said that the fire is suspected to have started around 3am and that the building, which is privately owned, was not occupied at the time of the incident. “The security guard of the adjoining building came on his motorcycle and alerted the officials at the Sector 29 fire department about the incident at 3.21am. Two fire tenders were immediately sent to the spot,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said that the two fire tenders reached the spot within three minutes as it was less than two kilometres from the station.“When the first batch of vehicles reached the spot, the first three floors of the building had been completely engulfed in the fire and the firemen immediately realised that a large-scale operation was needed. Upon alerting us, three more fire tenders were sent from the Sector 29 fire station, two each from the Bhim Nagar, Udyog Vihar, Manesar, and Sector 37 fire stations, along with fire tenders from private companies such as DLF, Maruti, Medanta, as well as the Indian Air Force. A total of 20 fire tenders were used for dousing operations,” said Kashyap.Fire officials said that due to the weather conditions, the blaze became difficult to control. “Although the building did not have any flammable objects inside, the wind speed was extremely strong at the time of the incident. The entire building was covered with glass panels. As soon as even one glass panel broke, the intensity of the fire increased rapidly with the gush of fresh air and it spread upwards, engulfing the floors above as well,” said Kashyap. “We were in a situation where we didn’t know which floor of the building we should focus our resources on. The entire operation was extremely tricky and difficult,” he said.Fire officials said that office items, electronic items, flooring, tiles and glass panels were completely gutted in the incident. “Our dousing operations ensured that the intensity of heat in the building remained under control, which ensured that it did not collapse. The owners had a valid no-objection certificate (NOC) and four of their hydrants were used for drawing water for the dousing operations, which lasted for nearly two hours. Subsequently, a fire hydrant from a nearby private hospital was also used for drawing water,” said Kashyap.Kashyap said that a short circuit is suspected to have been the main cause of the fire.As a precautionary measure, fire officials have kept a fire tender at the spot on standby until early Wednesday morning to extinguish any stray sparks that may occur.Despite repeated calls, representatives of the building management could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/six-storey-office-building-in-sector-44-gutted-in-major-fire-no-injuries-as-building-was-unoccupied/story-3hLj09S2wQDq97xEZUIZaP.html

Sondhi told them if they did not send him nude images of themselves, he would post intimate images of them to their friends and family. Some of the young women complied with his requests and in at least six cases he carried out his threats.He gained unauthorised access to hundreds of social media accounts, in particular Snapchat. A number of his victims experienced serious emotional and psychological harm in the aftermath of his despicable actions, with one victim attempting suicide.Joseph Stickings of the CPS, said: “Akash Sondhi is an extremely manipulative man who inflicted emotional and psychological damage on young women while also getting gratification from their images and videos.”“Following a diligent and thorough investigation conducted by the Essex Police Cyber Crime Unit the CPS was able to build a comprehensive case of 65 counts reflecting the high level of his offending”. He added: “I would like to thank all of the women who bravely came forward to tell of their traumatic experiences at the hands of Akash Sondhi.

Although Garland received bipartisan praise, Republicans argued that any nomination should wait until after the American public had a chance to vote, even though the presidential election was still eight months away. Later, the Senate confirmed President Donald Trump’s choice for the seat, Neil Gorsuch.When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September last year, Republicans abandoned their argument about election-year nominations, pushing through a confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett days before the November 3 election.Garland, 68, is a veteran of the legal community and US justice department.He first served in the department as a special assistant in President Jimmy Carter’s administration before going into private practice. He returned to the department for a brief stint in 1989 as an assistant US attorney.In 1993, he became a deputy assistant attorney general in the department’s criminal division and then was promoted to be a top aide to the deputy attorney general.Garland oversaw high-profile domestic terrorism prosecutions, including for bombings in Oklahoma City and at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.President Bill Clinton nominated Garland to be a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and he was confirmed in 1997. He became chief judge of the panel, which has influence second only to the Supreme Court, in 2013.Biden chose Garland after figures including former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, Democratic Senator Doug Jones and former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick had been talked about as candidates for the position.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-name-merrick-garland-as-us-attorney-general/story-4etr418oXks2lLhx8zUgfN.html

Hospitals across the UK have been struggling to cope with new admissions.Johnson told a specially convened session of the House of Commons to pass legislation related to the new lockdown that the government had no choice but to clamp another lockdown due to the ever-rising numbers. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have restrictions similar to the lockdown in England.He said: “(Alas), this mutation, spreading with frightening ease and speed in spite of the sterling work of the British public – has led to more cases than we have ever seen before, alas numbers that cannot be explained away by the meteoric rise in testing.“When the Office for National Statistics reports that more than 2% of the population is now infected, and when the number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40% higher than the first peak in April, it is inescapable that the facts are changing and we must change our response.”New centres have been established across the country for mass vaccination. Johnson saw the current phase as a “tough final stretch” that will hopefully end in the coming months when mass vaccination will prevent spread of the virus and its variant.Johnson said: “We are in a tough final stretch, made only tougher by the new variant – but this country will come together and the miracle of scientific endeavour, much of it right here in the UK, has given us not only the sight of the finish line but a clear route to get there.“After the marathon of last year we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them. Every needle in every arm makes a difference”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-deaths-cases-hit-records-as-england-starts-third-lockdown/story-qhynkyOHZ7hWR5kIPrMBUO.html
06-01-2021||World||Kim tells party congress that North Korea’s economic plan failed ‘tremendously’||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his five-year economic plan had failed to meet its goals “on almost every sector” as he kicked off a congress of the ruling Workers’ Party, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. The rare political gathering, which Kim last hosted in 2016, has drawn international attention as he is expected to unveil a new five-year economic plan and address inter-Korean ties and foreign policy. The congress, attended by 250 party executives, 4,750 delegates and 2,000 spectators, comes just two weeks before US President-elect Joe Biden takes office. In his opening speech, Kim said the country had achieved a “miraculous victory” by bolstering its power and global prestige, referring to military advances that culminated in successful tests in 2017 of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the US mainland and a series of meetings with US President Donald Trump. But the five-year economic strategy unveiled in 2016 had failed to deliver, he said, urging North Korea’s greater self-reliance. “The strategy was due last year but it tremendously fell short of goals on almost every sector,” Kim said, according to KCNA.Kim had sought to accelerate economic growth and boost electricity supplies but U.N. agencies reported chronic power and food shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, the coronavirus pandemic and severe floods.While consolidating power with a series of military provocations and ruthless purges, Kim has been trying to build a “man of the people” persona by openly admitting some of his failures - once a taboo in a country that reveres an errorless, godlike leader. Kim was even seen shedding tears as he thanked people for their sacrifices at a military parade in October.“He seems to have made a strategic decision to admit economic failure as he can also blame the coronavirus,” said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. “By doing so, he would also seek to cement his image as a people-loving leader.” ‘Stable anti-virus situation’On the pandemic, Kim lauded party workers for ensuring “stable situations against the coronavirus from beginning to end.” “They had resolutely overcome difficulties in the face of an unprecedentedly prolonged, unparalleled global health crisis,” he added.North Korea has not officially confirmed any coronavirus infections, although it reported thousands of “suspected cases” to the World Health Organization. South Korean authorities have said an outbreak in the North cannot be ruled out as it had active trade and people movement with China before closing its border last January.Seoul’s Unification Ministry in charge of cross-border affairs said it hopes the meeting will provide a chance to foster peace and advance inter-Korean ties. KCNA said Kim will suggest “strategic and tactical policies” aimed at promoting reunification and foreign relations during the congress. Kim usually gives a New Year address which maps out blueprints for his diplomatic, military and economic policy but skipped it this year. Analysts said he will likely give a message once the congress is over. In KCNA images, no one was seen wearing masks and participants did not sit apart, unlike at some other recent public events. Kim was accompanied by top aides, including his sister and senior party official Kim Yo Jong, nominal head of state Choe Ryong Hae and Premier Kim Tok Hun. Lists of participants released by KCNA showed nearly 75%, or 29 of 39 leaders who took the podium have been replaced since the 2016 congress, as Kim sacked many of his father’s longtime confidants, weakened the powerful military and promoted relatively younger loyalists, including his sister.Experts expect further leadership changes to be announced over the remaining days of the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-tells-party-congress-that-north-korea-s-economic-plan-failed-tremendously/story-r5Ugu6YrrNHsKt3gvnkBpJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Dems poised to take Senate as Congress meets to certify Biden win||A Democratic candidate is projected to win one of the two runoff elections in Georgia that hold the key to the Senate, and a fellow party nominee expanded his lead in the second race on Wednesday, setting up a potentially stunning upset defeat for Republicans in their stronghold.US Congress will hold a joint session later in the day to grant one final certification to President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Republican lawmakers allied to President Donald Trump have announced plans to object to the certification, which will drag out what has been a largely ceremonial process but will not change the outcome, or reverse Biden’s election.Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated Kelly Loeffler, the sitting Republican senator, by more than 60,000 votes, while Jon Ossoff, the other Democrat, was ahead of David Perdue, the incumbent senator, by over 17,000, expanding his overnight lead and tightening his grip on the race.Warnock and Ossoff’s wins — if and when the second happens — will raise the number of Democrats in the Senate from current 48 to 50, splitting the majority in the 100-member chamber with Republicans. But with Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate, Democrats will be in control.Democrat control of the Senate will complete a trifecta, with the House of Representatives and the White House already in the bag, starting January 20.With both chambers of Congress in Democratic control, Biden will have an easier time pursuing his legislative agenda. And the Senate win, on its own, will allow his nominees to be confirmed easily, especially those that Republicans were threatening to block.In response to the Georgia election outcome, Biden said: “Georgia’s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now. On Covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. They want us to move, but move together.”“It looks like we will emerge from yesterday’s election with Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, and of course I’m pleased that we will be able to work with Speaker (Nancy) Pelosi and a Majority Leader (Charles) Schumer,” he said in a statement.“We were told we couldn’t win this election, but tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work, and the people by our side, anything is possible,” said Warnock in a brief victory speech. “May my story be an inspiration to some young person who is trying to grasp and grab hold of the American dream.”Warnock will be the first African American senator from Georgia. He is reverend of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, which was once led by Martin Luther King Jr, the civil rights leader. And Ossoff, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, will be the first Jewish senator from Georgia. Shortly before he overtook Perdue, his campaign said in a statement , “When all the votes are counted, we fully expect that Jon Ossoff will have won this election to represent Georgia in the United States Senate. The outstanding vote is squarely in parts of the state where Jon’s performance has been dominant. We look forward to seeing the process through in the coming hours and moving ahead so Jon can start fighting for all Georgians in the US Senate.”Outgoing President Trump was tracking the runoffs closely, but only to pounce on technical glitches and difficulties to bolster his baseless claims of election fraud as he continued to pursue his doomed efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden. “Looks like they are setting up a big ‘voter dump’ against the Republican candidates. Waiting to see how many votes they need?” he tweeted during a pause in counting.Trump remained largely focused on the upcoming certification of Biden’s victory by Congress at the joint session later in the day. Lawmakers allied to him intend to object to the certification, but do not have the numbers to block the certification or reject.The president and his allies have been pressuring vice-president Mike Pence, who will preside over the joint session, to reject the certification, overstepping his constitutional authority. Pence is reported to have conveyed to Trump at a meeting on Tuesday that he does not have the power to reject or return the certificates to the states. Trump issued a statement denying Pence said that to him, but, notably, Pence did not endorse the denial, not directly or through surrogates.“States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval,” Trump wrote in a tweet Wednesday morning, just hours before the start of the joint session. “All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!”Trump’s own lawyer Jay Sekulow disagrees with the president. “Some have speculated that the vice president could simply say, ‘I’m not going to accept these electors. ‘I don’t think that’s what the Constitution has in mind. If that were the case, any VP could refuse any election,” he said on a radio show, according to CNN.Trump, who is consumed by an obsession to overturn his election defeat, will plough on nevertheless. He is addressing a rally in support of his baseless claims ahead of the joint session called the “Save America March”. He will reiterate his false claims of election fraud and will pile up more pressure on his vice-president, testing his unwavering loyalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dems-poised-to-take-senate-as-congress-meets-to-certify-biden-win/story-KZS5mULL1vpwddr05bvIJO.html
06-01-2021||World||Joe Biden celebrates Georgia win, looks to a united government||President-elect Joe Biden celebrated Democrat Raphael Warnock’s win in a Georgia Senate runoff election and said he was confident of another, calling the victories clear signs that voters want him to pursue his agenda while also seeking bipartisan consensus.“Georgia’s voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: They want action on the crises we face and they want it right now. On Covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more,” he said Wednesday in a written statement. “They want us to move, but move together.”The American people, he said, “demand action and they want unity. I am more optimistic than I ever have been that we can deliver both.”Democrat Warnock has defeated Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, the Associated Press reported, while Democrat Jon Ossoff appeared headed toward victory over Republican Senator David Perdue. If both victories are confirmed, the Senate will be evenly divided between the Republican and the Democratic caucuses, leaving Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to make tie-breaking votes.Biden said he’s pleased to be able to have Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress, but stressed that the wins haven’t diminished his desire to draw Republican support for his plans.“I’m also just as determined today as I was yesterday to try to work with people in both parties — at the federal, state, and local levels — to get big things done for our nation,” he said.Biden reiterated his desire to see Congress pass another Covid-19 relief bill.He also called on Senate leaders to move ahead on the confirmation processes for his Cabinet nominees, especially those who would have key national security roles, even before the Georgia results are certified. “My nominees for critical national security positions at State, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security have bipartisan support and have been confirmed by the Senate before,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-celebrates-georgia-win-looks-to-a-united-government/story-cvB51dNWQDuqgzRmKhCJCM.html

A final outcome is not expected until later on Wednesday.“There will be beneficiaries of a Democratic sweep and there are companies in the Nasdaq - technology and healthcare - that could potentially face some short-term headwinds when it comes to higher taxes and more regulation, impacting their bottom lines,” said Tim Chubb, chief investment officer at GIRARD in West Chester, Pennsylvania.The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 0.7% as behemoths Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Google-parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc dropped between 1.6% and 2%.Tesla Inc was the only major technology stock trading higher.At 10:06 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260.13 points, or 0.86%, to 30,651.73, the S&P 500 gained 9.67 points, or 0.26%, to 3,736.53 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 88.86 points, or 0.69%, to 12,730.10.The small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped 2.8%, hovering near a record high.Hopes of a vaccine-powered economic recovery in 2021 pushed Wall Street’s main indexes to record highs in late-December, with sectors that had previously lagged, including banks, industrials and energy, fuelling the rally.“You are seeing more evidence of a rebound in value over growth, and it feeds into the debate as to whether investors should pile into more cyclicals, which are co-related with value, or stick to bigger players within the growth space given that valuations in some cases are quite extreme,” said Sebastien Galy, macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.“Market is quite nervous about its position in large tech.”Invesco Solar ETF gained about 6.7% on expectations that clean energy companies will benefit under a Democrat-controlled Congress, while bets on decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level lifted ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF up 8.4%.AmerisourceBergen Corp gained 7.4% after the U.S. drug wholesaler said it would buy Walgreens Boots Alliance’s drug distribution business for $6.5 billion to expand in Europe.

Democrat Raphael Warnock won one of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs and the other Democrat, Jon Ossoff, has taken a lead over his Republican rival David Perdue.Taking to Twitter, Trump said that Democrats are just “toying” with Perdue, claiming that they have as many ballots as necessary to win the election. “These scoundrels are only toying with the @sendavidperdue (a great guy) vote. Just didn’t want to announce quite yet. They’ve got as many ballots as are necessary. Rigged Election!” tweeted the outgoing US president. “They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!” he wrote in another tweet, which was flagged by Twitter as disputed. They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night. The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!Also Read | Trump claims voter fraud in Georgia Senate runoffs, Republican candidate calls for ‘transparency’Trump also urged vice president Mike Pence to help him overturn the election results. Claiming that the US states want to “correct” their votes, he asked Pence to show “extreme courage” to thwart the Electoral College vote. According to a CNN report, Pence on Tuesday told Trump that the vice president does not have the authority to block certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s win.Trump’s allies in Congress are planning to raise objections on the vote count and delay the certification of the Electoral College. The House of Representatives and the Senate will separately debate for up to two hours over the objections, if any, which will be followed by a vote.However, they need a majority of lawmakers in both chambers voting in their favour to uphold the objections. Such a scenario is virtually unlikely as Democrats control the House and top Senate Republicans, including Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, have already recognised Biden as the next US president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-us-election-process-worse-than-third-world-countries-urges-pence-to-show-courage/story-qPT0KBf2nP6dS4yQXyA79M.html
06-01-2021||World||Jair Bolsonaro blasts Brazil’s syringe makers over soaring prices||President Jair Bolsonaro accused syringe makers on Wednesday of pushing up their prices after the government failed to buy hundreds of millions of syringes via auction for its Covid-19 vaccination drive, leading it to requisition surplus supplies.“Prices soared after the Health Ministry expressed an interest in buying syringes,” Bolsonaro wrote on social media, adding that the government had suspended buying until prices return to normal.Brazil’s three main syringe manufacturers met with Bolsonaro on Tuesday and agreed that each would supply 10 million, along with needles to cover the initial stages of the country’s planned vaccinations.“It was a requisition order and the companies have to obey it. This was almost a confiscation, but the government will pay,” said Paulo Henrique Fraccaro, head of Brazil’s medical supplies and equipment industry lobby group ABIMO.Fraccaro said the government decided to requisition syringe supplies after it failed to draw bids last week at an electronic auction session. It had sought to buy 331 million syringes but purchased just 8 million, or 2.5% of its target, after it set reference prices that were below companies’ bids.The Health Ministry offered 13 centavos (.13 reais) per syringe in its Nov. 29 tender, but most companies were asking for 22-48 centavos (.22-.48 reais), depending on the characteristics, Fraccaro said.While prices for the requisitioned syringes had not been agreed, Fraccaro said the government planned to open a second tender in one or two weeks with prices “adjusted” to today’s manufacturing reality.Brazil has the worst Covid-19 death toll outside the United States, but has lagged neighbors Chile and Argentina in starting inoculations against the new coronavirus.Bolsonaro wrote that Brazil’s states and municipalities have enough supplies to begin vaccinations, which are expected to start by the end of the month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jair-bolsonaro-blasts-brazil-s-syringe-makers-over-soaring-prices/story-S9gYq6ZXZgYzsCJUPommzL.html
06-01-2021||World||Saudi oil exports to US at zero for first time in 35 years||The U.S. didn’t import any Saudi crude last week for the first time in 35 years, a reversal from just months ago when the Kingdom threatened to upend the American energy industry by unleashing a tsunami of exports into a market decimated by the pandemic.The absence of deliveries follows a slump in crude shipments to the U.S. that left the desert kingdom in October. Since tankers from Saudi Arabia take about six weeks to reach import terminals on either the west or Gulf coasts, the drop is only starting to show up now. This is the first week America had no deliveries based on available weekly data through June 2010 from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A longer history of monthly figures shows this is the first time there were no Saudi imports since September 1985.Earlier this year, the oil producing countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and ten non-OPEC allies agreed to cut production by a record 9.7 million barrels a day after a brief production free-for-all that saw prices plunge. The supply cuts have helped shore up crude, even as fuel consumption struggles to return to pre-pandemic levels. In the past month, oil prices have risen on hopes that demand could improve as a number of vaccines have been announced to combat the health crisis.But America is still in the throes of the pandemic, with record infections in many states forcing new restrictions, while other parts of the world are recovering. U.S. gasoline consumption plunged to the lowest in years during the usual high-demand Thanksgiving holiday period.The demand loss is so acute some U.S. refineries have been idled. “Throughput is still below where it was before the crisis because of reduced domestic demand. So why send more here when Asia is where recovery has been clear,” said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar Inc.For Saudi Arabia, cutting shipments to the U.S. is the quickest way to telegraph to the wider market that it’s tightening supply. The government is alone in publishing weekly data on crude stockpiles and imports, which carry enormous influence among oil traders. Other big petroleum consuming nations, like China, publish less timely information about oil supplies.In May and June, Saudi deliveries to the U.S. more than doubled from a year ago. The onslaught prompted Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tweet in April: “My message to the Saudis: TURN THE TANKERS THE HELL AROUND.” American refiners received the final installment of that bumper load in early July.Since then, Saudi oil shipments to the U.S. have steadily declined. Just two weeks ago, they delivered only 73,000 barrels a day to customers, preliminary U.S. Energy Information Administration data show.Still, Saudi Arabia won’t be giving up on supplying the U.S. anytime soon even during this pandemic. Tanker tracking data monitored by Bloomberg show shipments from the kingdom rising in November. Even so, after the first of those ships arrives off the west coast this week, there is a long gap until the next one is due on Dec. 23.“The Saudis will be mindful about not losing any more U.S. market share to other sellers not if they can help it,” said Morningstar’s Fielden. That’s why despite the low seasonal U.S. demand, the Saudis cut prices for January shipments to its American buyers, he added.In the short term, the election of Joe Biden could benefit Saudi Arabia. While transitioning away from hydrocarbons would have a long-term impact on oil demand, hopes to revive the 2015-Iranian nuclear deal would pave the way for more Iranian oil to flow globally. “Those sales will displace Saudi oil and that would mean Arabia would have to turn to the U.S. to maintain sales,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-oil-exports-to-us-at-zero-for-first-time-in-35-years/story-SRCCnJzFyquMSgB04pNikL.html
06-01-2021||World||Democrats close to Senate control fuelled by black voter turnout||Democrats were poised to take control of the US Senate on Wednesday after high turnout among Black voters boosted their candidates in two runoff elections in Georgia.Challenger Raphael Warnock beat incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler to take one of the two seats. The race between Jon Ossoff and one-term Senator David Perdue was still too close to call, but Ossoff was leading by more than 17,000 votes and claimed victory.Two Democratic wins from a once reliably Republican state would be a rebuke of President Donald Trump’s incessant claims of voter fraud in the November election in Georgia, which he lost narrowly to President-elect Joe Biden.Republican turnout didn’t keep up with Democratic enthusiasm, driven largely by coordinated efforts to get Black voters to the polls led by former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams.Benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields rose past 1% for the first time since March as traders evaluated the implications of potential Democratic control of the Senate, such as additional fiscal stimulus and tax increases. US stocks were mixed.In a video statement, Ossoff, 33, spoke as if he were headed to Washington, though no one had called his race against Perdue, 71, a first-term Republican senator and former corporate executive.“I want to thank the people of Georgia for participating in this election,” he said. “Whether you were for me or against me, I will be for you in the US Senate.”To secure control of the chamber, Democrats need to win both seats, which would split the Senate 50-50 between Republicans and the Democratic caucus, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.Warnock, 51, is the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the position once held by Martin Luther King Jr. He will become Georgia’s first Black US senator.“This is a wonderful day here in Georgia and I believe in America. I am an iteration and an example of the American dream,” Warnock told CNN on Wednesday.The AP VoteCast survey of more than 2,700 verified Georgia voters found that Black voters made up 32% of the electorate — more than the 29% they were in November. And those voters opted overwhelmingly for the Democrats, by margins of 93% or more.Of the 115,000 voters who voted in the runoff but skipped the November election, 40% were African-American, according to the Democratic voter data firm TargetSmart.Perhaps no single person is more associated with Georgia’s shift to the Democrats than Abrams, who gained national attention with her unsuccessful run for governor in 2018.Abrams’s efforts date back a decade, when she was minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, working to challenge restrictive voter laws and energize minority voters.“Being a battleground means you have to fight for victory,” she told CNN Tuesday night. “Republicans, for 20 years, took for granted their successes.”Senate control, paired with the Democrats’ narrow majority in the House, would give Biden a unified U.S. government, smoothing the path for his nominees and allowing him to implement major pieces of his agenda.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who stands to replace Mitch McConnell as majority leader if Ossoff’s race is called in his favor, issued a statement calling it “a brand new day.”“For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate -- and that will be very good for the American people,” Schumer said, noting that the country was enduring “one of the greatest crises we’ve ever faced.”It could take days to get a final tally for the outcome of the race between Perdue and Ossoff. State election official Gabriel Sterling told CNN there were around 65,000 ballots still to be counted but said they were mostly from Democratic areas. About 17,000 military and overseas ballots, and some domestic absentee ballots, can still be counted as late as Friday.Ossoff’s margin is larger than the 11,779-vote lead that helped Biden ultimately flip the state. But the narrow results will almost certainly spark legal challenges or a recount that also could delay a final determination of Senate control. The current margin would allow Perdue to request a recount if Ossoff is declared the winner, and he has indicated he will do so.Georgia Republicans didn’t turn out in high enough numbers to tamp down overwhelming Democratic participation, said Kerwin Swint, director of the school of government at Kennesaw State University. Republicans needed 65% of the election day vote.And some Republicans in the state pointed fingers at Trump for damaging their chances.“When you tell people your vote doesn’t count and has been stolen and people start to believe that – and then you go to the two senators and tell them to ask the secretary of state to resign and trigger a civil war inside the Republican Party when you need Republicans to unite, all of that stems from his decision-making since the Nov. 3rd election,” said Sterling, a Republican who has aggressively refuted Trump’s unfounded claims of fraud.Loeffler showed no sign of conceding. “There are a lot of votes out there, as y’all know,” she told supporters. “And we have a path to victory and we’re staying on it.”Trump Questions ResultsThe uncertainty over the Senate comes as Congress meets in a joint session on Wednesday to count Electoral College votes that will ratify Biden’s win, even as Trump urged Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers to overturn the results based on baseless claims of a “rigged” election.Warnock called the move a “distraction” that could have cost Republicans the Georgia Senate seats.“It’s a distraction. These senators know better, and the people that I’m talking to all across Georgia are concerned about their lives,” he said. “We need to be passing the $2,000 relief checks. Instead, the politicians are focused on their concerns, who’s winning and who’s losing.”Fraud ClaimsFighting for party control of the Senate made the races important enough. But against the backdrop of Trump’s baseless claims of vote fraud and corruption by Georgia elections officials -- topped by his extraordinary hour-long phone call demanding that officials “find” enough votes to overturn the presidential election -- the races also became a test of Trump’s continued hold on the GOP.If Perdue manages to pull out a win, Biden would face a still-GOP-controlled Senate largely unwilling to back many of his plans to develop a federal response to controlling the coronavirus pandemic, deliver more economic stimulus, or raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy.Trump AlliesIn almost every way, Perdue’s and Loeffler’s calculations were to stick tightly to the president, or at least not alienate Trump voters and the party’s base. The duo both called for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to resign after he dismissed Trump’s allegations of voter fraud, and both have backed the effort in the Senate to challenge the election results when Congress certifies the November election on Wednesday.Both Republican senators described their foes as “dangerously radical” and warned Ossoff and Warnock would hand over power in Washington to “socialists” like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Ossoff and Warnock depicted their wealthy Republican opponents as out-of-touch multimillionaires.

06-01-2021||World||Israel convicts Palestinian activist of illegal protest, assault, lawyer says||An Israeli military court on Wednesday convicted a Palestinian rights activist of offences in the occupied West Bank, his lawyer said, in a case that Amnesty International described as politically motivated.The military did not immediately provide Reuters with the Ofer military court’s verdict against Issa Amro of the Palestinian city of Hebron, and arguments over sentencing will await a further hearing on Feb. 8.Amro denied the charges, which included protesting without a permit, obstructing Israeli soldiers’ activities in the flashpoint city of Hebron and assaulting a Jewish settler.Amro, 40, founded an activist group that regularly protests against settlement construction in Hebron. Under heavy Israeli military protection, around 1,000 settlers live there among 200,000 Palestinians.“It doesn’t make sense to punish someone for non-violent resistance,” Amro told Reuters. “The Israeli military system exists only to oppress Palestinians and restrict freedom of speech.”Amro was convicted on six of 18 charges against him, in incidents that occurred between 2010 and 2016, his lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said.Lasky said it was hard to predict whether Amro would face prison time, but that a Palestinian in a similar case received a 10-month term.Amnesty International said the charges against Amro were “politically motivated and linked to his peaceful work in exposing Israel’s human rights violations”.The group has also condemned as “disgraceful” charges brought against Amro by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.Amnesty said the PA has accused him of “disturbing public order” and “insulting higher authorities” over Facebook posts in 2017 critical of Palestinian leaders.Amro said his next Palestinian court hearing is on Jan. 20.Most countries view settlements Israel built on West Bank land captured in a 1967 war as illegal. Israel disputes this, citing biblical and historical connections to the territory, as well as security needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-convicts-palestinian-activist-of-illegal-protest-assault-lawyer-says/story-UMNrwv7Y0wCH0KD8aTxkGJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Stacey Abrams: Lawyer, voting rights activist who turned Georgia blue||Stacey Abrams lost a gubernatorial race to Republican Brian Kemp in 2018 by a narrow margin of 50,000 votes, in an election that was marred by widespread allegations of voter suppression. In her campaign closing speech, Abrams announced the creation of Fair Fight Action, a grassroots organisation to bolster voter registration efforts and counter the unfair voter suppression tactics which Abrams said led to her loss.In November last year, when Joe Biden flipped Georgia, a state which hadn’t elected a Democrat president in more than two decades, credit went to Stacey Abrams and many other women of colour like her, who have been organising their community since Abrams was a minority leader in Georgia’s House of Representatives. Although Abrams alone cannot be credited for the record number of voter registration through years of political canvassing, she has become the most popular face of a movement propelled by scores of Black women. These same women successfully delivered another resounding victory on Wednesday in the Georgia senate runoffs. Lawyer, voting rights activistStacey Abrams is a native of Mississippi, which much like Georgia was one of the seven Confederate states that fought against the United States of America in the civil war, resisting abolition of slavery. Abrams, who is a lawyer, Democrat politician, and a voting rights activist, was elected as the minority leader in Georgia’s lower chamber in 2011, and thus began her work of strengthening the Democratic party’s base in the state.The most pivotal moment in Abram’s political career was the infamous 2018 gubernatorial race, where Brian Kemp a staunch Trump ally, who was serving as the secretary of state of Georgia at that time, deregistered more than 1.4 million voters between 2012 and 2018, with some 700,000 voters being deregistered in 2017 alone. Since then Abrams has repeatedly emphasised that Kemp’s tenure as the secretary of state, whose office has access to voter registration data, conflicted with this campaign for governor, and has refused to acknowledge Kemp as the rightful winner. Abram’s role in turning Georgia blueJoe Biden was able to flip Georgia by a razor-thin margin of 0.24% votes in the state which had voted for Donald Trump in the last election. Abrams along with the women who worked with her in her grassroots campaign have registered close to 800,000 voters from the Latino, Black, and Asian communities, all minority groups, and have been able to successfully turn the registration into votes. Abrams told the New York Times that before her 2018 bid for governor she drove to 150 of Georgia’s 159 counties, trying to figure out where the party needs to become more viable. “But when I got into those places, there was always someone there to meet me — who had been waiting for someone to come to help connect and help them build this network,” Abrams told NYT. “So whether it was finding Black voters in South Georgia, and working with Black immigrants in Gwinnett, or working with the Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders community, or going to North Georgia and meeting with more and more Latino voters,” she said. The network Abrams talked about is the one which delivered a Democratic victory in a deep south state. Abrams and her grassroots organisers were not just able to encourage Black voters, they even turned many college-educated suburban White women into Biden voters, even though they had traditionally voted for Republicans. Abram’s commitment to making every vote count is visible on her Twitter account. In the race up to the Georgia runoffs, Abrams not only encouraged people to show up to the polls, but she also educated and continuously reminded them to check in with voter helplines to make sure their ballots were counted. Abrams is reportedly planning to run for governor in 2022. She is undoubtedly one of the most influential politicians in America today who is not in office. Donald Trump in his recently leaked infamous phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, asking him to overturn the election results, can be heard saying “Stacey Abrams is laughing about you. She’s going around saying, ‘These guys are dumber than a rock.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stacey-abrams-lawyer-voting-rights-activist-who-turned-georgia-blue/story-V0L2UMC0cn79Wx5KbtvWhP.html

They have a range of 4,000 kilometers, it said.The two-day drills started on Tuesday and also involved successful tests of quadcopter drones capable of dropping small cluster munitions, ISNA said.The military exercises took place as Iran vowed to defend itself against any U.S. military action in the final weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency.

06-01-2021||World||Australia brings forward vaccine rollout by two weeks to early March||The Australian government on Wednesday said it is bringing forward the expected rollout of its first coronavirus vaccine by two weeks to early March to ensure the health and safety of the people and frontline workers.Health Minister Greg Hunt said the national vaccination campaign will start earlier than expected. “We’ve been able to bring our vaccination commencement schedule forward from the middle of the year, to the second quarter, to late March and now to early March, and I’m not ruling out further steps,” the ABC News reported, quoting Hunt. “Safety trumps everything” and it is the government’s priority to ensure that there was public confidence in any and all vaccines rolled out in Australia, he said.Hunt said the first doses of the vaccine would be delivered to frontline workers and those with exposure to international travellers, and that the medical advice on what order the vaccine would be delivered to other priority groups and the rest of the population was “still being finalised”.“It’s not a surprising approach, it’s a very common-sense of approach — you simply follow the vulnerability and the risk of either transmission or the consequence of infection,” he said.Australia has secured 10 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, apart from just under 54 million doses of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, with 50 million doses being produced onshore by CSL in the state of Victoria, which has already started manufacturing doses.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines still need to be approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and expected to start inoculations in late March.Australia has so far recorded 28,791 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths due to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-brings-forward-vaccine-rollout-by-two-weeks-to-early-march/story-6v3s28xH7LX3XEuqwQhjdO.html
06-01-2021||World||Timeline: How EU filled its basket in Covid-19 vaccine shopping spree||The European Union (EU) has conducted a monthslong shopping spree to secure vaccines to battle the Covid-19 pandemic.The following is a timeline of its strategy.Contracts for allIn June the EU set up a team of experts from the bloc’s 27 member states to negotiate together with vaccine makers the advance purchase of Covid-19 shots, with a budget of about 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion).That followed criticism by member states of Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands, which that month had reached a deal with AstraZeneca on the supply of up to 400 million doses of its vaccine candidate.EU countries not involved in the deal said that could have triggered a race among EU governments for vaccines. The solution was to secure them together and to commit not to run parallel talks with pharmaceutical firms.The bloc immediately started negotiations with Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, and then with BioNTech/Pfizer CureVac and Moderna .EU officials said vaccine makers were selected on the basis of progress in their trials, of their ability to produce shots for Europe quickly and of the technology they used - in a bid to diversify and give Europe as many different technologies as possible given that some vaccine trials may fail.The first deal made was with AstraZeneca in August for 400 million doses, largely converting the agreement initially sealed by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. At that time, the vaccine developed by the British-Swedish firm together with Oxford University was conducting large-scale, Phase III trials.Pfizer and BioNTech were also carrying out Phase III trials in August, but the EU reached a deal with them only in November - for 300 million doses - after they said trial results showed their vaccine was highly effective and safe.In July, the EU had refused an offer by BioNTech/Pfizer to order 500 million doses as it found the suggested deal too expensive, according to an internal EU document seen by Reuters.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. The first to be authorised in Western countries, it poses significant - and unique - logistical challenges because it needs to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures.Germany, in what appears to be a breach of the EU agreements, conducted parallel talks for the supply of 30 million additional doses from BioNTech, which is based in Germany and had received German funds.A German health ministry spokesman said this week the deal was sealed in September, two months before the EU contract, although the timing of deliveries is still unclear.Sanofi dealBefore sealing the contract with Pfizer and BioNTech, the EU decided to close a quicker deal with France’s pharmaceutical giant Sanofi in September for 300 million doses.At that time, the Sanofi vaccine, being developed with British firm GlaxoSmithKline, was at just Phase I and II of trials. In December, the two companies announced their trials were not successful and needed at least another year of tests .The EU gave Sanofi 324 million euros ($400 million) in a non-refundable down payment to secure 300 million doses. It had paid AstraZeneca 336 million euros ($414 million) in a similar arrangement, EU officials told Reuters.The Sanofi/GSK vaccine is based on lab-made proteins designed to trigger an immune response, an established technology already used in vaccines against other viruses.After Sanofi, the EU signed a third deal with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson in October for the supply of up to 400 million doses of its vaccine which is based on a viral vector and was already at Phase III when the deal was closed. The company was given a down payment of nearly 350 million euros ($432 million).CurevacThe contract with Pfizer and BioNTech, the EU’s fourth, was signed on Nov. 11. Days later, the bloc announced an agreement with German firm CureVac for up to 405 million doses. At that time, CureVac had not yet started Phase III large-scale trials.It is unknown how much money was given in a down payment to the German biotech company, which had already received EU funds to develop vaccines. Germany’s state-owned KfW development bank is a major shareholder in CureVac.A sixth deal with US biotech firm Moderna was signed by the EU on Nov. 25, after successful trial results were announced. It envisages the supply of up to 160 million doses.Both Moderna’s and CureVac’s vaccines are based on the mRNA technology, the same used in the Pfizer-BioNTech shot.The EU is now in talks with U.S. firm Novavax for 200 million doses of its vaccine and with Pfizer for an additional contract of 50/100 million doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/timeline-how-eu-filled-its-basket-in-covid-19-vaccine-shopping-spree/story-epRfeI2ihjkxNqpPPbVIYK.html

06-01-2021||World||UK police to get stricter with fines for Covid-19 lockdown breaches||The UK police will get stricter with its enforcement of the new nationwide lockdown that legally came into force on Wednesday and have urged the public to fully comply with the rules, which call for people to stay at home except for limited reasons to be outdoors. Scotland Yard said people in “obvious, wilful and serious” breach of the restrictions are increasingly likely to face fines or fixed penalty notices, which range between 200 pounds and 10,000 pounds. “In practice this will mean that all those attending parties, unlicensed music events or large illegal gatherings, can expect to be fined – not just the organisers of such events. Similarly, those not wearing masks where they should be and without good reason can expect to be fined – not reasoned with,” the Metropolitan Police said.The public is being alerted that there are fewer “reasonable excuses” for people to be away from their home in the latest regulations, except for one form of daily exercise, for essential shopping or for medical reasons, and officers will get more “inquisitive” as to why they see someone out and about. The Met police also warned protesters planning to gather in central London this week that it will not tolerate any breaches and enforcement action will be taken.“After 10 months of this pandemic the number of people who are genuinely not aware of the restrictions and the reasons they are in place is vanishingly small,” said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist, who leads the Met’s response to the Covid pandemic.“Our first duty as police officers is to preserve life. The critical situation our NHS (National Health Service) colleagues are facing and the way the new virus variant moves through communities, means we can no longer spend our time explaining or encouraging people to follow rules where they are wilfully and dangerously breaching,” he said.A new digital fines system means it is quicker for police officers to issue fines on the spot. Since its launch last month, the Met Police said that more people have been reported for fines than in the rest of the year combined.“I hope it is not necessary for this particular trend to carry on but if people continue to break the rules, putting themselves, their families and their communities at greater risk, our officers are ready to act robustly,” added DAC Twist.The Police Federation of England and Wales also called on the public to do their part to keep each other safe as the new lockdown measures come into force amid a marked surge in infections, largely down to a new highly transmissible variant of coronavirus.“With the new variant of the Covid -19 virus spreading so quickly it comes as no surprise that a new lockdown has been put in place. More people are contracting the virus and more are dying from it. Our hospitals are struggling to cope: these are tough times,” said John Apter, the National Chair of the Police Federation.“It’s essential that people heed the new rules and stay at home unless absolutely necessary,” he said.The warnings come as a woman who threw a New Year’s Eve party in west London for more than 100 people was reported to the Met Police for a maximum fine of GBP 10,000, called a fixed penalty notice.“The organiser, and those who attended, deliberately breached the restrictions and decided that the rules did not apply to them. We will continue to take tough action against those who think they are above the law and put others in danger with this sort of reckless behaviour,” said Acting Inspector Ganesh Rasaratnam, from the Met Police’s Central West Basic Command Unit.“The large majority have behaved admirably and should be proud of themselves for helping play their part as we all fight this health crisis,” he said.According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), it is thought one in 50 people in private households in England had the virus last week – rising to one in 30 in London.At a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had “no choice” but to impose the new lockdown, with the number of patients in hospitals 40 per cent higher than in the first peak of the pandemic last year.Under the measures akin to the first lockdown in March 2020, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, exercise outdoors will be allowed only once a day, and all restaurants and outdoor sports venues must close.Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said new daily vaccination figures for the UK – which will be released for the first time from next Monday – will show there has been a “significant increase” in the number of people who have received the jabs.The government has set the target to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care workers by mid-February – around 13 million people – as the key route out of the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-police-to-get-stricter-with-fines-for-covid-19-lockdown-breaches/story-GZN2qWFwZPQ6xPJ0GpNg0I.html
06-01-2021||World||UK leader to use ‘every second’ to vaccinate the vulnerable against Covid-19||U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged that his government would use “every available second” to shield the elderly and the vulnerable from the virus rampaging across Britain as he told Parliament on Wednesday why the country needed to return to a Covid-19 lockdown.Lawmakers, who were recalled from their Christmas recess early to discuss the measures, are expected to approve the new rules because there is a wide consensus on the need for tougher restrictions to control soaring new infections.“There’s a fundamental difference between the regulations before the House today and the position we faced at any previous stage, because we now have the vaccines that are our means of escape,’‘ Johnson said. “And we will use every available second of the lockdown to place this invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable.”The U.K. is in a maelstrom of rising Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Britain reported more than 60,000 new daily coronavirus cases for the first time on Tuesday. More than 391,000 people have tested positive in the past seven days, up 44% from the previous week.Rising infections are also putting an unprecedented strain on the nation’s healthcare system. Hospitals in England are currently treating over 26,000 coronavirus patients, 40% more than during the first peak of the pandemic last April.When he announced the stay-at-home order on Monday, Johnson said it wouldn’t lifted before mid-February. By that time, the government hopes to have given one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine to about 13 million people who are most at risk, potentially allowing some relaxation of the restrictions.“After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them, and every needle in every arm makes a difference,’‘ Johnson told the House of Commons on Wednesday.The session came amid anger over the chaos in the government’s education strategy during the pandemic.As part of the latest lockdown, Johnson ordered schools across England to close, backtracking on the government’s pledge to keep them open. Some lawmakers are seeking assurances that schools will reopen in mid-February.“It’s been a huge shambles,” Robert Halfon, chairman of the House of Commons’ education committee, told the BBC. “This has got to stop. The government has got to offer consistency, a consistent policy that doesn’t change every couple of days.”Johnson ordered the national lockdown in England after public health officials warned that the rising infection rates threatened to overwhelm the National Health Service. On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics estimated that 2% of people in England were infected with Covid-19 in the week ending on Jan. 2.The government is ramping up its mass vaccination program after regulators authorized a second vaccine. The U.K. is using both the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and one made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Both require two shots, but British authorities have made a decision to delay the second shot — shifting it from 21 days after the first to up to 12 weeks later — in order to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. That decision is being hotly debated by governments and scientists around the world.As of Monday, the NHS had vaccinated 1.3 million people across the U.K. The government plans to have almost 1,000 vaccination centers operating across the country by the end of this week, Johnson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-leader-to-use-every-second-to-vaccinate-the-vulnerable-against-covid-19/story-2fUcvvIj5qmackdAk33NCI.html

06-01-2021||World||Netherlands play catch-up in Europe’s patchy Covid-19 vaccine drive||A nurse received the first Covid-19 shot in the Netherlands on Wednesday, kicking off one of Europe’s last vaccination programmes for the coronavirus as the European medicines regulator considered approving a second vaccine.Approval of the Moderna vaccine would be a big boost for Europe’s hopes of curbing a disease that has infected over 85 million people globally and killed nearly 1.9 million since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. Europe began its vaccination drive on December 27 but it has had an uneven start as cases continue to surge across the continent and worldwide, with the World Bank warning that rising infections and delays in vaccine distribution could limit the global economic recovery to just 1.6% this year.Authorities are also scrambling to contain two more infectious variants of the virus detected in South Africa and Britain which have driven a surge in cases.The Dutch government has faced a public outcry after being left behind in the race to defeat the viral pandemic, and finally launched its vaccination drive on Wednesday morning.DuSanna Elkadiri, a 39-year-old nurse who looks after dementia patients at a care home in the south of the country, received a shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.“This is the beginning of the end of this crisis,” Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said at a brief ceremony.Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine used by the Netherlands had received regulatory approval sooner than expected and that his government had expected a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca to be approved first, reducing the Dutch authorities’ flexibility.So far, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is the only one approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) though Moderna’s vaccine -- which is easier to store and transport -- is expected to become the second to win its endorsement later on Wednesday.The roll-out has been a test for Brussels’ ability to unify Europe amid political pressure to speed up the process.Some EU member states were frustrated at the length of time the EMA took to decide on the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, leaving it lagging the United States, Britain, Israel and Switzerland in approving and administering the first vaccines.The regulator has given a conditional marketing approval, rather than the ultra-fast emergency use approval issued by Britain, which it says requires more detailed study of the data.The two-dose Moderna vaccine has already been rolled out in the United States and Canada, and Israel this week become the first country outside North America to grant authorisation. It was about 95% effecive at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues.GOVERNMENTS UNDER FIREChina’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd has also developed a Covid-19 vaccine, but Beijing is still taking aggressive measures to prevent another wave of the disease that has killed 4,634 people in China.Chinese authorities on Wednesday imposed travel restrictions and banned gatherings in the capital city of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Beijing has sought to reshape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began, with top officials highlighting studies they say show the disease emerged in multiple regions. It has also rejected accusations of wrongdoing or mishandling of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. The head of the World Health Organization on Tuesday said he was “very disappointed” that China still had not authorised a team of international experts tasked with examining the origins of the novel coronavirus into the country. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the two sides were still in talks about dates and arrangements for the visit. “There’s no need to over-interpret this,” she said.Rolling out a vaccine quickly has not prevented other governments facing public criticism over their handling of the pandemic.Although Britain was the first country to approve and start rolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has been accused by political opponents of indecision after England began a new lockdown this week.The British parliament was recalled early to vote on the new lockdown measures on Wednesday. The French government has faced criticism after the national inoculation campaign got off to a slow start, hampered in part by red tape and President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to tread warily in one of the world’s most vaccine-sceptical countries.France is now stepping up its Covid-19 vaccine rollout and a third national lockdown should not be ruled out, Eric Caumes, head of infectious diseases expert at Paris’ Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, told BFM TV.Germany has decided to extend a nationwide lockdown until the end of this month and introduce tougher restrictions to try to curb the spread of the virus.But Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said he believed Europe’s biggest economy could hold out for a long time, adding that heexpected lower levels of government debt than after thefinancial crisis of 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-play-catch-up-in-europe-s-patchy-covid-19-vaccine-drive/story-AIUNohawMGebrsWr6NQXpO.html
06-01-2021||World||Germany urges patience with Covid vaccine rollout under fire||Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government pleaded for patience as it pushed back against criticism that Germany bungled the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine.A shortage of doses at the start of the campaign was expected and stems from production bottlenecks rather than insufficient procurement, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Wednesday in Berlin.“We have to ask large parts of the population for patience,” Spahn said. “We’ve ordered enough, more than enough vaccines.”Like other European Union countries, Germany started its program with a shot jointly developed with Mainz-based BioNTech SE on December 27. The shortage will be eased by additional production capacity, including the start of a facility in Marburg in February that will lead to a “massive” gain in output, he said.A similar vaccine from US biotech Moderna Inc., which won backing from the European Medicines Agency on Wednesday, could further ease supplies. Distribution of the shot could start as soon as next week, Spahn said. The EU has locked up as many as 160 million doses, with Germany to get more than 50 million.A day after Merkel tightened and extended lockdown measures, she gathered top cabinet ministers in an effort to quell tensions within her government over claims the rollout has been too slow.Senior members of her Social Democrat partners, including Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, questioned Merkel’s strategy of ceding responsibility for procuring vaccines to the European Union. With a national election slated for September, the tension threatens to inject party politics into the country’s pandemic fight.At an ill-tempered meeting on Tuesday, Merkel and state leaders agreed to controversial limits on movement, sharpened restrictions on private gatherings and prolonged hard lockdown measures until at least Jan. 31. She also defended the vaccination strategy, saying more supply is coming soon.“In the second quarter, based on all that we know from the manufacturers, we will already have significantly more vaccine doses,” Merkel said Tuesday in Berlin. The EU has ordered “significantly more vaccine than is necessary” to inoculate everyone in the bloc.Underscoring the pressure facing Merkel’s government, Germany on Wednesday registered more than 1,000 Covid-related deaths for only the second time since the pandemic began. Contagion rates remain more than double a government target despite weeks of strict curbs.Scholz, the SPD’s chancellor candidate who attended the meeting, denied that his criticism was a campaign ploy.“This is about a very serious issue, whether we can properly protect the citizens of this country,” Scholz said in an interview with ARD television on Wednesday. “The most important thing, not just for today but in the future, is that we do everything to make sure as much vaccine as possible is made in Germany and Europe.”After a relatively mild outbreak in the spring, infections in Germany have doubled since the end of November to more than 1.8 million and deaths have surged above 36,000.Scholz said Germany, which is supporting businesses affected by the lockdown, has the financial resources to weather the crisis “for a long time.”Thanks to years of prudent budget policy, Germany’s debt as a percentage of gross domestic product won’t rise much above 70% and will quickly shrink again once the pandemic has receded, he told ARD.With hospitals filling up and concerns about a spike from the holidays still coming, authorities are worried about the pace of inoculations. But Germany is ahead of most other European countries.According to the latest data from the RKI public health institute, over 367,000 people have been immunized in Germany through 11 a.m. on Wednesday, about 0.4% of the population. That compares with around 1.5% in the US and nearly 2% in Britain, which both began vaccinating several weeks earlier, and about 0.3% in Italy.Spahn, a leading figure in Merkel’s Christian Democrats, has said he is hopeful everyone who wants a shot in Germany can get one by the summer.“If you look at some of our neighbors in the European Union, then the structures we’ve put in place are working pretty well,” he said. “I’m not saying everything is perfect, I’m not saying there isn’t room for improvement, but all in all it’s working well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-urges-patience-with-covid-vaccine-rollout-under-fire/story-OXQvr5ryljvEtJQwMRQsGJ.html
06-01-2021||World||EU calls for ‘immediate release’ of Hong Kong activists||The European Union called for the immediate release Wednesday of the 53 former lawmakers and pro-democracy activists who have been arrested in Hong Kong after being accused of violating a new security law.The mass arrests, including of former lawmakers, were the largest crackdown on Hong Kong’s democracy movement since the law was imposed by China last June to quell dissent in the semi-autonomous territory.EU spokesman Peter Stano told a press conference that the arrests send the “signal that political pluralism is no longer tolerated in Hong Kong.” He added that the security law is being used “to crush dissent and stifle the exercise of human rights and political freedoms.”Stano did not exclude the possibility of sanctions against China, saying that EU authorities and member nations are currently “thinking about the best measures to take to react.”Stano said the issue could be discussed during a meeting of the bloc’s foreign affairs ministers later this month but insisted unanimity among EU nations will be required to green light sanctions.The crackdown in Hong Kong took place only days after the European Union sealed a business investment deal with China despite concerns about the human rights situation in the country. EU Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer separated the two topics, saying the EU is working with China “in a different way, in different areas.”China is the bloc’s second-biggest trading partner behind the United States, and the EU is China’s biggest trading partner. China and Europe trade on average over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) a day.“Of course we have a separate line of dialogue with China on the rule of law and democracy,” Mamer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-calls-for-immediate-release-of-hong-kong-activists/story-ckPhX87GQqO9sDXBBzU1SO.html
06-01-2021||World||British judge rejects bail for WikiLeaks’ imprisoned Julian Assange||A British court on Wednesday refused a bail application moved by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, two days after an extradition request by the US government was blocked on grounds of his mental health and risk of suicide.Assange, 49, has been held in the Belmarsh prison in south-east London for the past 18 months after he was evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy, where he sought asylum for seven years. His earlier bail applications were also refused.His legal team moved another application after the extradition was blocked on Monday. US authorities have indicated that they would appeal against the extradition ruling. He is wanted in the US to face charges of espionage, hacking and leaking classified documents.Judge Vanessa Baraitser of the Westminster Magistrates Court ruled that “there are substantial grounds for believing that if Mr Assange is released today, he would fail to surrender to court and face the appeal proceedings,” as his supporters gathered in rain outside the court.Assange’s lawyers emphasised that he has new family ties in the UK with two children he had fathered with his partner, Stella Moris, and that he would be bailed to the couple’s home address. But the judge did not accept the arguments.Assange has been detained at London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison since April 2019, when he was arrested for skipping bail during a separate legal battle seven years earlier.Clair Dobbin, a British lawyer acting for the US, said Assange had shown he would go “to almost any length” to avoid extradition, and it was likely he would flee if granted bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-judge-rejects-bail-for-wikileaks-imprisoned-julian-assange/story-8gPkMBm3xNiexKatj9lyYL.html
06-01-2021||World||EU agency approves Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union’s medicines agency gave the green light Wednesday to Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine, a decision that gives the 27-nation bloc a second vaccine to use in the desperate battle to tame the virus rampaging across the continent.The approval recommendation by the European Medicines Agency’s human medicines committee -- which must be rubber stamped by the EU’s executive commission -- comes amid high rates of infections in many EU countries and strong criticism of the slow pace of vaccinations across the region of some 450 million people.“This vaccine provides us with another tool to overcome the current emergency,” said Emer Cooke, Executive Director of EMA. “It is a testament to the efforts and commitment of all involved that we have this second positive vaccine recommendation just short of a year since the pandemic was declared by WHO.”European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the approval and added in a tweet: “Now we are working at full speed to approve it & make it available in the EU.”The EMA has already approved a coronavirus vaccine made by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. Both vaccines require giving people two shots.Ahead of the meeting on the Moderna vaccine, the agency said in a tweet that its experts were “working hard to clarify all outstanding issues with the company.” It did not elaborate on what those issues were. Moderna also declined to comment.German Health Minister Jens Spahn — who has in the past been critical of the slow pace of the EMA — said he expected the Moderna vaccine to begin rolling out to EU nations next week. Germany would get 2 million doses in the first quarter and 50 million in all of 2021, Spahn told reporters in Berlin.“The problem is the shortage of production capacity with global demand,” he said.Early results of large, still unfinished studies show both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines appear safe and strongly protective, although Moderna’s is easier to handle since it doesn’t need to be stored at ultra-frozen temperatures.The United States, Canada and Israel have already approved use of the Moderna vaccine. The US gave it the green light for emergency use in people over 18 years on Dec. 18, followed by Canada five days later with an interim authorization also for people over 18. Israel authorized the vaccine on Monday.Moderna said Monday that it is increasing its estimate for global vaccine production in 2021 from 500 to 600 million doses. The company said it is “continuing to invest and add staff to build up to potentially 1 billion doses for 2021.”Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don’t contain any coronavirus – meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.The EU officially began giving out Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination shots on Dec. 27, but the speed of each nation’s inoculation program has varied widely. France vaccinated around 500 people in the first week, while Germany vaccinated 200,000. The Dutch were only beginning to give out vaccine shots Wednesday, the last EU nation to start doing so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-approves-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-wS7QEW3XuxOGhIC5VseXHL.html
06-01-2021||World||European drugs authority meets again over Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||The European Medicines Authority (EMA) was meeting on Wednesday to decide on whether to approve Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine after failing to reach a decision earlier this week.“The meeting of EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) to discuss Covid-19 vaccine Moderna has started,” the regulator said in a tweet.The CHMP called an unscheduled meeting on Monday to discuss Moderna’s vaccine but failed to reach a conclusion. The medicines authority did not specify at the time why it could not approve the vaccine, but on Tuesday said its experts were “working hard to clarify outstanding issues with the company”.The Dutch national medicines authority told Reuters it was preparing for both a positive decision on Wednesday and for a scenario in which a conclusion still could not be reached.The EMA has set a Jan. 12 deadline for whether to recommend Moderna’s vaccine. It recommended a Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech on Dec. 21.A positive decision would mark the second regulatory authorisation for Moderna’s vaccine after the United States and further validation of its messenger RNA technology, just over a year since the first outbreak of the virus was identified in Wuhan, China.It was about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues.Since its rollout in the European Union began a week ago, hundreds of thousands of Europeans have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than a million shots have been distributed in Britain in just under a month, and the uneven start of the campaign has led to criticism of health authorities in Germany and France, among others.The Netherlands on Wednesday start vaccinations, giving its first injection to a 39-year old care home nurse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-drugs-authority-meets-again-over-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-WJpS2anH88LbNwbFTqbIMJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Explainer: Hong Kong mass arrests chill democracy movement||The sudden arrest of dozens of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, in the most sweeping use of a new national security law to date, is a clear sign of Beijing’s determination to rein in political opposition in the former British colony.The Wednesday morning roundup, widely condemned by Western government officials and human rights groups, will likely further chill an already dwindling protest movement in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.What happened?Police detained about 50 people, far more than in previous cases under the 6-month-old national security law. Those targeted appeared to include all candidates who had run in an unofficial opposition primary last year ahead of an expected election for Hong Kong’s legislature. City leader Carrie Lam later scrapped the election, citing the coronavirus pandemic. Activists called her move a thinly veiled attempt to thwart expected opposition gains.How can a primary be a threat to national security?Security Secretary John Lee said those arrested were suspected of trying to gain control of the legislature to paralyze government business. The subversion section of the national security law criminalizes “seriously interfering in, disrupting, or undermining the performance of duties and functions” of the Chinese or Hong Kong governments.Lam said at the time of the primary that if its purpose was to resist every government initiative, it could amount to subverting state power. The central government labelled the primary illegal and a “serious provocation” to Hong Kong’s electoral system.What’s the likely impact?The arrests will remove more activists from the scene, reducing the possibility of renewed protests and eliminating many as future candidates for office. They warn a younger generation that formed the backbone of protests in 2014 and 2019 that even holding an unofficial primary can result in legal action that can seriously impact their futures.Human Rights Watch said of the move that repression generates resistance, but the tightening restrictions on opposition activity and the lingering effects of the coronavirus on public life and the economy could delay or permanently discourage the emergence of a new generation willing to take on Beijing.Why now?Beijing has been unrelenting in its efforts to prevent any repeat of the 2019 protests, which grew increasingly violent in response to the government’s refusal to entertain the protesters’ demands. They plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.China is also determined to drive out what it sees as unwarranted foreign government interference in its domestic affairs. The nation’s newfound military, economic and political clout is emboldening it to take on the West, and it can take advantage of distractions resulting from pandemic and political disruptions in the US and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-hong-kong-mass-arrests-chill-democracy-movement/story-ZMScixul7PwQvSj4Ice8gO.html
06-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Timeline of events that led to China blocking WHO’s team||The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday expressed dismay over China blocking the entry of an international team of scientists to investigate the origin of the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the UN health agency, told a news conference that two members had already left their home countries for Wuhan, the first epicentre of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, when they were informed that Chinese officials had not approved necessary permissions to enter the country.“I’m very disappointed with this news, given that two members have already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute,” said Ghebreyesus. “But I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials. And I have once again made it clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team,” he added.Here’s the timeline of events leading to China blocking WHO’s team:December 2019: The WHO picked up a media report about a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause emerging in China’s Wuhan.January 2020: The virus outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus and China shared its genetic sequence with the UN health agency. Preliminary studies suggested that the bats could be the source since the coronavirus present in bats has a genome that is 96 per cent identical to the novel coronavirus. However, there has not been any concrete evidence to corroborate it.The United States declared a public health emergency after the country reported its first few cases of the novel coronavirus. US President Donald Trump issued an executive order to block the entry of foreign nationals travelling from China.February: The Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named the virus SARS-CoV-2, noting that it was a variant of the coronavirus that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The WHO started referring to the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Covid-19 to avoid “unintended consequences in terms of creating unnecessary fear for some population.” The health agency also said that it followed the best practices in naming the disease to minimise “unnecessary negative effects on nations, economies and people.”Also Read | Impasse over WHO virus mission ‘not just a visa issue’ says ChinaMarch: The WHO declared Covid-19 as a pandemic, urging countries to take immediate and aggressive action. Trump launched a scathing attack on China and said the world is paying a “very big price” for covering-up the facts on coronavirus. Ignoring the appeal from the WHO, the US president kept calling Covid-19 as “China virus” or “Chinese virus”.April: The US, which was the biggest contributor to the WHO, threatened to withhold funds, accusing the UN body of being China-centric and giving “faulty recommendation”. Other top US officials, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, alleged that China delayed in sharing accurate information on the novel coronavirus. The US and Australia were one of the first countries to demand an independent inquiry into the origin of the coronavirus outbreak. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the call for an inquiry was reasonable not meant to target any country. Australia’s demand triggered a sharp response from China, leading to a decline in their bilateral relations.May: Australia’s major push for an investigation into the origin of the virus outbreak and the response of the WHO gained huge traction and the European Union drafted a resolution seeking an independent probe. The WHO chief welcomed the proposed resolution and said that such evaluation must encompass the entirety of the response by all actors, in good faith.Member states of the WHO adopted the resolution by consensus at the World Health Assembly (WHA) calling for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the global response to the virus outbreak and an inquiry into the actions of the WHO and “timelines pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic”. China voiced strong objection to the resolution, saying it was premature to launch a probe into the origin of Covid-19.Speaking at the largely virtual WHA, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that Beijing supports a comprehensive review of the global response to the pandemic, but only after Covid-19 is brought under control. He asserted that China has been open and transparent about the virus outbreak from the beginning and will support a probe if it is conducted in an “objective and impartial manner.”Also Read | Covid-19: WHO chief ‘disappointed’ at delayed access for China investigation teamJune: China punished Australia’s beef producers and barley farmers in apparent retaliation and asked Chinese students to reconsider studying in that country. After Australia’s exports were hit following its strong criticism of China’s handling of coronavirus, Morrison said that he would not cave to coercion by trading values. “We are an open trading nation, mate, but I’m never going to trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes,” the Australian prime minister told the radio station 2GB.July: China agreed to allow a team of experts led by the WHO to visit the country to trace the origin of Covid-19. “After consultation, the Chinese government has agreed that the World Health Organization will send a team of experts to Beijing to trace the origin of Covid-19,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijiantold told a press briefing.December: The WHO announced that a team of international experts, looking into the origins of the SARS-CoV-2, will travel to China in the first week of January. Dr Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at the UN agency, said that there will be quarantine arrangements for the team and they will later visit the suspected site of the virus outbreak in Wuhan. “The purpose of the mission is to go to the original point at which human cases were detected and that we fully expect to do that,” he said, adding that the team will not be supervised by Chinese officials.January 2021: China denied necessary permission to the team of scientists to enter the country. After the WHO chief publicly expressed disappointment in a rare rebuke to Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC that there might be “some misunderstanding” and “there’s no need to read too much into it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-timeline-of-events-that-led-to-china-blocking-who-s-team/story-2E38IOZRoEghQZFkNTDR8H.html
06-01-2021||World||Trump bars US transactions with 8 Chinese apps. Here are other such bans||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday passed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese applications, including Ant Group’s Alipay payment app, heightening the conflict between the United States and China. The new order is among the list of bans imposed by the US president during recent times. The ban comes as the transition date of President-elect Joe Biden nears.Also Read | China asks US to stop interfering with Hong-Kong related issuesThe US-China tensions have caused large scale confusions in the financial markets too as the New York Stock Exchange took a U-turn on Monday and reversed its order of delisting three Chinese telecom majors.Here is the list of Chinese companies banned by the Trump administration recently:1. The Trump administration passed an executive order on Tuesday to control what it said was Chinese pervasiveness in the US for the protection of national security by banning Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, and WPS Office. The order that asserted the ban on the use of apps that help the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gain access to personal information of Americans and federal employees is set to be effective after 45 days.2. In another executive order dated November 12, 2020, the Trump administration prohibited dealing in publicly traded securities of companies linked with Chinese communist military. Following the order, the New York Stock Exchange earlier this week moved to delist China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom from January 11. The move to delist the three telecom majors was later reversed abruptly due to the ambiguity in the order, reported Reuters. However, as of today, the bourse is reportedly mulling to take a second U-turn and de-list the companies, according to a Reuters report. After the earlier order, there were also reports about Chinese oil majors to be the next in line to be removed from the bourse.Also Read | NYSE may make second U-turn on China telecom delistings amid confusion over policy3. China’s top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and drone producer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd were also blacklisted by the Department of Commerce last year. The order dating December 18, 2020, said, “We will not allow advanced U.S. technology to help build the military of an increasingly belligerent adversary.” Sixty other entities were also deemed by the department as working contrary to the national security and foreign policy of the US.4. The Commerce Department also banned transactions related with China’s TikTok and WeChat in September, following an executive order dated August 6,2020 banning TikTok in an attempt to safeguard national security. The order was also followed by a federal judge blocking the ban of the ByteDance’s short-form video app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-bars-us-transactions-with-8-chinese-apps-here-are-other-such-bans/story-0o7rahvSug7XNkUSwOp9QM.html
06-01-2021||World||Afghanistan busted Chinese spy ring, kept it a secret. NDS chief explains why||Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security which had busted a Chinese spy ring last month but kept the case a closely-guarded secret has, for the first time, confirmed that the security agency did detain Chinese nationals for espionage. As first reported by Hindustan Times, the NDS had detained 10 Chinese nationals for espionage. At least 2 of the 10 spies were learnt to have been in touch with the Haqqani Network, the terrorist group backed by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence that is blamed for many bloody attacks and doubles as the sword arm of the Taliban.The NDS had initially declined comment on the detentions to the media in Afghanistan.The official confirmation about the Chinese spy ring came on Tuesday after members of Wolesi Jirga, the Afghan House of Representatives, demanded answers on the Hindustan Times report from the National Directorate of Security boss Ahmad Zia Saraj.Ahmad Zia Saraj confirmed that a group of Chinese nationals had been arrested on charges of espionage in Kabul, according to Afghanistan private news channel Ariana News. But he declined to give any more details.“Yes, a group of Chinese has been arrested but due to it being a sensitive issue, I cannot share details,” the NDS chief told the lawmakers, according to the news channel.The official confirmation, however, comes after Afghanistan came under pressure from President Xi Jinping’s government in Beijing and allowed the 10 Chinese nationals to leave the country. The 10 were flown out of Afghanistan on Saturday in a special aircraft arranged by the Chinese authorities.Diplomats and security officials in Afghanistan believe that the 10 were linked to the Chinese intelligence agency, Ministry of State Security.President Ashraf Ghani was briefed about the detentions right in the beginning in view of the sensitivities involved. First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, a former NDS chief who is credited with rebuilding the intelligence agency, was tasked to oversee the investigation and engage the Chinese.Amrullah Saleh, who met the Chinese envoy to Kabul, Wang Yu, in this context, had initially conditioned their release on an official apology from Beijing.The terms of the arrangement between the two countries are not known.A diplomat in Kabul said President Ashraf Ghani may have been keen to wrap up the case as soon as possible, before it lands in a position where Beijing’s adversaries such as the US use the case to fire at China from his shoulders.Also Read: How a suspected Chinese spy targeted California politicians for 5 yearsThere was a view within the Afghan government that the 10-member Chinese module may have been attempting to create a fake East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) module in Afghanistan to entrap ETIM operatives in Afghanistan.ETIM is a small Islamic separatist group alleged to be active in Xinjiang province, home to China’s ethnic minority Uighur Muslims. The United States last month revoked the terror tag slapped on ETIM although the group continues to be designated by the UN Security Council. Rights groups say China uses the ETIM threat as an excuse to impose restrictions on Uyghurs and discredit human rights activists outside China.Chinese officials, however, suggest that Beijing was concerned that Afghanistan, which shares borders with the volatile Xinjiang province, could become a breeding ground for Uyghur Muslim militants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-intel-chief-confirms-busting-chinese-spy-ring-says-it-s-sensitive/story-iFqT1qRYtfytMlkEN7ATxN.html
06-01-2021||World||London court denies bail to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was denied bail on Wednesday because a judge said there is a risk he may abscond while the United States tries to secure his extradition from Britain.Assange has spent more than eight years either holed up in the London’s Ecuadorean embassy or in jail.But Assange on Monday won an attempt to stop his extradition to the United States to face 18 criminal charges of breaking an espionage law and conspiring to hack government computers. He had then asked to be bailed.“I am satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that if Mr Assange is released today he would fail to surrender to court to face the appeal proceedings,” Judge Vanessa Baraitser said.The U.S. Department of Justice says it will continue to seek Assange’s extradition.“As far as Mr Assange is concerned this case has not yet been won... the outcome of this appeal is not yet known,” Baraitser said.Admirers hail Australian-born Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuses of power by the United States. But detractors cast him as a dangerous figure who has undermined the security of the West, and dispute that he is a journalist.WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-court-denies-bail-to-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/story-rbZoxa3KXThVOM9XrNO8sL.html

It was also decided in December that health workers fighting on the frontline and people over 65 years of age would be vaccinated in the first phase.Meanwhile, with 52 more people succumbing to the viral infection in the last 24 hours, the Covid-19 death toll reached 10,461 in the country, while the number of total cases touched 492,594 after 2,118 new infections were reported in the last one day, according to the health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-relaxes-rules-to-purchase-covid-19-vaccine-on-emergency-basis/story-0WelMVrAfUVbOqqcxN5LQL.html
06-01-2021||World||Trump claims voter fraud in Georgia Senate runoffs, Republican candidate calls for ‘transparency’||After multiple failed attempts to overturn the US presidential election results, President Donald Trump has now started suggesting voter fraud in Georgia Senate runoffs, which will decide the fate of president-elect Joe Biden’s agenda. In a series of tweets, Trump claimed that the officials are “setting up” a “voter dump” against Republican candidates to get ahead in the final round of counting.“Just happened to have found another 4000 ballots from Fulton County. Here we go!” tweeted the outgoing US president, which was immediately flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”.Trump also amplified White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s misleading claim and implicit suggestion of electoral fraud. McEnancy asked why had the election officials stopped the vote count in Chatham County, a Democratic stronghold. “Why are they stopping the vote count in Democrat Chatham county, Georgia? This sounds familiar!” tweeted McEnancy, which was retweeted by the US president and duly flagged by Twitter.According to a CNN report, the counting of votes in Chatham County wasn’t just stopped for the night, rather the officials have counted everything they had. Gabriel Sterling, the voting systems implementation manager, told the US media network that they are left with the absentee ballots that came in on Tuesday via mail and dropbox, adding that such ballots are coming from largely Democratic counties.Also Read | Democrats win one Georgia runoff election, poised to pick the secondMeanwhile, Democrat Raphael Warnock has won one of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs and all eyes are now on the contest between incumbent Republican David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. Amid unsubstantiated voter fraud claims by the US president, Perdue’s campaign has called for “time and transparency to be certain the results are fair and accurate.” “We will mobilize every available resource and exhaust every legal recourse to ensure all legally cast ballots are properly counted. We believe in the end, Senator Perdue will be victorious,” Perdue’s campaign said in a statement early Wednesday.The final outcome of Georgia Senate runoffs is also set to coincide with the certification of the electoral college and Biden’s victory by the US Congress. In a fresh attempt to thwart the Electoral College vote, Trump has publicly urged vice president Mike Pence to steal the election for him. Taking to Twitter, Trump said that many states want to “decertify the mistake”, suggesting that Pence can send back the certificate to respective state legislatures.“If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!” he tweeted. If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency.

06-01-2021||World||Ukraine firm applies to make Russian vaccine, sparks political dilemma||A Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by a prominent Russian-leaning opposition figure has applied for state approval to make Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine, a sensitive move given toxic relations between Kyiv and Moscow.The two countries have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.Ukraine’s government has played down the prospects of approving the Sputnik V vaccine quickly, if at all. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the vaccine “a hybrid weapon of Russia against Ukraine” in an interview with The Day newspaper.Ukrainian pharmaceutical firm Biolik said in a statement on its website it had applied to register Gam-COVID-Vac, also known as Sputnik V, in Ukraine. Russia on Saturday floated the idea of holding clinical trials in Ukraine.Biolik’s application has been promoted by the Ukrainian opposition politician Viktor Medvedchuk, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Ukraine’s health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Deputy Health Minister Viktor Lyashko was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Ukraine would only use vaccines that had finished clinical trials. Sputnik V is still undergoing Phase III trials.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the New York Times last month that the vaccine would be used in Russia’s “information war” against Ukraine.But he was also quoted as saying “...it is impossible to explain to Ukrainian society why not take the vaccine from Russia if America and Europe do not give you the vaccine. It is impossible to explain that to anyone who dies.”Zelenskiy’s government is looking to secure Covid-19 vaccines from China and the global COVAX scheme for poorer nations to fight the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukraine-firm-applies-to-make-russian-vaccine-sparks-political-dilemma/story-oubgWvaYgG4cyDTlXgvhxL.html
06-01-2021||World||Russia, Syria clash with US over chemical weapons sanctions in UNSC||Syria and close ally Russia clashed with the US and other nations Tuesday over a Western initiative to suspend Syria’s voting rights in the global chemical weapons watchdog for failing to provide details of three chemical attacks in 2017 that investigators blamed on President Bashar Assad’s government.The confrontation in the UN Security Council foreshadowed a showdown when the 193 member states of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons meet in The Hague, Netherlands, in April to consider a French-drafted measure, on behalf of 46 countries, to suspend Syria’s “rights and privileges” in the body.The French proposal was a response to Syria’s failure to meet a 90-day deadline set in July by the OPCW’s executive council for Damascus to declare the nerve agent sarin and chlorine, which OPCW investigators said last April were dropped by the Syrian air force on the central town of Latamneh in late March 2017.The Western effort reflects a much broader effort to obtain accountability for Syrian chemical attacks and highlight claims that Assad’s government is secretly continuing its chemical weapons program.Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in September 2013, pressed by Russia after a deadly chemical weapons attack that the West blamed on Damascus.By August 2014, the Assad government declared that the destruction of its chemical weapons was completed. But Syria’s initial declaration of its chemical stockpiles and chemical weapons production sites has remained in dispute.Ireland’s UN ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason, a new council member, said it was “deeply disturbing” that the OPCW still cannot determine whether the initial declaration was accurate or complete because of gaps and inconsistencies. She said the problems are not “minor” as some would portray, alluding to Russia.“Over those seven years, the number of issues that need to be addressed has expanded from five to 19,” Byrne Nason said. “There have been 17 amendments to Syria’s declaration including the addition of a production facility, four research and development centers, and doubling of the amount of declared agents and chemicals.”In addition, she said, there are issues related to “hundreds of tons of missing agents and munitions reported destroyed” before Syria joined the chemical convention as well as recent reports of a production facility that Damascus declared as never having been used, “where there is clear evidence to the contrary.”Norwegian Ambassador Mona Juul, another new council member, also expressed concern at Syria’s failure to explain an unnamed chemical that can be used in chemical weapons but also has non-weapons uses. It was detected at the Barzah facilities of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center.Russia’s deputy UN ambassador, Dmitry Polyansky, again accused OPCW investigators of being “unscrupulous” and alleged they used “forgeries” and “manipulations” to blame Syria.He called the chemical watchdog “seriously ill with politicization.” And he accused a number of unnamed countries of “playing this `chemical card’ to step up pressure on the Syrian government that they failed to overthrow in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring.”As for the initial Syrian declaration, Polyansky said Damascus was not “an extraordinary case,” pointing to amended declarations by Western countries including France and Germany as well as Libya. He accused Western delegations of trying to “inflate agitation” around Syria.French Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere expressed regret at “the false accusations of those who seek to discredit OPCW” and its findings about Syria’s attacks.“There is simply the reality of the facts,” he said. “We all know them: the regime used weapons of war prohibited by international law against its own population, and since then we have seem chemical weapons re-emerge and become commonplace in Syria and elsewhere.”British Ambassador Barbara Woodward said OPCW investigators, alone and initially with a UN team, determined Syria used chemical weapons on at least six occasions.“These are not hypothetical issues for the thousands of Syrian civilians who have suffered the horrifying effects on the body of nerve agents and chlorine,” she said.Syria’s deputy foreign minister and former UN ambassador, Bashar Ja’afari, accused some unnamed Western nations of using the OPCW “as a platform to fabricate allegations and then justify an assault and aggression on Syria.”The aim, he said, is “to frame the Syrian government for the use of chemical weapons and exonerate the terrorists and the sponsors ... and give them the necessary means to escape through the occupied Golan area through Israel to the capitals of Western states where they can live.”Russia’s Polyansky said Syria could not meet the OPCW’s anti-Syria demands on Latamneh because it “simply doesn’t have” the chemical weapons and facilities the organization is seeking.“Hopefully, the majority of delegations at the member states’ conference in April will reject this provocation, and the West-initiated decision, which is `punitive’ by nature, will not pass,” he said.US deputy ambassador Richard Mills said neither the Security Council nor the world “is fooled” by Russia’s accelerated campaign to discredit the OPCW.He urged council members to call on all countries to support the French draft against Syria in April “aimed at promoting accountability for the Assad regime’s actions.”“It is time that the Syrian people, and indeed all the globe’s people, be allowed to live in a world free of the threat of chemical weapons,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-syria-clash-with-us-over-chemical-weapons-sanctions-in-unsc/story-S9wuDtuF4LzyAHFEIiEAkP.html
06-01-2021||World||NYSE may make second U-turn on China telecom delistings amid confusion over policy||The New York Stock Exchange is reconsidering its plan to allow three Chinese telecom giants to remain listed, the latest twist to a saga amid confusion over rules set by the Trump administration and tension within Washington on China policy.If it does so, it would mark a second sudden U-turn. The bourse said late Monday it reversed a decision announced just last week to delist China Mobile Ltd, China Telecom Corp Ltd and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd after consulting with regulatory authorities in connection with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.The about-face was due to ambiguity over an executive order issued by President Donald Trump barring investment in firms Washington says are tied to the Chinese military, and whether the three firms were banned under the order, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.However, it will go ahead with the delistings, which were planned on or before Jan. 11, if it deems the companies are subject to the order, said the person who asked to remain anonymous because the discussions are ongoing.Bloomberg earlier reported that the NYSE may flip back. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin phoned New York Stock Exchange President Stacey Cunningham on Tuesday to tell her he disagreed with the exchange operator’s decision to reverse course on the delistings, a separate source said.Coming in the final days of the Trump presidency, the back and forth at the NYSE underscored the lack of clarity about, and the tensions around, the implementation and implications of the administration’s ban on investment in 35 Chinese companies. One China expert who has worked with Congress on delisting issues said the NYSE may have made the U-turn if they sought clarity from Treasury about the rules and been told they did not need to delist. Republican Senator, and China hardliner, Marco Rubio expressed outrage that the U.S. Treasury may have caused the NYSE to wind back the delisting procedures. “If it is true that someone at (Treasury) advised (NYSE) to reverse the decision to delist these Chinese companies, it was a outrageous effort to undermine (President Trump’s) Executive Order,” he tweeted.The Treasury declined comment on the NYSE decision. OFAC, which is responsible for enforcing sanctions, declined comment. The NYSE is owned by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), which is run by billionaire Jeffrey Sprecher, whose wife Kelly Loeffler, also a former ICE executive, is one of two Republican senators facing run-off elections on Tuesday in Georgia. Loeffler is a staunch supporter of President Trump.NEW GUARD The flip-flopping at the Big Board also sowed confusion among investors.Tariq Dennison, managing director at GFM Asset Management in Hong Kong, said he had almost completely unwound his positions in China Mobile shares in both Hong Kong and New York, partly in anticipation of needing to find investments for U.S. clients with less exposure to risks associated with the investment ban.The are also questions about how the order will be handled by President-elect Joe Biden who is set to take office on Jan. 20 and could revoke it easily. His transition team has not commented on plans for the directive. William Kirby, a Harvard Business School professor focused on China, said on Monday that whereas the Trump administration has taken a “one-size-fits-all” approach to its regulation of Chinese companies, the Biden administration would likely have company-by-company reviews. Miller said that while the last year had seen toughening policies on investment flows into Chinese companies, “many of these rules are likely to fall by the wayside.”FLIP-FLOP The executive order banning U.S. investors from buying shares of companies Washington alleges are owned or controlled by the Chinese military takes effect on Jan. 11, although shareholders can wait until November 2021 to divest.While the directive stops short of forcing a delisting, a separate bill signed into law by Trump in November will kick Chinese companies off U.S. bourses if they do not fully comply with the country’s auditing rules in three years.S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Wednesday it would no longer remove the three firms’ ADRs, which had been due to be deleted before Jan.7, from its benchmarks after the NYSE’s latest decision.Other index makers including FTSE Russell and MSCI Inc have cut a dozen Chinese companies on the list from their benchmarks, but have not removed the three telecom firms, all of which have major passive U.S. funds amongst their top shareholders.The three telecom firms said in statements that they had taken note of the NYSE’s latest announcement and would release information in accordance with regulations, adding that investors should pay attention to investment risks.Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing on Wednesday that some political forces in the United States were continuing with an unreasonable suppression of U.S.-listed foreign firms, which she said highlighted the arbitrary nature of its policies.“We hope the U.S. respects the legal system and the market,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyse-may-make-second-u-turn-on-china-telecom-delistings-amid-confusion-over-policy/story-OJBtOoG7ZLpjUxV9hvtTfI.html

06-01-2021||World||China says it will respond to planned Taiwan, US defence talks||China said on Wednesday it would make a “necessary response” to a planned military dialogue between the United States and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, saying it firmly opposed the event.China has been angered by stepped up support for the democratic island by outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, including new arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, which have strained already poor Beijing-Washington ties.The U.S. State Department said Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Clarke Cooper would deliver “virtual remarks” at the Taiwan political and military dialogue from the State Department late on Wednesday, though gave no other details.Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it would make a “necessary response based on how the situation develops” and was “resolutely opposed” to the talks.China urges the United States to “immediately stop any form of official exchanges and military links with Taiwan, to avoid further damaging stability in the Taiwan Strait and Sino-U.S. relations”, she added.Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it would not give details of the talks, citing “Taiwan-U.S. mutual trust and a tacit diplomatic understanding”.“The two sides often maintain close and smooth communication on various issues of common concern, so as to continue to deepen cooperation at all levels of politics, economics, and security,” said spokeswoman Joanne Ou.Cooper met Taiwan’s top diplomat in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, in August, saying it was a pleasure to talk with her “as we work together for regional peace and stability”.Democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its sovereign territory, has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up military activity near the island.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-will-respond-to-planned-taiwan-us-defence-talks/story-4Uei6VzXHCKlQtYX2yY2bP.html
06-01-2021||World||Donald Trump’s defeat pits Republicans against Republicans||Donald Trump’s months-long effort to toss out the election results and extend his presidency will meet its formal end this week, but not without exposing political rifts in the Republican Party that have pitted future contenders for the White House against one another.Congress is expected to vote overwhelmingly against objections to certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, after several Senate Republicans said this week they wouldn’t join a small group of their colleagues set to challenge Electoral College votes from closely fought states Trump falsely claims he lost due to widespread fraud.The senators who say they’ll affirm Biden’s victory -- and who say to do otherwise would defy the Constitution -- include Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina, both of whom are seen as potential future presidential candidates.The leaders of the 13 Senate Republicans planning to object to one or more states are Josh Hawley of Missouri, also regarded as a potential 2024 candidate, and Ted Cruz of Texas, who finished second in the 2016 GOP primary to Trump.Presiding over the event will be the Republican Party’s most obvious standard-bearer in the years ahead, besides Trump himself: Vice President Mike Pence.He is under pressure from Trump’s supporters and the president to attempt to single-handedly change the outcome of the election by rejecting Electoral College votes from states where Trump has baselessly alleged that fraud robbed him of victory. Pence has not said how he will address the matter.Congressional certification of Biden’s win is the final, official act in the drawn-out 2020 election before he’s inaugurated and takes office on Jan. 20. But the complicated political currents roiling the Republican Party are turning what used to be a mere formality to end presidential contests into an unprecedented drama.“You are looking at ambitious Republican officials placing a bet on President Trump’s influence in the future,” said Michael Steel, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and former adviser to Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. The fate of the effort depends on Trump’s popularity going forward, he said.“There is a possibility he becomes highly unpopular -- having tried to warp the Constitution to protect him will be politically damaging. On the other hand, you have to assume, he will have a substantial impact in the Republican primary, and standing with him will help you avoid a primary challenge.”On Tuesday night, Trump, in a statement from his campaign, denied a New York Times report that Pence had told him he did not believe he had the authority to stop the certification.“Our vice president has several options under the US Constitution,” Trump said, an assertion rejected by constitutional scholars. The Constitution says only that the president of the Senate -- Pence, in this case -- shall “open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted.”Late-Night DebateDepending on how many states’ Electoral College submissions are challenged, Congress may find itself debating whether to affirm Biden’s victory well into the night on Wednesday or into Thursday morning. The ramifications will echo for years.Republicans objecting to congressional certification of Biden’s victory are aiming to ingratiate themselves with an outgoing president who has made clear he has no intention of retiring from politics. Some, though, have stopped short of embracing his false allegations of widespread fraud -- in effect, looking to harness the outrage he’s stoked without actually disputing the election results.“There will be a lot of competition for Trump’s affection, and Trump will still be very influential in the GOP primary,” said Mike DuHaime, a GOP strategist who worked for the Republican National Committee and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. “His tweets could make or break people in 2022 or 2024.”But the Republicans who say they’ll vote to accept the Electoral College results include staunch Trump allies such as Cotton and Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota. They say the Constitution gives Congress no real power to decide presidential elections, and describe the effort as violating conservative principles of limited federal government.“It is disappointing this vote has become the exclusive litmus test for whether or not a member of Congress stands with President Trump,” Cramer said in a statement late Monday.Cotton warned of destabilizing the Electoral College. A group of House Republicans who oppose calls to object said the same this week, pointing out that the College “could provide the only path to victory in 2024” for the Republican nominee and shouldn’t be weakened on Wednesday.Scott said the GOP lawmakers’ efforts aren’t practical, since Democrats control the House. “For their theory to work, Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats would have to elect Donald Trump president rather than Joe Biden,” Scott said Tuesday, referring to votes triggered by an objection to a state’s certified results. “That is not going to happen.”That the fight is happening at all is a sign of Trump’s enduring influence. The aftermath may ripple through the 2022 midterm elections -- calls for objections are more widespread among House Republicans, who are more vulnerable to primary challenges -- and the presidential nomination race that will follow.Trump again tried to pressure Senate Republicans on Tuesday.“I think it’s not only ridiculous, I think its dangerous,” said former GOP Representative Denver Riggleman of Virginia, who left Congress after losing his party’s nomination for re-election last year and has been critical of Trump. “I find it amazing that people are kowtowing to someone who lost an election because they’re worried about primaries or fundraising.”Riggleman said he doubts any Republican lawmakers believe there was electoral fraud outside what he dubbed the “QAnon caucus,” referring to the farcical far-right conspiracy theory. “This is simply political and the fact is they don’t care what it does to the republic,” he said.Cool ReceptionIn the Senate, the push had met a cooler reception until Hawley said last week that he’d object, defying pressure from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Cruz followed, leading a group of 11 Republicans including four newly elected senators, further eroding McConnell’s grip. Their specific plans are still unclear.Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler, who faced a runoff election on Tuesday, said she backed the effort.“Clearly, Cruz and Hawley are willing to get in and fight -- and I wish some of their colleagues in the Senate had the same fortitude right now,” said Jason Miller, an adviser to Trump’s campaigns in 2016 and 2020. But he downplayed questions about whether political futures are driving decisions.“This isn’t about trying to thread a needle by anyone not named Trump for the future,” he said. “This is much more a reaction to an angry and ticked-off Trump base.”Hawley believes he has an obligation to give voice to constituents sympathetic to Trump’s claims of vote fraud.“If you’ve been speaking to folks at home, I’m sure you know how deeply angry and disillusioned many, many people are -- and how frustrated that Congress has taken little or no action,” Hawley wrote to fellow Republican senators last week.He cited past objections during presidential certifications. “I strongly believe it is entirely appropriate for those of us concerned about the integrity of this last election to do the same,” he wrote.Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor, said Cotton is seeking to broaden his support among mainstream voters, while Cruz and Hawley want to “outdo each other for the conservative vote” heading into the 2024 primary.“They are setting themselves up to be the heir-apparent of Trump. But four years is a long time,” he said. “Identifying yourself now as the torch-bearer of Trumpism may or may not pay dividends in 2024.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-defeat-pits-republicans-against-republicans/story-Tf7jgAiB9tMNno6WGf0A9I.html
06-01-2021||World||Euro zone contraction deeper than thought in December as lockdowns bite||Economic activity in the euro zone contracted more sharply than previously thought at the end of 2020 and could get worse as renewed lockdown restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus hit the bloc’s dominant service industry, a survey showed.With infection rates soaring across Europe, countries have clamped down on public life. Germany is set to extend its strict lockdown until the end of the month and Italy decided on Tuesday to keep some nationwide restrictions in place.IHS Markit’s final December Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, did rise to 49.1 from November’s 45.3 but was significantly below a flash reading of 49.8. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.“Service sector activity in particular fell more sharply than estimated by the earlier flash PMI estimate, as more countries stepped up their fights against rising virus case numbers,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.The services PMI registered 46.4 in December, better than the previous month’s 41.7 but far weaker than the 47.3 preliminary estimate.With much of the service industry being forced to close demand also shrank a lot more than thought. The final services new business index was 46.6 compared to the flash estimate of 47.9, albeit better than November’s 40.6.“Worse may be yet to come before things get better, especially as the latest survey data were collected before the news of the new – more contagious – strain of the virus,” Williamson said.“Service sector activity in particular looks likely to remain constrained by severe social distancing in the early months of the new year.”But with vaccines being rolled out across the continent overall optimism about the year ahead improved. The composite future output index rose to 64.5 from 60.4, its highest reading since April 2018.The bloc’s economy is expected to gain momentum this year on vaccine hopes, a Reuters poll found last month, and will return to pre-crisis levels within two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/euro-zone-contraction-deeper-than-thought-in-december-as-lockdowns-bite/story-W3Eyv3hjZsCjzeQjAsOT8M.html
06-01-2021||World||Israel to tighten lockdown due to surge in Covid-19 cases||Israel will tighten lockdown restrictions in a bid to reverse the sharp rise in coronavirus infections that’s taking place as vaccine supplies dwindle.The cabinet voted to close all schools and non-essential businesses for two weeks, beginning midnight Thursday. Airline travel will be permitted only for those who purchased tickets before.A partial lockdown, which began Dec. 27 and restricted movement and banned most client-facing business activity, hasn’t managed to tame the virus.While Israel says it has inoculated about 15% of the population with a first dose of vaccine, it is running low on supply. Second doses have been set aside for those already immunized, but the government has warned that there will be a lull in new inoculations until more supplies arrive.A first shipment of 100,000 Moderna Inc. doses are to arrive this week, according to reports in the local press.The virus variant identified in Britain is spreading in Israel as well, exacerbating the outbreak, according to the government. More than 8,000 new cases in the country of 9.3 million were confirmed in each of the past two days, bringing the total since the beginning of the pandemic to more than 458,000, including 3,495 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-tighten-lockdown-due-to-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-2ZrltlJBEOqKvvGkHUC0PM.html
06-01-2021||World||Gulf Arabs agree to restore Qatar ties but no word on OPEC role||Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states agreed to fully restore ties with neighboring Qatar on Tuesday after a sustained U.S. push for the countries to unite against Iran.The breakthrough ending a dispute among some of the world’s top oil and gas producers that erupted in 2017 came just two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office after pledging a new start with Tehran.Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt signed an accord with Qatar in a mirrored concert hall in the northwestern Saudi town of Al Ula during a summit of Gulf Cooperation Council leaders, bringing the regional split to an end -- at least on paper.The same day, Saudi Arabia asserted its primacy over the global oil industry by surprising the market with a large crude production cut that secured its leadership among global producers and sent crude prices soaring.The Gulf leaders made no mention of whether Qatar would rejoin the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The nation, which pumps around 650,000 barrels a day of crude in addition to gas, decided to leave the cartel at the start of 2019, in one of the most visible consequences of the fallout.It was a rare example of the region’s politics spilling over into OPEC, which has mostly remained unified even amid warfare between some of its members.The reconciliation takes on greater significance given the impending changing of the guard in Washington. While President Donald Trump led an offensive to weaken Iran through sanctions, Biden has pledged to engage diplomatically with the Islamic Republic if it first returns to the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal.Qatar’s main equities gauge on Wednesday was broadly unchanged after advancing the previous day, while most other Middle Eastern benchmarks dropped. The implications of resolving the dispute had already been priced in before the official reconciliation announcement, according to analysts.The yield on Saudi Arabia’s $6.5 billion bond maturing in 2046 rose for a sixth day, while Qatar’s $3 billion debt maturing in 2030 yield gained as well.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, said Tuesday Gulf nations needed to “unify our efforts to advance our region, and face the challenges that surround us -- especially the challenges represented by Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.”Warm embraceQatar’s ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani landed in Saudi Arabia to a warm embrace from Prince Mohammed on his first visit since the 2017 falling out that cut trade, travel and diplomatic ties.UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on Twitter that a “shining new page” was beginning. Sheikh Tamim tweeted: “We all hope for a better future for the region.”The accord was a major step, but it’s unclear how far the reconciliation will go or how long it will last. The four boycotting nations accused Doha of meddling in their internal affairs, supporting hardline Islamist groups and building ties with Iran. Qatar denied the charges.“The fundamental issues that led initially to the dispute were only partially resolved, and the trust deficit between the Gulf leaders will not be healed immediately,” said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group consultancy.Iran FearsQatar had increasingly turned to Iran and Turkey -- another regional rival of Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- for support, relying on Iranian airspace for overflights. That troubled Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration, which had initially backed the boycott, as it sought to expand its offensive to weaken Iran.Asked whether the incoming U.S. government would be capable of containing Iran, Prince Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said all American administrations “are aware of Iran’s threats, even when they sometimes deal with it differently.”Still, although trade relations are expected to make a comeback, economists say trade is unlikely to return to its former levels. In the year before the split, Qatar’s total trade with the kingdom stood at around $1.7 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Qatar’s total trade with the UAE was $3.5 billion.The GCC comprises Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. Oman and Kuwait had remained neutral during the split, with Kuwaiti officials providing mediation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gulf-arabs-agree-to-restore-qatar-ties-but-no-word-on-opec-role/story-k8nq4wNIoYRXOd3B1rYNeJ.html

To ensure the work of the international expert team in China goes smoothly, we have to carry out necessary procedures and make relevant arrangements,” said Hua.She said the country is “doing its best to create good conditions for the international expert group to come to China”.On Tuesday the head of the World Health Organization told reporters Beijing had not yet finalised permission for the team’s arrival, saying he was “very disappointed with this news” -- in a rare rebuke of Beijing from the UN body.Earlier this week Chinese authorities refused to confirm the exact dates and details of the visit, a sign of the enduring sensitivity of the mission.The WHO had previously said China has granted permission for a visit by a 10-person team. Hua said China was “placing great importance and is actively communicating with the WHO”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impasse-over-who-virus-mission-not-just-a-visa-issue-says-china/story-ZUC6YugzLHHoUA5TXM245I.html
06-01-2021||World||South Africa’s hope to secure vaccines from India reportedly thwarted||South Africa’s hope of securing an order of 1.4 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine designed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford from an Indian company may have been thwarted by a ban on exports imposed by the Asian country’s government, Business Day reported, citing unidentified people.Until Monday South Africa was confident it had secured the order from the Serum Institute of India, which is making the vaccine under license, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. Talks are now being held directly with India’s government, two people familiar with the situation said, according to the newspaper.South Africa’s government is coming under increasing pressure from health leaders, opposition parties and labor unions over its failure to sign any direct vaccine supply deals with pharmaceutical companies. While it has signed up to Covax, an initiative aiming to ensure equitable access to vaccines, it will only start getting shots for 10% of its population of 60 million people in the second quarter.South Africa, the country hardest hit by the coronavirus in Africa, has between 700,000 and 1 million health workers, depending on how they are classified, according to Stavros Nicolaou, head of the health work group for B4SA, a business alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-s-hope-to-secure-vaccines-from-india-reportedly-thwarted/story-C6DY9GznzyZL5uc3XWXw9N.html
06-01-2021||World||European medicines agency ponders approval for Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union’s medicines agency was meeting Wednesday to consider giving the green light to Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine, a decision that would give the 27-nation bloc a second vaccine to use in the desperate battle to tame the virus rampaging across the continent.The meeting of the European Medicines Agency’s human medicines committee (CHMP) comes amid high rates of infections in many EU countries and strong criticism of the slow pace of vaccinations across the region of some 450 million people.The EMA has already approved a coronavirus vaccine made by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech. Both vaccines require giving people two shots.Ahead of the meeting on the Moderna vaccine, the agency said in a tweet that its experts were “working hard to clarify all outstanding issues with the company.” It did not elaborate on what those issues were. Moderna also declined to comment.Early results of large, still unfinished studies show both the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines appear safe and strongly protective, although Moderna’s is easier to handle since it doesn’t need to be stored at ultra-frozen temperatures.The United States, Canada and Israel have already approved use of the Moderna vaccine. The US gave it the green light for emergency use in people over 18 years on Dec. 18, followed by Canada five days later with an interim authorization also for people over 18. Israel authorized the vaccine on Monday.If the EU agency joins the list, its decision will have to be confirmed by the bloc’s executive commission in Brussels before vaccinations with the Moderna shot can begin.Moderna said Monday that it is increasing its estimate for global vaccine production in 2021 from 500 to 600 million doses. The company said it is “continuing to invest and add staff to build up to potentially 1 billion doses for 2021.”Both Moderna’s and Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots are mRNA vaccines, made with a groundbreaking new technology. They don’t contain any coronavirus – meaning they cannot cause infection. Instead, they use a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spike protein on the surface of the virus, ready to attack if the real thing comes along.The EU officially began giving out Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination shots on Dec. 27, but the speed of each nation’s inoculation program has varied widely. France vaccinated around 500 people in the first week, while Germany vaccinated 200,000. The Dutch were only beginning to give out vaccine shots Wednesday, the last EU nation to start doing so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-medicines-agency-ponders-approval-for-moderna-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-TDDa4flRnC8sOqM61dg9OJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Democrats win one Georgia runoff election, poised to pick the second||In the decisive battle for the US Senate control, Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated incumbent Kelly Loeffler by more than 40,000 votes and Jon Ossoff, the other Democrat, led David Perdue, the sitting Republican senator, by over 3,600.Victories by Warnock and Ossoff — if and when the second happens — will raise the number of Democrats in the Senate from current 48 to 50, splitting the majority in the 100-member chamber with Republicans. But with Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote as president of the Senate, Democrats will be in control.Democrats will wrest control of the Senate from Republicans and complete a trifecta, with the House of Representatives and the White House already in the bag, starting January 20.With both chambers of Congress in Democratic control, President-elect Joe Biden will have an easier time pursuing his legislative agenda. And the Senate win, on its own, will allow his nominees to be confirmed easily, especially those that Republicans were threatening to block.“We were told we couldn’t win this election, but tonight, we proved that with hope, hard work, and the people by our side, anything is possible,” said Warnock in a brief victory speech. “May my story be an inspiration to some young person who is trying to grasp and grab hold of the American dream.”Warnock will be the first African American senator from Georgia. He is reverend of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church of Atlanta, which was once led by Martin Luther King Jr, the civil rights leader. And Ossoff, a journalist and documentary filmmaker, will be the first Jewish senator from Georgia. His campaign said in a statement, which was released shortly before he overtook Perdue, “When all the votes are counted, we fully expect that Jon Ossoff will have won this election to represent Georgia in the United States Senate. The outstanding vote is squarely in parts of the state where Jon’s performance has been dominant. We look forward to seeing the process through in the coming hours and moving ahead so Jon can start fighting for all Georgians in the US Senate.”Outgoing President Donald Trump was tracking the run-offs — as it seemed from his tweets, when he pointed to some technical difficulties during counting — but he was preoccupied with his efforts to overturn his own election defeat o Biden. He tweeted about a rally he was to address on Wednesday before congress begins the process certify Biden’s election, which his Republican allies will try to block, and fail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-win-one-georgia-runoff-election-poised-to-pick-the-second/story-ULFdO7FWAd794H221drtIO.html
06-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un urges ‘big leap forward’ at rare North Korea congress||Leader Kim Jong Un issued a dire warning at North Korea’s first ruling party congress in five years, saying development plans fell far short of their goals and the party would explore a “new path” for making a “big leap forward.”The days-long Workers’ Party Congress -- convened to draft a new economic plan -- began shortly after Kim skipped his usual New Year’s Day address. In opening remarks Tuesday, Kim said the party’s previous five-year development plan, which ended last year, missed its targets due to both “internal and external challenges,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency.“The goals we set were immensely underachieved in almost all sectors,” Kim said, according to KCNA, making a rare admission of fault by planners.Remarks reported by state media didn’t mention any plans by Kim to revive stalled negotiations with the US to curtail his nuclear arms program in exchange for easing sanctions choking the state’s paltry economy. The gathering of 5,000 delegates and party officials is being closely watched for clues to how Kim will approach the incoming administration of US President-elect Joe Biden.Koh Yu-hwan, president of a government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification think tank in Seoul, said North Korea would probably hint at its US and South Korea strategy in later congress meetings.“North Korea may have calculated that the sanctions regime will last for a while,” Koh said. “It is finding problems internally to speed up the economic recovery, things North Korea can do during the sanctions regime.”Kim is one of the few world leaders yet to congratulate -- or even acknowledge -- Biden’s defeat of President Donald Trump, who dispensed with decades of US foreign policy to hold three meetings with the North Korean leader. There was no mention of the president-elect in the initial accounts of the event.Biden’s camp has signaled more room for negotiations, and the president-elect’s choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has backed a negotiated settlement with North Korea that first freezes and then rolls back its nuclear program in return for rewards.State media also didn’t explain what Kim’s “big leap forward” would entail, other than that the congress would lay the groundwork for improving living standards. The term evoked the Mao Zedong’s “Great Leap Forward” in neighboring China, a disastrous attempt to catch up with the industrial powerhouses of the West that contributed to mass famines.The meeting, where leadership changes are expected, comes as Kim’s battered economy was dealt further blows by natural disasters and his decision to shut borders due to the coronavirus. Gross domestic product likely shrank by 8.5% in 2020, according to a projection by Fitch Solutions, leaving it smaller than when Kim took power in 2011 with a pledge to improve people’s living standards.Kim has few options to turn around finances but a United Nations Security Council report said he has used illegal ship-to-ship transfers of contraband and cyber-crimes to earn money.“He’s groping in the darkness for a solution,” said Jo Dong-ho, a professor of North Korean economic studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. Jo added it’s highly unlikely Kim can open up like China and Vietnam because that would first involve nuclear concessions to the US-- a gatekeeper of sanctions.Images in state media showed Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong seated a row behind the leader, easing recent speculation among observers that her power had been clipped after she led a contentious pressure campaign against South Korea.Kim Jong Un also indicated that purges of cadres could be underway. Last year, he dressed down officials for falling short of goals, most prominently in July when he lashed out at the “careless budgeting” for a showcase hospital construction project in Pyongyang that had fallen behind schedule.The project appears to have been hit by a shortage of building materials, underscoring the difficulty he faces to improve living conditions while toiling under sanctions.Kim’s most recent public speech -- at a military parade in October -- featured a rare show of emotion, with the leader appearing to cry as he talked about the country’s economic struggles under international sanctions. He also rolled out several new weapons designed to strike US and allied forces, including what is believed to be the world’s largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.“I am skeptical he will discuss the new Biden administration in detail, if he even mentions it explicitly, that is,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent political analyst who used to work for the US government in areas related to North Korea. “Kim will probably want to maintain flexibility as the new US administration formulates its North Korea policy,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-urges-big-leap-forward-at-rare-north-korea-congress/story-yMM6h9x7vt7UBnz2Wajl4O.html
06-01-2021||World||India-American business group urges Joe Biden to ease restrictions on H-1B visa||A top India-centric American business advocacy group has urged the incoming Biden administration to ease the restrictions on H-1B visas and provide green cards to higher education students with science and mathematics degrees to meet the increasing demand for IT professionals in the country. On December 31, outgoing US President Donald Trump extended a freeze on the most sought-after H-1B visas along with other types of foreign work visas by three months to March 31, affecting a large number of Indian IT professionals who were issued visas by the US government for the fiscal year 2021. President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump’s immigration policies are cruel. “It is more of a legislative issue. We have basically recommended to the Biden administration, one, is ease up the H-1B (visa), but at the same time, every STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) PhD graduating, should be given a Green Card, so that they stay and contribute from day one as a taxpayer and also to the growth of the economy,” Mukesh Aghi, president of US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum told PTI in an interview. “That’s the position, we still are very supportive of. And I think the sentiment seems to be the same with the Biden administration,” said Aghi, based on the interactions he has had with members of the Biden Transition Team. Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20. Responding to a question, Aghi said the number of H-1B visas issued every year should be driven by the market demands. At this point of time, the current figure of 65,000 H-1B visas in addition to another 20,000 to those foreign nationals with graduation from a US university is quite inadequate to meet the huge demand of IT professionals in the US, he noted.Currently there is a shortage of 1 million IT professionals in the US. At the same time, he asserted, there is a need to ensure that the local job environment continues. Supporting the farm laws in India, Aghi said the three new legislations recently enacted are “the right thing to do.” Today the farmer in India gets 24 cents to a dollar for his produce, he said. In the era of technology, farmers need to have choices to be able to sell their produce to ‘mandis’ or to be able to sell to other geographies as well. The farm bill provides farmers with such an option, he explained. “It is just providing choices and in any economy choices are healthy. At the same time, if somebody is protesting diverse choices, in a peaceful manner, then we support it,” he said. But at the end of the day, in an agriculture-based economy, one has to figure out how to double the farmers’ income, expand job creation and improve productivity. “We strongly believe the farm bill supports that vision. People will object to it, but that’s normal in a good democracy,” he said. Aghi said the Covid-19 crisis and the current change in administration in the US provides India an opportunity to look at the Biden administration in a positive manner. “The crisis with China has brought to India the message that ‘we will not treat you as an equal partner’; sends a message to the leadership in India to look at the Biden Administration in a very, very positive manner,” he said. “It also sends a message to the Biden Administration that with the current scenario, which is a geopolitical one, India can be a reliable partner; India can stand up to the threat of aggressive China, which no other country has stood up to. Both countries have a common factor here,” Aghi said. “So, I think the current Covid-19 crisis where India can play a strong role in the vaccine production on producing cheaper generic drugs, not only for the US, but worldwide provides an equal partnership. I think India and the Biden administration will reach out to each other and come with some kind of an understanding early on, rather than waiting on and making sure that there is a win-win partnership here,” Aghi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-american-business-group-urges-joe-biden-to-ease-restrictions-on-h-1b-visa/story-JIUs2lbSzhOahRcEqsDM9J.html
06-01-2021||World||Japan emergency may last months as critics say steps too narrow||Restrictions set to be imposed under Japan’s state of emergency could last months, with both government advisers and critics of its strategy calling for broader steps than current proposals.Japan is set to declare an emergency as early as Thursday in Tokyo and three surrounding areas, with relatively narrow restrictions focused on reducing infections at bars and restaurants. But as in spring, the declaration may drag on if those moves fail to change people’s behavior, experts contend. Tokyo’s new virus cases are set to top 1,500 in a new record Wednesday, raising further doubts over the effectiveness of the expected measures.Lifting the state of emergency in less than a month would be “next to impossible,” Shigeru Omi, the head of the panel of experts advising the government, said on Tuesday. “It’ll need a little longer -- March or April, I’m not sure.”Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has called for a more focused state of emergency than that which devastated the economy last spring. He’s seeking to tackle the spread of coronavirus infections at restaurants that have been a primary source of the current surge, while limiting the scope of the restrictions to reduce the economic harm.Despite saying that a rerun of the spring emergency wasn’t necessary, Omi called for moves that would boost the effectiveness of restrictions on eateries, including encouraging remote work. Suga has at times given short shrift to the panel’s recommendations, particularly over a travel subsidy program that continued to run even as the current wave surged.While restrictions are envisioned to last for a month, the government plans to set in advance the specific conditions for lifting the emergency, with areas needing to return to “Stage 3” on a tiered system that measures criteria such as infection numbers and hospital conditions, the Nikkei reported.Omi’s calls were echoed by Hiroshi Nishiura, an expert in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at Kyoto University who was instrumental in defining the “Three C’s” strategy to avoid the places infections were most likely to spread.“At a minimum it will take close to two months” to bring things under control, he told public broadcaster NHK. Nishiura published a model predicting that limiting steps to bars and restaurants would not sufficiently reduce the transmission number and would instead keep cases at their current level. Steps similar to the first state of emergency would cut cases in Tokyo to fewer than 100 by the end of February, according to the model.Kentaro Iwata, a Japanese infectious disease expert who has clashed heads with policy makers before, also said broader steps were required.“The layers of infections have already spread too much, and intervening in restaurants isn’t an effective policy,” he wrote on Twitter. “The worst thing to do would be to have a watered-down state of emergency.”Iwata drew headlines in February for suggesting Tokyo may become a “second Wuhan” and called for a full lockdown to control the virus in spring, a step which ultimately proved unnecessary.Higher CaseloadWhile the government is keen to avoid those broader steps, in doing so it runs the same risk that countries in Europe found when attempting to impose a “lockdown lite” in autumn. Japan is entering the current state of emergency with infections in Tokyo averaging nearly 1,000 over the past seven days, though cases per capita are still less than a 10th of those seen in the UK, which has also returned to its strictest lockdown.Japan won praise for its early tackling of the virus, relying on public cooperation as its constitution makes European-style enforced lockdowns impossible. While critics at the time contended the steps were too light, the country ultimately exited the state of emergency in just six weeks, and avoided a second one during a summer surge.Many factors this time are different. Japan left the first emergency just as the summer was beginning. But January and February are the coldest months of the year in the Tokyo region, making ventilation more difficult and providing a more preferable environment for the disease -- something other nations such as South Korea have also had to contend with.The country may also struggle to enlist public cooperation the same way it did in spring. Officials have fretted that public concern over the virus was dropping, while many bars and restaurants, already pushed to the edge over the past year, may be reluctant to cooperate with requests to close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-emergency-may-last-months-as-critics-say-steps-too-narrow/story-0TDeaLaOzKzx2lYdktmjYK.html
06-01-2021||World||Mike Pence told Donald Trump he lacks power to challenge election results||Vice President Mike Pence has told Donald Trump that he lacked the power to challenge Vice President-elect Joe Biden’s electoral victory despite the US president’s insistence that he did not, according to a media report.The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Pence delivered the message to Trump during his weekly lunch with the president. Pence is set to preside over the US Senate on Wednesday as it receives the results of the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of presidential elections. Biden, a Democrat, beat Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and in the popular vote by more than 7 million ballots. Trump, a Republican, has not conceded the election, reiterating unverified claims that the November 3 presidential polls were rigged. Dozens of lawsuits by his campaign challenging election results have failed in US courts. “Vice President Mike Pence told President Trump on Tuesday that he did not believe he had the power to block congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election despite Mr Trump’s baseless insistence that he did,” the daily reported, citing unnamed people briefed on the conversation. Trump, however, has decried the report as “fake news”, asserting that Pence never told him what the report said. “The New York Times report regarding comments Vice President Pence supposedly made to me today is fake news. He never said that. The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act,” Trump said in a statement issued by his campaign. “The November 3 election was corrupt in contested states, and in particular it was not in accordance with the Constitution in that they made large scale changes to election rules and regulations as dictated by local judges and politicians, not by state legislators. This means that it was illegal,” Trump said. “Our Vice President has several options under the US Constitution. He can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation,” Trump added. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday.“If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect & even fraudulent numbers in a process NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!” he said in another tweet. Pence has not made any statement in the public so far. However, his staffers noted that the vice president supports the right of lawmakers to raise objections and debate. “Vice President Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election,” Pence chief of staff Marc Short said in a statement. “The Vice President welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on January 6th,” Short said. According to The New York Times, Pence has spent the past several days in a delicate dance, seeking at once to convey to Trump that he does not have the authority to overturn the results of the election, while also placating the President to avoid a rift that could torpedo any hopes the Vice President has of running in 2024 as Trump’s loyal heir. “Even as he sought to make clear that he does not have the power Mr. Trump seems to think he has, Mr. Pence also indicated to the president that he would keep studying the issue up until the final hours before the joint session of Congress begins at 1 pm Wednesday, according to the people briefed on their conversation,” the report said. “One option being considered, according to a person close to Mr Trump, was having Mr Pence acknowledge the president’s claims about election fraud in some form during one or more of the Senate debates about the results from particular states before the certification. Mr Pence will preside over those debates,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-told-donald-trump-he-lacks-power-to-challenge-election-results/story-LnL0iUzYRQuv7ZjWvHJIHK.html
06-01-2021||World||No charges against Wisconsin officer who shot Jacob Blake||A Wisconsin prosecutor declined Tuesday to file charges against a white police officer who shot a Black man in the back in Kenosha, concluding he couldn’t disprove the officer’s contention that he acted in self-defence because he feared the man would stab him.The decision, met with swift criticism from civil rights advocates and some public officials, threatened to reignite protests that rocked the city after the August 23 shooting that left Jacob Blake paralyzed. Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, called the decision “further evidence that our work is not done” and called for people to work together for equity. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, who is Black, was more pointed on Twitter: “I wish I could say that I’m shocked. It’s another instance in a string of misapplications of justice.”Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said investigators concluded Blake was carrying a knife when police responded to a report he was trying to steal a car. Officer Rusten Sheskey said he “feared Jacob Blake was going to stab him with the knife” as he tried to stop Blake from fleeing the scene.“I do not believe the state ... would be able to prove that the privilege of self-defense is not available,” Graveley said.The shooting of Blake, captured on bystander video, turned the nation’s spotlight on Wisconsin during a summer marked by protests over police brutality and racism. More than 250 people were arrested during protests in the days that followed, including then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, a self-styled medic with an assault rifle who is charged in the fatal shootings of two men and the wounding of a third.Blake family members expressed anger about the charging decision.“This is going to impact this city and this state and this nation for many years to come,” Justin Blake, an uncle, said. “Unless the people rise up and do what they’re supposed to do. This is a government for the people by the people, correct? We talk about this constitution everybody’s supposed to be so committed to, and yet we stand in the state that has the most convictions of African Americans in the United States. So they’re weighing heavy on one side of justice, but they’re allowing police officers to rain down terror on our communities. It’s injust.”Ben Crump, an attorney for Blake’s family, said in a statement the decision “further destroys trust in our justice system” and said he would proceed with a lawsuit. In a later tweet, he questioned whether Blake threatened Sheskey with a knife, saying “nowhere does the video footage show a knife extended and aimed to establish the requisite intent.”A federal civil rights investigation into Blake’s shooting is still underway. Matthew Krueger, the US attorney for Wisconsin’s Eastern District, said the Department of Justice will make its own charging decision.The Blake shooting happened three months after George Floyd died while being restrained by police officers in Minneapolis, a death that was captured on bystander video and sparked outrage and protests that spread across the United States and beyond. The galvanized Black Lives Matter movement put a spotlight on inequitable policing and became a fault line in politics, with President Donald Trump criticizing protesters and aggressively pressing a law-and-order message that he sought to capitalize on in Wisconsin and other swing states.Kenosha, a city of 100,000 on the Wisconsin-Illinois border about 60 miles north of Chicago, braced for renewed protests ahead of the charges, with concrete barricades and metal fencing surrounding the county courthouse, plywood protecting many businesses and the mayor granted power to impose curfews. Evers activated 500 National Guard troops to assist.As temperatures dipped near freezing Tuesday evening, about 20 protesters gathered and marched in an area north of downtown, chanting “No justice, no peace.” About 15 cars, some honking their horns, followed.Vaun Mayer, a 33-year-old activist from Milwaukee who is Black, drove to Kenosha to protest. He said he didn’t expect the officer to be charged, calling Graveley’s decision just the latest in a line of prosecutors failing to charge police officers in Wisconsin.“We’re used to this and we didn’t expect anything different than this,” he said.At a downtown park near the courthouse where hundreds gathered in the days after Blake was shot, there was no sign of any large, organized protests. Abdullah Shabazz, 36, who said he came from nearby Waukegan, Illinois, to show solidarity with the Blake family, blamed the weather.Kris Coleman, 36, of Kenosha, stood nearby livestreaming National Guard troops manning an intersection. He said the city appeared to be better prepared than it was during the summer. “And I’m happy,” he said. Later, a small group of protesters confronted Guard members briefly at the courthouse.Graveley told reporters during a two-hour presentation Tuesday afternoon that investigators determined that the events leading up to the shooting began when the mother of Blake’s children called police and said Blake was about to drive off in her car. Officers determined en route that Blake had a felony warrant out for sexual assault.They arrived to find Blake placing the couple’s three children in the back seat of the woman’s SUV. Graveley said officers had no choice but to arrest him since he was wanted. He said Blake resisted, fighting with the officers as they tried to handcuff him. Officers used a stun gun on him three times to no effect.Noble Wray, a Black former police chief and a use-of-force expert who reviewed the investigation, said Blake had a knife that apparently fell to the ground during the struggle. Blake picked it up and officers disengaged and drew their guns. Blake then tried to get into the SUV, Wray said.“Any officer worth their salt, they’re not going to let someone leave under these circumstances,” Wray said. “This is the stuff Amber Alerts are made of.”Sheskey grabbed the back of Blake’s shirt, Graveley said. Blake turned and moved the knife toward Sheskey, the officer told investigators, leading him to believe his life was in danger, the district attorney said.Sheskey fired seven times, hitting Blake in the back four times and in the side three times, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Graveley said the shots in the side show Blake had twisted toward the officer.Graveley showed reporters an enlarged photo of what he said was Blake’s knife, adding that Blake acknowledged to investigators he had it. The district attorney walked reporters through how he would have prosecuted the case, saying jurors would have had to put themselves in Sheskey’s position and that the officer’s self-defense claims would have held up given the circumstances of the case.Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who has prosecuted officers, said Graveley presented a compelling case that showed why charges are not appropriate.“There isn’t anyone who would like to be in that officer’s shoes -- but in that moment, he used what I feel was reasonable force to end the threat,” Cramer said. For those who disagree, he said, “What should he have done, let him drive away with a child in the back, let themselves get stabbed? … The only answer reasonably is -- they need to defend themselves.”The officers were not equipped with body cameras.Sheskey, 31, has been the subject of five internal investigations since he joined the Kenosha department in 2013, including three reprimands for crashing his squad car three times over three years. He has also earned 16 awards, letters or formal commendations, his personnel file shows.Rittenhouse, who was among armed people who took to Kenosha streets during the violence and said he was there to help protect businesses, faces multiple charges including intentional homicide. Bystander video showed Rittenhouse shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding a third man. Rittenhouse, who is white, has claimed the three men attacked him and he fired in self-defence. Conservatives across the country have been raising money for his legal team. Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shooting.Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to all charges at a hearing Tuesday.Prosecutors dropped the sexual assault charge against Blake in November as part of deal in which he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to two years’ probation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-charges-against-wisconsin-officer-who-shot-jacob-blake/story-d4zsl8y6eovUBqeH8wiiHJ.html
06-01-2021||World||One in 50 now infected, UK steps up coronavirus vaccination drive||More than 1 million people in England now have coronavirus, the British government said, as medics race to vaccinate the most vulnerable against the rapidly spreading disease.Rocketing case rates from the new virus strain mean one person in every 50 in England now has Covid-19, while in London one in 30 is infected, official survey results showed.Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the statistics as he vowed to speed up the government’s vaccination program, in order eventually to lift the latest lockdown. He said 23% of all over-80s in England have now been given a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, meaning some of those at the greatest risk are starting to get the protection they need.Johnson underlined his promise to vaccinate almost 14 million people at the highest risk and carers by mid-February. He said 1.3 million people across the UK had already received the first of two shots.But he signaled there could be many more months of restrictions ahead, saying current plans to end England’s national lockdown in mid-February were subject to a “lot of caveats, a lot of ifs.” England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said measures could be in place next winter, adding: “We shouldn’t kid ourselves this just disappears with spring.”Invisible ShieldThe Prime Minister was speaking at a press conference Tuesday, a day after he put the country into its third national lockdown since the pandemic began. The rest of Europe is also buckling under the strain of a resurgent pandemic, with Germany fighting high infection rates and encountering difficulties rolling out vaccines.The new national restrictions in the UK threaten to push the economy into a double dip recession, prompting Johnson’s government to announce another package of emergency support for businesses, worth more than 4.6 billion pounds ($6.2 billion).“You all want to be sure that we in government are now using every second of this lockdown to put that invisible shield around the elderly and the vulnerable in the form of vaccination, and so to begin to bring this crisis to an end,” Johnson said. “Yes it is a huge effort. It’s the biggest vaccination program in the history of this country.”He defended his decision to order the country to stay at home again, and pointed to latest infection figures showing record levels of coronavirus in the population. “The number of patients in hospitals in England is now 40% higher than at the first peak in April,” he said. “When everybody looks at the position people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice.”The figure of one in 50 people infected is an estimate based on a mass testing survey that aims to find people who have infections but no symptoms. It is significantly higher than the infection rate implied by the national totals from all positive test results, which mostly rely on people to seek tests when they show symptoms.Passenger TestingBritish officials are in talks over what more is needed to protect the UK from the pandemic, including potentially new restrictions at ports and airports on non-essential travel. At the press conference, Johnson said a new testing regime will be introduced. “We will be bringing in measures to ensure that we test people coming into this country and prevent the virus from being readmitted,” he said.The lockdown followed warnings from government medical advisers that the National Health Service could be overwhelmed within the next three weeks unless urgent action was taken.At Tuesday’s press briefing, Whitty said the “hope” is the new lockdown will be enough to bring the pandemic under control. “If people stick to those rules really strongly and at the same time, the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can, then our hope is the lockdown will be enough. But we’ve all got to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-50-now-infected-uk-steps-up-coronavirus-vaccination-drive/story-U5S8sToIH9boZ6EMcT5pnJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Democrat Raphael Warnock claims victory in one of two crunch US Senate runoffs||Democrat Raphael Warnock won one of Georgia’s two Senate runoffs Wednesday, becoming the first Black senator in his state’s history and putting the Senate majority within the Democrats’ reach.A pastor who spent the past 15 years leading the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr. preached, Warnock defeated Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler. It was a stinging rebuke of outgoing President Donald Trump, who made one of his final trips in office to Georgia to rally his loyal base behind Loeffler and the Republican running for the other seat, David Perdue.The focus now shifts to the second race between Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff. That contest was too early to call as votes were still being counted. If Ossoff wins, Democrats will have complete control of Congress, strengthening President-elect Joe Biden’s standing as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20.Warnock’s victory is a symbol of a striking shift in Georgia’s politics as the swelling number of diverse, college-educated voters flex their power in the heart of the Deep South. It marks the end of nearly two decades in which Democrats have been shut out of statewide office and follows Biden’s victory in November, when he became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state since 1992.Warnock, 51, acknowledged his improbable victory in a message to supporters early Wednesday, citing his family’s experience with poverty. His mother, he said, used to pick “somebody else’s cotton” as a teenager.“The other day, because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else’s cotton picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,” he said. “Tonight, we proved with hope, hard work and the people by our side, anything is possible.”Loeffler refused to concede in a brief message to supporters shortly after midnight.“We’ve got some work to do here. This is a game of inches. We’re going to win this election,” insisted Loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the Senate less than a year ago by the state’s governor.Loeffler, who remains a Georgia senator until the results of Tuesday’s election are finalized, said she would return to Washington on Wednesday morning to join a small group of senators planning to challenge Congress’ vote to certify Biden’s victory.“We are going to keep fighting for you,” Loeffler said, “This is about protecting the American dream.”Georgia’s other runoff election pitted Perdue, a 71-year-old former business executive who held his Senate seat until his term expired on Sunday, against Ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. At just 33 years old, Ossoff would be the Senate’s youngest member.Trump’s false claims of voter fraud cast a dark shadow over the runoff elections, which were held only because no candidate hit the 50% threshold in the general election. He attacked the state’s election chief on the eve of the election and raised the prospect that some votes might not be counted even as votes were being cast Tuesday afternoon.Republican state officials on the ground reported no significant problems.This week’s elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. The unusually high stakes transformed Georgia, once a solidly Republican state, into one of the nation’s premier battlegrounds for the final days of Trump’s presidency -- and likely beyond.Both contests tested whether the political coalition that fueled Biden’s November victory was an anti-Trump anomaly or part of a new electoral landscape. To win in Tuesday’s elections — and in the future -- Democrats needed strong African American support.Drawing on his popularity with Black voters, among other groups, Biden won Georgia’s 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in November.Trump’s claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, while meritless, resonated with Republican voters in Georgia. About 7 in 10 agreed with his false assertion that Biden was not the legitimately elected president, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 3,600 voters in the runoff elections.Election officials across the country, including the Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia, as well as Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have confirmed that there was no widespread fraud in the November election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two tossed by the Supreme Court, where three Trump-nominated justices preside.Even with Trump’s claims, voters in both parties were drawn to the polls because of the high stakes. AP VoteCast found that 6 in 10 Georgia voters say Senate party control was the most important factor in their vote.In Atlanta’s Buckhead neighborhood, 37-year-old Kari Callaghan said she voted “all Democrat” on Tuesday, an experience that was new for her.“I’ve always been Republican, but I’ve been pretty disgusted by Trump and just the way the Republicans are working,” she said. “I feel like for the Republican candidates to still stand there with Trump and campaign with Trump feels pretty rotten. This isn’t the conservative values that I grew up with.”But 56-year-old Will James said he voted “straight GOP.”He said he was concerned by the Republican candidates’ recent support of Trump’s challenges of the presidential election results in Georgia, “but it didn’t really change the reasons I voted.”“I believe in balance of power, and I don’t want either party to have a referendum, basically,” he said.Even before Tuesday, Georgia had shattered its turnout record for a runoff with more than 3 million votes by mail or during in-person advance voting in December. The state’s previous record was 2.1 million in a 2008 Senate runoff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrat-claims-victory-in-one-of-two-crunch-us-senate-runoffs/story-MHXIbLUrnUdYbte5TS6BcO.html

Those arrested included several prominent former lawmakers and allegations centered on an informal primary that drew more than 600,000 voters in July to choose candidates for a September legislative election that was subsequently postponed by the government.“The sweeping arrests of pro-democracy demonstrators are an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights,” tweeted Antony Blinken, Biden’s nominee for secretary of state. “The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing’s crackdown on democracy.”Police arrested lawyer John Clancey, who served as treasurer for the primary organizers, according to Jonathan Man, a partner at Hong Kong’s Ho Tse Wai & Partners, which has handled hundreds of protest cases and where Clancey is a solicitor. Man said Clancey is a U.S. citizen, potentially providing a new source of tensions between Beijing and Washington.Clancey is also the chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the Asian Legal Resource Center and a founding member of the Executive Committee of the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group, according to his Ho Tse Wai biography page.What Are the New Laws China Has Passed for Hong Kong?: QuickTakeThe mass arrests of largely moderate pro-democracy campaigners accelerate an ongoing political crackdown in the Asian financial hub, which has prompted condemnation from foreign governments, U.S. sanctions and the suspension of numerous extradition treaties with Hong Kong. The move comes as the outgoing Trump administration continues to hit Beijing over its assertive policies in the city and as Biden prepares to take office this month, with China representing one of his administration’s main foreign policy challenges.“This is a total sweep of all opposition leaders,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame specializing in Hong Kong politics. “If running for office and trying to win elections means subversion, it is clear that the NSL is aimed at the total subjugation of Hong Kong people. There should be no expectation of elections in any sense that we know it if and when elections are held in the future.”Former lawmakers Alvin Yeung, James To, Andrew Wan and Lam Cheuk-ting, as well as prominent academic and activist Benny Tai, were arrested by the police’s national security branch on allegations of subversion, according to Facebook postings and media reports. Also detained was former lawmaker Claudia Mo, a leading opposition figure and one of the city’s most outspoken critics of China’s policies in Hong Kong.The national security law was imposed by Beijing on the former British colony in June, sparking international condemnation led by the U.S. that Beijing was reneging on promises to guarantee the city’s unique freedoms following its return to Chinese rule.While Chinese officials have justified the legislation -- which bars subversion, terrorism, secession and collusion with foreign forces -- as a necessary tool to quell local unrest and restore stability to the city after historic protests in 2019, the law has so far mainly been used against non-violent political opponents and dissidents.Pro-government lawmaker Holden Chow tweeted that those arrested Wednesday had violated the security law because they had a “clear aim to paralyze” the local government and were threatening to “remove the Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong.” Secretary for Mainland and Constitutional Affairs Erick Tsang said ahead of the primary last July that it may violate the national security legislation.At the time, Tai dismissed such criticism of the primary as “­absurd.”Fraught PrimaryThe opposition primary contest at the heart of the latest police roundup drew 610,000 residents to the polls -- more than 13% of the city’s registered voters -- in a procedural exercise common in democracies worldwide. The turnout underscored the momentum generated by Hong Kong’s historic protest movement, on which the pro-democracy opposition was hoping to capitalize in a Legislative Council election originally scheduled for September.Opposition figures hoped to access a provision in the city’s charter to force Chief Executive Carrie Lam to resign by voting down her budget. The primary was condemned by China’s top agencies for Hong Kong as an “unlawful ­manipulation” of the city’s election system and a violation of the national security law.Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute deputy CEO Kim-Wah Chung said it had destroyed voters’ personal information within days of the primary, local outlet RTHK reported Wednesday.Hong Kong’s government first disqualified a number of opposition figures and then delayed the election by a full year, citing the coronavirus.U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said at the time that there was “no valid reason for such a lengthy delay,” and that the “regrettable action confirms that Beijing has no intention of upholding the commitments it made to the Hong Kong people.”Hong Kong’s Courts Are the Last Check on Beijing’s Growing Power“The political purge continues in Hong Kong,” said U.S.-based activist Samuel Chu, the managing director of the Hong Kong Democracy Council. The Chinese Communist Party “is remaking the rule of law and government in Hong Kong in its own image as a one-party authoritarian regime with lightning speed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/assault-on-universal-rights-incoming-us-secretary-of-state-on-hong-kong-arrests/story-cN4lrKpm3sAjwUtfyFw2NK.html
06-01-2021||World||New resolution by Chinese Communist Party to strangle dissent, freedom of expression||The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on Monday introduced new rules that banned cadres from expressing opinions and dissenting views from its own ranks, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).Jun Mai, writing for SCMP, stated that the revised rule book said that cadres can make complaints about their superiors but was prohibited from airing them in public and were also banned from expressing opinions that are ‘not consistent’ with the decisions of the central leadership.The new rules also officially incorporate references to Xi Jinping’s “Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era”, as the leader’s ideology is officially known - a concept that has already been written into the constitution, reported SCMP.The new rules were issued just six months ahead of the Communist Party’s centenary in July and mark an attempt to inject new life into the party rule book which was last updated 16 years ago.The new rule book made clear that the party that has about 92 million members will not tolerate dissenting views from its own ranks.“A member of the party must not publicly express opinions that are inconsistent with decisions made by the central leadership,” said Article 16 of the revised regulations on safeguarding the rights of party members, reported SCMP.Article 11 of the new rules stipulate that while party members are entitled to report misconduct by other members, including those who hold a higher rank, they must not disseminate such information at will and must not do so on the internet, reported SCMP.State media hailed the revised regulations, which came into effect in 1995 and were amended nine years later. The amended party rules were described by state media as ‘boosting democracy within the party’.However, Wang Qishan in an article published in People’s Daily, the party’s mouthpiece, in 2014, then the party’s top corruption buster and now vice-president, argued that joining the Communist Party means voluntarily giving up certain rights and freedoms.The amended regulations were published on the first working day after the New Year break of 2021, a year that carries tremendous political significance for Beijing as CCP is planning extensive celebrations in the run-up to its centenary celebrations on July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-resolution-by-chinese-communist-party-to-strangle-dissent-freedom-of-expression/story-bL3JJ4QZQb4MTeRz7gt2MJ.html
06-01-2021||World||Congress set to confirm Joe Biden’s electoral win over Donald Trump||President Donald Trump’s extraordinary effort to overturn the presidential election is going before Congress as lawmakers convene for a joint session to confirm the Electoral College vote won by Joe Biden.The typically routine proceeding Wednesday will be anything but, a political confrontation unseen since the aftermath of the Civil War as Trump mounts a desperate effort stay in office. The president’s Republican allies in the House and Senate plan to object to the election results, heeding supporters’ plea to “fight for Trump” as he stages a rally outside the White House. It’s tearing the party apart.The longshot effort is all but certain to fail, defeated by bipartisan majorities in Congress prepared to accept the results. Biden, who won the Electoral College 306-232, is set to be inaugurated Jan. 20.“The most important part is that, in the end, democracy will prevail here,” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, among those managing the proceedings, said in an interview.The joint session of Congress, required by law, will convene at 1 p.m. EST under a watchful, restless nation — months after the the Nov. 3 election, two weeks before the inauguration’s traditional peaceful transfer of power and against the backdrop of a surging COVID-19 pandemic.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who warned his party off this challenge, is expected to deliver early remarks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, set to gavel proceedings on her side of the Capitol, called it a day of “enormous historic significance.” It is about “guaranteeing trust in our democratic system,” she said in a letter to colleagues.But it is Vice President Mike Pence who will be closely watched as he presides over the session.Despite Trump’s repeated claims of voter fraud, election officials and his own former attorney general have said there were no problems on a scale that would change the outcome. All the states have certified their results as fair and accurate, by Republican and Democratic officials alike.Pence has a largely ceremonial role, opening the sealed envelopes from the states after they are carried in mahogany boxes used for the occasion, and reading the results aloud. But he is under growing pressure from Trump to tip it to the president’s favor, despite having no power to affect the outcome.While other vice presidents, including Al Gore and Richard Nixon, also presided over their own defeats, Pence supports those Republican lawmakers mounting challenges to the 2020 outcome.“I hope that our great vice president comes through for us,” Trump said at a rally in Georgia this week. “He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.”It’s not the first time lawmakers have challenged results. Democrats did in 2017 and 2005. But the intensity of Trump’s challenge is like nothing in modern times, and an outpouring of current and elected GOP officials warn the showdown is sowing distrust in government and eroding Americans’ faith in democracy.“There is no constitutionally viable means for the Congress to overturn an election,” said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., announcing his refusal to join the effort on the eve of the session.Still, more than a dozen Republican senators led by Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, along with as many as 100 House Republicans, are pressing ahead to raise objections to the state results of Biden’s win.Under the rules of the joint session, any objection to a state’s electoral tally needs to be submitted in writing by at least one member of the House and one of the Senate to be considered. Each objection will force two hours of deliberations in the House and Senate, ensuring a long day.House Republican lawmakers are signing on to objections to the electoral votes in six states — Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Arizona will likely the be the first to be disputed as the state tallies are announced in alphabetical order, and Cruz has said he will join House Republicans in objecting to that state.Hawley has said he will object to the election results from Pennsylvania, almost ensuring a second two-hour debate despite resistance from the state’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, who said the tally of Biden’s win is accurate.Sen. Kelly Loeffler may challenge the results in her state of Georgia. But it’s unclear if any of the other senators will object to any other state, as lawmakers were still devising a strategy.Democrats have the majority in the House and the Republican-led Senate is divided over the issue. Bipartisan majorities in both chambers are expected to soundly reject the objections.The group led by Cruz is vowing to object unless Congress agreed to form a commission to investigate the election, but that seems unlikely.Those with Cruz are Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.Trump has vowed to “fight like hell” to stay in office. He said at a rally in Georgia the electors voting for Biden are “not gonna take this White House!”Many of the Republicans challenging the results said they are trying to give voice to voters back home who don’t trust the outcome of the election and want to see the lawmakers fighting for Trump.Hawley defended his role saying his constituents have been “loud and clear” about their distrust of the election. “It is my responsibility as a senator to raise their concerns,” he wrote to colleagues.As criticism mounted, Cruz insisted his aim was “not to set aside the election” but to investigate the claims of voting problems. He has produced no new evidence.Both Hawley and Cruz are potential 2024 presidential contenders, vying for Trump’s base of supporters.Lawmakers are being told by Capitol officials to arrive early, due to safety precautions with protesters in Washington. Visitors, who typically fill the galleries to watch landmark proceedings, will not be allowed under COVID-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congress-set-to-confirm-joe-biden-s-electoral-win-over-donald-trump/story-GIB4LEVYBeLCi0MmrX8nKK.html
06-01-2021||World||George W Bush to attend Joe Biden’s inauguration in signal of unity||George W. Bush, the only living Republican former president, will attend the inauguration of Joe Biden later this month, a spokesman said on Tuesday night.Bush, who left office in 2009, will be accompanied by his wife, Laura, according to his chief of staff, Freddy Ford.The couple has gone to the inaugurations of Bush’s successors, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. It remains unclear whether Trump, who continues to insist, without evidence, that widespread fraud denied him re-election, will appear at the event on January 20.“I believe this will be the eighth inauguration they’ve had the privilege of attending -- President Trump’s being the most recent -- and witnessing the peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of our democracy that never gets old,” Ford said in a statement.Bush, who returned to Texas after his second term ended, has largely stayed out of the political fray that marked the Obama and Trump administrations. His brother Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, was defeated by Trump in the 2016 Republican primary contest. Their late father, George H.W. Bush, was the 41st president.The other remaining former presidents are Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Obama. All are Democrats. They gathered, along with Trump, for the elder Bush’s funeral at the Washington National Cathedral in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-w-bush-to-attend-joe-biden-s-inauguration-in-signal-of-unity/story-SCdTyVjYKbeWFIVq2fxoaO.html

We have the ability to forge a new kind of cooperation that won’t just be good for us, but for the region, and indeed for the entire world.”And then he tweeted a shout out to his Indian counterpart: “The US-India relationship was made all the stronger with a great diplomat and leader as my friend,” he wrote, adding hashtags to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Atlanta rally with President Trump and a Modi campaign slogan: #HowdyModi, #ModiHaitoMumkinHai.Pompeo has been tweeting foreign policy milestones and high points of the Trump administration such as the North Korea talks, which in the end yielded not much, and defended against criticism of being soft on Russia and harsh on European allies. The tweets have been described by some people as a “soft launch” of his run for the White House, which has been widely speculated about, but they also seemed like the secretary of state was a doing farewell run, which he cannot officially affirm because President Donald Trump has not conceded defeat and has continued to claim, falsely, that he won the November election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-have-never-been-closer-says-mike-pompeo/story-A1bpjCht0rVHKRtplDQTGO.html
06-01-2021||World||Despite pressure from Donald Trump,Mike Pence won’t interfere in election count says advisers||Despite growing pressure from President Donald Trump to help overturn his election loss, Vice President Mike Pence plans to stick to his ceremonial duties and not interfere with the election certification when presiding in Congress on Wednesday, advisers said.Trump ramped up pressure on Pence on Tuesday to block Congress’ certification of the November election results in an ongoing attempt to stay in power, after dozens of lawsuits by his campaign challenging election results failed in US courts.But the vice president, a loyal lieutenant during the four years of Trump’s often chaotic presidency, has no plans to attempt to do so, even as he seeks to show support for the Republican president’s quest. Pence is set to preside over a joint session of Congress on Wednesday as it receives the results of the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of presidential elections.President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, beat Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and, in the popular vote, by more than 7 million ballots. Trump has declined to concede the election.US states have already certified the results, and Pence’s role on Wednesday as president of the Senate is to “open all the certificates,” in the presence of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the US Constitution says.Trump has suggested Pence could do more than that. “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” Trump wrote in a tweet on Tuesday, his latest unfounded suggestion that the election was marred by widespread fraud.Pence told Trump on Tuesday he did not believe he had the power to block the certification, according to a source familiar with the subject.Trump’s tweet came after pointed remarks at a campaign rally for Republican US Senate incumbents in Georgia on Monday night, in which he expressed hope that Pence would intervene. “If he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much,” Trump said. About a dozen Republican senators, as well as dozens of Republicans in the House, plan to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress on Wednesday. The move has virtually no chance of overturning Biden’s victory.‘WILL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION’Current and former White House aides said the vice president planned to perform his ceremonial duties. “He will be very supportive of the president, but again he’ll stick to the Constitution,” one former White House official who has regular contact with Pence’s team told Reuters.The vice president would make clear in his statements that he backs Trump, while sticking to the constraints of the role, the former official said.“It is a ceremonial role. It is opening up envelopes and reading the contents of it,” he said. “That’s it.” Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, told Reuters on Monday that the vice president “will uphold the Constitution and follow the statutory law.” On Friday, a Trump-appointed judge rejected a lawsuit brought by Republican members of Congress asking Pence to reject Electoral College results, saying they had no standing for such a suit. One Trump adviser said the president had told others he would like Pence to fight harder for him. The vice president has sought, so far, to express his support without repeating the president’s false claims about the election. On Monday, during his own trip to Georgia, Pence said that Republican objections to the election would be heard, but he did not commit to taking action on them.“I share the concerns of millions of Americans about voting irregularities. And I promise you, come this Wednesday, we’ll have our day in Congress. We’ll hear the objections. We’ll hear the evidence,” he said.Following a pattern throughout their partnership, Pence has kept Trump informed about his thinking. The former adviser said Pence likely walked the president through the restrictions of his role, informed by a weekend meeting with a congressional parliamentarian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-pressure-from-donald-trump-mike-pence-won-t-interfere-in-election-count-says-advisers/story-bF0ldrYmPW62m7KOL6YNEO.html
06-01-2021||World||‘Hard miles’: Pandemic haunts new year as virus growth outpaces vaccines||Despite growing vaccine access, January is looking grim around the globe as the coronavirus resurges and reshapes itself from Britain to Japan to California, filling hospitals and threatening livelihoods anew as governments lock down businesses and race to find solutions.England headed back into lockdown. Mexico City’s hospitals hold more virus patients than ever. Germany reported one of its highest daily death tolls to date Tuesday. South Africa and Brazil are struggling to find space for the dead. Even pandemic success story Thailand is fighting an unexpected wave of infections.And as doctors face or brace for rising numbers of Covid-19 patients after end-of-year holiday gatherings, more and more countries are reporting cases of a new, more contagious variant that has already swept across Britain.January is going to be “a tough one,” said Dr. Margaret Harris, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization. “This idea that seems to be ‘Ah, we’re all sick of it. We want to look at something else. Oh, this doesn’t apply to me’ ... that’s got to go away. It really is all hands on deck.”While Britain rolled out a second vaccine this week and some US states are starting to give the second round of shots, access to inoculations globally is sharply unequal. The supply isn’t remotely close to meeting the epic demand needed to vanquish a foe that has already killed over 1.85 million people.“We are in a race to prevent infections, bring cases down, protect health systems and save lives while rolling out two highly effective and safe vaccines to high-risk populations,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “This is not easy. These are the hard miles.”England is facing a third national lockdown that will last at least six weeks, as authorities struggle to stem a surge in Covid-19 infections and relieve hospitals, where some patients are left waiting in ambulances in a parking lot for access to overcrowded wards.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s tough new stay-at-home order for England took effect at midnight. It will shut schools, restaurants and all nonessential stores and won’t be reviewed until at least mid-February. Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon imposed a lockdown that began Tuesday.The two leaders said the restrictions are needed to protect the National Health Service amid the emergence of the new variant that has sent daily infections, hospitalizations and deaths soaring.The NHS “is going through probably the toughest time in living memory,″ said Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst of the King’s Fund think tank.Elsewhere in Europe, Italy and Germany extended their Christmastime lockdowns, Spain is restricting travel, and Denmark lowered the number of people who can gather in public from 10 to five. France is likely to announce tougher measures Thursday, and Ukraine is closing schools and restaurants starting Friday.In Latin America, some warn the worst is yet to come.“The boost we are experiencing here in Brazil is much more serious than what was happening months ago,” said Domingos Alves, an adjunct professor at the University of Sao Paulo.Brazil’s number of patients in intensive care reached its highest level since August, just as the nation reopened shops and offices after the end-of-year holidays — and the vast country still hasn’t approved or received any vaccines. Some Brazilian hospitals reinstalled refrigerated containers outside to hold the corpses of Covid-19 victims.Mexico’s capital has more virus patients than at any point in the pandemic and is flying in doctors from less hard-hit states. Its beach resorts are readying for more cases after thousands of US and European tourists visited over the holidays.“Probably in the third week of January, we are going to see the system stressed more, that there will be more ambulatory cases and cases requiring hospitalization,” said Dr. Mauricio Rodriguez of Mexico’s National Autonomous University. He blamed the rise on fatigue with social distancing, mixed messages from public figures and Mexicans lowering their guard during the holidays.Zimbabwe reintroduced a curfew, banned public gatherings and indefinitely suspended the opening of schools. In South Africa, which is seeing yet another fast-spreading variant of the virus and is the continent’s hardest-hit nation, authorities re-imposed a curfew, banned liquor sales and closed most beaches.South Africa’s undertakers are struggling to cope with the rise in deaths, National Funeral Practitioners Association of SA President Muzi Hlengwa told state broadcaster SABC.“It is something that you have never seen before. ... We have run out of coffins, we have run out of space at the mortuary,” he said. “We normally have cremations during the day, but now we have cremations even at night.”The pandemic is even reaching countries that seemed to have the virus under control.Thailand is facing a surge that has infected thousands in the past few weeks, blamed on complacency and poor planning. The government is locking down large parts of the country, including the capital, Bangkok, and considering tougher measures.Japan is getting ready to declare a state of emergency this week, beefing up border controls and speeding up vaccine approval after a surge of cases around New Year’s Eve.And holiday worries aren’t over now that 2021 has arrived.Pope Francis abandoned an annual ritual of baptizing babies in the Sistine Chapel tied to Wednesday’s Epiphany holiday. Orthodox Christian countries like Russia and Greece could face more infections after they celebrate Christmas on Thursday. And China is closing schools early ahead of next month’s Lunar New Year holiday, telling migrant workers not to go home and tourists to avoid Beijing.Vaccinations are getting off to a slow start in many places. In the U.S., where over 350,000 people have died, some states are struggling to secure enough shots and organize vaccinations. The Netherlands has come under heavy criticism for being the last European Union nation to start inoculations, which it will do Wednesday. Australia isn’t planning to do so until March. And most poorer countries are even further behind.Opposition politician Geert Wilders called the Dutch government “the village idiot of Europe.”Yet India offers a glimmer of hope. Its infection rate is down significantly from a September peak, and the country is kicking off one of the largest inoculation programs in the world, aiming at vaccinating 300 million people by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hard-miles-pandemic-haunts-new-year-as-virus-growth-outpaces-vaccines/story-YCzVwK3RcBCFEjLBeeEMqN.html
06-01-2021||World||Germany extends lockdown until January 31, toughens curbs||The German government said Tuesday it is extending the country’s lockdown by three weeks until Jan. 31, tightening curbs on social contacts and planning limits on people’s movements in the worst-affected regions as it tries to reduce stubbornly high infection figures and worrying numbers of coronavirus-related deaths.Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was “absolutely necessary” to maintain restrictions, particularly in light of a more infectious variant of the virus that emerged in England.“We must reach a point where we can once again follow the chains of infection,” Merkel said after a lengthy videoconference with Germany’s 16 state governors. “Otherwise, we will just go keep going back into a lockdown after a short relaxation.”The chancellor said that restrictions on social contacts will be tightened. People will be allowed to meet only one person outside their own household.In a new move, authorities across Germany will allow people in areas with more than 200 new infections per 100,000 residents over seven days to travel only 15 kilometers (just over nine miles) from their hometown unless they have a good reason to go further.“In particular, day trips are not a good reason,” Merkel said. She pointed to a string of recent incidents in which day-trippers hoping to ski or sled have overrun winter resorts even though lifts and other facilities are closed.Merkel and the governors plan to confer again Jan. 25 on what happens after the end of the month.Germany launched a nationwide partial shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities. That failed to reduce infections, and the current lockdown -- which also closed nonessential shops and schools -- took effect Dec. 16. It was initially due to run through Jan. 10.Authorities say Germany’s reported numbers for COVID-19 cases are distorted by lower testing and delayed reporting over the Christmas and New Year’s period. The country’s disease control center says it expects to have a reliable picture of what is going on only from Jan. 17, Merkel said.But even according to the current figures, Germany is far from its declared aim of getting new confirmed cases below 50 per 100,000 residents over seven days — the maximum level at which officials say contact-tracing can work properly.On Tuesday, the infection rate stood at 134.7 per 100,000 nationwide, and 944 more deaths were reported to authorities in 24 hours, one of the highest daily death tolls yet in a country that had a relatively low COVID-19 mortality rate during the pandemic’s first phase.Merkel said the emergence of the new variant in England is “one reason more” to keep up restrictions. A few cases of the variant have been detected in Germany.The chancellor defended Germany’s approach to vaccinations following criticism fueled by perceptions that Europe has made a slow start and that the European Union was too hesitant in ordering the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, the only one so far cleared for use in the 27-nation bloc.Germany had vaccinated nearly 317,000 people by Tuesday, just over a week into the campaign. That’s a better showing than in several other EU countries, but critics have pointed to faster progress in the U.K., the United States and Israel.Merkel said it was “right and important” for the EU rather than individual countries to order vaccines for the whole bloc. She said that it “is in Germany’s interests” since the country is surrounded by other EU member nations and in the middle of the EU trade zone that relies on open borders.“A high number of vaccinated people in Germany combined with many who aren’t vaccinated in our neighborhood won’t be good for Germany,” she said. “So we don’t want national solo efforts. We think the most effective health protection for us can be attained through a common European procedure.”Health Minister Jens Spahn, who has faced criticism from inside Germany’s governing coalition, has repeatedly said that vaccinations are progressing as expected and that the slow start is because teams are first going to nursing homes to vaccinate the most vulnerable. Merkel said she thinks Spahn is doing “a great job.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-lockdown-until-january-31-toughens-curbs/story-GkZrIJ8bD1XOFmItgrLAEK.html
06-01-2021||World||Too close to call two Georgia Senate races that will decide fate of Biden’s agenda||Tight contests were developing on Tuesday in two US Senate races in Georgia that will decide which party controls the chamber and with it the power to advance or block Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals.Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler held slight leads over Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a pastor at a historic Black church in Atlanta.With about 70% of the expected vote in, Loeffler led Warnock by less than a percentage point, while Perdue was ahead of Ossoff by 1.4 percentage points, according to Edison Research.Also Read| Georgia Senate runoffs: Democrats take early leadsThe races appeared headed to a close finish, with an Edison exit poll of more than 5,200 voters finding half had voted for Republican President Donald Trump in November and half for Biden. The voters were also evenly split on whether Democrats or Republicans should control the Senate. The survey included both early voters and voters who cast ballots on Tuesday.Democrats must win both contests in Georgia to take control of the Senate. A double Democratic win would create a 50-50 split in the Senate and give Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote after she and Biden take office on Jan. 20. The party already has a narrow majority in the House of Representatives.If Republicans hold onto the Senate, they would effectively wield veto power over Biden’s political and judicial appointees as well as many of his legislative initiatives in areas such as economic relief, climate change, healthcare and criminal justice.Both Democratic candidates were running slightly ahead of Biden in the first 32 counties where 95% or more of the likely vote had been counted. Most of those counties are small and lean Republican.Ossoff was doing 0.3 percentage point better in those counties than Biden did. Warnock was doing about 0.5 percentage point better than Biden did.Also Read: Tight elections unfolding in Georgia with Biden’s agenda, Senate control at stakeThe outcome may remain in doubt for days if the margins are razor-thin.Both Biden and Trump campaigned in the state on Monday, underscoring the stakes.No Democrat has won a US Senate race in Georgia in 20 years, but opinion surveys show both races as exceedingly close. The head-to-head runoff elections, a quirk of state law, became necessary when no candidate in either race exceeded 50% of the vote in November.Biden’s narrow statewide win in the Nov. 3 election - the first for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992 - has given the party reason for optimism in a state dominated by Republicans for decades.More than 3 million Georgians voted early by mail or in person, shattering the record for runoff elections even before Election Day arrived. The two races drew nearly half a billion dollars in advertising spending since Nov. 3, a staggering total that fueled a tsunami of television commercials.In Smyrna, about 16 miles (26 km) northwest of Atlanta, Terry Deuel said he voted Republican to ensure a check on Democratic power.“The Democrats are going to raise taxes,” the 58-year-old handyman said. “And Biden wants to give everyone free money - $2,000 each or something like that for COVID stimulus? Where are we going to get the money?”Ann Henderson, 46, cast ballots at the same location for Ossoff and Warnock, saying she wanted to break Washington’s gridlock by delivering the Senate to Democrats.“It’s the social issues - civil rights, racial equality, voting rights, pandemic response,” she said. “If we take it, maybe we can get something done for a change.”U.S. equity market index futures were broadly weaker as the early results came in favoring the two Democratic candidates, signaling stocks could open on the soft side on Wednesday morning. The benchmark S&P 500 e-mini futures contract was down 0.3%, while futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq were off by 0.7%. TRUMP RAGESThe campaign’s final days were overshadowed by Trump’s continued efforts to subvert the presidential election results. On Saturday, Trump pressured Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, on a phone call to “find” enough votes to reverse Biden’s victory, falsely claiming massive fraud.Trump’s efforts to undo his loss - with some Republicans planning to object to the certification of Biden’s win when Congress meets on Wednesday to formally count the presidential vote - have caused a split in his party and condemnation from critics who accuse him of undermining democracy. At Monday’s rally in Georgia, Trump again declared the November vote “rigged,” an assertion some Republicans worried would dissuade his supporters from voting on Tuesday.His attacks appear to have undermined public confidence in the electoral system. Edison’s exit poll found more than seven in 10 were very or somewhat confident their votes would be counted accurately, down from 85% who said the same in a Nov. 3 exit poll.Gabriel Sterling, a top official in the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office, told CNN that - in his opinion - Republican losses would fall on Trump.“When you tell people your vote doesn’t count, it’s been stolen, and people start to believe that, and then you go to the two senators and tell them to ask the secretary of state to resign and trigger a civil war inside the Republican Party … all of that stems from his decision-making,” he said.If elected, Warnock would become Georgia’s first Black U.S. senator and Ossoff, at 33, the Senate’s youngest member. Perdue is a former Fortune 500 executive who has served one Senate term. Loeffler, one of the wealthiest members of Congress, was appointed a year ago to fill the seat of a retiring senator.

06-01-2021||World||Dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy figures arrested: Report||About 50 Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested by police on Wednesday under a national security law, following their involvement in an unofficial primary election last year held to increase their chances of controlling the legislature, according to local media reports.Those arrested included former lawmakers and pro-democracy activists, and the group were arrested on suspicion of subversion under the city’s national security law, according to reports by local newspaper South China Morning Post and online news platform Now News.At least seven members of Hong Kong’s largest Democratic Party — the city’s largest opposition party — were arrested, including former party chairman Wu Chi-wai. Former lawmakers, including Helena Wong, Lam Cheuk-ting, and James To, were also arrested, according to a post on the party’s Facebook page.Pro-democracy activists and lawmakers had last July held an unofficial primary election to figure out which candidates they should field in a now-postponed legislative election that would boost their chances of gaining a majority of seats in legislature. Gaining a majority would allow the pro-democracy camp to vote against what they deemed to be pro-Beijing government policies.More than 600,000 Hong Kongers voted in the primaries, although pro-Beijing lawmakers and politicians criticized the event and warned that it could be in breach of the city’s national security law, which was imposed on the city by Beijing in June to quash dissent following months of anti-government protests.Beijing also blasted the primaries as “illegal,” calling it a “serious provocation” of Hong Kong’s current electoral system.Following the handover of Hong Kong to China by the British in 1997, the semi-autonomous Chinese city has operated on a “one country, two systems” framework that affords it freedoms not found on the mainland. In recent years, Beijing has asserted more control over the city, drawing criticism that Hong Kong’s freedoms were under attack.The legislative elections, originally slated to be held in September, were later postponed for a year after Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam claimed that holding elections would be a risk to public health given the coronavirus pandemic. The pro-democracy camp denounced the postponement as unconstitutional.In November, all of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy lawmakers resigned en masse after Beijing passed a resolution that led to the disqualification of four of its camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-hong-kong-pro-democracy-figures-arrested-report/story-7diKFRlbzNErsOx5d01ObK.html
06-01-2021||World||Hundreds of Donald Trump supporters flock to DC ahead of vote||Hundreds of supporters of President Donald Trump descended on the nation’s capital Tuesday to cheer his baseless claims of election fraud a day before a congressional vote to affirm Joe Biden’s victory.Just blocks from the White House, protesters — many without masks — gathered in Freedom Plaza to decry the vote in the Electoral College As temperatures dropped to the low 40s and a steady rain swept onto the streets, hundreds remained in the plaza into nightfall.“I’m just here to support the president,” said David Wideman, a 45-year-old firefighter who traveled from Memphis, Tennessee.Wideman acknowledged he was “confused” by a string of losses from the president’s legal team in their attempt to overturn the results of the election and didn’t know what options Trump had left.“I not sure what he can do at this point, but I want to hear what he has to say,” Wideman said.Trump tweeted his support for the protesters: “Washington is being inundated with people who don’t want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won’t take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” The president was expected to personally address his supporters in Washington on Wednesday during a rally on the Ellipse, just south of the White House. The protests coincide with Wednesday’s congressional vote expected to certify the Electoral College results, which Trump continues to dispute.The rallies had local officials and law enforcement bracing for potential violent street clashes. Many businesses in downtown Washington boarded up their windows, fearful that the protest could devolve into the unrest seen in May and June when dozens of businesses were vandalised.District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called in National Guard troops to help bolster the city’s police force. She urged residents to stay away from downtown Washington and to avoid confrontations with anyone who is “looking for a fight.” But, she warned, “we will not allow people to incite violence, intimidate our residents or cause destruction in our city.” Election officials from both political parties, governors in key battleground states and Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, have said there was no widespread fraud in the election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two challenges rejected by the Supreme Court.A pro-Trump rally Dec 12 ended in violence as hundreds of Trump supporters, wearing the signature black and yellow of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, sought out confrontations with a collective of local activists attempting to bar them from Black Lives Matter Plaza, an area near the White House. At least two local Black churches had Black Lives Matter banners torn down and set ablaze.On Monday, police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, 36, after he arrived in Washington ahead of this week’s protests. Tarrio was accused of burning one of the Black Lives Matter banners in December and was found with two high-capacity firearm magazines, police said. A judge signed an order Tuesday banning Tarrio from entering the District of Columbia, with very limited exceptions related to his criminal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-donald-trump-supporters-flock-to-dc-ahead-of-vote/story-tmq8skyhAp0sdN6v0OYAPI.html

06-01-2021||World||WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange to discover if he will be freed from jail on bail||WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange will discover on Wednesday if he will be allowed to taste freedom after years of self-incarceration and jail time, following victory in his battle to avoid extradition from Britain to the United States.A British judge on Monday rejected a request from US authorities for Assange, 49, to be sent across the Atlantic to face 18 criminal charges of breaking an espionage law and conspiring to hack government computers.The charges relate to the release by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of confidential US military records and diplomatic cables which US officials say put lives in danger.Although Judge Vanessa Baraitser accepted the US legal arguments in the case, she said Assange’s mental health issues meant he would be at risk of suicide if he were extradited. The US Department of Justice says it will continue to seek his extradition and will appeal against her verdict. In the meantime, Assange, who is currently being held in the top-security Belmarsh Prison in east London, will seek to be freed on bail at a hearing on Wednesday.If Baraitser grants his request, he will be able to enjoy freedom for the first time in more than eight years.Admirers hail Australian-born Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuses of power by the United States. But detractors cast him as a dangerous figure who has undermined the security of the West, and dispute that he is a journalist.WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of secret US diplomatic cables that laid bare often critical US appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified US military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff.FREEDOM?In June 2012, Assange fled to London’s Ecuadorean embassy after losing his bid to prevent extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over alleged sex crimes.He remained in the embassy, living in confined conditions, until being dragged out in April 2019. Although the Swedish case against him had been dropped by then, he was jailed for breaching British bail conditions and his supporters forfeited sureties of 93,500 pounds ($127,076). He has remained behind bars after completing his jail term pending the outcome of the U.S. extradition case, which would include any appeal by the United States. Baraitser has previously refused him bail, saying he remained a flight risk.Assange’s partner Stella Moris, with whom he had two children while holed up in the embassy, said they could not celebrate as long as he was still in prison.“We will celebrate the day he comes home,” she said.Assange’s lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said on Monday that the extradition ruling cast a new light over the bail decision. But Nick Vamos, lawyer at London-based firm Peters & Peters and former head of extradition at Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service, said he expected his bid not to succeed.“To do so, he would have to point to some change in circumstances, for example the COVID-19 risk in Belmarsh, other than the extradition judgment in his favour,” Vamos said. “I expect his bail application to fail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wikileaks-julian-assange-to-discover-if-he-will-be-freed-from-jail-on-bail/story-hwOSKFmFO9SOpUczuTEfUN.html
06-01-2021||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un opens congress with policy failures admission||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened his country’s first ruling party congress in five years with an admission of policy failures and a vow to set new developmental goals, state media reported Wednesday.The Workers’ Party Congress met in Pyongyang on Tuesday with thousands of delegates and observers in attendance, the Korean Central News Agency reported.In his opening speech, KCNA cited Kim as saying the developmental goals set in a 2016 congress “were not met in almost all areas to a great extent.“We should further promote and expand the successes and victories that we’ve achieved through our painstaking efforts but prevent us from having the painful lessons again,” he said.While underlining the need to start the work to develop the economy under a new five-year plan, Kim reviewed the present status of North Korea’s metal, chemical, electric and other key industries and set unspecified tasks for future development, according to KCNA.This year’s congress comes as Kim faces the toughest challenge of nine-year rule because of what he has called “multiple crises” __ an economy hammered by pandemic-caused border closings, a series of natural disasters last summer and persistent U.S.-led sanctions. During Tuesday’s speech, Kim described the difficulties as “the worst of all” and “unprecedented.”He also is likely to see US policy change under President-elect Joe Biden, who unlike President Donald Trump is expected to avoid top-down summit diplomacy with him and maintain punishing sanctions on the North, unless Kim takes significant steps toward denuclearization.Officially, the congress is the party’s top decision-making body, though key day-to-day decisions are made by Kim and his inner circle. The congress would still provide Kim with a chance to solidity his authority by announcing new goals, naming loyal lieutenants to top posts and calling for a stronger unity behind his leadership.It’s now known how long this year’s congress would be held. It was held for four days in 2006, five days in 1980 and 12 days in 1970.North Korea’s yearlong closure of its border with China, its biggest trading partner, to guard against COVID-19 is taking a heavy toll on its already-troubled economy. Bilateral trade volume plummeted by about 79% in the first 11 months of last year from the corresponding period in 2019, analyst Song Jaeguk at Seoul’s IBK Economic Research Institute. North Korea’s GDP was estimated to have contracted by 9.3% in 2020, he said.Following the sharp drop in external trade, North Korea experienced a fourfold increase of imported foodstuffs like sugar and seasonings at markets while its factory operation rate dropped to its lowest level since Kim took power because of a shortage of raw materials, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in late November.“I can’t think about any words to describe how difficult situation the North Koreans are going through now, rather than saying they’re suffering tremendously,” Song said. “If the coronavirus pandemic continues, they’ll suffer harder.”Many experts say North Korea has no other option but to maintain its border closure as the pandemic continues worldwide, because its public health care system remain broken and a major outbreak could cause a dire consequence. Despite taking draconian anti-virus measures, North Korea has steadfastly argued it hasn’t found a single virus case on its soil, a claim widely disputed by foreign experts.During his speech, Kim said the surest and fastest ways to resolve the ongoing difficulties is further bolstering internal strength. Observers predicted Kim would use the congress to call for building a stronger self-reliant economy and launching new productivity campaigns to squeeze his people for more labor. Last week, North Korea said it successfully completed a 80-day labor campaign.During the congress, the North may issue conciliatory messages in consideration of ties with the incoming Biden administration while underscoring its traditional ties with China and Russia, Seoul’s Unification Ministry said in a report on the outlook for the congress.Kim didn’t mention the United States in his Tuesday speech.Some experts say Kim won’t likely launch a major provocation anytime soon because that would further dim the prospect for early talks with the Biden government, which faces many urgent domestic issues. But they say Kim may resume high-profile missile tests when the US and South Korea militaries conduct their annual springtime military drills.Trump canceled or scaled back many regular military drills with South Korea to provide more space for diplomacy.The Kim-Trump diplomacy has largely remained deadlocked for about two years over a US refusal to provide North Korea with extensive sanctions relief in exchange of a partial surrender of its nuclear capability. In its late November intelligence briefing, South Korea’s spy agency said Kim had ordered diplomats abroad not to provoke the United States due to worries about Biden’s new approach on his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-opens-congress-with-policy-failures-admission/story-D5Gitct22Y23GIBPFHFO1L.html
06-01-2021||World||Donald Trump orders ban on WeChat Pay and other ‘Chinese’ apps||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered a ban on Alipay, WeChat Pay and other apps linked to Chinese companies, saying they could route user information to the government in Beijing.The executive order is to take effect in 45 days, just weeks after Trump is replaced in the White House by President-elect Joe Biden.A senior administration official said the order and its implementation has not been discussed with the “potential incoming Biden administration.”The move by Trump comes after previous executive orders aimed at banning TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, were derailed by court rulings indicating Trump overstepped his legal authority.The apps targeted by the new ban were chosen because of the extremely high number of downloads, which meant tens of millions of users could be at risk of having their data harnessed, according to the administration official.“We are trying to articulate to the world and take steps to stop the encroachment of China’s big data strategy -- photos, text messages, phone calls to parents -- from being fed into this mass tool for global oppression,” the official said.Trump’s order calls for the secretary of commerce to review and assess what further apps should be included in the ban.It specifically named Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay and WPS Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-orders-ban-on-wechat-pay-and-other-chinese-apps/story-te0r0AxQnAIRnzdyjTHcOP.html
06-01-2021||World||WHO disappointed China hasn’t granted entry to coronavirus experts||The World Health Organization expressed dissappointment over China not finalising the permissions for the arrival of the team that was to investigate the origin of the coronavirus, said world health body chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday (local time).“Over the past 24 hours, members of the international scientific team on COVID-19 virus origins began traveling from their home countries to China. Today we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalised the necessary permissions for the team’s arrival in China,” he said.The WHO Chief said that the official visit was as per arrangements jointly developed between WHO, the Chinese government, and countries for which the team was meant to travel through on their way to Wuhan.He added, “I am very disappointed with this news given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute. But I have been in contact with senior Chinese officials and I have once again made clear that the mission is a priority for WHO and the international team.”Tedros said that the global health body is eager to get the mission underway “as soon as possible”.Beijing had previously said it would give the WHO’s expert team full access to investigate the virus origin.While China has dismissed criticism of its handling of early cases that emerged in late 2019, some leaders including US President Donald Trump have questioned Beijing’s actions during the outbreak. Trump has often called it the ‘ChinaVirus’ and has repeatedly called for the Chinese government to be held accountable for “this plague”.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also slammed the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for continuing to spread disinformation regarding Covid-19, and obstructing the investigation of the World Health Organization (WHO) in finding out the origin and spread of the virus.Sino-Australian relations have been in a downward spiral since April, when Canberra infuriated Beijing by proposing an independent international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was detained in May for her live stream reporting from Wuhan over COVID-19, has been sentenced to four years of imprisonment in late December, Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) reported.She has been convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for her reporting in the chaotic initial stages of the outbreak.As per the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus cases across the globe currently stands at over 85 million cases and 1.8 million deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-disappointed-china-hasn-t-granted-entry-to-coronavirus-experts/story-lGqp3IaBahSvUsUNzO2akL.html

06-01-2021||India||BJP national chief JP Nadda to visit poll-bound Bengal a month after convoy attack||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda will be visiting West Bengal for a day on January 9, a month after his convoy was stoned at Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district on December 10. Nadda will attend political programmes in the Katwa area of East Burdwan district, located about 145 km to the south-west of Kolkata. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha MP from East Burdwan, Sunil Mandal, joined the BJP on December 19. Security arrangements for Nadda have been tightened manifold in view of the attack, BJP leaders said. Instead of driving down to Burdwan from Kolkata he will fly in a chopper. “Nadda will attend a rally and have lunch at the home of a party supporter in the Dainhat area. He is also scheduled to visit the famous Sarbamangala temple in Burdwan town,” said a state BJP leader. “Rest of the schedule has not been finalized yet,” he added. Union home minister Amit Shah is also scheduled to visit Bengal on January 30. Shah visited West Midnapore and Birbhum districts on December 19 and 20 respectively during a two-day trip. His visit was marked by the biggest defection from the TMC. Led by heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari, six sitting TMC legislators, three other MLAs from the Left and Congress and the Burdwan East Lok Sabha member joined the BJP in Shah’s presence at a massive rally in Midnapore town. On the afternoon of December 10, the cavalcade of the BJP national president was stoned in South 24 Parganas, leaving several national and state leaders bleeding and bruised in the state for the first time. The incident took place at Shirakol in Diamond Harbour, the Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew who has emerged as the BJP’s main political target in recent weeks. Several BJP workers were allegedly assaulted as well in the attack. The incident was telecast live by several news channels. Vehicles of some media houses were also damaged. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, national vice-president Mukul Roy and national secretary Anupam Hazra were hurt by pieces of stones and shards of glass from the shattered windshields of their cars. The Centre transferred three Indian Police Service (IPS) officers to other states after the incident. They were in charge of the police arrangements made for Nadda’s trip. The state government, however, refused to comply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-national-chief-jp-nadda-to-visit-poll-bound-bengal-a-month-after-convoy-attack/story-ce2UE3L21NQ8yumIfTc8aI.html

Worried, the Union Health Ministry has decided to rush a team of experts headed by Director of the National Centre for Disease Control Dr S K Singh to the state on Friday. After a brief lull, Covid-19 cases have gone up in the state and the test positivity rate also rose to 10.01% on Wednesday. According to state health ministry data, out of 63,891 tested 6394 people have emerged positive. With 25 new deaths, the Covid-19 death toll went up to 3209 and total active cases are 65,057 in the state currently. What is worrying is that six cases of the mutant strain were also reported from the state two days ago. Among the infected 51 are health workers. Kerala has been consistently reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases for more than a week surpassing Maharashtra. In the last one week, 35,038 new cases were logged. Despite the rise in active cases, the state government put up a brave face saying its mortality rate is the lowest in the country, 0.4 per cent against the national average of 1.30 per cent. “We expected a big hike in Covid-19 cases after the local body elections. But still numbers are under control,” said state health minister K K Shailaja. With a high density of population (860 people per square km) and the recent surge in virus cases the government has asked the Centre to give top priority to the state while distributing vaccine vials. “Our strategy was to delay the peak and restrict casualties and we succeeded in both. Since the state’s density of population is quite high and prevalence of high incidences of lifestyle disease, we need to get more vaccines in the first round itself,” said the minister. Kerala was the first state to report a coronavirus case in the country-- a China-returned medical student in January. Though cases have surged in the last couple of weeks its death rate is still the lowest in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-65-057-active-covid-19-cases-kerala-s-positivity-rate-touches-10-after-brief-lull/story-kaWArO2ZxpdsDJuyX72ktI.html

Before coming to Arunachal Pradesh, he visited forward areas in Sikkim and interacted with senior officers and personnel deployed there, the IAF said on Twitter. Bhadauria is on a visit to “air bases and advance landing grounds” in the Eastern Air Command, it noted.The IAF chief, in his maiden visit to Arunachal Pradesh, called on Governor Brig (Retd) B D Mishra and Chief Minister Pema Khandu and discussed issues pertaining to the national security, recruitment of the state’s youth into the force and the IAF’s humanitarian missions in the state.Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have borders with China.

06-01-2021||India||India says UN peacekeeping ops should be backed with proper mandate and resources||India on Wednesday said the UN’s peacekeeping and special political missions should be backed with a proper mandate and resources even as it called for a permanent slot for Africa in a reformed UN Security Council. New Delhi’s position on these issues was outlined in foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s intervention in a debate in the UN Security Council on the theme of “Challenges of maintaining peace and security in fragile contexts”. This was the first key meeting of the council since India became a non-permanent member of the body for two years in January. Shringla underlined the need to ensure the UN’s presence on the ground, particularly its peacekeeping operations and special political missions, are “sufficiently mandated and resourced to implement a comprehensive understanding of peace and security”. “Having contributed significantly to UN peacekeeping in Africa for six decades, we have seen how peacekeeping missions are struggling to implement ambitious mandates. Peacekeeping missions should have a clear and well thought out exit strategy,” he said.Shringla also said the time has come for the Security Council to introspect about the fact that the African continent doesn’t “have a single voice amongst the permanent membership to defend its own interests” at a time when “more than half of the country issues on the council’s agenda pertain to Africa”. “We need to correct this historical anomaly, and collectively support the Ezulwini consensus,” he said, referring to the African Union’s position on the need to make the Security Council more representative and democratic. The debate was held under Tunisia’s presidency of the Security Council for January, and focused on the African continent. Shringla said India and African countries have worked together for a fairer global governance system. Under its development partnership with Africa, India has executed 189 developmental projects in 37 African states, while another 77 projects are being completed with a total outlay of $12.86 billion. India supplied medicines to several African countries to help them fight Covid-19 and it responded to the UN secretary general’s call to upgrade its peacekeeping hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan, he said. At the India-Africa Forum Summit held in 2015, India also announced lines of credit worth $10 billion and grant assistance of $600 million to African countries. India is Africa’s third-largest export destination, and Indian firms have invested over $54 billion in Africa, he said. Pointing to the serious challenges posed by the growth of terrorism, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa, Shringla said initiatives such as African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), G-5 Sahel Joint Force and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) need more robust support from the Security Council. India is also engaged in capacity-building of security forces in several African countries and counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism training forms a significant part of defence training programmes, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-un-peacekeeping-ops-should-be-backed-with-proper-mandate-and-resources/story-GGc6XFZxBS4ikfjwkAp35K.html

The matter figured in a video-teleconference between the two leaders, who discussed key issues such as the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, bilateral relations, and regional and global issues, particularly India-European Union (EU) ties. Modi appreciated Merkel’s long-standing role in providing stable and strong leadership on the European and global stages, and thanked her for guiding the growth of the India-Germany strategic partnership, according to readout from the external affairs ministry. “The Prime Minister briefed Chancellor Merkel on the developments in India with regard to vaccine development and assured Chancellor Merkel of India’s commitment to deploy its capacities for the benefit of the world,” the readout said. Modi also conveyed his best wishes for the early containment of a new wave of infections in Germany and other European countries. He also welcomed Germany’s decision to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA), and expressed his desire to strengthen cooperation on the platform of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). Noting that this year marks the 70th anniversary of relations between India and Germany and 20th anniversary of the strategic partnership, the two leaders agreed to hold the sixth inter-governmental consultations at an early date and to set an ambitious agenda for the discussions. Without giving details, German government spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted that the two leaders discussed the pandemic, advances in vaccine development and production and the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-dials-chancellor-merkel-promises-to-use-vaccine-capabilities-to-help-other-nations/story-yFa9BywisaF1RRRnjt90dN.html
06-01-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee’s evening meeting with Governor Dhankhar sparks speculation||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited the Raj Bhawan on Wednesday evening and held talks with governor Jagdeep Dhankhar for around an hour. The government maintained silence on Banerjee’s visit which made news in view of the increasing acrimony in the relationship between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Dhankhar over issues ranging from law and order in Bengal to ruling party leaders branding the Prime Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) central leaders and ministers visiting the state for poll campaign as “outsiders.” The governor, who targeted the TMC on these issues even during a visit to a temple in Midnapore district a few hours before Banerjee called on him, wrote a short tweet around 7 pm, saying he and his wife greeted the chief minister. He also posted a photograph. “I don’t know anything about the conversation that took place but it is possible that the chief minister may have plans to induct new faces in the state cabinet where two positions are lying vacant. Former transport minister Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP in December and deputy sports minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla resigned from the TMC on Tuesday,” a senior TMC Lok Sabha member said on condition of anonymity. “If the chief minister inducts new ministers, they have to be sworn in by the governor. That won’t be necessary if the portfolios are distributed among others ministers,” said the TMC MP. A second TMC leader said the chief minister could have met the governor to invite him to the special session of the state assembly that the government wants to hold to pass resolutions against the Centre’s new farm laws. On Monday, while addressing a media conference, Banerjee had said, “We will hold an assembly session for one or two days and we will introduce a resolution demanding withdrawal of the farm laws. We will try to ensure that the resolution is passed unanimously. I know the BJP will oppose it but expect other parties to support it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-evening-meeting-with-governor-dhankhar-sparks-speculation/story-mCgXmZEyF4flWxNswuecDK.html

Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhad said on Tuesday that Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had agreed to “fully set our differences aside” with Qatar at a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit at Al-Ula. The four countries had cut ties with Qatar in 2017 and imposed a partial blockade, accusing the gas and oil-rich state of backing acts of terrorism. Qatar, which had angered the other states because of its close ties with Iran and the broadcasts of the Al-Jazeera news channel, had dismissed these allegations. Following the restoration of full ties between the five countries, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “We were pleased to note the positive developments at the recently concluded GCC Summit in Al-Ula, Saudi Arabia. We welcome the reconciliation and rapprochement between countries in the region. “India shares [an] excellent relationship with all the countries in the GCC, which is in our extended neighbourhood and we hope that such encouraging developments will further promote peace, progress and stability in the region.” Srivastava added: “We will continue to work with GCC countries for the strengthening of our bilateral cooperation. We also look forward to enhance our institutional dialogue and partnership with the GCC.” The GCC states are home to some nine million Indian expatriates, with a majority based in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

I feel he would fulfil my request,” said former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, while talking to reporters after the conclusion of the party’s national executive meeting in Patna on Wednesday.Manjhi’s statement came hours after the announcement of polls for two vacant Council seats on January 28 by the Election Commission (EC), which could make distribution of seats among the allies in the NDA a tricky affair.The by-election has been necessitated due to resignation of former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and former MLC Binod Narayan Jha.Jha was elected as MLA from Benipatti in recent Assembly polls while Sushil Modi has been elected to the Rajya Sabha.Incidentally, Manjhi clarified that one Council seat to be sought would not be filled by any of his family members but would go to a party leader. “There will be no one from my family who would be MLC now,” he said.Manjhi’s elder son Santosh Kumar Suman is a sitting MLC and also a minister in the Nitish Kumar cabinet.Besides, the HAM(S) chief said his party would be contesting the West Bengal Assembly polls and decide on tickets after consulting NDA allies.The ruling JD(U) has already announced its plans to contest the assembly polls in the neighbouring state.The former CM said his party was in favour of reservations in the private sector, judiciary and also a common education system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jitan-ram-manjhi-pushes-for-cabinet-legislative-council-seat-in-bihar/story-LRo8gYA99rbrmXgv7z2kcJ.html

An FIR was registered under Section 17 & 18 of UAPA, Section 153-A, 295-A and 124A of Indian Penal code and section 65, 72 and 75 of IT Act.It was alleged in the FIR that petitioners were going to Hathras with intentions to take undue benefit of the rape and murder case, disturb law and order situation and fuel caste based riots in the state. The FIR also stated that the petitioners had received huge foreign funding to orchestrate riots.The bench comprising justice Surya Prakash Kesarwani and justice Shamim Ahmed passed the order on Tuesday on a petition filed by Atiq-ur- Rehman from Muzaffarnagar, Masood from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur.Seeking release from jail, the petition has challenged the order of the magistrate by which the three were sent to judicial remand calling it unlawful.The petitioners said that the Mathura chief judicial magistrate (CJM) did not have the jurisdiction to try the matter or remand the petitioners to custody. It added that Rehman and Masood were going to meet the bereaved family while Alam was ferrying them to the destination.The court has fixed January 27 as the next date of hearing in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-case-allahabad-hc-seeks-centre-up-govt-s-replies-on-arrest-of-alleged-pfi-members/story-2amoDxtfKbp1eEH0e0gbJJ.html
06-01-2021||India||Macron’s top advisor Emmanuel Bonne to meet NSA Ajit Doval as France turns the screws on Pak||French President Emmanuel Macron’s top advisor Emmanuel Bonne and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval will tomorrow hold the annual strategic dialogue between the two countries that is expected to review the progress made in the 10,000 megawatt nuclear power plant to be set up in Maharashtra and building the six diesel-electric submarines under project P-75I for the Indian navy. Besides, the two top advisors will also share notes on improving maritime security and developments in the Indo Pacific region, particularly in context of China’s aggressive moves.Bonne, President Macron’s diplomatic advisor, is expected to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and meet foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Friday.“The two sides will hold discussions on wide-ranging bilateral and global issues,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement ahead of the strategic dialogue that will seek to reinforce deep ties between the two countries. France has been one of India’s most reliable partners in Europe for years but the two countries had inched closer over the last few years that led to a deal to buy 36 Rafale aircraft.When French defence minister Florence Parly was in India last year in context of the induction of the omni-role fighter jets in the Indian Air Force, she and defence minister Rajnath Singh had agreed to stick to the Rafale template of government-to-government deals for future defence purchases.India is expected to sign a $2.5-billion contract this year for 56 medium transport aircraft under the Make-in-India initiative. India is also looking at acquisition of six Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker aircraft for expanding the Indian Air Force (IAF) strike capability through latest mid-air refuelers as well as the Safran aircraft engines under the ‘Make in India’ programme. The jet engines, which are used by Dassault Aviation for the Rafale jets, could be used to power the twin-engine advanced multi-role combat aircraft developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) till it develops its own version.Officials said France had responded positively to New Delhi’s concerns about access of military technology to countries which have adversarial relations with India, a reference to Pakistan. France has decided against helping Pakistan upgrade its fleet of Mirage fighter jets, air defence system and Agosta 90B class submarines, a decision that was timed after Prime Minister Imran Khan’s loud criticism of French President Macron. Around the same time, France also conveyed to Qatar, which had earlier bought Rafale jets for its air force, not to allow any Pakistan-origin technicians near the aircraft for maintenance.Pakistan watchers said that it was on account of the French government’s restrictive approach that the Mirage 3 and Mirage 5 fighter jets in Pakistan air force’s inventory did not participate in last month’s joint aerial exercises, Eagle-IX, involving the Chinese and Pakistan air force.Doval and Bonne are also expected to discuss India’s other neighbour, China, in some detail, particularly given French concerns around Beijing attempting to flex muscles in the Indo-Pacific region. China has, for instance, been trying to get people in the French island group of New Caledonia to vote for independence in the three referendums being held to decide its future. This island group with an area of 18,575 sq km, located in the South Pacific east of Australia, is one of the 16 overseas territories of France that are home to 1.5 million French citizens.In October last year, France had formalised its interest in the Indo-Pacific when President Macron appointed Christophe Penot, one of his country’s most senior diplomats as the first French envoy for the Indo-Pacific. As part of this focus, France has forged new initiatives such as the trilateral dialogue launched with India and Australia in September last to enhance cooperation and strengthen multilateralism in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nuke-power-jet-engines-and-submarine-review-on-ajit-doval-table-at-meet-with-french-advisor/story-IHWpq2EC6bbEaxFVpZNIzH.html
06-01-2021||India||As snow blankets Kashmir, administration draws flak for slow response||The administration in Kashmir on Wednesday came under fire from Srinagar residents who accused them of incompetence in clearing roads and restoring normal power supply amid heavy snowfall since Sunday.People in summer capital Srinagar were aghast as the main roads were not cleared properly even after three days. Main roads and link roads in many areas of Srinagar were still under snow causing problems in commute even for emergency purposes.The roads leading to tertiary care hospitals like Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) Hospital in Old City and Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) at Soura on the city’s outskirts were still dangerous for driving.“The roads at Karan Nagar are still covered with snow. There is a lot of water. The vehicles were still slipping there causing traffic jams. This is the state of our emergency road which leads to SMHS hospital. The officials are saying many things on Twitter but on the ground, the situation is pathetic,” said Faisal Ahmad, a resident of Karan Nagar.“Roads leading to SMHS hospital like Chattabal, Zampa Kadal etc are not cleared of snow. I am a doctor and can’t even think of taking my vehicle out in case of any emergency. I wonder what they are doing on ground although they seem quite busy on Twitter,” said Mohammad Shahid. Patients going to SKIMS pointed out that snow-covered roads were causing huge problems in reaching the hospital.“We have cleared the snow inside the institute and on its foot paths and the road approaching to the institute from 90-feet side is cleared of snow. However, there is snow in the Soura chowk. The road from Old City side is being cleared,” said medical superintendent SKIMS, Dr Farooq Jan.The main roads of the old city are full of slush and water. “For the past three days this Nowpora-Khanyar road has not been cleared. Today afternoon they came with a machine but it was a half-hearted effort. The snow is still on the road there. It is the first time I am seeing the administration very lackadaisical in its approach,” said Mohammad Ashiq, an autorickshaw driver in Khanyar.“I have not been able to move out my auto these days because of the blocked road,” he said.The Srinagar administration on Tuesday had asked residents to avoid unnecessary travel. But despite very little transport on roads, the people said that the snow clearance efforts of the Mechanical Engineering Department(MED) and Srinagar Municipal Corporation(SMC) were not up to the mark.The city center Lal Chowk, which is the business hub of Srinagar, was covered with snow on Wednesday morning.“Normally the city centre would be cleared within hours but this is the first time I have seen Lal Chowk blocked for three days. Yesterday main Residency Road was completely closed. Today they came with a machine like a tractor but it was not effective. It only cleared the paths, not the huge road of Lal Chowk,” said Sakib Altaf, a resident of Lal Chowk. “Even the power situation is not what should be in an important area like Lal Chowk. It is erratic,” he said.Srinagar district administration in a tweet assured that they were on their toes. “This is to assure our residents that our entire administration is on its toes in efforts to clear the snow and restore the affected services. With unrelenting snowfall this has been an unprecedented situation. Please continue to cooperate with us — we so appreciate it. Thanks,” it said.SMC mayor Junaid Matto also took to Twitter to say that they have to only clear interior lanes. “SMC doesn’t clear main roads. SMC does interior lanes and by-lanes. Main roads are done by MED and R&B,” he said.“I have asked for four zonal control rooms to be set up immediately for snow-clearance of lanes and by-lanes by SMC. Roads not in our jurisdiction. All four control rooms to be led by senior officers. We won’t stop till we clear all lanes,” he said.Calls to MED landline number which the Srinagar administration has issued on social media to contact in case of assistance during snowfall yielded no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-snow-blankets-kashmir-administration-draws-flak-for-slow-response/story-0F2zgmhpDVdCPEsrvy6lkN.html
06-01-2021||India||Rapid response teams formed, alert sounded over bird flu scare in Telangana||With several states prepping to contain the H5N8 strain of bird flu, the Telangana forest department on Wednesday announced a series of measures to identify the causes of death of any bird in the state and also sounded an alert. Telangana principal chief conservation of forests and chief wildlife warden R Sobha said instructions had been issued to the authorities of zoological parks in Hyderabad and Warangal, besides various birds and wildlife sanctuaries in the state to constitute Rapid Response Teams for conducting patrolling in areas where migratory birds congregate. Similar directions have been given to all the circle heads and division heads. The field officers have been instructed to collect the carcasses of birds during this period, pack them safely and send them to veterinary science laboratories for analysing and identifying the cause of death, she said. Sobha said during the winter season, a large number of migrant birds from Northern region of Himalayas come to southern states. “These birds nest and breed in water bodies. Since these birds travel over long distances crossing several states, it is essential to keep track of these birds at the nesting and breeding sites. Suitable instructions have been issued in this regard,” she said. The PCCF requested the general public also to be alert during the period and if any dead bird is noticed, they can pass the information to the wildlife crime control cell at Aranya Bhavan, Hyderabad with toll free number 18004255364, which functions around the clock. She said district forest officers had been asked to coordinate with animal husbandry as well as the district administration in taking required preventive measures and vigil to detect death of birds. Telangana minister for animal husbandry T Srinivasa Yadav, who held a meeting with higher officials of the department following an alert from the Centre, said there were no reports of any bird flu cases from any part of the state so far. “We have collected 276 random samples from various poultry farms and tested them for bird flu, but did not find any trace of the disease. We have, however, alerted the officials at all levels to prevent the outbreak of the virus,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-response-teams-formed-alert-sounded-over-bird-flu-scare-in-telangana/story-9ak0xTdWqLCePkyQgAOnJO.html

With last year being all dull for everyone, it’s time to restart our lives,” he said.“I was away from playback singing for some time and was concentrating on my online channel. Also, I was busy composing for OTT series. As I have a studio at home, I was constantly working on music for commercials, albums and series,” said ‘Tanha Dil’ and ‘Chand Sifarish’ singer.Shaan is currently working on a few projects, including some big banners. Speaking more about them, he said, “For me, music matters the most, and if it’s happening, I am all happy. This year I will be doing a lot of singing for films that too under banners like Yash Raj, with whom I worked a long time back.”“So, it is kind of back to a business stint for me as a singer,“ he said laughingly.“Also, I am working on an album based on my late father’s compositions and writings of poet Nida Fazli. It has been a long-waited dream that will be fulfilled this year, hopefully.”The ‘Suno Na’ singer believes that recreating history is not easy for creative people, “Every time I am asked when we will get to hear a song like ‘Tanha Dil’. But the fact is that it’s unfair to limit creativity and compare it to past projects. When we did ‘Tanha…’ or ‘Loveology’ we never thought it would be such a huge hit. So, you never know what’s in the store.”At the moment, Shaan is a proud father, as both his sons have started their musical journey. “Yes, I am not only proud, but I’m thrilled that both my sons are so passionate about music. The kind of passion and love I always wanted them to have for music,” he shares.The New Year will also see the passionate singer on TV as a part of a musical show - Indian pro music league, a musical reality show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/if-music-is-happening-i-am-all-happy/story-7dO0NiCPD1COTCkfY1cBoM.html

Eight people were also rescued after their vehicles got trapped in a mudslide near Panthial in Ramban district late Tuesday, officials said on Wednesday. The highway has been closed since Sunday following heavy snowfall and incessant rains which triggered multiple landslides. Additional director general of police, T Namgyal said there has been fresh snowfall on both ends of Jawahar Tunnel and landslides at several places along the highway. Landslides and mudslides at Panthial, Marog, Mom Passi, Digdol, Mehad and Dhalwas were yet to be cleared. Although the road stretch between south portal of Jawahar Tunnel and Banihal was cleared of snow, the stretch between north portal of the tunnel and Quazigund was still to be cleared. Officials said stranded vehicles along the highway have been taken to safer places amid continuous rain and snowfall. “The road clearance operation is going on at a war footing to ensure early restoration of traffic on the highway which is blocked at over a dozen places including Samroli, Nashri, Dalwas, Peera, Chanderkote, Cafeteria Morh, Marog, Monkey Morh, Mom Passi, Seeri, Kela Morh, Panthiyal, Sherbibi, Rattanbass and Ramsu,” a traffic department official said.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the weather was expected to improve from Thursday. “Weather is improving gradually and significant improvement is expected from Wednesday afternoon but light rain and snow will occur at scattered places of Jammu and Kashmir for the next 24 hours,” said IMD director Dr Sonam Lotus. “Now onwards, there is no forecast of any major snowfall. From Thursday weather is likely to remain mainly dry till January 14,” he added. The Traffic police have said that no fresh traffic movement will be allowed on the highway on Thursday as well. “On January 7, no vehicular movement shall be allowed on Jammu-Srinagar highway from Jammu towards Srinagar and vice-versa in view of snow accumulation around the Jawahar Tunnel, landslides/shooting stones/mudslides at Samroli, Dalwas, Cafeteria Morh, Sitaram Passi, Bai Nallah, Digdol Army Camp, Magerkot, Gangroo, Salad,” said a traffic official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-highway-remains-closed-for-4th-day-8-rescued-from-mudslides-in-ramban/story-Km5Tu8tHHJgraP1OGb0tMI.html

States and UT shall not dilute guidelines issued under DM act in any manner,” ANI quoted MHA as saying. “In view of the above, Govt of Tamil Nadu is requested to immediately issue necessary order to bring their Guidelines in line with the MHA guidelines dated 28 December 2020 and inform compliance to this Ministry,” it said.Also Read: India records 18,088 Covid-19 cases in last 24 hours, death toll over 1.5 lakhCinemas were running with 50 per cent capacity to ensure social distancing since November 10 following the Centre’s directives but theatres saw only a few patrons. Tamil Nadu’s revenue and disaster management department passed an order on January 4 to increase the seating capacity in cinemas, theatres and multiplexes to 100 per cent by following standard operating procedures and Covid-19 precautionary measures during showtime. It came after a representation from the Theatre Owners Association. The industry has been severely hit during the coronavirus pandemic as several films opened on the OTT platforms.Also Read: US could soon give 1 million Covid-19 vaccinations a day, says Anthony Fauci“Based on the decrease in the COVID-19 cases day by day, the theatre owners association have represented to the government to increase the seating capacity of cinemas, theatres and multiplexes,” the state government’s order outlined. Tamil Nadu’s cinema halls despite the state government’s announcement evoked a mixed response as four citizens from the state were detected with the new mutated strain of Covid-19, which was first detected in the UK. Experts believe that sitting in close proximity with other people in public places like cinema halls increases the chances of getting infected by a contagious disease and poses as risk as Covid-19 cases continue to recorded across the nation.

The industry is still reeling from the effects of Covid-19 as 60% of the 1,104 theatres in the state remain closed due to the pandemic. “Since quality films did not get released and as spectators did not turn up, sixty per cent of theatres are closed down in Tamil Nadu,”Joint Secretary of Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association S Srither was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Movie theatre owners were hoping that the recent order by the Tamil Nadu government would help the industry to shed some losses as films were scheduled to release during the Pongal festival and it would generate a higher footfall. The MHA order is likely to affect the revenue of Tamil Nadu theatre owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/centre-asks-tamil-nadu-to-revoke-order-for-100-capacity-in-cinema-halls/story-JuBROpWZTPEwMOChEoYL0K.html
06-01-2021||India||India’s new science policy proposes lateral entry of scientists in related ministries||A new draft policy on science and technology has proposed up to 25 percent lateral recruitment of scientists in related ministries.The purpose is to attract domain experts who are needed in science-related ministries to handle issues linked to emerging technologies and advancements, according to officials.According to the draft Science Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) 2020, these could be scientists with domain expertise in different fields either from autonomous institutions or the private field.“Lateral recruitment (minimum 25 percent) of professionals and subject matter experts will be mandated in all scientific ministries for a finite duration with comparable roles, responsibilities and empowerment to a regular official,” the draft policy states.Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, said experts are needed in ministries as science progresses and new technologies emerge.“In scientific ministries and departments when scientists are recruited, over a period of time, they are not able to practise science. Many a time, there are expert groups from outside the ministry or department that are formed for a specific field depending on the need,” Sharma said.The purpose behind the proposed lateral recruitment is to attract domain experts. “So, they can spend more time in the ministries/ departments and deal with subjects of their expertise,” Sharma said.In science-related ministries and departments, the position for the top post is mostly advertised. However, if the draft policy is accepted, this can lead to the lateral entry of experts at the mid-level.Currently, domain experts can apply for posts in autonomous institutions of the scientific ministries.The DST, along with the Office of Principal Scientific Adviser, started the process of formulating the STIP 2020 last year. The policy was to be out by the year-end but has been slightly delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The draft STIP has been uploaded by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) on its website. The DST has also invited suggestions, inputs and comments for making changes by January 25.Addressing reporters, Akhilesh Gupta, Head of the STIP Secretariat, said over 300 rounds of consultation took place while drafting the policy. More than one lakh emails were received during the drafting of the policy, he said.“There was a wide range of consultation that has taken place. The youngest person was a 10-year-old and the oldest was an 85-year-old.  We also took great care to have at least one-third women scientists in every consultation we organised,” Gupta added.For the first time, the states as well the diaspora were consulted in making the science policy, he noted.The entire process of drafting a policy was completed in a year, Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-new-science-policy-proposes-lateral-entry-of-scientists-in-related-ministries/story-wWxysQPLlcYaFcvzyiZzIJ.html
06-01-2021||India||Ahead of launch, Centre issues warning against fake ‘Co-WIN’ apps||As the government is working to launch the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) app, the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday warned people against sharing any personal details on some applications on app stores with the same name as that of the official one. The health ministry said the official platform will be adequately publicised on its launch.“Some apps named ‘CoWIN’ apparently created by unscrupulous elements to sound similar to upcoming official platform of Govt, are on App stores. Don’t download or share personal information on these. Dept official platform will be adequately publicised on its launch,” the ministry said, according to news agency ANI.Co-WIN has been created by the Centre as a digitised platform for rolling out vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The app is in the pre-product stage and is not available for public use. Data of healthcare and frontline workers is being registered on the app at present and more than 7.5 million beneficiaries were registered during the nationwide dry run which took place on January 2.Also Read| India records 18,088 Covid-19 cases in last 24 hours, death toll over 1.5 lakhExplaining new features about Co-WIN, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday that priority groups such as healthcare and frontline workers won’t have to register themselves as beneficiaries since their data has been already populated on the app’s vaccine delivery management system in a bulk manner.Some of the new features that Bhushan spoke about during Tuesday’s briefing were the usage of Aadhaar cards as a mode of authentication to avoid any malpractice, SMS in 12 languages to guide beneficiaries and vaccinators, availability of a 24X7 helpline including information technology (IT) professional and a chatbot pattern to help users navigate the portal.Bhushan also pointed out that the health ministry was prepared to roll out a Covid-19 vaccine within 10 days of emergency use authorisation approvals, adding that a final call on this will be taken by the central government.The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) on Sunday had approved the use of two Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech. Both the manufacturers, who had earlier engaged in a dispute, buried the hatchet and issued a joint statement on Tuesday saying they will work together for the developing, manufacturing and supplying of vaccines in India and around the globe.Also Read| ChatBot, SMS in 12 languages: Health ministry releases new Co-win detailsMeanwhile, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) chief Balram Bhargava said that Bharat Biotech’s vaccine had been cleared in the clinical trial mode and that consent of participants has to be taken and there has to be a regular follow up of participants.India has logged more than 10.3 million Covid-19 cases after 18,088 new cases and 264 related deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry on Wednesday.

06-01-2021||India||Supreme Court to examine laws against unlawful conversion in UP, Uttarakhand||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to examine the two contentious state laws passed by Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, prohibiting conversion from one religion to another by marriage. Issuing notice on two separate petitions challenging the laws, a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, refused to order stay. Soon after the Court order, the Muslim organization Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind filed an application for intervention raising serious concerns over the two laws being aimed to target Muslim youth. This application will come up along with the two petitions after four weeks. At first, the top court hesitated to issue notice as it was aware about the pendency of separate petitions before the Allahabad High Court and the Uttarakhand High Court challenging the Uttar Pradesh ordinance titled “Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020” and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act. “Only the society in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will be affected by this law. Why should the petitioners not approach the respective High Courts,” observed CJI Bobde. Citizens for Justice and Peace (CJP), a NGO run by social activist Teesta Setalvad, which filed one of the petitions challenging the two laws, informed the top court through senior advocate CU Singh that the issue is arising in other states as well. “The state of Himachal Pradesh has re-enacted a similar law (HP Freedom of Religion Act) in 2019 after its earlier law prohibiting conversion from one faith to another was struck down by the Himachal Pradesh High Court in 2012. Now the new law has roped in marriage by conversion as a ground to prosecute persons. We have multiple states,” it said. The other petition, filed by two lawyers Vishal Thakre and Abhay Singh Yadav and a law researcher Pranvesh, also asserted that the problem needs to be addressed by the top court as the “UP Ordinance and Uttarakhand Act are against the public policy and society at large and violates basic structure of the Constitution”. Similar laws were being contemplated by state governments of Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana and Assam, the petition added. The bench agreed to issue notice on the two petitions seeking responses from the Centre on whether the laws in question violated fundamental right to practise one’s religion, guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution among other rights protected under Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (right against discrimination) and 21 (right to dignity). The CJP petition said, “The Ordinance and the Act impinge upon this right (under Article 25) by imposing unreasonable and discriminatory restrictions on it by mandating that the administration be informed of such intention and a probe be launched in such a personal and intimate exercise of one’s right.”The CJP lawyer urged for a stay as Singh said, “Rampaging mobs are moving around lifting people from marriage ceremonies. Before marrying, individuals have to register their names and the burden is on them to prove that the conversion is not for marriage. If someone does convert for marriage, he faces punishment up to 10 years.”He was referring to the provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 that outlaws religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement. The law in force since November 24 last year prescribes a jail term varying between one to five years, in addition to fines of up to Rs 15,000 for those convicted under the law. The jail term goes up to 10 years and fine up to Rs 25,000 for conversions of women belonging to scheduled caste or scheduled tribe communities or who are minors. The law was promulgated about a month after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to end “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. The Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind cited this statement given by the UP chief minister to raise the issue of fundamental rights of the Muslim youth, who are being “targeted and demonised by using the Impugned Ordinance” in its application. “The practice of converting religion just for the sake of marriage might at worst be termed as ‘ethically objectionable’ or ‘immoral’, however, the same cannot be criminalised,” Jamiat stated through its lawyer Ejaz Maqbool. Both petitions too voiced concerns that the ordinance can become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to falsely implicate anyone. “Daily there are reports of people being picked up by force. These provisions are obnoxious particularly when the SC in 2018 held that the state cannot interfere with an individual’s right to marry as held in Shafin Jahan case,” Singh argued. Asking individuals to validate their conversion for the purpose of marriage or otherwise violates their right to privacy, he added.The bench, also comprising Justice’s AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was not convinced to order stay.

The farmers protesting against the legislations had announced on January 2 that if their demands remained unmet they would take out a ‘tractor parade’ towards Delhi On January 26, when the country would be celebrating its Republic Day.Women hailing from three villages -- Safa Kheri, Khatkar, Pallwan -- in Jind are learning to steer the tractor wheel.“Around 200 women are being imparted training to drive tractors,” Sikim Nain Sheokant, the president of Jind-based Kisan Ekta Mahila Manch said over the phone.She said though some of the women can drive tractors in the fields for farm operations, they do not have experience of road driving.“We want women to drive tractors on highway on January 26 without any help,” she said.Sheokant said several villagers were also helping them out by offering their tractors and providing them required training.Women are undergoing training at a toll plaza on Jind-Patiala National Highway for handling tractor-trolleys on road. The protesting farmers have declared toll plazas “free”.“We are getting the training for driving a tractor for participating in the tractor parade,” said a woman who has been receiving the lesson.They are also trying to provide training in villages, said Sheokant. She feels the new farm laws are not in the interest of the farming community.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana and other parts of the country have been camping at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for more than a month, mainly demanding a repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price for their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-women-training-to-drive-tractor-as-farmers-prepare-for-r-day-protest-march/story-SbhRATKuCbR9BacAhzgaiP.html

A high level team comprising Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Joint Secretary and Covid-19 nodal officer, ministry of food processing industries, has been deployed to Kerala on Wednesday, to oversee the implementation of bird flu containment operations and guide state health departments in mounting appropriate public health interventions to control the situation. In addition, this high level team will also review the Covid-19 situation in the states. The department of animal husbandry on January 4, 2021, had notified detection of Avian Influenza (H5N8) in samples of dead ducks from Alappuzha and Kottayam districts in Kerala. A similar report of bird flu has also been received from poultry samples from Panchkula district of Haryana, following which the health ministry called a meeting of experts to monitor the situation. The first set of high level team was sent to the affected states on January 4. “The two multi-disciplinary teams comprising experts from the National Center for Disease Control, National Institute of Virology, PGIMER, Chandigarh, Dr RML Hospital, New Delhi, and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, have been deployed to the affected districts by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on January 4, 2021 to assist the state health departments in implementing the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare’s Avian Influenza containment plan,” the health ministry statement said. Similar reports of the disease have also been reported from Jhalawar, Rajasthan and Bhind, Madhya Pradesh involving crows and migratory birds. The Department of Animal Husbandry as per laid down protocol has issued alerts to further intensify surveillance to detect any case in poultry birds. “So far, no human case of Avian Influenza has been reported. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to keep a strict watch over the evolving scenario,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-sends-experts-to-bird-flu-hit-states-no-human-case-found-yet/story-l4XpkX3fUCOjMbZsJrXJyK.html
06-01-2021||India||Avian flu virus cannot spread through cooked food: Giriraj Singh||The Centre has issued an advisory to the state on the spread of bird flu in the country, said Union minister of fisheries, animal husbandry, and dairy Giriraj Singh on Wednesday adding that the virus has returned due to India with migratory birds.“Bird flu cases can be found all over the world. India was declared free of bird flu in September. Then in October, we issued an advisory that the cold is coming and that there is a need to take precautions. Today, most of the cases are being reported from the places where migratory birds come, and they are the reason for bringing the virus to the country,” Singh told ANI.He informed that most cases of the disease are found in Kerala where “25,000 ducks have died”.“The government is on alert. Samples from all states are being sent to Bhopal. There is nothing to worry about. The government will also provide compensation to the farmers for the poultry bird that died,” the minister said.He said virus cannot be spread through cooked food and till today, no case of transmission of Avian Influenza virus to humans has been reported in India.“Bird flu spreads in two ways, one by migratory birds and the other when it is culled. The first case in India was 2006, and since 2015 every year some cases are reported,” he added.Earlier today, considering the possibility of the spread of Avian Influenza (AI) Virus to humans and other domesticated animals and birds, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change directed all states and Union Territories to take all possible steps for containing the spread of the disease.As per the government’s notification, the ministry asked the states/UTs to take up surveillance and monitoring of birds, for any signs of disease and take appropriate measures for controlling it, on priority.This ministry vide letter dated January 3, 2021, had also forwarded generic guideline relating to Avian Influenza to the Chief Wildlife Wardens of all states/UTs and had requested for taking immediate steps for containing the spread of the disease.Earlier today, the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying confirmed Avian Influenza, cases have been reported from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala.The ministry informed this after the samples from these states were tested positive by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research -National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (ICAR-NIHSAD).Notably, bird flu viruses have been circulating worldwide for centuries with four known major outbreaks recorded in the last century. India notified the first outbreak of avian influenza in 2006. Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic.“There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products. In India, the disease spreads mainly by migratory birds coming into India during winter months i.e. from September - October to February - March. The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said.In view of a threat of a global outbreak of AI, the DAHD had prepared an action plan in 2005, which was revised in 2006, 2012, 2015 and 2021 for the guidance of state government for prevention, control and containment of Avian Influenza in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avian-flu-virus-cannot-spread-through-cooked-food-virus-brought-by-migratory-birds-giriraj-singh/story-fp9z8eGRu1ssbR4EIeYogO.html

They’ve more information about me than I have in my office today. Every question they asked was answered clearly. There is no tax evasion. They send us notices in every two to three days. I would say it is harassment because if we are to answer the same question 10 times then there is a problem,” Vadra said while speaking to ANI.While saying that he has been cooperating with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax department during questioning.“Every question posed by Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Income Tax department have been answered with evidence. I am willing to go to any agency for questioning as I haven’t done any kind of tax evasions, “ he added.“The agencies questioned about my business history which was answered both verbally and with documentary evidence,” he said referring to the 23,000 documents taken away form the investigative agency from his office. Pointing to the COVID-19 situation, he expressed reservations for being called by the ED in the ofice for questioning.“It is better that a few officers come to my office with COVID report and we would sanitize the room, than me going to an Income Tax office with 50-70 people,” he said. On the contrary, he accused the “central government of using him as a political pawn.”“The government is cornered with its own issues such as farmers and people want answers. They want to divert the issue by bringing my name up because the media will get attentive and flash my name up. It has been happening for 10 years. Especially, when my family fights for farmer issues and all of this is to digress the topic and show me in a bad light,” Vadra claimed. The ED and Income Tax Department is probing Robert Vadra, husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act pertaining to allegations of money laundering in the purchase of London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square.Earlier, the ED had also recorded Vadra’s statement in connection with assets and properties outside India.

06-01-2021||India||Andhra ex-minister arrested in kidnapping case of Telangana CM’s relatives||Hyderabad police on Wednesday arrested former Andhra Pradesh tourism minister and Telugu Desam Party leader Bhuma Akhila Priya from Kurnool district for her alleged involvement in the kidnap of three distant relatives of Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao late on Tuesday night in connection with a land dispute. “We have taken Akhila Priya into custody from her residence in the morning and after preliminary interrogation and arrested her formally in the afternoon. She would be produced before a local court in Secunderabad for judicial remand later in the evening, after medical examination,” Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar told reporters. Apart from Akhila Priya, her husband Bhargav Ram and another senior TDP leader from Kurnool A V Subba Reddy were among several people who were allegedly involved in hatching and executing the kidnap plan. “We have formed special teams of the police for tracking and apprehending the other accused,” the commissioner said. The three kidnapped – K Praveen Rao, K Sunil Rao and K Naveen Rao, are said to be distantly related to the chief minister and cousins of KCR’s aide P Venugopal Rao. Praveen Rao is a former national badminton player. “The brothers were said to be involved in a land dispute with the accused at Hafeezpet on the city’s outskirts. The details of the land issue are being probed,” Anjani Kumar said. According to the commissioner, about 10 people barged into the residence of Praveen Rao, who has been living with his two brothers Sunil Rao and Naveen Rao at Krishna Residency apartment at Manovikas Nagar in Bowenpally at around 7.20 pm. They introduced themselves as Income Tax officers and one of them even flaunted his identity card. “They separated the brothers from the rest of the family and asked them to sit in the hall, while forcing the others to go into a bedroom. Later, they whisked the three brothers away in a vehicle. The kidnappers also took away laptops and mobile phones from them,” the commissioner said. After waiting for more than an hour in the bedroom, the other family members came out and realised that three men were kidnapped. They immediately alerted the police, who swung into action to track the kidnappers. “We alerted our counterparts in the Cyberabad and Rachakonda police commissionerates and kept a tab on the movement of all vehicles on closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras, besides mobile phone towers,” he said. At around 3.30 am, the kidnappers released the three brothers at Kokapet-Narasingi area on the outskirts of Hyderabad, not before forcing them to sign some documents at a farmhouse where they were confined for a few hours. “Based on the complaint given by the family members, we have arrested Akhila Priya. We are on the lookout for others,” the commissioner said. Pratap Rao, another brother of Praveen Rao told reporters earlier in the day that there was a dispute between the accused and his family over 50 acres of land at Hafeezpet in which they were partners. “Instead of settling the issue through legal means, they tried to intimidate our brothers. The issue has nothing to do with the chief minister’s family. So, please don’t drag the family into this,” Pratap Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-ex-minister-arrested-in-kidnapping-case-of-telangana-cm-s-relatives/story-qPjWNYHPlNKcNyVjZyNLtL.html
06-01-2021||India||Indian-origin hacker, blackmailer jailed for 11 years in UK||An Indian-origin man who hacked into the computer accounts of over 574 girls and young women to exploit them has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for blackmail, voyeurism and cybercrimes by a UK court.Akash Sondhi gained unauthorised access to hundreds of social media accounts, in particular Snapchat, and went on to commit blackmailing crimes between December 26, 2016 and March 17, 2020, the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.The 27-year-old from Chafford Hundred in Essex, south-east England, threatened his victims that if they didn’t send him nude images of themselves, he would post intimate images of them to their friends and family. Some of the women complied and in at least six cases he went on to carry out his threats, it said.“Akash Sondhi is an extremely manipulative man who inflicted emotional and psychological damage on young women, while also getting gratification from their images and videos,” said Joseph Stickings, a Senior Crown Prosecutor in the Complex Casework Unit for the CPS.“Following a diligent and thorough investigation conducted by the Essex Police Cyber Crime Unit the CPS was able to build a comprehensive case of 65 counts reflecting the high level of his offending,” he said.“I would like to thank all of the women who bravely came forward to tell of their traumatic experiences at the hands of Akash Sondhi. Their accounts provided strong evidence and the CPS were able to create such a compelling prosecution case that Akash Sondhi pleaded guilty to all counts,” he added.The CPS said a number of Sondhi’s victims experienced serious emotional and psychological harm in the aftermath of his despicable actions, with one victim even attempting suicide.Sondhi admitted a total of 65 offences – including hacking, blackmail, and voyeurism – and was sentenced at Basildon Crown Court 11 years in prison, a five year Serious Crime Prevention Order, and placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years.Essex Police said Sondhi targeted 574 victims across the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Romania and other countries by hacking into their social media accounts, while some of his victims have still not been traced. Sondhi’s address at Hedingham Road in Chafford Hundred, Essex, was raided by officers from the force’s Cyber Crime Unit on 19 March last year after several victims, aged between 16 and 25, made reports.“He targeted with no remorse purporting to be a friend on social media after hacking accounts, then once he got access to their intimate pictures he would attempt to blackmail them around disclosure of the images to friends and family demanding more images and videos of his own choice putting the victims through an ordeal causing extreme distress and embarrassment,” said Detective Sergeant Ian Collins, from the Essex Police Cyber Crime Unit.“Since his remand and now this sentence we have managed to stop this vile offender from targeting more victims. This is a wakeup call for anyone committing this type of crime: we will catch you and bring you to justice, and you can go to prison for the distress caused to the victims,” he said.The detective also urged social media users not to store intimate images of themselves and to secure and protect their data.“Don’t share passwords even if you think it’s a trusted friend that asks you for them, it might not be,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-origin-hacker-blackmailer-jailed-for-11-years-in-uk/story-kgluBz0O8FbJiHwQvej5FJ.html

The daily butchering of thousands of animals continually for several years generates acoustic anisotropy due to Einsteinian Pain Waves (EPW) emitted by dying animals. And the accumulated acoustic anisotropy is found to be related with the stress history of rocks,” says the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog’s syllabus.“In 1984, more than 20,000 people died due to gas leaks in Bhopal. People living in houses with cow dung coated walls were not affected.”According to the syllabus, the native cows are “hardy and clever enough not to sit at dirty places”, while the Jersey cow is “lazy” and “prone to diseases”. “It has also been seen that they [Jersey cows] attract infection by not being hygienic enough.” The syllabus says whenever any unknown person comes near a desi cow, “she will immediately stand. The irreverent exotic cow displays no emotions.”The examinees will be asked to answer objective multiple-choice questions for the Kamdhenu Gau-Vigyan Prachar-Prasar Examination as per the syllabus. There will be separate categories of examinees involving primary and middle school; secondary; and college students. Students who clear the exam will get cow expert certificates, officials said.A Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog statement about the exam said: “Union education ministers, chief ministers, state education ministers, chairmen of Gau Seva Aayogs of all states, district education officers of all states, principals of all schools, print and electronic media, NGOs and cow donors will be involved in this mammoth exercise [examination].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-in-desi-cow-milk-earthquakes-due-to-slaughter-in-syllabus-for-national-exam-on-cows/story-zd4M5fqxrj9HWzLACaS3xL.html
06-01-2021||India||5 states have reported bird flu outbreak: Here’s all you need to know||After at least five states in India reported bird deaths due to bird flu in the past one week, the Centre has issued an advisory to all states asking them to test the droppings of migratory and poultry birds to prevent the spread. Close to 24,500 birds have died and thousands others are infected. Here’s an explainer on how serious is the 2021 bird flu threat.What is avian influenza or bird flu?Bird flu is a highly contagious viral disease caused by Influenza type A viruses which generally affects poultry birds such as chickens and turkeys. Birds are normally the carriers of the virus, which take it to long distances, thereby affecting large avian population across continents. There are many strains of the virus and most of them are mild and may merely cause a low egg production or other mild symptoms among chickens. However, some are severe and lethal that cause deaths of large number of birds.How does the bird flu spread?Wild aquatic birds such as ducks and geese are the natural reservoir of Influenza A viruses and the central players in the ecology of these viruses. Many birds carry the flu without developing sickness, and shed it in their droppings. Since birds excrete even while flying, they provide a nice aerosol of influenza virus, probable reason for crows getting the virus in India. Some other birds feed on the dropping catch the illness and also become carriers. Sometimes, which is rare, the virus jumps over to mammals such as pigs, horses, cats and dogs. What strains have been found in India?Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), the lab accredited to confirm bird flu, has detected two strains of influenza viruses so far. They are H5N8, a sub-type of avian influenza found in poultry and wild animals, has been found in crows in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. The strain poses a low risk to people and is highly lethal to wild birds and poultry. The second strain found is H5N1 in ducks in Kerala and migratory birds in Himachal. It is highly infectious and causes severe respiratory disease in birds. Human cases of H5N1 are rare but if infected, the mortality rate is about 60% according to the World Health Organization. Which Indian states have been affected? The NIHSAD has so far identified 12 epicentres in Rajasthan (Baran, Kota, Jhalawar), Madhya Pradesh (Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa), Himachal Pradesh (Kangra) and Kerala (Kottayam, Alappuzha). In addition, bird flu deaths have also been reported from Haryana and Uttarakhand. Himachal’s Kangra district magistrate banned sale or culling of poultry in the alert zone and closed all poultry or fish selling shops. In Rajasthan, Section 144 was imposed in a 1km radius of infected areas in Jhalawar and Baran districts. In Kerala, Kottayam and Alappuzha districts close to 38,000 ducks have been culled.Why does bird flu impact India?According to Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), India is the epicentre as flight paths of distant birds criss-cross the country’s skies and India is also a terminal destination for many such streams, making it a biological hot spot for bird disease. Nearly 370 species of birds, from the northern wheatear to yellow-rumped flycatcher – crisscross India from Europe, Russia and Mongolia each year, according to BNHS. This time, the disease has come from Siberia, Mangolia, China and some other Central Asian countries. Which countries other than India are affected? In the last few weeks, avian influenza has hit at least 10 European countries -- Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Croatia, and Ukraine, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Cases have also been reported in South Korea and Japan, where this has been the worst bird flu outbreak on record, having reached over 20 % of its 47 prefectures. To control avian influenza, France would cull around 600,000 poultry birds. In Germany, about 62,000 turkeys and ducks will be slaughtered after being hit by H5N8 bird flu. South Korea’s agriculture ministry in October had ordered temporary closure for poultry farms and related transport to contain a wider spread of bird flu. Japan’s government has also called for disinfections of poultry farms across the country after infections have been detected in six regional prefectures since November. How does bird flu infect humans?No human infection has been reported in India so far. As of December 17, 2020, a total of 239 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus were reported from four countries -- Cambodia, China, Vietnam and Lao PDR -- since 2003. Of these cases, 134 were fatal. The last case was reported from Lao PDR on October 13, 2020 (one case, no death), according to WHO. The first case of humans having contracted bird flu came after an outbreak in a live bird market of Hong Kong in 1997. It was the H5N1 strain of the virus, and 6 out of 18 infected humans died of the disease. A few years later, the virus returned, killing many people in various other parts of the globe and caused hundreds of human deaths, particularly in south-east Asia. Generally, people coming in close contact with infected alive or dead birds have contracted the H5N1 bird flu, and it does not usually spread from person to person, according to WHO, which also said that there is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and cooked poultry food.What are the economic implications of bird flu?The Central government records show nearly Rs400 crore have been paid to poultry farmers till 2016 as compensation for mass killing of birds. Across the globe, the loss estimated globally was US$200 billion in 2016. In its recent report, WHO said that bird flu hampers the poultry industry in a big way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-states-report-bird-deaths-here-s-all-you-need-to-know-about-bird-flu/story-NqyfeAoNajPeaY58OCFd5L.html
06-01-2021||India||Central team to visit bird flu-hit areas of Kerala tomorrow, culling of ducks continue||With the culling of ducks continuing in bird flu-hit areas of Alappuzha and Kottayam in Kerala for the second consecutive day, the Union government has decided to rush a team of experts to the state on Thursday, the state animal husbandry department said.The state government has also announced relief for affected farmers-- they will be given Rs 100 for each culled duck. Officials have started collecting details of culled birds, said a senior official of the department. In three days at least 46,000 birds will be culled in Alappuzha 38,000 and 8000 in Kottayam. There is a ban on trading of ducks till further notice in the two districts, he said. Surrounded by many water bodies, in Alappuzha and surrounding areas duck farming is popular-- eggs of ducks are almost double the price of chicken eggs and duck meat is a delicacy in many areas of the state. In Kuttanad and other areas people encourage duck farming because pecking birds are good for paddy cultivation as they clear farms of pests and their foray gives a tilling effect to muddy soil. Kuttanad is known as the rice bowl of Kerala.“I suffered major losses. I lost around 20,000 birds in the last one week. I bought 10,000 ducklings only two weeks back. I took bank loans and money from lenders to fund my farming. Compensation from the government is meagre,” said K Kuttappayi, a farmer in Alappuzha. Farming for the last four decades, he said the recurring epidemic was posing a big challenge for poultry farmers.On Tuesday, the government had declared bird flu as a state disaster and rapid response teams were deployed for culling and surveillance of the affected areas. And strict controls have been imposed to contain the H5N8 strain of flu. State animal husbandry minister K Raju convened a meeting in Alappuzha on Wednesday and he will be camping in the district for two days, said his office. As an after-effect, prices of chicken plummeted in the state and chicken traders said there is a 40 per cent dip in sales. Many neighbouring states have also put restrictions on chickens from Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-team-to-visit-bird-flu-hit-areas-of-kerala-tomorrow-culling-of-ducks-continue/story-J42ROZfs6xNG1J2OxiP7NN.html

Their return flight was scheduled on Sunday when snowfall disrupted surface and air traffic. They have had to stay back as the snowfall continued till Wednesday morning.On Wednesday afternoon, they were on way to Dal Lake. “We are going to explore Srinagar. It is too good to describe. Except for the fact our flights were cancelled, everything else is amazing,” Rahul, a corporate employee, said while his friends busied themselves clicking pictures of a gigantic Chinar tree covered with snow near Chinar Park. “The people here are so hospitable,” he said.As the number of Covid-19 infections in Jammu and Kashmir dipped to a large extent and snowfall began in late December and January, tourists started arriving in the valley in large numbers after 16 months.Also Read: Stranded on Jammu-Srinagar NH, truckers face tough timeTourism in Kashmir took a hit since August 5, 2019, when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked and restrictions imposed on the movement of people and communication for months. Two days before the revocation of Article 370, around 20,000-25,000 tourists in Kashmir were asked to leave the Valley along with the Amarnath pilgrims. The situation was then further aggravated by the Covid-19 lockdown since March 2020. About 20-30 tourists would arrive per day in July, 2020, and there have been over 1,000 visitors every day since December 25, 2020, according to the tourism department.However the inflow of tourists was disrupted after surface and air traffic was suspended since Sunday following heavy snowfall.Unmindful of the fact that his parents were worried about their flight back home, Yashwant, a teenager from Delhi appeared ecstatic while playing in the snow. “I just love it,” he said as his mother asked him to go inside the hotel.Meanwhile, Charan, his wife and infant daughter were trying to negotiate the slush-covered road to find a good food outlet for lunch.“It is too cold. We are trying to acclimatise to this atmosphere. I have worn a lot of layers. Though I have been to Ladakh, this is for the first time I have experienced snow,” said Charan, who had come with a group from Hyderabad on January 2.The heavy snowfall seems to have boosted tourism in Kashmir Valley.Sajid Ahmad, a visitor from Lucknow, said that they mostly spent their days inside owing to the snowfall. “We travelled small distances in Srinagar and could not go anywhere farther due to the snowfall. Our return flight is on January 8 and we are trying to see as much as we can,” he said.Free accommodation for stranded touristsMany travel, trade and tourism bodies in Kashmir have come together to assist stranded tourists who are short of funds to help them and provide them accommodation without charge. They formed a forum and put up phone numbers in social media for those in need.“With this heavy snowfall, many tourists are stuck in Srinagar and the Tourism Forum shares the difficulties they are facing in this difficult time. We are sincerely with them and will try to do whatever best can be done,” the forum said in a statement.“Whosoever is stranded or needs a room or does not have cost of boarding or lodging or who has to overstay due to the closure of roads and airport, this forum will provide help,” said Abdul Hameed, chairman of the Houseboat Owners’ Association.“Many of our friends and associates have opened their houseboats, hotels and even vehicles for stranded tourists,” he said.In Gulmarg, the deputy commissioner Baramulla has asked hoteliers and others to extend the stay of tourists and guests till the weather improves.“CEO Gulmarg Development Authority and Assistant Director Tourism have been directed to ensure the necessary compliance and establish help desk for the purpose,” the DC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snowed-in-tourists-make-the-most-of-their-stay-in-kashmir-as-locals-band-together-to-help/story-xyfAgJF9xcdnPTp3ikMUTL.html

06-01-2021||India||Trinamool shifts attention to infighting in party units after minister quits||Hours after former India cricketer and Bengal’s deputy sports minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla resigned from the Trinamool Congress (TMC), infighting in several district units of the party once again came under focus on Tuesday. Calling Shukla a “good boy”, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said he had quit to pursue sports. “He said in his letter that he wants to leave politics and give more time to sports. There is nothing more to this. There is no place for misunderstanding here,” said Banerjee. The TMC chief’s assertions however did not stop the dissent in Howrah district where forest minister Rajib Banerjee, the two-time MLA from Domjur, has been raising his voice against a section of leaders and avoiding government and party events since September. He did not attend Tuesday’s cabinet meeting as well and reportedly informed the leadership that he was unwell. Shukla is the Howrah North MLA.Another high-profile lawmaker, Vaishali Dalmiya, who represents Howrah’s Bally assembly seat and, like Shukla, joined politics in 2016, said during a live television show on Tuesday evening that there are “termites in the TMC who are breaking the party from within”. “There are some former civic body councillors and block presidents who did not perform and now their only job is to humiliate sincere MLAs and MPs. I have prepared a file on them. The party must deal with these people strictly,” she said. Vaishali is the daughter of Jagmohan Dalmiya, the Kolkata-based businessman who served as president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB). He was the BCCI president till his death in 2015. Another TMC leader and former mayor of Howrah, Rathin Chakraborty, too, spoke out. “The TMC is going through a turmoil and many sincere leaders and party workers are not being given the opportunity to work,” he quipped. Shukla, Dalmiya or Chakraborty made no mention of joining the Bharatiya Janata Party like former minister Suvendu Adhikari and six other lawmakers and a Lok Sabha member who were welcomed into the saffron camp by Union home minister Amit Shah on December 9. Yet, Bengal BJP leaders said Howrah is just one of the districts where they were waiting for an exodus from the ruling party. “Several TMC leaders and MLAs from Howrah, Nadia and South 24 Parganas are waiting to switch sides. It is only a matter of time,” a senior state BJP leader told HT on condition of anonymity. Differences in the TMC’s Howrah district came to the fore in mid-July last year when the tussle between two ministers, Rajib Banerjee and Arup Roy, over corruption by some local functionaries became an embarrassment for the party. Rajib Banerjee told the media at that time that some corrupt mid-level leaders were being shielded by the district leadership. Shukla, who has a clean image, was subsequently made the district president. Reacting to Shukla’s resignation and Dalmiya’s comments on Tuesday, Roy said, “Leaving the party before the polls was not the right thing to do. Also, if any leader has a problem with people in the organisation it should be discussed within the party, not in public.” TMC spokesperson and deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy maintained caution with his comment on the infighting in Howrah. “One must bear in mind that Roy was a student front leader who worked his way up to become a minister. He is a senior leader,” Roy told HT. Not willing to be quoted, at least three TMC leaders admitted that infighting is an issue that plagues the organisation in several districts and addressing it before the assembly polls is as urgent as preparing for the elections. Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee on Monday started a five-day tour of the north Bengal districts where the BJP won seven of the region’s eight Lok Sabha seats in 2019. This is the first time he is visiting the region alone and for so many days. In November, Jagadish Barma Basunia, the legislator from Sitai constituency in Cooch Behar, had spoken in support of Mihir Goswami, the Cooch Behar South MLA who joined the BJP. Basunia also questioned internal changes being made at the recommendation of election strategist Prashant Kishor.In Murshidabad district, TMC legislator from Hariharpara, Niamot Sheikh openly challenged Kishor’s authority at a rally in November. “Prashant Kishor is the cause of all trouble. Suvendu Adhikari revived the party in Murshidabad. And now leaders who talk to him are facing action,” Sheikh said at the rally held days before Adhikari joined the BJP. Interestingly, BJP leaders said they are in touch with Dipak Haldar, the legislator from Diamond Harbour in South 24 Parganas district which is a segment in Abhishek Banerjee’s Lok Sabha constituency. Haldar could not be contacted despite several attempts. “TMC will eventually collapse because it was formed with the sole purpose of ousting the CPI(M)-led government. Once that purpose was served in 2011 the party was left with no agenda. Without comprehensive idealism no party can sustain for long,” BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told HT on Tuesday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-shifts-attention-to-infighting-in-party-units-after-minister-quits/story-LXzWXiwVlrMhCIPJCN6DiK.html

When summoned by the khap panchayat, the young girl said she would like to continue living with the boy, enraging the elders, who then forced the parents of the three children to hang them. Both the boys were beaten and tortured and their private parts were burnt before hanging them.Commenting on the facts of the case, the apex bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said, “The offences are serious that can disrupt society. You cannot punish someone for falling in love. This is a worse form of crime.”Advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain who appeared for the state informed the Court that out of 11 applicants, only two persons had not completed 10 years of sentence.

Even if they are to be released, they have to be sent to another district.”Considering all these aspects, the bench ordered the state to arrange for a probation officer to visit the jails of Agra and Mathura and interview the accused. The officer would submit a report to the top court in two weeks.The incident occurred on March 27, 1991 in a village under Barsana police station at Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.

What is the current status of those petitions. To whom did he submit those petitions or did he take any steps to resolve their grievances?” Palaniswami asked.Only the duly elected government could redress the grievances of the people and not the opposition party, he said.On Stalin’s recent announcement that he would submit the second list of corruption charges against ministers to the state Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Palaniswami said the DMK president had earlier submitted a petition to Purohit, levelling baseless corruption charges with regard to projects for which tenders are yet to be floated.“How can he say corruption took place when the work is yet to start,” the chief minister wondered.Palaniswami said the e-tendering system is followed by all departments offering the opportunity to everyone to apply from anywhere in the world.But this was not the case during the previous DMK regime where applications were given only to persons whom they wanted, the chief minister alleged.The DMK submitted a complaint last month to the Governor, alleging corruption charges against ministers including the chief minister.With a number of cases pending against senior DMK leaders, Palaniswami sarcastically remarked many of them would not be able to contest the elections if the court expedited the cases.Assembly elections in the state are likely to be held in April-May this year.At Anthiyur later, Palaniswami said he was ready to face any inquiry over the corruption charges levelled by Stalin.He said he was ready for a one-to-one meeting with the DMK leader in a public place where he would respond to Stalin’s charges.He said the DMK chief was attacking him and his cabinet colleagues with such charges ‘unable’ to bear the good work of the AIADMK government.The chief minister also provided a detailed list of welfare schemes being implemented by his government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/mk-stalin-s-gram-sabha-meet-camouflage-to-blame-tn-govt-says-cm-palaniswami/story-YQUI3IrxRW70bYjSDxNw5L.html

The woman, who had gone to a temple on Sunday, was found dead under mysterious circumstances, Sharma said adding that the victim’s family accused the temple priest and his aides of raping and murdering her and that a case was registered against them. “The victim’s son said his mother had gone to offer prayers at the temple on Sunday but she did not return. However, around 11pm, the temple priest and two of his aides came to his house and handed over his mother’s body,” he said.Also Read: Hathras horror: CBI files charge sheet against fourThe rape, which comes months after the Hathras gang-rape case, has led to strong criticism of the BJP-led government in UP by opposition parties.

Tagging a media report, she tweeted, “In Budaun, the police station officer did not listen to the one pleading and did not even examine the place of the incident. There is something wrong in the UP government’s intentions on women’s security.”Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala termed the crime as ‘gruesome’ and also questioned as to when will the Yogi Adityanath government in the state wake up.

When rescue workers and fishermen were worried about a missing boat on Nattika beach in Thrissur on Tuesday, young Devang Subil approached them. Initially no one was willing to hear him and some of them even shooed him away, saying it was not a child’s play.After Nattika legislator Geetha Gopi heard his plea she approached police and rescue officials and Subil managed to board a rescue boat with his drone.“It was my first deep sea voyage. When our boat reached 11 nautical miles away from the coast I released my drone. Initially the wind created problems but after 20 minutes or so my drone captured first visuals of a man clinging on to a log of capsized boat and beamed faint visuals in my mobile phone,” said Subil detailing the rescue operation. He said soon fishermen and coastal police immediately diverted their vessels to the spot where the first man was found and rescued him. Later 300 metres away from the spot, they found two others and rescued; the fourth one took almost another an hour to spot, he said. “The fourth man was on the verge of drowning after exhaustion. Minutes after his rescue, the man lost his consciousness,” he said. Now four of them are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Thrissur. They spent almost six hours in the sea and one of them managed to send an SOS to the shore which alerted others.“We salute the youngster whose timely intervention saved four lives. He showed us how new innovations can help save lives. I have already approached the government with a suggestion to honour him,” said MLA Geetha Gopi. Subil, a second year B.Tech student of Bnegaluru’s Christ University, had returned to his native place after his college shut due to pandemic. The Kerala Fishing Boat Operator’s Association said it was the first time a drone camera was used to save fishermen from seas in south India. It is planning to submit a proposal to the state fisheries department to deploy more drones and train rescuers to use them.“It is a cheap medium of rescue. Usually we press helicopters and speed boats into service for such search operations. But this is very cost effective,” said Subil, adding he will add more modifications and be ready to train rescuers involved in such operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-drone-19-year-old-rescues-4-drowning-fishermen-off-kerala-coast/story-nvCNgclVlaxfuuG4Q4HuPP.html
06-01-2021||India||Amit Shah to attend Thuglak magazine’s 51st anniversary event in Chennai on Jan 14||Union home minister Amit Shah would visit Chennai on January 14 to take part in the 51st anniversary celebrations of Thuglak magazine edited by Reserve Bank of India’s board director S Gurumurthy, confirmed the Tamil political magazine. Shah’s participation assumes political significance as several senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including LK Advani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have addressed Thuglak’s anniversary celebrations in the past.After his visit in November, this is Shah’s second trip to the city in the recent past, ahead of the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu due in April or May. A senior BJP leader in the state said that though Shah’s itinerary is yet to be finalised, his visit will bring clarity especially in relation to their ally, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). “He will clear all the uncertainty over the alliance and also the issue of the chief ministerial candidate,” the leader said on condition of anonymity. Shah’s visit may also coincide with that of two other significant leaders on the same day. BJP president J P Nadda, who was scheduled to visit Chennai on December 31 for poll preparation and to make important party announcements postponed his visit likely to mid-January after he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Meanwhile Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat is also likely to be on a two-day visit to attend other events and his programme was scheduled a couple of months ago, said a source. During his two-day visit on November 21, Shah had inaugurated infrastructure projects worth Rs67,378 crore at a government function in Chennai. Taking everyone by surprise, chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami and his deputy O Paneerselvam announced on stage that their alliance with the BJP will continue. Later, Shah held marathon meetings, first with Palaniswami and Paneerselvam, followed by an event with state party members after which he chaired a high-level meeting with state leaders urging them to work towards coming to power on their own in the next five years in Tamil Nadu. The BJP leader quoted above had attended this meeting. “He instructed us not to comment on anything as we are a national party and announcements would come from Delhi,” the leader said. BJP being non-committal on the alliance with AIADMK and Palaniswami as the CM candidate irked the AIADMK camp until BJP clarified that it is a procedural issue. Through midnight into the early hours of November 22, Gurumurthy and Shah held a one-on-one meeting at the latter’s hotel. Gurumurthy became the editor of Thuglak after its founder-editor and political commentator Cho Ramaswamy’s demise in December 2016. Last year, vice-president Venkaiah Naidu was the chief guest with the participation of actor Rajinikanth. Last year, PM Modi recorded a video message for the event as he did in 2017. Modi had participated in 2008 when he was the chief minister of Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-to-attend-thuglak-magazine-s-51st-anniversary-event-in-chennai-on-january-14/story-3zoL7vrSLhuiuZ1bXkW1kL.html

Police also resorted to lathicharge to clear the way for government surveyors to demarcate the site.Retaliating against the lathicharge, the villagers pelted stones at the police, leading to injuries on both sides. Villagers had been blocking the way on Tuesday as well, vowing not to allow the demarcation work to go ahead. On Tuesday, the police had backed off but today, they attempted to clear the blockade by force and physically drive away the squatting villagers. “The police tried to forcefully enter by stomping over the women who were lying down to block the path. They then began firing tear gas shells and a lathicharge before retreating,” Shubham Shivolkar, a leader who was present at the site, said. While no one was seriously injured, several villagers complained of having been struck by police lathis and tear gas shells. Earlier in the day, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said that while the government was open to discuss and address the villagers’ concerns, the IIT-Goa campus will be built at the present site. “The demarcation is going on. It will continue. The people will (eventually) calm down. We have told them we are willing to discuss,” Sawant said, indicating that the Goa government was unwilling to back down from the present site which is the latest site identified after two previous locations also in ‘forested areas’ were opposed by locals. Located in the state’s eastern corner at the foothills of the Western Ghats along the border with Karnataka and more than 50 kms from the state capital Panaji, the land chosen is thickly forested interspersed with cashew trees that villagers claim have sustained them for generations and have been demanding that the new proposed IIT be shifted to a different location, one which will come at less cost to the environment and their livelihoods.IIT Goa has currently been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College. Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were also scrapped on account of protests from local residents and after pressure from the Opposition, which had alleged a land scam in shortlisting of sites for the top technology institute.The present site was identified and the land, which belongs to the Goa government, was handed over to IIT-Goa in May last year during the Covid-19 lockdown. Protests have been on since.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/violence-erupts-as-police-villagers-clash-over-proposed-iit-goa-campus/story-t8vfJvFKr6tf32BkMnB6IM.html
06-01-2021||India||India calls on Sri Lanka to fulfil expectations of Tamil minority||India on Wednesday called on Sri Lanka to meet the Tamil minority’s expectations for greater devolution of powers as part of the reconciliation process even as it committed itself to greater cooperation aimed at boosting the island nation’s post-Covid-19 recovery efforts. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is in Sri Lanka for his first overseas visit of the year, raised the expectations of the country’s Tamils during a joint media interaction with his counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena. He reiterated India’s backing for Sri Lanka’s reconciliation process and an “inclusive political outlook” that encourages ethnic harmony. Acknowledging the immediate challenge of post-Covid-19 recovery, Jaishankar said India will “always be a dependable partner and a reliable friend” that is open to strengthening ties on the basis of “mutual trust, mutual interests, mutual respect and mutual sensitivity”. Also Read: Sri Lanka to sign agreement to secure Covid-19 vaccine through COVAX“As we promote peace and well-being in the region, India has been strongly committed to the unity, stability and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Our support for the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka is long-standing, as indeed for an inclusive political outlook that encourages ethnic harmony,” he said. Jaishankar pointed out it was in Colombo’s own interest to fulfil the Tamil minority’s expectations for “equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka”. He added: “That applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th amendment of the Constitution. The progress and prosperity of Sri Lanka will surely be advanced as a consequence.” The aspirations of Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority, a key political issue in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, had also been raised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a virtual summit with his counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa last September. At the time, the Indian side had called for the full implementation of the 13th amendment, which is an outcome of the 1987 India-Sri Lanka peace accord aimed at devolving more powers to the Tamils. Rajapaksa and his brother, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, have shied away from committing to full implementation of the amendment. They have also indicated they won’t go against the wishes of the Sinhala majority while working on any resolution in Tamil-inhabited areas. In his remarks at the media interaction, Gunawardena noted that President Rajapaksa had firmly stated his commitment to the well-being, progress and opportunities of all Sri Lankan citizens, including Sinhala, Tamils and Muslims. Jaishankar said he and Gunawardena had discussed several proposals for cooperation in energy, infrastructure and connectivity, and the early implementation of such projects would help accelerate Sri Lanka’s recovery from the impact of the pandemic. He also promised a speedy follow-up to talks on possible Indian investments in special zones for manufacturing pharmaceuticals and tourism. While expressing India’s commitment to help enhance Sri Lanka’s capability to deal with growing maritime challenges, Jaishankar said New Delhi also looked forward to the early return of Indian fishermen detained by the island nation’s authorities for crossing the maritime boundary. Gunawardena thanked India for its support to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. “The Indian government’s ‘neighbourhood first policy made a very positive impact on our health sector and the economy during the critical period [of] unprecedented crisis...,” he said. Jaishankar is visiting Sri Lanka during January 5-7 at the invitation of Gunawardena. The external affairs ministry said the visit reflects the priority attached by both countries to strengthening relations in all spheres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-calls-on-sri-lanka-to-fulfil-expectations-of-tamil-minority/story-V49Alanoa5X2O5Bq0DNa3H.html

Our support for the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka is long standing as indeed for an inclusive political outlook that encourages ethnic harmony,” he said.He also emphasised on the importance of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.Jaishankar, who had met President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his counterpart Gunawardena before the press conference and was expected to meet with the minister of fisheries Douglas Devananda, said he was looking forward to the early return of Indian fishermen detained in Lanka. “We look forward to the early return of our fishermen from Sri Lanka,” Jaishankar said. Indian fishermen, apprehended in Sri Lanka for allegedly poaching in its territorial waters, were provided consular assistance by the Consulate General of India in Jaffna last week.The high commission said it was in touch with the Sri Lankan Government to facilitate the early release of the detained fishermen.India and Sri Lanka last week held through video conferencing a meeting of the joint working group on fisheries and discussed the issues related to fishermen and the ways to overcome challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each other’s waters. On his part, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister conveyed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government for the tremendous support India extended in the past several months to mitigate the adverse impact of the Covid pandemic.“India’s Neighbourhood First Policy has made a positive impact on the health sector and economy during this period of unprecedented crisis,” Gunawardena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sri-lanka-looking-at-post-covid-cooperation-says-jaishankar/story-6TpKPbStOfBXqAeOUDR56N.html

The court also observed that the prosecution could move an application seeking further investigation in the case before the special court. It has also directed the accused to surrender before the trial court by January 20.The court passed the judgment while hearing the appeals of the state government and mother questioning the special court verdict.There are four accused in the case and one of them Pradeep Kumar had died by suicide last year. The court has also pulled up the investigating team, prosecutor and judge of the POCSO court.The prosecution’s case is that the two minor girls had died by suicide due to repeated sexual harassment by the accused. The girls, aged 13 and nine, were found dead inside their home 52 days apart. The 13-year-old was found dead on January 13, 2017, and the younger child, aged nine, died 52 days later on March 4.The case had seen many twists and turns since then. Last year the government had admitted in the high court that the case was not investigated properly and it was ready for a re-probe. The mother had also approached the high court for a court-monitored central agency probe. In 2019 the POCSO court had set free four accused and passed strictures against the investigating team. But the police officer who headed the investigation was promoted later. There was enough indignation after the verdict and later the high court took up the case suo motu but proceedings were stalled again after the government announced a judicial commission. Many lapses in the trial also came to the fore. A lawyer N Rajesh, who represented one of the accused in the case, was later appointed as the district child welfare committee president, a body aimed at protecting rights of children. During the trial, many witnesses turned hostile.The ruling CPI(M) also faced criticism as some of the accused are reported to be party workers. The state women commission also failed to come to the rescue of parents due to political pressure, said activists who were helping parents, both labourers. The mother of the siblings had staged several rounds of protests seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-sets-aside-aquittal-in-wayalar-minors-rape-murder-case/story-3T6Owtnga2JtPv9XiGl8wK.html
06-01-2021||India||Wisconsin’s assembly speaker supports farmers’ protests, writes to Indian envoy||Voicing his support for the farmers’ protest in India, the Speaker of Wisconsin State Assembly has urged the Indian government to reconsider its decision on the three farm laws and listen to the concerns of the affected farmers.Robin J Vos expressed his support through a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. He also wrote a similar letter to US Ambassador to India Ken Juster.“One thing Wisconsin and India may have in common is our large agricultural economies. The farmers of our state are a very large part of our overall economy. It would be unfathomable to me that we would make law changes that affect them without taking their input into account, or by shutting them down as they exercised their right to peaceably assemble,” he wrote in his letters dated January 4.“Hopefully, the Modi government will reconsider its decision and sit down with the affected farmers to listen to their concerns,” Vos said. India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted”, asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.“We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said last month.“Recently, I was made aware of three new laws that may have a great impact on the farmers of Punjab. It is my understanding that these three laws were implemented with little to no consultation with this large community of farmers, and have sparked massive protests in Delhi,” Vos said in his letter to Sandhu.“While my job does not usually call me to opine on relations between the United States and other countries, I write as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin. I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi you convey my concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest,” he said in his letter to the Indian ambassador.Wisconsin has a sizeable Sikh population. In his letter to Juster, Vos said he was writing as a US citizen who represents Indians in Wisconsin.“I ask that in your consultations with Prime Minister Modi and his government, that you convey a concern for violations of human civil rights and the right to peaceably protest. I trust you agree that these are fundamental bedrocks in American society and we should do all we can in our diplomatic relations to ensure that they are bedrocks in the countries with which we have diplomatic ties,” Vos wrote.Eminent Sikh American Darshan Singh Dhaliwal welcomed the letters written by Vos and said that farmers of the entire India, not only Punjab, were suffering.“Repeal of the three farmers’ laws is the right thing to do. Farmers do not want these laws,” said Dhaliwal who left for India on Tuesday to show solidarity with the protesting farmers.He said he was in talks with several US Congressmen for a visit to India to meet the protesting farmers and get a firsthand assessment of the situation on the ground.Meanwhile, the Indian embassy has increased its outreach to members of the US Congress briefing them about the various aspects of the farm bill, and the right of the farmers to protest and the several rounds of talks that the government has had with the leaders of the protesting farmers.During these briefings by senior officials of the Indian embassy, the lawmakers and their staffers are being given the historical perspective of the agricultural sector in India and the problems that this sector is facing, including the falling income of farmers.Ambassador Sindhu has spoken to a few eminent Congressmen. The Indian embassy is also reaching out to members of the Indian community.Members of US Congress and their staffers are told about the various misconceptions about the farm bills. They are told that farmers have the absolute right to protest and their ongoing protest is democracy in action.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislation would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wisconsin-s-assembly-speaker-supports-farmers-protests-writes-to-indian-envoy/story-BmFyLitQyq54DguEZlMFzI.html

The accused were identified as K Arulanantham, 34, the AIADMK’s Pollachi town students’ wing secretary, Haron Paul, 29 and ‘Bike’ Balu, 27, a second-hand bike dealer, police said. “They are friends of those previously arrested in the case,” a senior official said. The trio were produced at the Mahila Court in Coimbatore district on Wednesday and were remanded to 14-day judicial custody, police added.AIADMK, in a joint statement by chief minister and party coordinator Edapaddi Palaniswami and coordinator O Paneerselvam, were quick to expel Arulanandam. The party removed him from membership and asked the cadre not to be in contact with him. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M K Stalin said in a statement that bail should not be granted to the accused. “While there are still many ruling party figures to be trapped….I urge the CBI to expedite the investigation, arrest all those involved in the heinous sexual offense up to the top level of the AIADMK, and ensure safety of Tamil Nadu women,” Stalin added.Also Read: DMK cadre manhandle AIADMK woman functionary at Stalin’s gram sabhaThe case came to light in February 2019, when a 19-year-old woman filed a complaint alleging a group of men sexually assaulted her inside a car, filmed the act and threatened to leak the video. The local police began investigations which revealed that a network of men had similarly harassed scores of women in Pollachi and blackmailed them. Several videos had leaked during this time. Police arrested five men-- K Thirunavukarasu, Riswanth, M Satish, T Vasanthakumar and R Mani in 2019. After allegations linking the names of the accused with ruling party functionaries emerged, Tamil Nadu government first transferred the case to the CB-CID and then to the CBI which filed a charge sheet in May 2019. There was a huge public outrage across the state over the case and wide-ranging debates on the safety of women as reports suggested that the accused befriended the women on social media to meet them in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-functionary-among-3-more-arrested-in-pollachi-sexual-assault-case/story-YqLnqLb9vPnmfdME3lW2fJ.html

Balyan said there is no treatment for the infection and that all the states have been advised to exercise preventive measures that include restriction of movement of birds and proper disposal of birds.“Infection in humans is not yet reported in India though the disease is zoonotic. There is no direct evidence that AI viruses can be transmitted to humans via the consumption of contaminated poultry products,” the Union ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying said in a statement. Implementing management practices that incorporate bio security principles, personal hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection protocols, as well as cooking and processing standards, are effective means of controlling the spread of the AI viruses, the ministry statement added. The AI influenza has so far been reported from five states —Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala—Balyan said. “In Haryana, it has been transmitted to poultry as well, otherwise the virus is found in wild and migratory birds,” he added. The animal husbandry ministry has asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan. Meanwhile, the department of animal husbandry and dairying has also set up a control room in New Delhi to keep watch on the situation and to take stock on a daily basis of preventive and control measures undertaken by state authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avian-influenza-can-be-transmitted-to-humans-no-case-in-india-yet-minister/story-fDQK8hWl9EmRZ7npqH7bPO.html

The officer added it was not yet known how the gas leak occurred.Dipak Chattaraj, CEO of the RSP, has assured all help to the families of the deceased workers. A high-level probe has been ordered into the incident.The four who turned unconscious were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Ispat General Hospital in Rourkela, but later succumbed to the poisonous gas. The deceased have been identified as Ganesh Chandra Paila (59), Abhimanyu Sahu (33), Rabindra Sahu (59) and Brahmananda Panda (51).Archana Satpathy, public relations officer of the Rourkela Steel Plant, said all the four worked for a maintenance contractor firm Star Construction. Though there were reports of several other workers being affected by the gas leak, the steel plant spokesperson said only four workers were present at the accident site.Officials said the coal chemical department in the plant produces coke oven gas that is generated from the Coke Oven Battery. Local officials said a probe would be started as to how the leak happened and the lack of safety protocols at the worksite.The first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, RSP produces 4.5 MTPA (Million Tonne per Annum) of hot metal.

Fresh national elections have been scheduled on 30 April and 10 May.PM Oli later told people in a televised address that his rivals within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) had paralysed decision-making, leaving him with no other option.It was a reference to the continuing power tussle with Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda, the former prime minister who was also the co-chair of the party and had played a lead role along with another prime minister, Madhav Nepal, to force PM Oli’s exit.India’s decision to go ahead with Gyawali’s visit - it was initially scheduled to take place last month - is seen to demonstrate India’s explicit support for the Nepali people and the ruling Oli government, a Nepal watcher said about the visit that is seen to be high on the political quotient.Also Watch: India donates ICU ventilators to Nepal to battle Covid-19 During his visit, Gyawali is expected to get a clear commitment from New Delhi for supply of over 12 million doses of the coronavirus vaccines produced in India. Nepal has offers from China to supply its version of the Sinovac vaccine. During discussions with Indian officials, Nepalese officials have, however, said that the Oli government preferred to get its vaccine supplies from New Delhi.Nepal’s ambassador to India Nilamber Acharya has already held several rounds of meetings with Indian vaccine manufacturers and government officials. His last meeting was on Tuesday with Dr V Krishna Mohan, executive director of Bharat Biotech that is producing the indigenously-developed Covid 19 vaccine.China, which has poured millions of dollars into Nepal in recent years in the form of aid and infrastructure investment, appears to have exhausted its influence with PM Oli in recent months after it tried to pressure him to avoid splitting the ruling communist party at all costs. Beijing is lately seen to be leaning in support of the rival communist party faction led by Prachanda and Madhav Nepal.India, in contrast, has already underlined that it has adopted a hands-off approach to the political developments in Nepal, calling PM Oli’s decision to dissolve the 275-member House of Representatives an internal matter.Pradeep Gyawali’s discussions with Jaishankar are expected to take up the boundary dispute that had soured relations between the two neighbours when Kathmandu issued a new political map.This visit will reboot ties, an Indian official said, stressing that the two countries shared a unique relationship of centuries-old civilizational ties based on shared geography, history, culture, language and religion. India is also looking to revive the religious and cultural heritage of Nepal given the civilizational ties between the two countries and could propose help to promote infrastructure development around sites that hold a potential from this perspective.It was a point that was underscored by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he last visited Nepal in 2018, starting the visit from Janakpur and launching the Ramayana Circuit by flagging off a bus route between Janakpur and Ayodhya. PM Modi had then announced a Rs 100-crore package to develop the holy city of Janakpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-chinese-prefer-indian-vaccine-first-nepal-to-india-ahead-of-minister-s-visit/story-qd6E8cs3Cn8NoxT0KIFSZO.html

She got a lot of inspiration from it, her brother Kishanbhai Patel said.He said his sister is suffering from hearing and speech impairment since birth and is learning art at a coaching institute.Vandana’s life-like rangoli of the Prime Minister was appreciated by several people. Rangoli is an art form in which patterns and portraits are created using coloured rice powder, sand or flowers.In a letter to Vandana, the Prime Minister, while encouraging her, said that obstacles and challenges keep coming up in life, but even in adverse circumstances if we don’t give up and fight resolutely then that is our real victory.He also wished a bright future for Vandana and hoped that she scales new heights in the field of art and education.In her letter to the Prime Minister, Vandana described him as an inspiration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fighting-challenges-in-life-resolutely-is-real-win-pm-narendra-modi-to-speech-impaired-woman/story-FM1DeXfKZyMEsA9GtMnYVL.html

The secondary spread by human handling (through fomites) cannot be ruled out,” the ministry said.Also Watch: Mass bird deaths in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, flu alert sounded So far, avian influenza has been reported from 12 epicentres of four states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala - after confirmation of positive samples from ICAR-NIHSAD. “So far, no human case of Avian Influenza has been reported. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to keep a strict watch over the evolving scenario,” the Centre has said. The ongoing outbreak has been reported from these parts of India:1. Rajasthan (crow) – Baran, Kota, Jhalawar2. Madhya Pradesh (crow) – Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa3. Himachal Pradesh (migratory birds) - Kangra4. Kerala (poultry-duck) - Kottayam, Allapuzha (4 epicentres)The government has asked states to strengthen the biosecurity of poultry farms, disinfect the affected areas, and properly dispose of dead birds and carcasses.The animal husbandry ministry has also asked states for timely collection and submission of samples for confirmation and further surveillance and intensification of surveillance plan.To prevent disease transmission from affected birds to poultry and humans, the ministry has asked states to follow the general prevention guidelines.“Coordination with the forest department for reporting any unusual mortality of birds was also suggested to the States. The other states were also requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality amongst birds and to report immediately to take necessary measures,” the ministry said in a statement.A control room has also been set up in New Delhi to keep watch on the situation and take stock on a daily basis of preventive and control measures undertaken by state authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-severe-is-the-latest-bird-flu-outbreak-and-govt-strategy-to-combat-it-all-you-need-to-know/story-aA4o7K4N6X1QzM8PkLscFL.html
06-01-2021||India||SC refuses to stay laws against interfaith marriage, issues notices to UP, Uttarakhand||The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on a petition questioning respective state legislations that outlaw and punish religious conversion by marriage, deceit, coercion or enticement. The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde issued the notices, but refused to stay the two laws despite arguments by petitioners that the law was being misused to harass individuals who married outside their faith. The court was hearing two petitions, one by a group of lawyers, and another by social activist Teesta Setalvad’s NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace. Also Read: SC to hear pleas against farm laws, issues related to farmers protest on January 11The persons who filed the first PIL are advocates Vishal Thakre and Abhay Singh Yadav and law researcher Pranvesh, based in Prayagraj. The petition said, “The Ordinance passed by the State of Uttar Pradesh and law passed by Uttarakhand are against the public policy and society at large and violates basic structure of the Constitution.” It pointed out that a similar law is being contemplated Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana and Assam.The Uttar Pradesh ordinance titled “Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020” outlaws religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement. It was promulgated on November 24. The law prescribes a jail term varying between one and five years, in addition to fines of up to Rs15,000 for those convicted under the law. The jail term goes up to 10 years and fine up to Rs25,000 for conversions of women belonging to scheduled caste or scheduled tribe communities or who are minors.The law was promulgated about a month after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to end “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.“This ordinance can become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to... falsely implicate anyone...there are probabilities to falsely implicate persons who are not involved in any such acts and it will be a grave injustice if this ordinance is passed,” said the petition.Senior advocate CU Singh who appeared for Setalvad’s NGO sought a stay on the UP ordinance. “Rampaging mobs are moving around lifting people from marriage ceremonies. This law requires prior reporting of marriages and burden of proof is on individual to show that he has not converted for marriage. These provisions are obnoxious particularly when the Supreme Court in 2018 held that state cannot interfere with individual’s right to marry as held in Shafin Jahan case.”The Uttarakhand law, called Freedom of Religion Act, was passed in 2018.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “Can a law be stayed if prosecution is oppressive or false. This is the problem when you come directly to Supreme Court.”While initially taking up the case, the bench was of view that the matter should go to the high court. A similar challenge is pending before the Allahabad and Uttarakhand high courts. But Singh told the Supreme Court that it was not just a matter concerning these states as a similar law had also been passed by Himachal Pradesh in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-stay-laws-against-interfaith-marriage-issues-notices-to-up-uttarakhand/story-t4pr8lr9CMFd29CeumLh8K.html

The only solution is to catch the culprit and punish them. It’s not possible to provide security to 2,000 scientists.” “I have posted everything on Facebook regarding the incident. I do not know the reason behind this but I can only guess that it might be a consequence of working on a critical technology. There might be other reasons as well,” he added.Mishra further said, it was important to bring this in public domain in order to save other scientists in future.“People take advantage of the silence. Agencies are looking into it. Surely it was no work of a street thug but some sophisticated espionage agency inside our organisation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-scientist-claims-to-be-poisoned-3-years-ago-seeks-punishment-for-culprit/story-WGA0I8Fv95M49z13ntN08H.html

The court directed all other petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws introduced by Centre to be also listed on Monday.Also Read: Supreme Court refuses to stay ‘love jihad’ laws in UP, Uttarakhand; issues noticeThe AG informed the court that talks with farmers are on and there are chances of reaching an agreement.“There are chances of the parties coming to an agreement .That chance will be closed if we file an affidavit,” AG Venugopal said. The bench said, “We want to encourage talks. We will keep the matters on Monday and if AG tells us that talks are on, we will adjourn the matter.” The bench observed that as of now there was no improvement in the situation at all. SG Tushar Mehta informed the court, “Our response is ready but since we are in a healthy discussion (with farmer unions) we have not filed it yet.” Sharma, who appeared in person to argue for the PIL, said that during the passing of the 1954 Constitutional amendment introducing Entry 33, only 8-9 states out of 19 existing states had ratified. The farmer unions have been holding protests over the three farm laws introduced by Centre last year. The laws in question, The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, have also been opposed by some states, which have passed laws to blunt the implementation of the above enacted laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-pleas-against-farm-laws-issues-related-to-farmers-protest-on-january-11/story-bRmxuIXP4fMe6knMUKOgjL.html

The Centre told the court that “healthy discussions” are going on with farmers after which the court adjourned the matter for further hearing on January 11.Attorney General K K Venugopal said there is good chance that parties may come to a conclusion in the near future and filing of response by the Centre on the pleas challenging the new farm laws might foreclose the negotiations between the farmers and government.“We encourage consultation. We can adjourn the matters on Monday (January 11) if you submit the same due to the ongoing consultation process,” the bench said.The farmers have been protesting at Singhu, Tikri and Ghaziabad border points near the national capital demanding the repeal of the laws passed in September last year. Several rounds of talks have taken place between the government and the farmers but no resolution has been found.In the last round on January 4, the talks were inconclusive as the farmers remained adamant with their demand that the laws be scrapped. The government has ruled this out, and has asked the farmer leaders to suggest changes to the laws which it said can be discussed.The three laws against which farmers have been protesting are: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The farmers claim these laws will benefit big corporate houses. The government has, however, tried to allay these fears and even said that it is ready to discuss changes to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-encourage-consultation-supreme-court-while-hearing-petition-against-farm-laws/story-7TDZV8UzLnZIO9L6OMwbnI.html

Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan administered the oath of office to justice Goswami at Tummalapalli Kalakshetram in the city. Andhra chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, chief secretary Adityanath Das, director general of police (DGP) Gautam Sawang, high court judges and their family members, besides several state ministers, MPs, MLAs and officials took part in the ceremony. Later, the government hosted high tea for the dignitaries. Later, justice Goswami left for high court and took up the cases in the first bench comprising justice Praveen Kumar. Justice Goswami, who was transferred from Sikkim, replaces justice J K Maheshwari, who has been moved to Sikkim. The abrupt transfer of justice Maheshwari within 14 months of his appointment as Andhra Pradesh chief justice comes in the wake of the chief minister’s complaint on October 6 against Supreme Court judge justice N V Ramana to the Chief Justice of India. Also Read: Andhra CM likens attacks on temple as ‘political guerrilla warfare’, directs police to tackle situationJagan alleged that justice Ramana, in collusion with justice Maheshwari and a few other judges, apart from Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu, conspired to topple his democratically-elected government in the state. He explained how Justice Maheshwari had passed orders against his government as part of the conspiracy. Born on March 11, 1961 at Jorhat in Assam, justice Goswami obtained his degree in law from the Government Law College, Guwahati in 1985 and enrolled himself as an advocate in the Guwahati high court. In 2011, he took over as an additional judge in Guwahati high court. He served as the executive chairman of Nagaland state legal services authority from 2011 to 2013. Later, he was appointed as a permanent judge in the high court. He was an acting chief justice of Guwahati high court twice in 2018 and was later elevated as full-time chief justice of Sikkim on October 15, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/andhra-pradesh/justice-goswami-takes-over-as-new-chief-justice-of-andhra-pradesh/story-cie7eB8wb03Yy8Q7sRolsL.html
06-01-2021||India||Covid-19: Firms may face problems in finding volunteers for vaccine trials in India||With two vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) already getting emergency use authorisation (EUA) in India, recruiting trial subjects is likely to become difficult for the companies next in line. India’s apex drug regulator approved Serum Institute of India’s Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at the beginning of the year. The companies have said just the news that a vaccine will be available soon has had an adverse impact on recruitment . “Even without the emergency use authorisation, there were many press releases that the vaccine is soon going to be available. And, that has hurt us badly in terms of recruitment because a lot of people asked us whether they should still be participating in the clinical trial if a vaccine was going to be out soon,” said Dr V Krishna Mohan, executive director at Bharat Biotech, in a webinar held just before the approvals. He said, unlike in the United States and United Kingdom, the clinical trials in India are happening at the same time as vaccines are transitioning to EUA. Also read | India crosses 150,000 Covid-19 deaths: Here’s where other worst-hit countries standHe said that the challenge was bigger for Bharat Biotech as they were focussing on people in the older age groups. The oldest person to enrol for the Covaxin trial was 97, he said. “Hospitals have also asked us whether it is ethical to continue a clinical trial when you have an EUA. These questions need to be answered,” said Dr Mohan. There are at least six other vaccines under human clinical trial in India. These are: the indigenously developed ZydCov-D by Zydus Cadila that is to start the phase III trial, the Russian Sputnik V vaccine whose phase II and III trial is being conducted by Dr Reddy’s, Serum Institute of India’s second vaccine NovaVax that is being considered for a phase III trial, vaccine candidates by Biological E and Gennova that are to begin phase I trials, and Bharat Biotech’s second nasal vaccine candidate. For Dr Pankaj Patel, chairperson of Cadila healthcare, the challenge would be the time taken for recruitment. He said, “The number of vaccines that are being developed or have been developed in the past in India – there are already vaccines available still companies were able to conduct clinical studies and get volunteers and approval. The challenge would be in terms of the speed of recruitment and not in getting the volunteers to come in.” The major concern, however, is regarding subgroup analyses as those who are the most vulnerable will likely start getting the vaccine soon. “If we think about Covid-19 vaccines, the first goal is to protect the vulnerable and we are working towards the vaccine being efficacious. We have seen results from Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford/AstraZeneca, these are based on overall efficacy. But is overall efficacy what we really measure in the most vulnerable?” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, leading vaccine expert and professor at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory at Christian Medical College-Vellore. “We have some indicators that the elderly are protected, but we do not know with sufficient confidence that the vaccines are working in these vulnerable groups. Similarly for children, the trials have only just started. Now, if you have an efficacious product developed in the middle of a pandemic, there is an ethical imperative to start to use it for vulnerable populations which only increases the challenge for our ability to assess efficacy in those sub groups,” she said. The real challenge would be three to four months down the line, said Drug Controller General of India VG Somani at the webinar. “There is definitely a little bit of challenge once something is available. But they will have to wait till their turn comes and it is not very clear to the common public at present when that turn will come. So probably it will not be that big challenge for the coming three to four months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-firms-may-face-problems-in-finding-volunteers-for-vaccine-trials-in-india/story-bZutnAyiWOnmB5F9NKROlI.html

This project will help improve the river transport infrastructure in West Bengal and help in the economic development of the state by connecting the hinterland with markets and job centres in Kolkata’s Metropolitan Area”.The agreement was signed by Dr C S Mohapatra, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of India; Shri Rajdeep Dutta, Deputy Resident Commissioner, on behalf of the Government of West Bengal; and Mr Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, India on behalf of the World Bank.The project will cover the five most populous districts of southern West Bengal, including its urban agglomeration -- the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) where around 30 million people or one-third of West Bengal’s population live.“This operation will allow the state to invest in Kolkata’s economic productivity by making its waterways and ferry services part of an efficient and safe urban mobility strategy,” said Mr Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India.“Importantly, given Kolkata’s strategic location, the project is also ensuring that the metropolitan area emerges as a transport and logistics hub for the sub-region, leveraging the EDFC and connecting to the north-east and the land-locked countries of Nepal and Bhutan,” he added. The Hooghly river, a distributary of the river Ganga, in Kolkata separates the Kolkata port from its large consumption centres, which are, its wholesale market and its vast hinterland comprising among others the entire North East of India and two landlocked neighbouring countries namely, Nepal and Bhutan.West Bengal’s ferries can provide an efficient, flexible mode of public transport for both passengers and freight, saving on operating costs and travel time when compared with road journeys. In the first phase, the project will enhance the capacity and improve the safety of the Inland Water Transport system; including rehabilitating existing jetties, buying new ferries with enhanced design; and installing electronic gates in 40 locations.In the second phase, it will support long-term investments for passenger movements, including in terminals and jetties; improve the design of the inland water transport vessels; ensure night navigation on the most hazardous and trafficked routes and crossing points, and encourage the private sector to invest in Ro-Ro vessels that will allow easier movement of trucks across the Hooghly river.The $105 million loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), has a maturity of 17 years, including a grace period of seven years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-bank-commits-usd-105-million-to-improve-west-bengal-waterways/story-d2slX0VHa4zGxQf1TUBEbM.html

The surveillance should not be restricted to the protected areas alone and should be extended to all wetlands and habitats that host migratory birds and areas with any possibility of interaction of migratory and poultry birds, the advisory said.“All deaths of migratory birds—their number and cause are to be reported to the environment ministry immediately,” the letter said.“Intensive surveillance should be undertaken to look for any unreasonable bird behaviour, or death among wild birds as well as migratory birds. Vigilance should be stepped up in the zoos also.”The states have been asked to send weekly reports to the ministry with details from important bird sites, number and species of birds that arrived, approximate period of arrival and stay, any changes in migratory pattern vis a vis number, arrival sites, etc as compared to previous years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-mass-bird-deaths-centre-asks-states-to-constitute-monitoring-panels/story-DfxSdv3IoOYPDYdIHhKP2L.html

Among the INSACOG network of labs that has returned positive samples for new variant after genome sequencing are NIMHANS, Bengaluru, CCMB, Hyderabad, NIV, Pune, IGIB, Delhi, NCDC, New Delhi, and NCBG, Kolkata. NCBS, InSTEM, Bengaluru, CDFD Hyderabad, ILS Bhubaneswar, and NCCS Pune have so far found no UK mutant virus among the samples that have been sequenced in their labs.From November 25 to December 23, 2020, midnight, about 33,000 passengers disembarked at various Indian airports from UK. All these passengers are being tracked and subjected by states to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests to detect Covid-19. All these persons have been kept in single room isolation in designated health care facilities by respective state governments. Their close contacts have also been put under quarantine. Comprehensive contact tracing has been initiated for co-travellers, family contacts and others. Genome sequencing on other specimens is going on, according to the ministry of health. “The situation is under careful watch and regular advice is being provided to the states for enhanced surveillance, containment, testing and dispatch of samples to INSACOG labs,” said the health ministry in a statement.The Indian government had suspended air travel from the United Kingdom December 23 onwards after a new variant of Sar-CoV-2 was found to be circulating in London and other parts of the country. The new variant – which has 23 mutations, including one on the receptor binding protein on the spike used by the virus to enter the human cells – is thought to be 70% more transmissible, raising concerns of super-spreading events. However, doctors monitoring these patients have not found severe illness among these patients because of the new variant. The presence of the new UK variant has already been reported by Denmark, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden, France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Japan, Lebanon and Singapore, so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reports-71-cases-of-uk-variant-of-covid-19/story-NgltdZ9JGtoqLZmjFxPKIK.html

06-01-2021||India||‘Bharat Biotech vaccine approved in clinical trial mode, consent of participants has to be taken’: ICMR||Balram Bhargava, chief of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said on Tuesday that Bharat Biotech’s Covid-19 vaccine has been cleared in the clinical trial mode, which means consent of participants has to be taken. He was responding to the questions being raised on the clearance given to Covaxin.“Permission for restricted use in clinical trial mode has been allowed which means consent of participants has to be taken and there has to be a regular follow up of participants,” Bhargava said at a press conference on Tuesday.Explaining the process followed in granting nod to AstraZeneca-Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine and indigenously developed Covaxin, Bhargava said, “The existing pandemic situation, high mortality, available science and lack of definitive treatments were considered by the subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 of CDSCO for granting accelerated approval to these vaccines, and that is in our legal provision.”The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had on Sunday approved AstraZenca’s vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive.Industry experts and some opposition leaders have expressed concern over the absence of Phase 3 trial data on Covaxin. The critics have cautioned that “sidestepping” processes and giving “premature” clearance could risk lives and fuel vaccine hesitancy in India.“In a pandemic situation, restricted use is considered based on safety and immunogenicity data while phase three clinical trail is still ongoing. The immunogenicity data generated through phase two clinical trial serves as a surrogate for efficacy. The Clinical Trial Rule, 2019, provides for considering phase two results to guide approval. Now the SEC guides the DCGI in the process of decision making for restricted use under emergency situation. Now we have two vaccines,” Bhargava said.The Union health ministry, meanwhile, said on Tuesday that it is prepared to roll out Covid-19 vaccine within 10 days, but a final decision on the launch date is yet to be taken.“Based on the feedback from the dry-run of vaccination drive, the health ministry is ready to introduce Covid-19 vaccine within 10 days from the date of emergency use authorisation,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.He also said that healthcare and frontline workers need not register themselves for the vaccination drive as their database has been uploaded on the CoWIN vaccine delivery management system in a bulk.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-vaccine-approved-in-clinical-trial-mode-consent-of-participants-has-to-be-taken-icmr/story-NSWVTh7douMtYDl1ZVnP6K.html

He also alleged that the opposition is indulged in vandalizing acts to divert public attention from welfare schemes launched by his government.“A new model of political guerilla warfare is taking place in the state. Temples and idols are being attacked with political motives. Attacks are being held on temples at places with less population, at midnight hours at isolated places. The idols are being desecrated,” Reddy said while addressing Spandana’ video conference with district collectors and SPs. “The next day those incidents are being publicized in social media. After that, a section of mainstream media is publicizing that news. Opposition parties are using those opportunities,” he added.Reddy said that the Andhra Pradesh government is delivering many welfare schemes for the public.“Unable to digest the public welfare, such incidents are being orchestrated by the opposition. Without any devotion or fear for God; idols are being demolished. The opposition wants to defame the government through these incidents. We have to carefully monitor these strategies,” he said.Reddy said that this type of incident never happened in past and there is a need to tackle political guerilla warfare.“Such a situation never arose in past. This kind of political guerilla warfare should be tackled. As of now, 36,000 CCTV Cameras are installed in temples. Now communal harmony should be publicized. Stern action should be taken on those who spread hatred among castes and religions. Such situations should not be spared,” he directed police officials.“If anybody tries for political mileage, they should be taught a lesson. Every incident of idols’ desecration or attack on temples should be carefully and meticulously investigated. The culprits should be displayed publicly. In this matter, collectors and SPs should not spare anybody. They should be taught a lesson,” he added.Earlier on Tuesday, the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) general secretary and advisor to Andhra Pradesh government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy raised suspicions towards Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in the matter of attacks on temples and alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to gain a political foothold in the state by holding agitation on such incidents.“Opposition parties are playing a dangerous game. They are playing with religion and Gods. Attacks are being held on small temples in small places, where security measures are nominal. Will the government, or YSRCP, or YS Jaganmohan Reddy get any benefit from such incidents? Even a small boy can say that such attacks will hamper the prestige,” he said while addressing a press conference.“When we were in opposition, we have never spoke on such incidents. We believe that religion and devotion are personal feelings. Our party works beyond such religious or caste politics. We never acted such irresponsible deeds. We appeal to the public to think. Who will do such things? Definitely, it is the handiwork of opposition TDP. They want to get political gain,” he said.Attacking BJP which tried to hold Ramateertham Dham Yatra on Tuesday against the alleged attacks on Hindu temples in Andhra Pradesh, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said, “BJP wants to make inroads into the state. That’s why holding agitation. But it is not correct on their part to try to get political mileage of such unfortunate incidents. BJP speaking of religion is a well-known fact. That party is trying to get a foothold in the state.”The idol of Lord Ram was allegedly desecrated at Ramateertham in Vizianagaram district here on December 29 following which a group of BJP workers staged a protest on the temple premises.On December 31, Andhra Pradesh Police DGP Gautam Sawang had said that an investigation is going on in the incident of desecration of Lord Ram idol at Ramateertham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-likens-attacks-on-temple-as-political-guerrilla-warfare-directs-police-to-tackle-situation/story-cuo1oSBunKsObQ8z77h8vN.html

He was speaking at a meeting of the Haj Committee of India officials and Haj Group organisers at Haj House here.“Today discussed various issues concerned to Haj 2021 with Haj Committee of India officials and Haj Group Organisers at Haj House in Mumbai. Arrangements are being made to give Corona vaccine to all the people who will go to perform Haj from India,” the Union Minister informed via Twitter.The last date for submission of forms for Haj 2021 has been extended till January 10, 2021.Last month, during a meeting with the Haj Committee here to discuss the preparations and registrations for Haj 2021, Naqvi lauded the committee for making the registration process “100 per cent” digital, in turn making India the “first country” to do so.In another tweet, the Union Minister on Tuesday slammed the Opposition for raising questions on the measure taken by the Centre to combat the coronavirus pandemic. “Those people who earlier raised questions on welfare measures taken by Narendra Modi government during the corona crisis, are now trying to create confusion on the Corona vaccines which have been developed by hard-working scientists of our country,” he said in a subsequent tweet.“...Some failed and frustrated political players’, who are unable to convince the people, are trying to confuse by using Corona vaccine as confusion rexine.” Last week, Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) announced “restricted emergency use” for two Covid-19 vaccine candidates -- Bharat Biotech’s COVAXIN and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-arrangements-being-made-to-vaccinate-haj-pilgrims-says-union-minister-naqvi/story-Cb5nIE8PCbSTduN2kuSv0J.html
06-01-2021||India||Delhiwale: Memories of train journeys||Some trains are moving. Some trains are still. A few passengers here and there, walking with their suitcases and kids. And suddenly, a rail engine whistles.The sounds of trains have always evoked the mysteries of travelling, and of escape—this is particularly true when one is living in such a seemingly endless city as Delhi. Yet, these sounds have become rarer in the times of the coronavirus pandemic. No passenger trains were running during the weeks of lockdown (except for the ones carrying migrants from their adopted cities to their home districts). And only a few are back in operation. Gone are the days when the ‘Delhiwales’ could, on impulse, book a ‘Tatkal’ in a Shatabdi to Agra or Kalka as the weekend approached. One is bound to grapple with all the tiresome questions—how crowded will the coaches be? How high are the chances of catching the infection in them?Until we can again have the semblance of a normal time, there is a place from which you can experience the thrill of rail travel without even stepping inside the rail station. This is the overbridge that runs over the New Delhi railway station. The unique destination was briefly mentioned on these pages some years ago but now in these extraordinary times it has acquired a more profound significance. Usually busy with traffic, the bridge has a broad sidewalk that makes it possible for the pedestrian to spend a long time looking down at the station. The platforms are as close from here as if you were standing on the footbridges of the station itself—you can even spot the resident rats. The vantage point also gives a bird’s eye view of almost the entire railway station. This late afternoon, you can clearly see the destination plates on the red AC coaches of a train—that’s Mumbai-bound Rajdhani Express. And see, over there, a group of porters are dragging a trolley. In another train, a woman is sitting by the window, her head resting against the grills, her face masked.And now the air fills up with the echo of a railway station announcement—the arrival of so-and-so Express on platform number so-and-so. This computerised female voice is so familiar, and one has heard it so many times in so many railway stations, that it instantly evokes those carefree days when we lived without the sword of coronavirus hanging over our head. The moment painfully brings back the memories of a life we have lost due to the ongoing pandemic. Some minutes later, the Rajdhani starts to leave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-memories-of-train-journeys/story-ONfDInSoChYkVscROWLWrL.html
06-01-2021||India||‘We will not discontinue Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna in Chhattisgarh’: CM Bhupesh Baghel||After the Central government decided to procure 24 lakh (MT) paddy from the Chhattisgarh government on Sunday, the state government is claiming that the Centre has not followed its commitment to procure 60 lakh (MT) of the food grain. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, in an interview, said the state unit of BJP is misleading the Centre by informing them that the state is procuring paddy at Rs 2500 per quintal not on MSP. Baghel said that the Congress government is giving more money under a different scheme and there is an attempt to hamper the state government’s Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, under which the state government is giving Rs 10,000 per acre to sugarcane, paddy and maize farmers of the state. The Centre’s decision on Sunday has given the Congress-led government a political weapon to target the BJP saying this shows that the Centre is not keen about the welfare of farmers and the minimum support price assurance. Q. What is this whole procurement issue? The Central Government is saying that they will procure only 24 lakh (MT) but Chhattisgarh government has claimed that the Central government agreed for 60 lakh (MT) earlier? What is your stand? A. See, initially, the Centre agreed for 60 lakh (MT) procurement of paddy from the Chhattisgarh government but on Sunday they said that they will procure 24 lakh (MT). I believe, the Centre has been misinformed...…The issue is the feedback given by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) state unit to the Centre , especially Raman Singh ji, who is saying that the government is procuring paddy at Rs 2500 per quintal, which is not correct …. We procured paddy in the state on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) last year and even this year also. Although, in the first year of the Congress government we procured at Rs 2500 per quintal but the Centre had then said the state government cannot give a bonus hence we stopped. Our point is that the Central government is giving Kisan Samman Nidhi and in the same way we started the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna… What is the problem in that? Q. Now since the Centre has restricted the procurement to only 24 lakh (MT) will it affect the state’s Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna? A. See, these people (Centre) say that under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, if anything is given to the farmers it will be considered as bonus. My question is how will you define anything as bonus? If paddy was purchased for Rs 2500, it will come under bonus but when Raman Singh had given a bonus of Rs 300 per quintal what was that? We were told to procure only on MSP and you can check the record of last two years that we are procuring paddy on MSP only. Q. So are you saying that this is an attempt to hamper the continuation of the state’s Kisan Nyay Yojna? A. Yes, that’s exactly what it is. In the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, the state government is giving Rs 10,000 per acre to sugarcane, paddy and maize farmers. The money is given in installments. So how did this money became ‘bonus’? On one hand, the Central government is giving Kisan Samman Nidhi, which does not comes under bonus but when we give money to farmers it will be treated as bonus? Secondly, the central government agreed to procure 24 lakh (MT) of paddy, which means they have accepted that we are not giving any bonus. Otherwise we would not have been allowed to deposit a single grain in FCI. Q. So basically you are alleging that the Centre is trying to stop the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Scheme? Then how will you resolve this issue with the Centre? A. They are trying to stop the scheme but we are firm about it…See, the state government has its own scheme, we have started a scheme under the directives and rules of the Union Government only. Many states have also started similar schemes …We believe that everything can be resolved through communication and are continuously talking over this issue with the Central government. Q. With whom is the state government negotiating? A. We talked to the Prime Minister and Food Minister yesterday. I thanked the Prime Minister and said that the Centre has procured 24 lakh MT but the commitment was of 60 lakh (MT) and demanded the rest of the procurement. The PM said that he will look into the matter. Similarly, I also spoke to the Food Minister, who claimed that the Chhattisgarh government is giving incentives, I told him the state government is not giving any incentives but is giving money to farmers as you are giving under the Kisan Samman Nidhi. Q. It means that you will continue the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna under any circumstance? A. Yes, there is no question of scrapping it. The Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna is a separate scheme started by the state government and paddy procurement under MSP is a different scheme. All we are saying is that we will explain to the Central government about our scheme and clear a misunderstanding if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-will-not-discontinue-rajiv-gandhi-kisan-nyay-yojna-in-chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel/story-Rq9Nw9d4xfwdxehrtlCPhJ.html

06-01-2021||India||‘Conception that housewives don’t add to economic value of household must be overcome’: SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that the conception that housewives do not work or do not add economic value to the household is “problematic” and needs to be overcome. The Court was dealing with grant of compensation in a motor accident case, where the Delhi High Court had reduced the earning of the deceased wife as she was a homemaker.A three-judge bench headed by Justice NV Ramana felt that fixing an economic value to the hard work and labour by homemakers is difficult but nevertheless significant. Citing the 2011 Census, Justice Ramana, in a concurring but separate order found that nearly 159.85 million women in India are engaged in “household work” as compared to 5.79 million men.A recent report released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed that on an average, women spend 299 minutes a day on unpaid domestic services for household members versus 97 minutes spent by men on an average. She prepares food, manages procurement of groceries and shopping needs, cleans and manages the house and surroundings, undertakes decoration, repairs and maintenance work and tends to children and aged members of the household.Also read: Dry run blooper in Varanasi leads to vaccine boxes transported on bicycle“Despite all of the above, the conception that housemakers do not work or that they do not add economic value to the household is a problematic idea that has persisted for many years and must be overcome,” Justice Ramana added.The bench, also comprising Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Surya Kant unanimously agreed to raise the compensation awarded to the motor accident victims – Poonam, a housewife and her husband Vinod - to Rs 33.2 lakh instead of Rs 22 lakh awarded by the High Court.The Court said that a homemaker’s notional income must be determined by Courts keeping in mind the number of women engaged in this activity, and the value of their labour, service and sacrifices. Their activities contribute in a real way to the economic condition of the family and the economy of the nation and ought to be recognized in reflection of our changing attitudes and mindsets as well as towards achieving the constitutional vision of social equality and dignity of all individuals.The motor accidents claim in the present case was instituted by the two daughters of the couple who died in April 2014. The Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal awarded the daughters Rs 40.7 lakh compensation but on an appeal by the insurance company, the same was reduced to Rs 22 lakh by High Court||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conception-that-housewives-don-t-add-to-economic-value-of-household-must-be-overcome-sc/story-YNfIxljYAnjJHpMYoMa5sN.html
06-01-2021||India||NIA probes union of Chennai-Dhaka couple who studied in London, finds no ‘love jihad’||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently questioned on WhatsApp an Indian woman from a Chennai business family who converted to Islam to marry the son of a Bangladeshi politician after meeting him in London, where they studied together, to find out if their marital union was a case of what some Hindu groups describe as “love jihad”.The agency did not find any evidence that the interfaith marriage was “love jihad”, a term groups use to describe some relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, but one that the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise. The woman said she was happy with her husband and had willingly converted to Islam, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. ‘States can’t interfere…’: Owaisi slams BJP over religious conversion lawsHer father, a Chennai-based businessman, complained in May last year that she was abducted in London by the son of a leader of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and a former member of Parliament. He alleged that she had been forcibly taken to Bangladesh after she was radicalised and converted to Islam. The woman studied in London with the Bangladesh politician’s son. Also Read: Eliminate State and social interference in matters of conscienceTamil Nadu Police asked the NIA to investigate the matter because it had international ramifications. After recording her parents’ statement, the central anti-terror agency contacted her on WhatsApp. “During the questioning (over WhatsApp), she told us that she married him willingly after converting to Islam and has not been forced at all in the marriage. She said she is happy,” said an NIA officer who didn’t want to be named. Officials cited above said their probe in the case was “more or less over” and a closure report will be filed in court after other verifications are completed. This is not the first time that an NIA probe of a “love jihad” angle has not yielded any evidence of a conspiracy. An NIA spokesperson said the case is under investigation. Also Read:  3 men framed in false ‘love jihad’ case: Cops“A complaint of kidnapping was filed last year and we had registered a case,” said Chennai commissioner of police, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, unable to recall the sections under which the case was registered. “Since we transferred the case to the NIA, we aren’t aware of further details or the present status of the investigation.”Another senior official of Tamil Nadu police who did not wish to be named said, “When we get a complaint of such a nature which has international and religious ramifications, we don’t investigate.” “Our stand is to transfer it to the appropriate agency and in a case like this it is the NIA.” The official, however, could not recall the complaint made last year.Also Read: The Number Theory| A decade of rightward shift in Indian politicsNIA’s probe of interfaith marriages in Kerala, including that of Hadiya’s marriage to Shafin Jehan that became a cause célèbre, revealed that there had been no coercion to marry the brides and convert them to Islam. It examined several cases in Kerala where it was alleged that the woman had been forced to convert to Islam. The Supreme Court too, in 2018, overruled a Kerala high court order that annulled the marriage of Hadiya to Jehan, saying the right to marry a person of one’s choice was integral to Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution. The Central government has said in Parliament that there was no term such as “love jihad” in the law. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said in the Lok Sabha in February 2020: “Article 25 of the Constitution provides for the freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health. Various courts have upheld this view including the Kerala high court. The term ‘love jihad’ is not defined under the extant laws”. However, two stringent recent laws in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh appear to want to crack down on interfaith relationships that allegedly use marriage as a lure to force Hindu women to convert to Islam. The stringent laws do not use the words “love jihad”, and the UP law has already been challenged in the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-probes-union-of-chennai-dhaka-couple-who-studied-in-london-finds-no-love-jihad/story-hkQmEUbQyxBACkC0DXADSL.html
06-01-2021||India||Central Vista plan gets SC nod in 2-1 majority verdict||The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the thumbs-up to the Central government’s over ₹15,000 crore redevelopment plan for the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi where a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices are to be built. The court declared that the project is “in line with the standards of public trust” and constitutes a “just use of resources” for a public purpose, without breaching any tenet of environmental protection. By a 2-1 majority -- the majority judgment was given by justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari, while justice Sanjiv Khanna disagreed and wrote a separate order -- the bench dismissed a clutch of petitions against the redevelopment project while holding that the government and its agencies fulfilled all legal requirements in altering the land use of the seven plots in the area, and in obtaining the environmental clearances for constructing the new Parliament building. The majority judgment upheld the land use plan for the seven plots in the Central Vista area where a new Parliament, with a built-up area of around 60,000 square metres, and expanded seating for over 1,200 members of both Houses, along with 10 other buildings to house all 51 Union ministries, are to be built within an integrated complex marked by underground transit connectivity and structural identity. The minority view, however, held that the land use plan and the environmental clearance must be reviewed. In split verdicts, the view of the majority holds.The government hailed the majority verdict, which was criticised by green activists and political parties who have been concerned about its environmental impact, the potential loss of heritage buildings and the vast public funds to be devoted to the project at a time when the nation is battling the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy is in recession.Rejecting the petitioners’ argument on whether the government should spend so much money on the redevelopment plan, the court said that it “cannot be called upon to govern” by dictating that the government desist from spending money on a particular project or ask it to run its offices only from areas decided by the court. Apart from affirming the land use, defended by the government through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the court also dismissed objections to the Central Vista Committee’s recommendations and the environmental clearances, paving the way for a new Parliament building, which the government intends to construct first and has thus separated it from the plan to build the Central Secretariat. The court said the government will, however, have to take approvals from the Heritage Conservation Committee and municipal authorities before the construction begins on the new Parliament. At the same time, it urged the government to install smog towers atop the new Parliament building while making smog towers and smog guns mandatory for all construction projects in the future. Justice Khanna, in his verdict, questioned the process by which the land use was changed, besides inadequate consultation and public participation.The judge found favour with the arguments made by the petitioners, through senior counsel Shyam Divan, Sanjay Hegde and advocates Shikhil Suri and Shadan Farasat, that the entire process had been short-circuited, and required a review.But the majority verdict held that the Delhi Development Act did authorise the government to “modify” the master plan for the Capital without the necessity of specific amendments or a new master plan because the proposed changes were essentially in the nature of “swapping of the uses of the concerned Government plots” and do not pertain to any private ownership at all. It rejected the challenges to the October 17, 2017, and March 20, 2020, notifications with respect to what it called a “minor” change in land use in the Central Vista area, noting the land was to be ultimately used for the similar purposes of having government offices, public and semi-public use and for recreation, and no change of a substantial or radical character was envisaged. “The project does not involve any conversion into private ownership and has no element whatsoever of permitting commercial use of vital public resources.The proposed project is in line with the standards of public trust and the petitioners have failed to point out any circumstance which would suggest otherwise,” stated the verdict. It also underscored that there was a “substantial compliance of the prescribed procedure” by the government and that the final decision was the outcome of involvement of all the planning authorities referred to under the Delhi Development Act.About the need to have a more extensive public hearing for a project of national importance such as this, the majority judgment said that the government records substantiated that the process of inviting objections and chance to raise grievances were accorded to the objectors. It turned down the petitioners’ contention that Parliament was too kept out of the purview of consultative exercise.The verdict noted that the proposal regarding the new Parliament building was placed before the General Purposes Committee (GPC) which was headed by the Lok Sabha speaker and included MPs from all major national political parties having a presence in Parliament. The judgment also shot down the petitioners’ contention that the entire Central Vista area was a heritage zone, after relying upon the listed heritage chart submitted before the bench by government authorities. It did not find any infirmity in having separate plans for Parliament on the one hand and the Central Secretariat and other buildings on the other, noting that it was for the government to formulate such policy decisions regarding the redevelopment. It further upheld the appointment of the consultant, stating the documents corroborated that there had been no favouritism or malice behind the decision.“The political issues including regarding development policies of the Government of the day must be debated in the Parliament, to which it is accountable. The role of Court is limited to examining the constitutionality including legality of the policy and Government actions. The right to development, as discussed above, is a basic human right and no organ of the State is expected to become an impediment in the process of development as long as the government proceeds in accordance with law,” concluded the majority.Union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri welcomed the verdict and pledged to maintain the highest standards in executing the project.“Delhi is on course to becoming a World Class capital city and in the first step by the time nation completes 75 years of its Independence in 2022 a new Parliament building will be ready reflecting the aspirations of new India,” Puri tweeted.The Congress said the project was not a legal issue, but a case of misplaced priorities of “an autocrat seeking to etch his name in the annals of history”. Senior party spokesperson and deputy leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma said: “We are living in strange times. No relief for the migrant labour, no justice for India’s farmers fighting for their rights in bitter cold, pouring rain, tear gas and braving lathis. As we approach Ganatantra Diwas, need to reflect on state of Republic.”Environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari said the project was harmful for the environment and an encroachment of public space by the government. “This project is an encroachment of open places, which are meant for the public, by government,” Kandhari said.Lt Col Anuj Srivastava (retd), an architect and activist of LokPATH, which describes itself as a public collaborative for holistic and appropriate development, said more public consultation was required for the project to go ahead. “It’s a 611-page judgment.The court heard us patiently. The judgment is a split one but we are quite disheartened and disappointed. Are we leaving something for our children that we will be proud of? We are exploring our legal options.”(With inputs from HTCs and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-plan-gets-sc-nod-in-2-1-majority-verdict/story-dOu6irheyMhXsCk9SrJXDL.html
06-01-2021||India||Mallya’s properties in South Africa, Europe identified; to be attached soon||The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which investigates money laundering cases, has identified several properties of businessman Vijay Mallya in South Africa and Europe, acquired through a web of offshore companies and trusts, which will soon be attached, people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. So far, ED has attached Mallya assets worth Rs 11,231 crore (more than the alleged proceeds of crime), which are mostly located in India, except a property worth Rs 14 crore attached in France in November last year. The agency didn’t touch his assets in the UK as 13 Indian banks led by State Bank of India are already pursuing the courts there to recover the money from him. The former liquor baron flew to the UK from India in March 2016 as banks closed in on him to recover Rs.9,000 crore owed to them by his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. One of the officials cited above said the had located Mallya’s properties in South Africa, including a mansion bought by him in Cape Town, and a couple of properties in Europe. The official refused to share the details and value of these properties until the exact ownership is verified and they are attached. Mallya is currently on bail in the UK and his extradition, although cleared by the courts,has been delayed because of a “confidential legal hearing”, according to the British high commission in Delhi. Indian agencies have not been informed officially or unofficially on what grounds Mallya’s extradition has been held up. Officials in ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) suspect that Mallya had applied for asylum in the UK on “certain unknown specific grounds” because his claim of a “political witch-hunt” against him has been debunked by British courts. It has been alleged by both the agencies that Mallya diverted most of the money taken from Indian banks into foreign assets, the Indian Premier League (IPL) team and F1 motorsport firm Formula One. Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot had issued a ruling for Mallya’s extradition to India in December 2018 in response to a request from the Indian government, which has accused him of “knowingly misrepresenting” the profitability of his companies when he sought bank loans in 2009. The UK high court, in its ruling in April, upheld the senior district judge’s verdict. When the UK high court refused Mallya permission to appeal to the Supreme Court last month on the ground that his case didn’t involve a “point of law of general public importance”, the long-drawn extradition process was believed to have entered the last stage. Mallya is currently on bail on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017. An email sent to Mallya remained unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mallya-s-properties-in-south-africa-europe-identified-to-be-attached-soon/story-MZksYdotJxI5bO3eY5QMOM.html

Modi is the prime accused in a ₹13,500-crore fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB).The Mehtas had approached the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court through their lawyers in November, seeking a pardon and requesting that they be enlisted as approvers in the cases against Modi.Special judge VC Barde allowed the plea and directed the investigating agency, the Enforcement Directorate (ED), to facilitate their arrival in India so they can appear before court and make a statement.The ED has claimed that 49-year-old Modi, who is lodged in London’s Wandsworth jail and is the subject of two extradition requests (by the Central Bureau of Investigation and ED), had diverted around ₹1,201.18 crore ($175.1 million) through his sister Purvi. The agency ,in its charge sheet, claimed that Purvi was an active participant in the generation of proceeds of crime and in money laundering. It claimed that Purvi was a director in Dubai- and Hong Kong-based companies that received funds obtained by Modi through fraudulent means. Purvi has maintained that she had no knowledge of these transactions. In a reply to the designated court hearing a plea filed by ED for confiscation of Modi’s properties, she claimed that she had nothing to do with the alleged proceeds of crime.Maiank and Purvi, in separate applications seeking a pardon, said they were not prime accused and had only a limited role to play in the cases against Modi. They submitted that as close relatives of Modi, they are in “a unique position to be able to provide substantial and important evidence, information, proof, and documents relevant to Nirav Modi and his actions/dealings. Such information will significantly aid the further investigation of ED and will prove critical to conclusively establish the facts against Nirav Modi and other key accused persons”.Their lawyer, Amit Desai, contended that because of Modi’s alleged criminal activities, their personal and professional lives had been brought to a standstill and they had distanced themselves from the diamond trader. “The applicant undertakes to be examined as a witness in this court and submits that he/she will make true and full disclosure of the whole of the circumstances and events as known to him/her, without concealing any evidence and will provide complete information regarding the same, which is true according to him/her and within his/her knowledge,’ they claimed in their applications.They pleaded that they were ready to give statements as witnesses over a video conference or any other electronic means convenient at such time and in such manner as directed by the court.ED, in its reply, submitted: “The applicant as an approver can help ED to prosecute the mastermind, to identify and attach more proceeds of crime in India and abroad, to repatriate the proceeds of crime to India, to obtain more evidence against the mastermind, etc”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-s-sister-brother-in-law-turn-approvers-in-pnb-case/story-YDagZN8jYRnRE4iS0EdZZO.html
06-01-2021||India||India’s self-reliance initiatives may lead to trade barriers with other nations, says outgoing US envoy||New Delhi’s self-reliance and “Make in India” initiatives have the potential to lead to higher tariffs and other trade barriers that could hit the country’s capacity to integrate into global value chains, outgoing US ambassador Kenneth Juster cautioned on Tuesday. Juster pointed to “frictions and frustrations” on trade and investment between India and the US, and said the two sides were unable to finalise even a “small trade package” despite persistent efforts. There are also growing restrictions on market access for some US goods and services, increasing tariffs, new limitations on free flow of data and a “less-than-predictable regulatory environment for investors”, he said. In a farewell address, he also spoke of the need for both countries to preserve their commitment to diversity and tolerance in order to maintain their status in the world and the strength of bilateral ties. On the strategic front, Juster said the time has come for India and the US to develop guidelines and “even redlines” for a stronger Indo-Pacific architecture to tackle future challenges. Without naming China, he said this framework should enable all countries to prosper from a region that respects sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes. Juster, a political appointee of the Trump administration who has overseen key aspects of India-US strategic relations over the years, is set to step down this month. His address, at an event organised by the Observer Research Foundation that was attended by senior diplomats and the media, largely focused on taking forward ties in key areas such as trade, defence and security, energy and healthcare. Noting that the US is India’s largest trading partner, and India the 12th largest partner of the US, he said bilateral trade was worth $146.1 billion in 2019, up from $18.6 billion in 2001. It is “frustrating” that bilateral trade isn’t near its potential and greater openness on the part of India would boost trade and investment, he added. “This is a lot of good news for the economic and commercial relationship. But I would be less than candid if I did not note that there are also frictions and frustrations on the trade and investment front. Despite persistent efforts, we were unable to conclude even a small trade package,” Juster said. “Moreover, there are growing restrictions in India on market access for certain US goods and services, increasing tariffs, new limitations on the free flow of data, and a less-than-predictable regulatory environment for investors,” he said. Juster added: “As with the US, India would naturally like to enhance its economic security by increasing domestic production and reducing critical dependencies... The current view in India is that the best way to meet these various objectives is through a policy of ‘Self-Reliance’, emphasising ‘Make in India’, while still seeking to be engaged globally, participate in global value chains, and be an exporter to the world. “It remains to be seen whether all of these policies are compatible and mutually reinforcing, or whether they will lead to higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. The latter would limit India’s capacity to truly integrate into global value chains and, in the process, raise prices for Indian consumers.” Juster said India has a “strategic opportunity to become an alternative destination for manufacturing investments” as American and other companies find it “increasingly difficult to operate in China or seek to diversify away from Chinese-led supply chains”, but the Indian government may need to take further action to benefit fully. Both the US and India have benefited from their diverse populations and India’s “embrace of diversity will always be what makes it exceptional”, he said. “It is a source of strength for this great country and an inspiration for all of us,” he added. “While neither of us is – nor has been – perfect, we understand that preserving our commitment to diversity and tolerance is important to maintaining our status in the world and the strength of our bilateral relationship,” Juster said. Without directly referring to China’s aggressive actions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) or in other parts of the Indo-Pacific, Juster said the US and India are committed to a rules-based order, peace and diplomacy, while there are others who “choose suicide vests or military incursions”. In response to a question, Juster said the US has been “very supportive” amid the India-China border standoff. “We both share a vision of the Indo-Pacific region...and that is an inclusive vision that provides opportunities for all countries to grow and prosper but also wants to avoid incursions of any type, intimidations and predatory financing, and when there’s a situation that is along those lines, we cooperate to try to resist it,” he said.The two sides have deepened cooperation on defence and security issues, including efforts to provide security beyond their borders, and convergence on the Indo-Pacific, which has the world’s fastest-growing economies and most populous nations, reflects this cooperation, he said. “The region needs stability, leadership and a democratic model for development that does not threaten the sovereignty of other countries. This is why a strong and democratic India is an important partner to promote peace and prosperity,” he said. “We are now building out the foundation of a stronger Indo-Pacific architecture that will enable us to tackle challenges that lie ahead. Our mission over the next five years and beyond should be to give this endeavour further form and substance – to develop guidelines and, if necessary, even redlines,” Juster said, adding this would enable all countries to prosper from a region that respects sovereignty, a rules-based order and peaceful resolution of disputes in line with international law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-self-reliance-initiatives-may-lead-to-trade-barriers-with-other-nations-says-outgoing-us-envoy/story-ZWzg1ZM8FZN4opVja12hrK.html

He is a legislator from Howrah.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee confirmed the development at a media conference.Shukla did not comment on the development. Shukla’s exit comes ahead of the state elections to be held in April this year. “Laxmi is a good boy. He wrote a letter saying he wants to pursue sports wholeheartedly and wants to be relieved of all responsibilities in the party,” Banerjee said.” He did not talk of resigning from the ministry. But we have accepted his resignation and written to the governor that he may be relieved as minster. Laxmi has said that he will continue to be a member of the legislative assembly till its current term comes to an end.”Shukla’s decision sparked speculation that may join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) like former minister Suvendu Adhikari.Last month, at a rally addressed by Union home minister Amit Shah in Midnapore, six TMC legislators joined the BJP, led by Adhikari, considered a political heavyweight. Banerjee dismissed the speculation. “It is good that he wants to pursue sports. He said he wants to give more time to sports. That’s why he wants to leave politics. There is nothing more to this. He has our best wishes. There is no place for misunderstanding here. You (the media) try to make something out of every information,” Samik Bhattacharya, chief spokesperson of the Bengal BJP, did not say whether Shukla would join the party. “It is difficult for any person with strong principles to stay in the TMC. We are not surprised,” he said. Shukla was a middle-order batsman and a medium-pacer in the Indian team in 1999. He played for the Bengal cricket team as well as the Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi in Indian Premier League (IPL) matches. He joined the TMC before the 2016 assembly polls. He declared his retirement from cricket in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-minister-laxmi-ratan-shukla-quits-tmc/story-4h9enAAwI5t9pFxIMtMW6L.html
06-01-2021||India||Farmers’ tractor rally deferred to Thursday||Tens of thousands of protesting farmers will take out a tractor march on January 7, deferring it by a day because of wintry and wet weather conditions, to converge on the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal Expressway, leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions, said on Tuesday. At a press conference, leaders of farm unions said they would be coordinating the month-long protests spelt out in a fresh agitation agenda spanning 15 days from January 7, which includes picketing Raj Bhavans, onward marches from six blockade sites on Delhi’s borders and a tractor march “rehearsal” for Republic Day. “The change in the schedule, deferred by a day, is only because of weather conditions. After January 9, farmers will campaign in every village to ready themselves to drive their tractors into Delhi on January 26,” Yogendra Yadav, a senior leader of the agitation, said. Joginder Singh Nain, who leads the Nain faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the contingent from Haryana would be led by women farmers.Farm unions have launched one of the largest strikes in decades to demand that the Centre revoke the three contentious laws approved by Parliament in September. The laws essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming. These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Together, the laws will allow big corporations and global supermarket chains to buy directly from farmers, bypassing decades-old regulations. Farmers say the reforms will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s procurement system, whereby the government buys staples, such as wheat and rice, at guaranteed prices. “Tractors from all neighbouring states will begin rolling into Delhi. We will continue with our blockade of goods and services of {Mukesh} Ambani (Reliance Industries Limited ) and {Gautam} Adani (Adani Enterprises Limited), including their products, malls and petrol pumps owned by them,” Darshan Pal, a senior farm union leader said. The leaders slammed what they called the government’s propaganda. “The government doesn’t want to withdraw the laws because it has become an ego issue for them. They have tried tarnish our agitation in countless ways, sometimes calling us Maoists and Khalistani {a reference to Sikh separatists},” Balbir Singh Rajewal of the Bharatiya Kisan Union said In a widely anticipated sixth round of talks between the Union government and protesting farm unions on December 30, the Modi administration agreed to spare farmers from heavy fines for crop-residue burning, as provided for in an anti-pollution ordinance, and continue the current mechanism of giving subsidised power for agricultural use, as demanded by farmers. The seventh round of talks on January 4, however, ended in a stalemate as the government did not accede to the farmers’ demand to repeal the three agricultural laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-tractor-rally-deferred-to-thursday/story-AKRR9QjuiAHJ8wpaDoZFxH.html
06-01-2021||India||HC seeks Centre, Punjab replies on Reliance petition against vandalism||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Punjab government and the Centre on a plea by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited seeking action against vandals damaging its network infrastructure and commercial properties in Punjab.The company’s counsel, Ashish Chopra, said the high court had sought responses from the Punjab administration and the Centre by February 8. Reliance Jio, in its petition, alleged that business rivals with vested interests were taking advantage of the ongoing farmers’ protests and damaging its infrastructure in Punjab. The petition said 1,500 telecom towers operated by Jio in Punjab had been vandalised, crippling the mobile network in Punjab, where the company has 14 million subscribers.Subscribers are compelled to port to other networks, the plea said, adding that the acts of vandalism had also endangered the lives of thousands of its employees. Jio’s parent company, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), and its retail arms or affiliates have “no interest and does not intend in future to do corporate or contract farming,” according to the petition. RIL and its retail arms have not purchased any agricultural land directly or indirectly for the purpose of farming, it said. Underscoring that Jio and RIL have the greatest regard for the hard work of farmers, the petition added that RIL and its affiliates have never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain “unfair advantage over” farmers or their produce. Reliance Jio filed the petition on Monday seeking a direction to the government authorities in the state and at the Centre to protect its communication infrastructure as well as ensure the safety of its employees. The plea claims it had been targeted in Punjab because those with “vested interests” were taking advantage of the farmers’ agitation against the recently enacted agricultural laws. Jio also sought the appointment of a competent authority to assess the damages to be recovered from the vandals in the context of a judgment by the Supreme Court that rioters must be made to pay for the destruction of properties. “The destruction has been done in a well orchestrated manner, which is result of a sustained disinformation campaign being carried out by vested interests,” said the plea, demanding that adequate security arrangements be made to stop the vandalism of its infrastructure. Telecom infrastructure owned by the company has been targeted in parts of Punjab by protesters who have alleged that the new farm laws were meant to benefit certain corporate houses at the cost of farmers. The laws change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets as opposed to a network of government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales, and laying down a national framework for contract farming. In response to submissions, state’s advocate general, Atul Nanda said that the company itself has admitted that the action has been taken to protect its assets. “The government has deployed 1019 patrolling parties in 22 districts and has appointed 22 nodal officers to ensure that no further damage is caused. The state is carrying out the duty enjoined upon it by the various statutes. ..the impact of the agitation on 1300 affected towers has been removed and they are now functioning,” Nanda told the court adding that the task of the state agencies would become easier, if the petitioner was to share information regarding the alleged vested interest involved. These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Farmers say the laws will make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the procurement system, whereby the government buys staples such as wheat and rice at guaranteed prices||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-centre-punjab-replies-on-reliance-petition-against-vandalism/story-kXdwmZhHuuQnx1qVJRHFwM.html

06-01-2021||India||Transportation to jabs: Centre outlines Covid vaccination plan||The Centre on Tuesday spelled out the mechanics being put in place across the country that will enable the roll-out within the next week of the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive, which will utilise a repurposed form of the existing vaccine delivery platform at national, state, district, and local levels.Even as talks are in the final stages with companies for signing vaccine purchase deals, the Centre’s preparations for the drive vaccine deployment and delivery management is in its advanced stages to vaccinate more than 300 million people in the first phase, said Union secretary of health and family welfare ministry, Rajesh Bhushan, during the weekly media briefing on Covid-19 updates on Tuesday.“We are confident that we are ready to roll-out the vaccination programme within 10 days of having granted emergency use authorisation to two vaccines,” Bhushan added. On Sunday, Drugs Controller General of India announced the emergency use approval for two vaccines – the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine being manufactured in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Bharat Biotech International Limited’s locally developed vaccine candidate, Covaxin. HT reported on Monday that the government was preparing to start the vaccination drive by next week.Covid update: UK PM’s India visit; England lockdown; Centre explains CoWin appExplaining the logistics, Bhushan said that the Centre is utilising its new digital vaccine delivery management system – Co-WIN – that has been enhanced from its existing platform under the annual Universal Immunisation Programme.Also Read: 60,000 cops registered so far to get Covid-19 vaccine shotsThe “Co-WIN vaccine delivery management system” kicks off with the transport of the doses from the manufacturing plant. In the first part, the vaccines are moved from the factory to the local health care facility. The second part covers the identification, registration of citizens, and the administration of doses, while the final part concerns with the follow-up of patients and lodging of adverse effects, if any.“In the first step, manufactures will transport the vaccines by air to primary vaccine stores run by the Union health ministry, which are called Government Medical Stores Depot (GMSD),” Bhushan said. Currently, there are four such depots in the country – one each in Karnal, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. From these depots, supplies will sent in refrigerated or insulated vans to 37 state vaccine stores spread across various states.“From there on, it is the responsibility either of the state governments or Union Territory administration to deploy the stock further as per their requirement. From the state stores, the supplies will be sent to the district vaccine stores, which is also a temperature-controlled facility,” he said.Also Read:13 people in Delhi have mutant variant of Covid-19, eight are city residentsThis entire process, storage as well as transport, will be digitally monitored in real-time. The second part of the drive will deal with the identification and registration of vaccine candidates as well as the administration of the shot. Health care and frontline workers will not be required to register themselves as their information, gathered from their respective organisations, departments, has already fed into the system and has been populated onto Co-WIN, he said.At-risk population priority groups – people above 50 years of age, and those under 50 years with comorbidities – will be required to register on the app.While people above the age of 50 years will be identified based on electoral rolls, the data for those who are below the age of 50 with comorbidities will be compiled on the basis of an inclusion system which will grade diseases that may be more fatal with Covid. This system is being devised by an expert panel, which is expected to release the exact selection method in “one or two days”, Bhushan said.In the third, and final part of the process officials will be able to follow through with the beneficiaries after the immunisation. The entire process will be digitally documented and captured in the app. “The platform also enables documentation of any adverse event following immunisation in real-time...” Bhushan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transportation-to-jabs-centre-outlines-covid-vaccination-plan/story-ia3KVh6KjtuX03HCeSEWSI.html
06-01-2021||India||SII, Bharat Biotech make joint pledge||New Delhi: A day after a war of words appeared to break out between vaccine-makers Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech, both of which have received emergency approvals to roll out jabs against the coronavirus, the two Indian companies on Tuesday appeared to bury the hatchet as they jointly pledged for a smooth roll-out of vaccines in the country and the world.On Monday, Bharat Biotech chairman and managing director Krishna Ella hit out at comments suggesting that the firm’s coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin, was “safe like water”, and said its Phase 3 efficacy data, likely to be out by February or March, will silence critics. Though he did not take any names, Ella’s remarks came a day after SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said that only three vaccines had passed all scientific evaluations and others were “safe like water”.In an unexpected joint statement on Wednesday, the two firms said: “Both companies respect the great work being carried out by each other and put behind us the miscommunication and misunderstanding caused during the past week. We are fully aware of the importance of vaccines for people and countries alike, we hereby communicate our joint pledge to provide global access for our Covid-19 vaccines.”Bharat Biotech has been in the eye of a storm after Covaxin was granted “restricted use in emergency situation” approval, leading to several experts questioning the decision because of the shorter duration of human trials and relatively lower data published for the candidate, which is still in the process of its Phase 3 checks. The Oxford vaccine, called Covishield, got the Drug Control General of India (DCGI) nod based on the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data generated on 23,745 participants from overseas studies, as well as interim data from Phase 2/3 trials on 1,600 people in India.Hitting out at criticism at a press conference on Monday, Ella said it was “easy to target Indian scientists”. “I had to tell this because some other company has branded my product as ‘safe like water’. Some local company in press yesterday said that safety is like water of other companies. Only three companies have done efficacy, and other vaccine is like water. I want to deny that.” He also appeared to question the results of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that is being manufactured by SII.A day later, however, the joint statement appeared to de-escalate the slugfest between executives of the two vaccine-makers clashed over the approval of their jabs. “Adar Poonawala and Krishna Ella, jointly on behalf of the two companies, today communicated their combined intent to develop manufacture and supply the Covid-19 vaccines for India and globally. They said the more important task in front of them is saving the lives and livelihoods of populations in India and the world,” the statement said.“Now that two Covid-19 vaccines have been issued EUA (emergency use authorization) in India, the focus is on manufacturing, supply and distribution, such that populations that need it the most receive high quality, safe and efficacious vaccines. Both our Companies are fully engaged in this activity and consider it our duty to the nation and the world at large to ensure a smooth rollout of vaccines. Each of our Companies continue their Covid-19 vaccines development activities as planned,” it added.The statement was posted on the Twitter accounts of the two companies and also shared by Poonawalla, who said: “This should clarify any miscommunication. We are all united in the fight against this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-bharat-biotech-make-joint-pledge/story-glBKCKMs2b6jnXqKuwB7JM.html
06-01-2021||India||Body of woman found in farm in Jharkhand’s Simdega week before marriage||The body of a 20-year-old woman was found from a farmland in Jharkhand’s Simedga district on Tuesday morning, police said.Police recovered the body from Jhirkamunda village under Kurdeg police station in Simdega district, around 300 meters away from girl’s home. Prima facie it seemed she was stabbed to death as several injury marks were found in the body, police said. The woman’s marriage had been fixed with a businessman from Gumla named Danish Ansari on January 12. Her family members lodged FIR against Ansari, as he had reportedly called her for shopping on Sunday after which she did not return home.Superintendent of police (SP) Simdega, Shams Tabrez said, “We have recovered the body and sent it for postmortem. Prima facie it appears that the woman was stabbed to death with sharp weapon. On complaint of victim’s father, we have lodged an FIR against the Danish Ansari with charge of murder.” Tabrez said, “Ansari, resident of Ambua village in Gumla district, had called the woman for wedding shopping at Kurdeg market on Sunday. She went there with two of her friends. When they reached market, she sent her two friends home. But she herself never returned.”He said the family members of the woman did not initially inform the police. “They searched on their own on Sunday and Monday. When they asked Ansari, the accused himself took the family to the place where her body was lying. Then the police was informed,” the SP said. However, Ansari escaped from the place after gauging villagers’ anger. “We have launched a search operation in coordination with Gumla police. The accused will be nabbed soon,” the SP said. On Sunday, a headless body of a girl was found in Ranchi’s Ormanjhi block.The Ranchi police on Tuesday announced an reward of Rs 50,000 to any person who will give information about the girl. “The identity of the girl is yet to be established. We are making all efforts to find her identity in a bid to move ahead in the case,” said superintendent of police, Ranchi (rural), Naushad Alam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/body-of-woman-found-in-farm-in-jharkhand-s-simdega-week-before-marriage/story-6IMGAEuLEixVLdHTd6XtiP.html
06-01-2021||India||Pollution control measures key in big development projects: Experts||Smog towers and smog guns are likely to be integral features of air pollution mitigation efforts for all major development projects in future, especially in cities with high air pollution. The Supreme Court (SC), in its judgment on the Central Vista redevelopment project, directed on Tuesday that “the project proponent may set up smog tower(s) of adequate capacity, as being integral part of the new Parliament building project; and additionally, use smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase is in progress on the site”. The court also directed the Union environment ministry to consider issuing general directions on installation of smog towers for all upcoming major development projects while granting approval in cities with high pollution levels. “Unless there is a solid plan in controlling traffic emissions, short-term strategies for future projects will not help. Also, scientifically, there is no evidence that smog guns and smog towers work. In all, for future development projects, a holistic air pollution control strategy is needed…,” said Sagnik Dey, professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Delhi. Smog towers are structures designed to work as large-scale air purifiers while smog guns are like giant vacuum cleaners of the ambient air. They are usually fitted with multiple layers of air filters, which clean the air in the area as it passes through them. The smog tower sucks the polluted air, which is purified by the multiple layers before recirculating into the atmosphere. Many scientists think smog towers are ineffective because its nearly impossible to filter polluted air outdoors. Emissions are being generated continuously and from many sources. A senior official of the environment ministry, who did not want to be named, said: “We will integrate the directions of SC in all future projects.” One of the main contentions of a section of environmental and legal experts in the case of Central Vista has been that its cumulative long-term ecological impacts haven’t been studied and components have been isolated for ease of getting clearances. For example, the Parliament Building was appraised by the environment appraisal committee as a separate project while other components of the Central Vista are being appraised now. On Tuesday, a three-judge bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar, by a 2:1 majority, held that the grant of the environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for the project was valid. Justice Sanjiv Khanna dissented with the majority view. Experts stressed that the environment ministry should also consider the cumulative impacts of large buildings and redevelopment projects. “The question of whether the Central Vista redevelopment project is an integrated one or not for the purposes of the environment clearance was discussed extensively in court. Clearly, the bench could not come to an agreement on whether the environmental clearance to the Parliament is legal or not. As Justice Khanna’s dissenting view shows, he is not persuaded by the government’s claim that the Parliament should be viewed as a stand-alone project when it is in fact only one component of the tender for Central Vista redevelopment. This certainly still leaves a question mark about the integrated nature of this project. But what is just as important is that this issue of the integrated nature of large building and construction projects has now gained a lot of legal importance with this dissenting judgment on this matter,” said Manju Menon, senior fellow, the Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-control-measures-key-experts/story-KwKxWC1AWJ9t6ntjfBVSYK.html
06-01-2021||India||Critics insist Central Vista project has several issues, to take a call on review plea||Reacting to the Supreme Court’s approval to the Central Vista redevelopment project by a 2:1 majority verdict on Tuesday, urban planning experts and activists said there were many problems with the Centre’s plan.While the court held that the government and its agencies fulfilled all legal requirements in altering the land use of the seven plots in the area and in obtaining the environmental clearances for constructing the new Parliament building, critics maintained the project was ill-conceived even as they flagged green concerns.Explained: SC win for Modi govt; new Parliament & Central Vista plan clearedAlso Read: Dissenting judge laments lack of public consultationPetitioners who challenged the project said the decision on whether to file a review petition will be taken after going through the 611-page judgment. “We are not against the government constructing a new Parliament building. But public land meant for recreational use can’t be used for it. There are a lot of infirmities in the clearance granted to the project,” said Rajeev Suri, one of the petitioners.Also Read: Pollution control measures key in big development projects: ExpertsExperts said the Central Public Works Department cannot start the work at the new site till it obtains clearance from the Heritage Conservation Committee, Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs, which is responsible for protection of heritage buildings in Delhi. “The judgment is significant for multiple reasons. Even though it upholds the government’s view that there was no infirmity in the processes related to land-use change,  approvals related to the new Parliament’s environment clearance and other approvals, it clearly indicates that no construction can take place even on the new Parliament site before the approval of the Heritage Conservation Committee,” Kanchi Kohli, a researcher with the Centre for Policy Research, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/critics-insist-project-has-several-issues-to-take-a-call-on-review-plea/story-EmQgUW3s30y7tIRyZpSC4N.html
06-01-2021||India||Dissenting judge laments lack of public consultation||Justice Sanjiv Khanna delivered a dissenting judgment on Tuesday regarding approval of the Central Vista redevelopment plan, raising questions over whether the government fulfilled its duty to consult citizens and accord them the right to participate in a project of national importance.Even as he agreed with the majority view of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari on the issues of inviting the bid for consultant for the project, and award of tender, he differed on more fundamental aspects of change in land use, inadequate consultation and public participation.Also Read: Central Vista plan gets SC nod in 2-1 majority verdictThe arguments by the Centre did not convince Justice Khanna with respect to the authorities’ compliance with the laws in letter and spirit for a project, which he said, involved the right to participate and the duty to consult. Explained: SC win for Modi govt; new Parliament & Central Vista plan cleared“I have agreed on the aspect of notice inviting bid, award and order of Urban Commission with the opinion of respected Brother Justice Khanwilkar. However on the aspect of change of land use, I have held that the same was initiated as being bad in law,” he said.While the majority held that it was not incumbent upon the government to give each and every detail of the project while issuing the public notice of the proposed modification in the master plan, Justice Khanna said that it was necessary for the authorities to put the redevelopment plan and layouts in public domain with explanatory memorandum relating to their need and necessity, as well as studies and reports. Also Read: Pollution control measures key in big development projects: ExpertsThe judge highlighted that the Delhi Development Rules, 1959, required authorities to furnish summary of the proposals to enable the public to raise informed objections. “To ignore their salutary mandate as to the manner and nature of consultation in the participatory exercise, would defeat the benefic objective of exercise of deliberation. Public participation to be fruitful and constructive is not to be a mechanical exercise or formality, it must comply with the least and basic requirements,” he said. Justice Khanna maintained that mere uploading of the gazette notification giving the present and the proposed land use with plot numbers was not sufficient compliance. “In the present case, there is no contestation between transparency and the right to know on the one hand, and the concerns of privacy, confidentiality and national security on the other. Further, the Development Act and Development Rules demand and require openness and transparency, and embody without exception the right to know which is implicit in the right to participate and duty to consult,” he held. He also noted that the sanctioning and approving authorities in the central government never examined whether the change in land use was sufficient for the redevelopment project or a conservation plan had to be put in place since the Central Vista area included heritage structures. He also did not accept the majority view that the change in the land use was “minor” and emphasised that what is envisaged is complete redevelopment of the entire Central Vista, with site development infrastructure, landscape design, engineering design and services, mobility plan etc. He faulted the government for issuing the March 20, 2020 notification on change in land use of the seven plots without obtaining prior permission from the Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC) because the Central Vista is declared as a heritage zone under the Unified Building Bye-laws as also under the master plan of Delhi. Justice Khanna opted to quash the March 20 notification, preferring a review by the HCC regarding the change in land use and restrictions to apply. He opted to set aside the environmental clearance for the new Parliament building, saying the recommendation by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) on April 22, 2020 did not give reasons on whether clearance could be granted for the Parliament building alone without taking into account the entire redevelopment project. The majority judgment has held that there was no fault in giving a clearance to the new Parliament building after the government chose to segregate the two projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissenting-judge-laments-lack-of-public-consultation/story-Bou4qv2N88Ldcl5MeXywPK.html
06-01-2021||India||‘In line with public trust standards’: How SC judges arrived at Central Vista decision||Arriving at a decision granting approval to the Central Vista redevelopment plan was not straight forward. The majority decision of the Supreme Court, authored by two on a three-judge bench, laboured to arrive at a conclusion by examining underlying constitutional principles, environmental safeguards, and the standard of judicial review to be maintained in examining an iconic project of this nature.Some of the important aspects that make the 611-page judgment interesting are: Rule of law and democratic due processThe petitioners implored the apex court to apply the “rule of law” instead of “rule by law”, which they argued, the government followed to bypass the “democratic due process” in order to obtain various approvals and clearances for the project worth over Rs 15,000 crore (this does not include the PM’s residence, and some other elements of the project). The majority verdict by justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari maintained that the rule of law provides a constant trigger to any state-citizen exchange and calls upon the court to strike a balance between two entities both bound by the same principle of superiority of law. But it added that the import of an expression like “democratic due process” in an administrative matter is fraught with serious consequences, for it will mean a decision on the subjective notion of the court, and not in accordance with the “procedure established by law”. An expansive approach towards democratic due process, where issues of constitutional rights are not involved, will be tantamount to substituting the government’s decision with the wisdom of the court regarding a better course of action or a policy. “Even if a Court finds it debatable, that can be no ground for the Court to quash an action taken strictly in accord with the prescribed procedure,” said the majority view, adding application of democratic due process will lead to withdrawing the task of governance from the democratically elected representatives and the executive by creating an illusory bar on the exercise of their power to function freely despite being within the four corners of the law. Plea for a heightened judicial review Keeping a safe distance from executive policymaking functions, the judges held that it is not the court’s concern to enquire into the priorities of an elected government. “We cannot be called upon to govern. For we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise in that regard. Judicial review is never meant to venture into the mind of the Government and thereby examine validity of a decision.” The judges noted with concern the misuse of PIL (public interest litigation) jurisdiction by a section of people in society who seek substitution of the government’s view with their view by filing a PIL. “Judicial time is not meant for undertaking a roving enquiry or to adjudicate upon unsubstantiated flaws or shortcoming in policy matters of Government of the day and politicize the same to appease the dissenting group of citizens — be it in the guise of civil society or a political outfit.” Referring to the present set of petitions challenging the project, justice Khanwilkar said, “We need to say so because we had to spend considerable time and energy on this matter despite the pandemic situation, which at the end, we find to be devoid of substance.” The petitioners argued that the courts must adopt a “heightened” judicial review. Discarding this argument, the bench said, “There is absolutely no legal basis to ‘heighten’ the judicial review by applying yardstick beyond the statutory scheme and particularly when the Government has accorded no special status to the project and has gone through the ordinary route of such development projects as per law.” Public participationThe majority verdict addressed the petitioners’ complaints as regards the absence of sufficient public participation in the entire process. The court discussed the principles of natural justice while underlining that the subject matter of a development project, with no direct bearing on lives and livelihoods, cannot be equated with a project which has a direct impact. It noted that whether in a given case, personal oral hearing is to be provisioned for, or mere representations be invited, or public discussion is called for, is a matter for the legislature to make a law in that regard and that a court can’t prescribe a legislation in this regard. “The citizens are completely free to advocate any notion along the government policy or the manner of making it in their free exercise of right to speech and expression, but enforcement of such notion cannot be fructified by resorting to judicial review...No country with a sizeable population like ours can give a promise of direct participation to every individual in the decision-making process (of the government) in administrative matters unless the law so prescribes,” it held. Thus, the scope of public involvement in government processes, it said, is a matter dependent on legal framework of a country and the court should be loath to venture into that area. Environmental concerns While accepting the environmental clearance granted for the development of the new building, the majority decision felt it proper to direct the Central Public Works Department to set up smog towers of adequate capacity at the project site and install smog guns throughout the construction phase to mitigate pollution. “Time has come to advance the intent behind improving air quality a mandatory feature for modern buildings and more particularly during the phase of construction of such major projects in the cities most affected by air pollution.” The court called upon the Ministry of Environment and Forests to issue directions. In addition, the court asked the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to issue general directions to ensure smog guns and smog towers are made mandatory while constructing government buildings, townships or other major private projects. This shall be made an integral part in all future major development projects for grant of development permissions, particularly in cities with bad track record of air quality, the judges held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-line-with-public-trust-standards/story-Q2vTVrsLvpDKGSI3CGRBRN.html
06-01-2021||India||Farmers’ protest Highlights| Farmers to take out tractor march on Jan 7 at 4 Delhi borders||The ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three contentious agricultural laws passed by the Centre in September entered day 41 on Tuesday and will continue for the time being as the seventh round of talks between the government and the farm union leaders failed to resolve the deadlock between the two sides. Monday’s talks saw both sides stick to their stand, with the government once again reiterating the laws won’t be repealed and insisting on a clause-by-clause discussion, while the farm unions stressed they want nothing short of a rollback. The unions also demanded a legal guarantee on the Minimum Support Price (MSP). The eighth round of talks will take place at 2 pm on January 8.Monday’s developments came despite there being hopes in some quarters of a resolution as, in the seventh round of talks on January 4, the two sides had arrived at a consensus on two out of four demands raised by the farmers. In the seventh round of talks, the central ministers representing the government and the farm unions leaders had also, for the very first time, taken meal together. Also on Monday, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Limited (RIL), whose Jio Infocomm mobile towers have been allegedly targeted by a section of farmers in Punjab, moved Punjab and Haryana high court, seeking “immediate government intervention” to stop the vandalism of its properties.It also accused “vested interests” and “business rivals” of instigating the farmers and further clarified it had never done “contract” or “corporate” farming and has no plans to enter the business.Follow major highlights from day 41 of the anti-farm law protests here:All will resolve soon, say BJP leaders from Punjab after meeting PM ModiPrime Minister Narendra Modi is in the know of all developments related to the farmers’ protest against the new agri laws and the issue will get resolved soon, BJP leaders from Punjab asserted on Tuesday after meeting the PM, reported PTI.Farmers to celebrate ‘Azad Kisan Diwas’ on Netaji’s birth anniversaryKrantikari Kisan Union President Darshan Pal said that ‘Azad Hind Kisan Diwas’ will be celebrated on January 23, on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary.

06-01-2021||Editorials||Chronicling the role of institutions | HT Editorial||In his final memoir, The Presidential Years; 2012-2017, published posthumously this week, the late former president Pranab Mukherjee has candidly written of the decline of his former party, the Congress, and its political mismanagement in the final years in power. He has enumerated the strengths and weaknesses of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And he has given a glimpse of his own decision-making process — of advising the government privately, while being publicly supportive of it. And he has offered views on demonetisation — which he believed did not meet its objectives — and the Goods and Services Tax — which he saw as transformative.The book’s value lies in the behind-the-scenes accounts the late President offers into conversations at the highest levels of the Indian State — as well as the engagement of India’s leadership with foreign interlocutors. But its greater value — beyond the insights on parties and individuals — lies in its assessment of the institutions.Mr Mukherjee, a long-term parliamentarian, noted the trend of parliamentary disruptions and wrote how “appalled” he was with the “callousness” with which disruptions were used. This, he argued, ends up hurting the Opposition more because it loses its moral authority to question the government. The late president’s concerns on the subject must be internalised by all political actors at a time when the functioning of Parliament, for various reasons, has come under criticism. At the same time, Mr Mukherjee also warned against judicial excesses and the need to reform the appointment process of judges — once again, a key concern at a time when the role of the judiciary has come under criticism. Restoring institutional functioning is essential for democracy — that remains the key takeaway from the presidential memoir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/chronicling-the-role-of-institutions-ht-editorial/story-3PQwFiziUkTLtdqhEZKNQM.html
06-01-2021||Editorials||Ghaziabad roof collapse: The challenge of maintaining public infra||Last week, a roof collapse at a cremation ground at Muradnagar in Ghaziabad killed 24 people and injured at least 17 others. On Tuesday, Ghaziabad Police arrested the contractor who built the crematorium; four government officials, too, have been arrested. An initial report indicated that “substandard material” was used to build the crematorium, and there were other “design issues”, which might have led to the structural failure.While the swift action taken by the administration and the police is praiseworthy, the roof collapse is symptomatic of a larger problem that is rampant across India — the failure of the State to not just ensure good quality public infrastructure (all built with public money), but also force contractors to keep to timelines and maintain infrastructure projects during their lifecycle. This lack of admin-istrative capability and criminal negligence is responsible for open borewells, weak flood embankments, wobbly bridges, and potholes in the roads, all of which have humanitarian conseque-nces. Slow police action, judicial delays when it comes to taking action against the culprits, and absence of political will to ensure quality projects add to the challenge. Research from around the world (compiled by TheConversation, an academic website) throws up several reasons why governments slip up in implementing public projects. Announcement is often equated with accomplishment and officials lose interest when details are worked out; when things go wrong, those who speak up about the problems are dismissed, discounted or punished; many implementers suffer from optimism bias (what could go wrong?), and there is steady turnover of officials. These are valid explanations and structural reform is essential. For now, it is important that there is justice for all those who lost their lives in a needless tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/ghaziabad-roof-collapse-the-challenge-of-maintaining-public-infrastructure/story-wAI1pokHj5JCYAFT2WpJOO.html
06-01-2021||Editorials||India at the horse shoe table||Whenever India takes a seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), there is excitement about the possibility of it translating into permanent membership. When holding one of the rotating seats, it is a sensible ambition to make the case, through diplomatic accomplishments, for being a permanent member. But expanding SC is a tortuous process. At present, the window of opportunity for SC reform is closed. Not one of the Permanent Five (P5) members is interested in its expansion. After a year of battling with nature, much of the world sees multilateral responses to climate and health as the heart of UN reform and SC expansion as a quixotic quest.India’s agenda sensibly focuses on what is optically useful and realistically possible. New Delhi has a traditional multilateral agenda, which revolves around counterterrorism, peacekeeping, trade, and, negatively, opposition to an intrusive human rights regime. Much of this remains relevant, but the coming years should allow India to take up new issues. Climate, public health, maritime security and digital standards stand out among the century’s new challenges. Much of this is on the fringes of the UN, but there will be considerable spillover. Global climate cooperation still uses the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as its foundational understanding. India has made nascent multilateral contributions in this space, such as the International Solar Alliance, but needs to become more involved in rules-setting. New Delhi has called for reform of the World Health Organization, but is yet to provide details. Maritime security is increasingly intertwined with the need to uphold the UN Law of the Sea against the revanchist tendencies of China. Global trade will increasingly be about data, a domain where India’s capabilities and policies will win points with other developing countries.Whatever the opposition put up by China, if India shows it has the diplomatic skills to get other countries to work together, the case for it being a permanent member will become irrefutable. Multilateralism is the most difficult form of diplomacy, and SC membership, even if non-permanent, is among the best platforms to display India’s abilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-at-the-horse-shoe-table/story-KZexjyZVCTyCJKnoDIuqCN.html
