Now in his late 50s, he had been out on parole from the Ambala Central Jail since April last year, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday, he had fired three shots at Amarjeet at her friend’s house in Baldev Nagar, hitting her in the head and foot, and later killed himself too.Families had business tiesAmarjeet’s elder son Gagandeep Singh told the police in his complaint that Isham had liquor business ties with his family for the past 10 years. But, he was unsure what led to the confrontation between his mother and Isham, and later firing. Police are also probing the role of Amarjeet’s friend at whose house she was shot dead. “The friend says she was in her dining room, while Amarjeet and Isham were in a bedroom for a meeting. She had prepared tea for them, while Amarjeet asked her to wait outside. Isham had a .32-bore revolver in his hand with his finger on the trigger when she rushed in after hearing gunshots,” said Hamir Singh, in-charge, Baldev Nagar police station.“A tenant lives on the first floor of the house. She claims she didn’t hear anything except the firing because of the volume of her television. We’re investigating the case from every angle, as the only accused has died,” said Singh, adding that autopsies were conducted at the Ambala civil hospital on Monday. Victim contested MC polls unsuccessfullyAmarjeet had contested the recent Ambala civic polls from ward number 6 and got 1,433 votes, but lost to BJP’s Archana Chhibber by a margin of 834 votes. She had earlier served as district president of Congress’s woman wing and switched to Venod Sharma’s HJCP on December 14 last year, when Shakti Rani Sharma was declared the party’s mayoral candidate. Sources said Isham didn’t want Amarjeet to contest the elections and had also threatened her on this.The victim leaves behind her husband, Paramjeet Singh, and two sons, Gagandeep Singh and Jasbir Singh, who are married and run a business of threads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-politician-s-murder-in-ambala-serving-life-term-for-murder-shooter-was-out-on-parole-101610389656953.html

Earlier, we would sell eggs by the tray, but now we have stopped ordering them,” said Ashok Kumar, proprietor of Chandigarh Provision Store, Sector 9, Panchkula.Those who are still selling eggs, claim their sales have dived drastically. Proprietor of Jai Maa Devi store at Mansa Devi Complex, Sector 5, Sunil Kumar said customers were preferring the much costlier branded eggs. “The price of a tray of 30 eggs has decreased from ₹200 to ₹160, yet people are interested in buying branded eggs, which can cost as high as ₹390 for six eggs.”Taking note of this, president of Panchkula Beopar Mandal, Bobbee Singh said, “Shopkeepers choosing not to stock eggs can cause problems. Awareness is needed. The Beopar Mandal will reach out to the shopkeepers and assure them that it’s safe to sell eggs.”In a health advisory, the Haryana animal husbandry department had said that poultry products can be cooked and consumed as usual with no fear of acquiring avian influenza virus, as it was sensitive to heat.Chandigarh stores report lower sales tooMeanwhile, retailers in Chandigarh are also complaining that demand for eggs has plummeted. Nitish Singla, a grocer from Sector 48, said, “A tray of 30 eggs would cost around ₹200 a week back. Now, people are unwilling to purchase it even at ₹150 per tray. Only 30% of our customer base is still interested in buying eggs now.”Anirudh Thakur, a grocer from Sector 23, also confirmed that egg sales at his store had dropped by around 40% in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-as-sales-dive-shops-in-panchkula-stop-stocking-eggs-101610389596919.html

It was last Tuesday that the carcass of a migratory bird was found floating in Sukhna Lake, and since then 19 more dead birds were recovered from different areas in the city till Sunday. However, all these were isolated cases. On Monday, for the first time, a number of dead birds were found in the same area, which is close to Chandigarh-Panchkula border.Bird flu has already been confirmed in the Barwala poultry belt of Panchkula district, where culling operations are underway. “The birds were found close to each other and 13 of them were crows. Even before this, we have found dead crows in the city, which makes the matter serious. We have sent the samples for testing to Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar,” said Debendra Dalai, chief conservator of forests. Of 34 dead birds found till now, 16 were crows. The test results of the bird found at Sukhna and a pigeon recovered on Wednesday had come negative on Friday night. Results of five other samples are still awaited, because of which no further sample had been sent for testing till Sunday. “We are creating awareness on symptoms of bird flu and have asked people to keep vigil,” said Dalai, adding that measures are being taken to ensure domestic species of birds don’t interact with wild species.As of Monday, 10 Indian states have reported the outbreak: Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Delhi. No case among the human population has been reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-flu-scare-14-dead-birds-found-near-railway-station-in-chandigarh-101610389538326.html
11-01-2021||Other||Bird flu in Barwala:Just ₹90 per culled bird will drive us to bankruptcy, says poultry farmers||Detection of avian influenza in two poultry farms of the Barwala belt has left poultry farm owners on tenterhooks about their fate.Around 1.66 lakh chickens in five farms falling in the affected area are being culled after the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, confirmed presence of the virus in different areas of the belt.While the government will be paying the affected poultry farms ₹90 for every bird culled, farmers say, this is pittance compared to the ₹500-crore loans, which were set to cripple the industry.“Farm owners in Barwala belt owe over ₹500 crore in loans. How will they repay it, if birds are culled? Besides, over hundreds of workers at the affected poultry farms will be left unemployed,” said Darshan Kumar, president of the Haryana Poultry Farmers Association.Farmers approach admnOn Monday, the association gave a representation to the Panchkula deputy commissioner, seeking that the compensation for each bird be increased to ₹450.“Each bird costs the farm owners up to ₹500, but the government will be paying only ₹90, which was the rate back in 2013. Now, cost of raising each bird has increased manifold,” the association members said.They also requested the administration to spare the farms situated near affected farms. “If authorities go about culling birds falling in the 1-km radius of affected farms, nearly 80 farms will go extinct,” said Rajesh Singla, owner of a poultry farm.This mass culling is unprecedented, said Singla, who has been in the trade for the past 30 years. “This is the first time bird flu has been detected in Barwala belt, which called for culling of birds at this extent,” he added.But, widespread culling will push farmers into bankruptcy, he said, adding that killing healthy birds just because they were in the 1km radius was unreasonable.‘Banks will come after loan defaulters’Sudhir Aggarwal, who has been in the business for 35 years, said, “Every farm owner has taken loan of ₹300 to ₹500 on each chicken, translating into a load of nearly ₹3 crore for 1 lakh birds. How will they tide over the losses if the government pays only ₹90 per bird?”“In the next few months, private banks will start seizing farms of defaulting poultry owners. Where will they go then?” he questioned.Nearly 30% farms had shut down over the past three years, especially during the ongoing pandemic, said Sishpal, owner of one of the farms, where culling is undergoing. With his farm set to lose around 1 lakh birds that cost him around ₹450 each, he said his business’ fate now hanged in balance.BOX: Over 20,000 birds culled in 3days, more samples takenPanchkula The local administration collected more samples from poultry farms in the Barwala belt on Monday, even as culling of over 20,000 birds finished at two farms.After bird flu was confirmed in samples taken from Siddharth Poultry Farm, Kheri, and Nature Poultry Farm, Dandlawar-Ganauli, the Haryana government on January 8 turned the area within a kilometre of the two epicentres as infected zone (covering three more farms in Kheri) and 1-10km as surveillance zone, besides announcing culling of 1.66 lakh birds in these farms.With around 40 rapid action teams culling birds, deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said the situation was under control.“Culling has been completed at Siddharth and Nature poultry farms. On Tuesday, four teams will complete sanitisation at these farms. Meanwhile, culling of birds has started at Narender poultry farm,” he said, adding that more samples were collected on Monday from 12 poultry farms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-in-barwala-just-90-per-culled-bird-will-drive-us-to-bankruptcy-says-poultry-farmers-101610389357691.html

The other two officers involved in the case are then UT home secretary Krishan Mohan and then director, tourism, Vivek Atray. Court had already grated them bail after summons were issued to them under cheating, criminal conspiracy and corruption charges. In 2009, Vivek Aditya, a Right to Information activist, had complained to the Central Vigilance Commission about alleged financial irregularities in the project coming up at Sarangpur village. Later, the case was shifted to the CBI. It was alleged that the former top officials awarded 73.65 acres of land to Unitech Limited ignoring financial rules. The project has since been scrapped.In the third closure report submitted on November 14, 2018, the CBI had stated that no evidence was found against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-stays-proceedings-in-decade-old-chandigarh-theme-park-case-101610389297758.html

The elections are scheduled next month.The decision was taken at a meeting held on Monday under the leadership of Kulwant Singh, where around 25 former SAD councillors were also present.Just two days back, SAD had officially declared a list of 28 candidates (all of whom were former councillors), but on Monday, 22 of them sided with Kulwant.In the 2015 elections, Kulwant had led the Azad group (of Independents) and won 10 seats. With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. Later, in 2017, he joined SAD.“We want development of the city. All former councillors have decided to rise above party lines while contesting the MC elections. We are hopeful of winning all 50 seats,” said Kulwant.Parvinder Singh Sohana, president, Youth Akali Dal, Mohali, said: “We will contest elections only under the leadership of Kulwant Singh.”Last month, SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had appointed a five-member committee for the MC elections in Mohali. It included former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra and Kulwant. “The party’s core committee has decided to contest on party symbol. The decision was taken in the presence of Kulwant Singh. He should have objected in the meeting itself,” said Chandumajra.Four-cornered contestWith the latest development, a four-cornered fight awaits the MC polls. In the fray are SAD, Congress, Aam Aadmi Party and Kulwant’s group. The splinter Akali group floated by Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa has opted out of the elections and will support AAP candidates and Independents. Meanwhile, Punjab cabinet minister and Congress leader Balbir Singh Sidhu said: “In 2015, we supported him (Kulwant) to become the mayor, but after 18 months ,he back-stabbed us and joined SAD. People of Mohali are aware of his truth and will give his group a befitting reply.”The five-year term of the House ended on April 26 last year. Among the 50 wards, 25 have been reserved for women besides five for scheduled castes (including two for women) and two for backward classes (men).Flip-flops so farA real estate developer, Kulwant Singh was the SAD candidate from Fatehgarh Sahib in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.He along with other members of Azad group left the party over denial of candidature ahead of the first Mohali MC elections in 2015.He went on to become Mohali’s first mayor in August 2015 as per an agreement with Congress.As many as 27 councillors, including 10 from Azad group, 14 from Congress and two Independents, voted for him.Rishabh Jain of Congress had secured senior deputy mayor’s post and Independent councillor Manjeet Singh Sethi became the deputy mayor with 23 SAD-BJP councillors deciding not to vote.Later, in 2017, Kulwant went back into the SAD fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/big-blow-to-akali-dal-as-former-mohali-mayor-s-group-decides-to-go-independent-in-mc-polls-101610389117473.html

As a result, when it rains, the water collects on low lying spots of newly resurfaced roads, leading to water-logging.“Water logging on low lying areas damages the roads slowly, but if the authority designs the drainage systems in a manner that the rain water does not stay onto the road, the damage can be stopped. We have demanded that road resurfacing be done keeping in mind gradient channelling water into nearby drains,” said Amit Gupta, a member of Progressive Community Foundation, a citizens’ group. They have written to the authority demanding that any service provider to lay cables cuts the newly built roads, however, it is not repaired properly afterwards.“There is no coordination among different departments of the authority when it comes to giving permission to service providers to cut the newly built roads and lay cables, that include internet, water pipeline, gas pipeline and telephone, among others. The authority’s area official builds the roads and then the water department gives permission to cut the road. But later it is not repaired. As a result it weakens the road so much so that commuters have to face issues,” said SK Jain, another member of this group.Jain further added, “We advise that the road cutting or line laying permission be given only by a local officer, who knows when the road was built.”The Noida authority’s chief general manager Rajeev Tyagi said that he will look into all of these issues.“We will look into these issues raised by the residents and take appropriate action as per rules,” said Tyagi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-residents-demand-road-repairs-101610388816863.html

Police said the gang allegedly used to purchase dry fruits and spices from wholesalers by quoting a higher price but then default on payments. The gang allegedly then used to sell the goods in the open market. The suspects were identified as Mohit Goel, a resident of Sector 50 and Omprakash Jangid, from Rajasthan.According to the police, Goel (40) is the mastermind in the 2017 scam, in which victims were offered smartphones at ₹251. He was arrested in February 2017 when the company, which placed orders with Goel, alleged that they had not received the handsets they had paid for. Pre-orders for the “cheapest smartphone” had led to the company’s website to crash in 2016.Police said he has also served time on previous occasions for allegedly cheating people in various scams, one of which was in Delhi for taking ₹25 lakh from a victim.According to police officers, a case was registered at the Sector 58 police station in December last year against 14 suspects, including Goel and Jangid, in connection with duping people on pretext of paying for dry fruits and spices. “A probe was conducted in the matter and the suspects were found running a luxurious office from Sector 62 by the name of Dubai dry fruits. They offered rates above the market value to wholesalers to purchase the commodities. Initially, in order to build trust, they conducted some business properly but then would pay only 30 to 40% of the amount as advance, while not paying anything later and giving a post-dated cheque, which would eventually bounce. The goods were then sold at a profit in the open market, thus earning them a decent profit margin,” said joint commissioner of police, law and order, Luv Kumar.Police officers said that the suspects have allegedly duped more than 500 people in this manner across the country. At least two dozen such cases have been identified against them, while more cases are being looked into. Police said the suspects have allegedly duped people in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. A senior police official, requesting anonymity, said that the suspects are allegedly responsible for the majority of dry-fruit related scams in the country.“They were running a company from Gurugram in 2017 which they later shut and moved to a new location. They started one in Noida in 2019 in Sector 63, before starting Dubai dry fruits. Their modus operandi was to close the company they were running after duping a good number of people and then starting another firm,” said Kumar.Another senior police officer, requesting to not be named, said that the suspects allegedly kept a large amount of money for their legal team, including High Court lawyers, who came into action every time a case was filed against them. The officer also said that Goel was allegedly unperturbed after his arrest today as well. One of Goel’s partners is on anticipatory bail.Police also said that they have identified at least six other accomplices and several more associates, including foreign nationals, who were allegedly working for them.“The current office had an employee strength of 56. They were offered a 2% incentive for bringing in clients. We are working to identify everyone associated with them and then take necessary action against them,” said the joint CP.Police are working to identify how much profit they have made but suspect it to be in crores. They will also identify assets purchased by them and then seize them.“Sometimes when complaints were filed against them, they would file counter FIRs through court. In Meerut action was taken against them for filing a false case. In some cases, they would also honeytrap people who would try to take action against them. In Rajasthan, they got five people arrested in one such honeytrap case,” said Kumar.Almost ₹10 crore of profits from frauds were invested allegedly by Goel and his wife, Dhaarna, in a virtual reality games company, said the police.They were nabbed from near Meghdootam Park in Sector 50. Three phones, 60 kilogram dry fruits, an Audi car, an Innova and other electronics were recovered from them.The suspects were produced before a magistrate where a team of six lawyers argued their case. However, the court remanded them to judicial custody for 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/freedom-251-scam-kingpin-arrested-again-this-time-for-duping-traders-101610388636847.html

The officials said that each of the underground solid waste collection bins will be able to handle two tonnes of dry and wet waste and thus aid in improving the look of the city by helping keep the city clean.The five centres are near Sarvodaya Hospital in Kavi Nagar, near Santosh Medical College in Vijay Nagar, near Vandana Farm House in Vasundhara, Hindon cremation ground in Ghaziabad city and at Sector 7 in Raj Nagar. “The five underground solid waste collection points have been built at a cost of about ₹32 lakh. These will help improve the city’s look and will also help in maintaining hygienic conditions. These have been installed at locations where people dump garbage in open,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. “We will start more collection points as per requirement. Each of the sites has two bins for dumping dry and wet waste, with each having capacity to store about one tonne of waste each. Once the bins get filled up, they can be emptied using our vehicles. The waste dumped at the opening above the ground level goes down to the underground bins,” he added. The officials said that this will also help improve the city’s rankings in the upcoming Swachh Survekshan which is likely to be initiated in March. The national ranking of Ghaziabad city had slipped to nineteenth from the thirteenth spot (in the ranking of cities having population of over 10 lakh) in the fifth edition of the Swachh Survekshan – 2020, results of which were announced by the ministry of housing and urban affairs in August last year.The Ghaziabad city stood at 351 spot in the ranking released in 2017, while it considerably improved its position in 2018 when it was placed at 36th rank, and further improved its position to the 12th spot in 2019. In 2019, the city stood at the top in the state ranking but in 2020, it slipped by two positions giving way to Lucknow and Agra ahead of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-to-place-solid-waste-collection-bins-underground-at-five-locations-101610388456778.html

Three persons – the owner of the property and the brokers – have been arrested in connection with the incident.The bodies were discovered during a joint search operation by the Bulandshahr police and the Greater Noida police.Explaining the sequence of events, Ranpal Singh, senior sub-inspector, Site V police station, said that Kalu left Greater Noida and came to Bulandshahr on January 8, as allegedly revealed by him. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that last week, six people had died in Bulandshahr after consuming spurious liquor and that Kalu had also consumed the spurious liquor. “On January 9, Kalu was admitted to GIMS, Greater Noida by the Bulandshahr police for treatment. On January 19, when he regained consciousness, he revealed that he had been consuming liquor with Pradeep and Santosh at a factory in the Site V area in Greater Noida.” Police said Kalu allegedly told them that Pradeep and Santosh may still be at the same spot drinking and guarding the liquor cartons, after which officers from Bulandshahr and Noida, who were interrogating Kalu, rushed to the spot.The police team, along with the excise department team, conducted a joint search operation at the said factory and found the main door of the building open. “The team recovered the two bodies. Scattered next to the bodies were illegal liquor bottles. One body was found on the bed and another body near the washroom,” the SSI said. The police also found 36 cartons of illicit liquor, wrappers, and other paraphernalia from the rented premises. There was no one else at the premises, said officers. Police said Kalu and Santosh were named in the FIR registered in Bulandshahr, adding that Kalu was allegedly also involved in the operations of the illicit liquor racket. Both the decease were from Gangawali in Bulandshahr, said the police.On Monday, the Greater Noida police arrested the property owner, Surendra Sharma, a resident of Tappal, and two property brokers – Niraj Nagar, a resident of Dankaur and Shashank Tyagi, a resident of Beta 2 – for facilitating the rent agreement with the suspects for ₹25,000 a month. The rent agreement was signed between Mintu and Surendra.The DCP said that the suspects had allegedly hired the premises from Surendra on January 2 this year on the pretext of running a cosmetic products manufacturing unit. Surendra was arrested for criminal conspiracy, said officers.“A case has been registered against five persons – Kalu, his accomplices Mintu, Tinku, and the deceased Pradeep and Santosh under Sections 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink) of the IPC and Section 60 (penalty for unlawful, export, transport, manufacture, possession, sale) of the Uttar Pradesh Excise Act. The property owner and two dealers have been charged under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC,” SSI said.R B Singh, Gautam Budh Nagar excise officer, said that an excise department team also conducted a search operation and found wrappers of “Miss India” brand on the liquor bottles. “We scanned the QR codes and found that they were counterfeit. We found some liquor bottles, wrappers and other things at the spot. However, there was nothing at the premises to suggest that a factory was operating from there. It appears the gang had shifted the illegal liquor to Greater Noida from Sikandrabad after the situation deteriorated there,” he said.On January 8, six persons died while around a dozen people fell ill after consuming spurious liquor in Jitgadhi village of Bulandshahr district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/greater-noida-two-found-dead-in-illegal-liquor-factory-property-owner-brokers-arrested-101610388396767.html

In the Muradnagar incident, Ajay Tyagi, awarded the contract for the structure which had collapsed, was arrested by the Ghaziabad police apart from four others, including officers of the Muradnagar Nagar Palika. He had also been a major contractor with the Ghaziabad municipal corporation which blacklisted his three firms -- Ajay Tyagi Constructions, Mahi Construction and Builders and Krishna Associates – after the incident. Tyagi had allegedly told the police that he bribed officials and also resorted to malpractices.“Although technical and quality checks are taken up time and again, we will now undertake strict and special checks in cases where contractors quote 25% or below the tender cost. This is done as there is always an apprehension that quoting a rate much below the tender price may involve compromise with the quality of construction material. So, these works will be strictly checked and suitable action will be taken up,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The corporation has a list of about 350 registered contractors who take up different civic infrastructure related works under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation.“In other cases, if the price is quoted slightly below the tender price, there are chances that contractors may have resorted to malpractices like forming cartels or managing tenders among themselves. So, these practices will also be checked up and we will encourage that more bidders participate in tenders,” Tanwar added.As per norms, works of over ₹1 lakh are awarded through e-tendering process, with the work going to the lowest bidder. “Corporation officials are always entrusted to maintain quality checks in works which are awarded, irrespective of whether the price is quoted only slightly below or much below the tender price. In fact, after the Muradnagar incident, some expert agency should be roped in to check the quality of work, for instance of over ₹50 lakh, while the other smaller works should be checked by a committee of technical experts from different agencies such as the public works department, the UP Jal Nigam, among others,” said Rajendra Tyagi, councillor from Raj Nagar. “Further, if the corporation wants to ensure transparency, they must publish its works online with details. This will ensure that everything is in the public domain and any citizen can see whether the same work is allotted frequently (as in case of roads) or not,” he added. The Muradnagar roof collapse incident has virtually exposed the alleged nexus between certain officials and contractors and a special investigation team of the Economic Offences Wing is now probing the case, on directions of the Uttar Pradesh government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/muradnagar-incident-effect-civic-body-steps-up-checks-all-low-quoted-tenders-will-be-scrutinised-101610388336751.html

Sweepers were also pressed into action and earthmovers were brought in to clear the debris scattered on the bypass road near Haibowal Bridge.The garbage accumulated near the wall all of Lord Mahaveer Homeopathic College and the School for differently abled was also cleaned.The cleaning drive, however, brought a smile to the residents’ faces who said that the area had been lying in a state of neglect for a long time.Kanwar Jatinder Singh Bajwa, a resident, said, “Over the years, crossing the Haibowal bridge had become quite a task. We had raised the issue several time but to no avail. But today, I was relieved to see the MC staff carrying out cleaning work. Sadly, the MC got into action only in view of the CM’s visit; otherwise the place would have remained in shambles.”Manu Dogra, another resident of Haibowal, said the CM should visit the city frequently. “CM’s visit has brought a pleasant change to this route. The roads are being cleaned and potholes are being filled. I would urge the CM to keep visiting different parts of the city so that other areas can also get a facelift,” he said.Later in the evening, MC commissioner Pradeep Kumar Sabharwal inspected the route that the CM’s cavalcade is expected to take. Heavy police force was also deployed in the area.Meanwhile, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu welcomed the chief minister’s visit, stating that it has finally brought in some hustle and bustle as the pandemic had brought life to a standstill. “We are eagerly waiting for the CM as his project will rejuvenate the water body that had turned into a bane for the city,” said the mayor.New cleaning project new foundation stoneAt Haibowal Bridge, the workers were busy preparing the foundation stone of the project that would be inaugurated by the CM on Tuesday.Interestingly, the foundation stone of ₹650-crore project of rejuvenation of Buddha Nullah is being set up right in front of the foundation stone of Buddha Nullah in-situ bio-remediation project, which had been inaugurated in 2011 by the then Union minister for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh and then Ludhiana MP Manish Tewari.The project, estimated to cost ₹15.05 crore, had failed badly.

The residents have time until the end of March to get their pet dogs and cats registered, failing which they have to shell out ₹4,000 as fine, and lose custody of the pet to the civic body till the formalities are complete. Avneesh Aggarwal, a resident of Mall Road, who was seen chasing his labrador for a picture, said, “The real problem is the long format of the registration form. By the time you manage to fill in all the details, the session expires and you have to start the process all over again.”Sunil Vinayak, a resident of Sham Singh Road, said he was struggling with the online payment. “Making online payment through the MC website is tough as there are many technical glitches. I had planned to visit MC’s Zone-D office to physically fill out the form, but it is always crowded and risky considering the pandemic situation,” he said, adding that he hopes that the MC authorities will find a way to make the process less cumbersome. Another resident, Rishi Punni, said that he has been making multiple rounds of the vet’s office for the last few days as he lost a few old prescription slips of his pets. “I have two pets and had got them vaccinated. But I only have the new prescription slips. The old ones had been misplaced. Since, the MC has asked for details of the vaccination, I have to visit the veterinarian to get the entire chart of the prescription,” said Punni. MC’s senior veterinary officer Dr Harbans Dalla agreed that technical glitches are hampering the pet registration project. “I have received several complaints from residents. Some are facing troubles, not just in online registration, but also at the MC office. I have taken up the issue with the IT staff and soon all glitches will be solved. We are also planning to do away with the long format of registration forms to make it easy for the residents to register,” said Dr Harbans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-teething-troubles-in-pet-registration-process-101610388158206.html
11-01-2021||Gurugram||Nine, including spa owner, arrested in Sushant Lok for flesh trade||The police on Monday arrested seven women and two men, including the owner of a spa, in Sushant Lok 1 for their alleged involvement in flesh trade. Two teams from DLF Phase-4 and Sushant Lok police stations raided the spa after sending decoy customers to the establishment. “We had sent two head constables as decoy customers at A-One Spa Centre in Block C in Sushant Lok-1. They met the spa manager at the reception. A man present at the counter demanded ₹1,000 for a massage. When asked about the charges for extra services, the man demanded ₹2,000 for each service. The decoys agreed and handed over two notes of ₹2,000 denomination to each woman to finalise the deal,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police. The head constables soon gave a missed call to one of the inspectors, who was standing guard nearby along with a police party. “We raided the club and arrested seven women for illicit trade. We also recovered ₹4,000 given to them by the decoy customers,” Rao said. The women are aged between 20 and 25 years, the police said.“The women had been working in the spa for the last six months and they received a part of the payment,” Rao said, adding that the owner was involved in flesh trade running out of the spa. A case was registered against the accused under sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, 1956 at Sushant Lok-1 police station. The accused men and women were produced in the district court on Monday and sent to judicial custody, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/nine-including-spa-owner-arrested-in-sushant-lok-for-flesh-trade-101610388097153.html

According to the police, they received a call on the police control room number that three men had snatched a cash bag at gunpoint from a man. After this, a team from Palam Vihar police station was sent to the spot. The police said that Deepak Pandey, a resident of Delhi who works for a private company in Udyog Vihar, had gone to Sector 14 to withdraw ₹10 lakh from the company’s account. He was riding a scooter while returning to his office. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that Pandey received a call soon after he crossed Atul Kataria Chowk at Sector 14 towards Palam Vihar. “He parked the scooter near a nursery and was attending the call, when three men on a motorbike pulled up close to him, took him at gunpoint and snatched his bag,” he said. Pandey said the bag contained important documents, his laptop and cash, which was kept in the middle pocket. “I screamed for help and asked another motorist to chase the bike. But no one helped. The snatchers disappeared in one of the lanes of Palam Vihar,” he said. The police said the suspects were following Pandey since he was out of the bank. However, as the area was congested and the police were deployed at the gate, they targeted him near the nursery. A case under sections 379 B(snatching and use of force) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections of the Arms Act was registered at Palam Vihar police station on Monday. The police recorded the victim’s statement and are verifying his claims.

11-01-2021||Gurugram||Animal husbandry department issues advisory on consumption of meat and poultry||As panic around the outbreak of avian influenza (or bird flu) spreads, the district animal husbandry department on Monday issued a public advisory, assuring citizens that the consumption of poultry and eggs is safe. Officials said they have been receiving a large number of enquiries from concerned residents, who want to know whether the virus poses a risk to personal and public health, and what level of care needs to be taken. “There is a lot of panic around the whole situation because Haryana has confirmed an outbreak of H5N8 avian influenza virus. People are not visiting parks and have stopped eating chicken. There are also a lot of rumors about how the virus can be transmitted to humans. In a meeting with state authorities this afternoon, we were told to widely disseminate that there is no health risk from eating chicken and eggs. It is completely safe,” said Dr Punita Gahlot, deputy director, animal husbandry department, Gurugram. The particular H5N8 strain, officials said, is extremely lethal to birds but has no proven pathogenicity in humans. Officials also pointed out that unlike the H5N1 strain, which was found to be circulating in birds in Himachal Pradesh, H5N8 has no proven incidence of transmission from birds to humans. “We have to be careful of course. But this reluctance to eat poultry is going to disproportionally affect the poultry industry. In fact, if there is even the slightest risk with both strains of the virus, it is not to people who are eating the chicken but to those who are butchering it,” said a veterinary officer with the animal husbandry department, seeking anonymity.Translated from Hindi, the animal husbandry department’s advisory states, “It is completely safe to eat poultry and poultry products in Gurugram. People should cook chicken thoroughly for 30 minutes at 70 degrees Celsius and no raw meat or eggs should be consumed this time. Our teams are on high alert. There are no unusual deaths or illnesses among birds at poultry farms in Gurugram. Citizens are advised not to panic or fall prey to rumors.” “We will be publicising this message widely through the public relations office and through social media. In case a risk emerges for humans, people will be immediately notified,” Gahlot said. “There is a lot of concern over this outbreak because after Covid-19, people have become aware of the risk of zoonotic diseases. But Covid-19 is still the largest public health concern that we have to worry about, not bird flu,” she said.As of Monday, a total of 34 commercial poultry farms and 24 backyard units having high-density of poultry have been put on round-the-clock surveillance, officials revealed. Meanwhile, the wildlife department has also extended its surveillance of wild birds to other green areas in the district, including Leisure Valley Park and Bhondsi. “Only in Tau Devi Lal Park, we have we seen an unusual number of bird deaths. In other places, it is business as usual. We will know once the samples have returned from Jalandhar,” said Rajesh Chahal, district wildlife inspector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/animal-husbandry-department-issues-advisory-on-consumption-of-meat-and-poultry-101610388037194.html
11-01-2021||Gurugram||Canal water supply for sectors 58-115 likely to start this summer||The city’s newer sectors, 58 to 115, are likely to start getting canal water supply by this summer, with 75% of the work having been completed and the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) targeting to lay water distribution pipelines in these sectors by March 31. Although officials confirmed that a majority of the work across the three land parcels has been completed ahead of summer, when the demand peaks, they were reluctant to commit to a specific deadline.A senior official in the GMDA’s infrastructure-II division, which looks after water supply, said, “We have already made some progress in this regard. In Sectors 58 to 70, pipelines had been laid by August last year and water supply has already begun. Then, we had also started supplying water to some areas between sectors 71 and 76 around the same time, and to a few more areas beyond Sector 99. A few land litigation issues are still pending, but a quick resolution is expected and we will lay more pipelines in the remaining sectors as the right of way is handed to us. Supply should start in April, but I can’t say for sure.”In all, the GMDA has to finish laying about 130 kilometres of the piped network to achieve what has been its central mandate, after it took over water infrastructure from the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). While the initial deadline for the same was March 2019, this was subsequently pushed to June 2020 due to multiple land acquisition issues. “After that, the lockdown happened and we were not able to complete the work due to lack of labour. But we have taken it up again on a priority now,” said Pradeep Mehta, chief engineer, GMDA (Infra-II). The GMDA also plans to complete construction of a water boosting station in Sector 72 by March 31, which will supply water to sectors 70 to 80, and to Gwal Pahari as well. “Around 25% of the work is complete, but the scale of the project is not as intense as building a whole new plant, so it should be done by March,” Mehta said. However, water supply to sectors 80 to 115 may take longer as the augmentation of the GMDA’s water plant in Chandu Budhera is expected to be completed by June 2021. “We are creating four new holding tanks with an additional capacity of 1060 million litres of water. Around 70% of the work is complete. The pipelines in areas between sector 81 and 115 will be laid by March, but the additional water storage capacity is needed and will be ready a few months later,” said the senior official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/canal-water-supply-for-sectors-58-115-likely-to-start-this-summer-101610388036735.html

The district administration on Monday directed urban local bodies and the revenue department involved in public dealings to prepare the list of vaccine beneficiaries at the earliest. With the data collection ongoing across the state, over 450,000 frontline workers are to be registered on Co-WIN, the digital platform for real-time data on Covid-19 vaccine. Frontline workers are second on the list of priority groups to be vaccinated in the initial phase, which is expected to start on January 16 with the immunisation of healthcare workers. While the police had submitted the list directly to the state administration, data for urban local bodies data is to be managed at the district level.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, Gurugram, “Details of the police staff has been shared with the state administration. Of the 5,800 police personnel, the plan is to first provide vaccine shots to over 1,500 who were deployed on Covid-19 duties, such as at borders, or those who were tasked with identifying missing Covid-19 positive patients, and even those who were stationed at hospitals.”“Second on the list are those who were stationed in residential areas to monitor the containment zones and were involved in public dealings at police stations. Finally, those who are at police lines or with the crime cell will be vaccinated,” said Rao, adding that the department has already submitted its details to the state. In the case of urban local bodies, a count of municipal and revenue employees is set to be taken. Yash Garg, the newly appointed deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “A letter has been sent to the urban local body and revenue to prepare the list of frontline workers at the earliest. Within the revenue (department), employees who are under subdivisional magistrates and are involved at the block level of the district with various tasks are included. Although there hasn’t been a specific deadline issued by the state, the administration is trying to get the details fast.”Under the urban local bodies’ list, municipal workers engaged in public health, sanitation and waste management are also covered. Other staff like engineers, bus drivers, conductors, water tanker operators and those working at crematoriums and maintenance department are all included as frontline workers. The list will include permanent, contractual and outsourced workers, and also those working with contractors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/data-collection-of-frontline-workers-for-vaccination-gains-pace-101610387977652.html

They don’t have a choice and with the court pulling up the Centre, maybe it will happen soon. All groups have major plans for the Republic Day, and we have been practising and coordinating for it constantly. The point of organising matches is not just to keep ourselves in shape or entertained, but to show the government that we are ready for a prolonged fight,” said Yogesh Pratap Singh, state president, BKU (Bhanu).The farmers are adamant that if their demands are not met, they will march down with their tractors and conduct a parade on the Republic Day at Rajpath.“Our farmer brothers have been asked to march to Delhi on January 23 itself with each of them carrying a fist full of soil from our lands because that is where our hearts are. It is our belief that each child of the nation is a farmer. The government is still not listening to our demands and we have no plans of backing out,” said Dr Shailesh Kumar Giri, national spokesperson, BKU (Lok Shakti).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-chilla-border-farmers-organise-kabaddi-wrestling-to-keep-themselves-in-shape-101610387978128.html
11-01-2021||Other||Farmers mobilising at Haryana border for Delhi march on Jan 26||Farmer leaders from Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, who are protesting at the Haryana-Rajasthan border in Jaisinghpur Khera, on Monday said that they will march towards Delhi on Republic Day. They said that preparations for January 26 are in full swing and that farmers from several states are mobilising at the site. Groups of farmers from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa also joined the ongoing agitation on Monday, with more expected to join in the coming week.Addressing a press conference at the protest site on Monday, national vice president of All India Kisan Sabha and former CPI(M) MLA Amra Ram said that farmers would join the agitation in Delhi. “We will move towards Delhi on January 26, once again. Since Day One, this has been our goal. The Haryana government has been stopping us and not allowing us to move ahead,” said Ram. Farmers from several states have been camping at Jaisinghpur Khera, located near Shahjahanpur in Alwar district, at the Rajasthan-Haryana border, for the past 30 days. Farmers from across the country have been protesting against the three new agriculture laws that were passed by the Centre in September last year, over fears that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of corporations and end the minimum support price (MSP) for important crops. The farmers at the site had tried to proceed towards Delhi on December 25, 2020. However, amid heavy police presence and barricading, farmers could not enter Haryana as planned and blocked the second carriageway of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway. On December 31, nearly 20 trolleys led by youngsters from Rajasthan broke the barricades and entered Rewari with the aim of proceeding towards Delhi. They were joined by their counterparts from Hanumangarh and Shri Ganganagar in Rajasthan on January 3, after which they tried proceeding towards Delhi, but were stopped as the Rewari police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons. Ram blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of sowing seeds of divisions to weaken the movement. “Some news reports have claimed that locals here are not happy with our agitation. This is not true. We are getting a lot of support from locals who pitch in with various resources,” said Ram. BJP spokesperson Jawahar Yadav said that allegations against the party were baseless. “The BJP has no interest in creating divisions in any movement. If protesters feel that locals are against them, it must be due to their actions and behaviours. The BJP is only making efforts to make farmers understand the true benefits of the three farm laws,” said Yadav.Ram said that locals are continuing to support the agitation. “They are sending milk, snacks and other items. A majority of the locals support our movement. A few concerned shopkeepers had approached us, but even they were convinced after we told them that the roads were blocked by the police,” said Ram.Support for the farmers’ agitation, however, seemed divided among residents of villages near the site. Sinu Jaisinghpuria, a resident of Jaisinghpur Khera, said that most villagers want the protesting farmers to move towards Delhi. “Due to the farmers’ movement, a number of heavy vehicles have started passing through the village. There have been some accidents due to the increased vehicular movement in the area. Most people are of the view that farmers should move towards Delhi,” said Jaisinghpuria. He added that the earnings of small shops on the highway are being adversely affected due to the agitation. Sanjay Madhav, a member of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha — the umbrella body of farmer unions protesting at Delhi’s borders — and the state convener of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee in Rajasthan, said that both locals and farmers were being inconvenienced for the past four days due to the closure of a slip road. With the Haryana government opening the road on Monday, the issue had been resolved, he said. “The police had closed a slip road due to which we were facing difficulties in procuring supplies as before. Even the locals were being inconvenienced. However, the road has been opened again now. We requested the police to not create obstructions for us,” said Madhav. He said that the agitation would be marking important days to honour different sections of farmers ahead of January 26, when the protesters plan to march to Delhi. “We will be marking a day to honour women farmers next week, on January 18. We will also be celebrating Lohri and other important days before proceeding ahead,” said Madhav.Deputy superintendent of police for Bawal, Rajesh Kumar, couldn’t be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-mobilising-at-haryana-border-for-delhi-march-on-jan-26-101610387976781.html

Officials said that they are not closing down any shop or poultry for now as there is nothing to worry given that GB Nagar has seen no signs of avian influenza so far. They also said that the vigilance has been stepped up in the district. There are 20 rapid response teams of three members -- two foresters and one veterinarian -- in the district for the purpose. The district administration has already set up a task force to keep an eye on any case of bird flu. The officials said that they have also sensitised the chicken shops and poultry owners. “So far there has been no case of bird flu in GB Nagar. However, we have stepped up the vigilance especially after cases being reported in the neighbouring cities like Delhi. All the officials have been asked to check the poultries and sensitise them about the symptoms and report us in case any symptom is noticed. There are anyways only a few poultries in the district,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar. He added that the vigilance is being kept on all big poultries and smaller shops equally. VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer (CVO) of GB Nagar, said, “There are only two major poultry farms in the district and those are in Jarcha village, Greater Noida. We have already visited them and apprised them of the symptoms and asked them to inform us in case of any emergency. The entry of outsiders and extra stockings have been barred for some time in a bid to avoid any source that might bring along the pathogens.” Srivastava, who heads the district animal husbandry department, said that the district largely depends on chicken supply from Ghazipur chicken market, which was shut last Saturday for 10 days. “The roadside small shops that sell chicken are in our radar too, but most of them are now closed as they depend on the wholesalers from Ghazipur market. Sale is anyways down with most of the shops now closed,” Srivastava added. Asked if those shops selling chicken would be shut as precautionary measures, the officials denied for now. “We are not shutting any shop for now or taking any such measures as it would create panic among people. For now, we have just asked out teams to stay alert,” CVO said. The district has 20 rapid response team (RRT) to inspect different areas of Jewar, Bisrakh, Dankaur and Dadri. Each RRT has two officials from the forest department and one from animal husbandry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-sensitising-the-poultry-farms-says-gb-nagar-admin-101610387858014.html

The district has come up with 13 cold storage points for storing of vaccine, besides the main vaccine depot. The officials have also identified 73 centres where the vaccination will take place, and about 21,543 doctors and medical staff have been identified for vaccination under the first phase.

11-01-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 vaccine to be administered at six sites on Jan 16||The Covid-19 vaccine will be administered to nearly 600 healthcare workers at six session sites in Gurugram on January 16, said senior health officials, with a decision on further vaccinations to be taken once the procurement and distribution plans are finalised at the state level.Only a limited number of session sites have been given the go-ahead to smoothly conduct vaccinations on the launch day, said health officials. “A decision on vaccination post-January 16 is yet to be taken by the state government. It will depend upon the vaccine stock and distribution strategy,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Of the 5,000 session sites across the country, where vaccine administration will start this week, at least 113 are in Haryana. About 11,000 healthcare workers in 22 districts are set to get the first dosage. However, officials did not disclose which vaccine would be administered during the drive.“As directed by the state, only six sites have been selected in Gurugram for the vaccine launch. But we are prepared with 161 sites, in case the vaccination gains pace next week,” Yadav said.In Gurugram, over 36,000 healthcare workers, both from government and private set-ups, are registered for the vaccination. According to Yadav, whenever the full-fledged vaccination drive starts, they will try giving a vaccine shot to all healthcare workers in the district within three days.At the six identified sites — government primary schools in Wazirabad and Daulatabad, Chauma urban primary health centre, Bhangrola primary health centre, SGT Medical College in Chandu Budhera and Medanta Hospital — a dry run was conducted at four sites on January 7. Two private hospitals — SGT and Medanta — are the new sites added to the list.On January 16, the Wazirabad session site has been chosen for interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi through videoconferencing. The Wazirabad site is one of the two session sites in the state, with the other being in Panchkula, chosen for the videoconference. Other session sites will have a webcast of the event, said Yadav.For making the system robust before the vaccination day, another dry run was planned on January 14 at 161 sites in the district. The drill, however, has been cancelled due to lack of clarity on the vaccination schedule, confirmed MP Singh, the district immunisation officer.On Monday, Yadav held a meeting with medical officers from 21 private hospitals, urban primary health centres and community health centres. He directed them to strictly adhere to the dos and don’ts. A training session was also conducted for data entry operators who will have to work on the Co-WIN platform to track and update the beneficiaries list.Yadav said that for vaccination, well-trained and experienced personnel are being deployed for smooth functioning at the session sites. Foot signage will be put at the session sites to clearly demarcate the entry and exit to prevent chaos. He said that Covid-19 vaccine will not be administered to female healthcare workers who are pregnant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-vaccine-to-be-administered-at-six-sites-on-jan-16-101610387736730.html
11-01-2021||Bhopal||Chouhan emphasises police action in recovery of missing girls, women||Instructing the police to act to recover girls and women who have been reported missing in the state, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the number of missing girls is double when compared to missing boys. He said it was a clear indication that the disappearance of girls was not normal, as per an official release.CM’s observation and instructions came during a high-level meeting with home minister Narottam Mishra, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri in connection with girls and women reported missing from the state, as per the release.Chouhan said, “Police should increase the number of recoveries of girls… Serious action needs to be taken in the case of the missing girls. Disappearance of girls is a matter of concern.”The CM said recovering lost girls should be a priority. "Such a system should be made that a complete record of the girls going out of the district for work, employment etc., is maintained so that they could file a complaint. There should be such a system that registration should be mandatory for those who go out of the district for work. Only then this could be stopped," he said.Chouhan suggested merging of different types of helplines. At present, the Umang app and helpline 1090 are operating in the state. The helpline number of the Government of India is 1098.He, however, congratulated the police on the decline in the number of crimes against women in the last few months. Crimes against women have reduced by half in the last eight months, he said.Also read: Democrats in US Congress begin second push to impeach Donald TrumpDGP Vivek Johri said, ”The main reasons behind the disappearance of girls and women in urban areas include their leaving house without informing anyone or getting angry and running away or eloping with boyfriends. In rural areas, people migrate in search for employment. In such cases, action by the Labour Department becomes necessary. A record should be maintained of where and what work the contractor is taking from them.”Reacting to the CM's and the DGP’s statements, state Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “By talking of boyfriends, the state government is trying to trivialise a serious issue like crimes against girls and women. It is trying to cover-up its inefficiency in taking action against organised gangs which target girls and women across the state. The fact remains that a good number of girls and women are trafficked from tribal areas by these organised gangs but the government and its police force continue to remain oblivious of the ground reality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/chouhan-emphasises-police-action-in-recovery-of-missing-girls-women-101610386962549.html

Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh had last week given permission to reopen archaeological sites, tourist spots, museums and forts in Pune district.

11-01-2021||Bangalore||Hectic lobbying for ministerial berths ahead of Karnataka cabinet expansion||By Venkatesha BabuWith Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa saying he has received the consent of the party high command to induct seven new members into his cabinet, hectic lobbying has begun among nearly two-dozen aspirants. Differences also have cropped between newcomers into the party - those who crossed over from Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) to help BJP form the government - and old guard loyalists who feel the interlopers have bagged bulk of the cabinet berths.In the 224-member Karnataka assembly, there are 2 vacancies with the BJP having 119 members plus the support of three independents. The Congress has 67 MLA's while the JDS has 33. Among those who crossed over from Congress and JDS who are waiting to be inducted include Raja Rajeshwari Nagar MLA Munirathna as well as Vidhana Parishat members MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar.Munirathna told HT, "while campaigning for my by-poll victory, the CM himself said that I would be made a minister and I am confident that he will keep his word." AH Vishwanath, another defector who was defeated in the subsequent by-poll but was nominated to the upper house, sounded bitter and said, "Yediyurappa should remember the sacrifice of those who helped him become the chief minister. Our sacrifice should not be easily forgotten."However, with the High Court passing strictures against Vishwanath becoming a minister following a PIL - he is a nominated member to the upper house - he is unlikely to be taken into the cabinet. Several of the BJP's old guards, including CM's political secretary M P Renukacharya, seven-time MLA Umesh Katti, five-time legislators S Angara, GH Thippareddy, Mudigere MLA MP Kumaraswamy, Karkala legislator Sunil Kumar, Basangouda Somangouda Patil representing Devara Hipparagi, Parana Munavalli, Hartal Halappa, Dattatreya Patil Revoor, Aravind Limbavali, are some of those who have publicly expressed their desire to be a part of the cabinet.Also read: Satellite imagery shows China creating new military logistics hub in TibetOthers like Hiriyur legislator Poornima Srinivas said that to increase women representation, she should be given an opportunity. Speaking to HT, Mudigere MLA MP Kumaraswamy said that he was fully confident that he would be allowed to serve the people as a minister. "I am sure that adequate representation to a backward class person like me would be provided," he said.Meanwhile, minister for urban development Byrati Basavarj, who crossed over from Congress to help BJP form the government, expressed confidence that his fellow defectors would also be rewarded with cabinet berths. "I am sure that MTB Nagaraju and Muniratha will be made ministers for helping the party come to power. I am confident that promises made will be kept," he stated.However, in the past, some like MP Renukacharya expressed unhappiness over preference given to defectors against long-time loyalists. Last month, as talks of cabinet expansion swirled, Renukacharya had said, "If we hand out all ministries to those who have come in now, should the old-timers who have helped build the party twirl their thumbs?"Renukarcharya on Monday reiterated that he was an aspirant for a ministerial berth "but ultimately we will go by the decision of Yediyurappa who is like a father figure to us," he said.While there was no clarity on whether the cabinet would merely be expanded or there is a reshuffle in the offing, some of the ministers expressed confidence that they would not be dropped. Independent MLA H Nagesh, excise minister facing allegations of corruption relating to transfers in his department, said, "I am confident that I will not be dropped from the cabinet."CM Yediyurappa on Sunday night had said that the cabinet expansion and the oath-taking ceremony would take place on Wednesday (January 13) afternoon. Today, while speaking at a party convention, he said that it may take place on January 13 or 14. Sources in the BJP said that since January 13 is a new moon day (Amavasya - considered inauspicious), the event might be pushed by a day or two.Political analyst Manjunath said that jockeying for cabinet berths was normal but also warned that there might be a spike in dissidence after the expansion. "There are too many aspirants and too little berths. So dissidence will inevitably come to fore. It remains to be seen how the CM decides to handle that," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/hectic-lobbying-for-ministerial-berths-ahead-of-karnataka-cabinet-expansion-101610381485949.html

The civil service prelim examination, scheduled on October 11, 2020, will now be conducted on March 14, 2021 (Sunday). The examination had been postponed after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of 2018 Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs. A circular was issued asking Maratha candidates to apply under open or Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. Vishnu Tangade, a candidate from Jalna district, has applied through EWS category. According to him, no matter what, exams should be held. “I am relieved to know that MPSC is going to conduct the exams. Lakhs of candidates had been looking forward to this. Supreme Court has said that it will hear Maratha reservation case on daily basis. I am hopeful that till the date of examination we will have some definitive answer on the Maratha reservation issue. We don’t want to take the right of other EWS candidates,” Tangade said. Nayan Rathod, who has applied through the open category, said that it is important that the commission issues notification for 2021 examination as well. “This exam which will be held in March was due in 2020. So, the examination of 2021 is pending. After this exam is over, MPSC should issue the dates for the 2021 examination. It is essential for students who face attempt and age limitations,” Rathod. Candidates have expressed happiness after the dates are declared. “We are happy that the exam will take place. MPSC should clear the doubt about 2021 examinations as well,” said Mahesh Gharbude, who has been preparing for the civil service examinations for last 3 years. Experts think that it is essential for candidates to overcome worries and focus on the exam. “Candidates should focus only on the examination now. Notification for this exam was issued on December 2019. The exam was scheduled to be held on April 5, 2020. Almost a year after its original date, it is going to be conducted. Students should not worry about the results and the cut-offs.

During questioning, the DCP said the man, Sanjay Singh Lohia, disclosed that he was working as a peon at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in Delhi.“Lohia also confessed that he deceived the woman and made physical relations with her on the pretext of marriage after claiming to be a divorcee. He has been sent to jail,” Thakur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-claiming-to-be-divorcee-promises-marriage-and-rapes-woman-held-101610378605754.html

Until a few weeks ago, Awasthi was making over ₹600 a day and currently, he is glad of any work, even one that pays a pittance.Since the past 47 days, scores of daily wagers like him, who usually wait at the labour chowk near the Metro station to find employment, are struggling as the farmers’ road blockade has killed opportunities.Labourers say they now have to wait for hours on end at the Labour Chowk and even then, only a handful manage to find work that was plentiful before, given the numerous factories and warehouses in that part of Haryana, not far from the Delhi border.“I found this work after four days of unemployment. Many other daily wagers have left for their homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh after waiting for a couple of days in the hopes that the farmers would disperse,” Awasthi said.The biggest problem is that very little raw material is arriving in this industrial area because of the closure of Rohtak Road. “Some trucks still bring in goods via the inner roads, but a distance that was covered by these vehicles in five minutes earlier now take three to four hours because of the jam that often builds up on these narrow roads. Many truckers have refused to ferry goods because of the jams,” said Praveen Chillar, who deals in construction material and often hires daily wagers.Factory owners said while a few businesses have temporarily downed their shutters, the arrival of material at factories that are open has dipped to as low as 30%.“I would earlier hire nearly a dozen wagers daily. Now I need just two or three a day because of the dip in business,” said Subhash Jangra, accounts manager of a factory dealing in iron and steel goods.Three to four daily wagers squat outside this factory daily in the hopes of finding work, but most will go away disappointed.“This factory is among the few that hires labourers like us, but they will need only a few of us. Most others are able to make do with their own staff,” said Bhure Singh, a daily wager who said he hasn’t had any work for a week now.“Now we know that most of our days will be spent squatting here with no luck. It is better than staying home and being scolded by wives for not working,” said Kali Charan, another wage earner.The workers said they do not grudge the farmers their protest, but they are finding it hard to take this hit after a prolonged period of unemployment during the lockdown just months earlier.“Unlike the farmers, we don’t even have lands to go back to and cultivate. We don’t have a system of minimum wages. It all depends on the demand and supply. Right now, there is very little work and lots of people to do it,” said Ajay Pal, a daily wager.The only silver lining is the free food at the langars organised by farmers. “I have my breakfast there and leave for home after having dinner. It had reduced the quarrels back at my home,” said Pal.Agitating farmers here said they try to ensure that none of these workers is turned away from langars. “Us farmers know the hardships of these labourers. So, we have been cooking much more than what we would have needed for our small group. We cannot give up this protest, but we are trying to lessen their problems,” said Harminder Singh, a farmer from Katera village in Firozpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-protest-hits-daily-wagers-at-labour-chowk-in-bahadurgarh-101610378605146.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Air pollution: SC asks Govt to come out with steps to deal with stubble burning||The Supreme Court Monday asked the Centre to file an affidavit detailing “concrete steps” to deal in future with the situation of stubble burning, which is a major cause of air pollution in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) during the winters.The order by a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, came after it was submitted that the pollution caused due to stubble burning will again come to fore in future.“Mr Tushar Mehta (Solicitor General), you come back with some concrete steps on stubble burning,” the bench said.The top court was hearing a petition which has raised the issue of pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench, “The issue will arise again. For this year, the issue of stubble burning is over and it will start again next time. The Centre has said nothing on this”. The bench asked solicitor general to file an affidavit on the issue. The apex court had last month said it was “not satisfied” with the work done by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, which has been constituted by the Centre to tackle air pollution. “We don't know what your commission is doing. People in Delhi are not satisfied with your work. We are also not satisfied,” the bench had said. Mehta had earlier told the bench that the commission is working on “war footing” and several steps have been taken to deal with pollution. On November 6, the apex court had asked the Centre to ensure there is no smog in Delhi as it was informed that the Commission has started functioning from that day. It had said that pollution problem has to be dealt with by the executive as it has the power, money and resources for this. The Centre, which has appointed former Chief Secretary of Delhi M M Kutty as the chairperson of the Commission, had apprised the court that there were experts from the field besides members from NGOs in the newly created Commission. On October 29, the top court was informed by the Centre that it has come out with an ordinance on curbing pollution and it has been promulgated already. The top court is also hearing a separate plea on air pollution and had last year even taken a suo motu note of alarming rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR where several directions have been passed with regard to stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/air-pollution-sc-asks-govt-to-come-out-with-steps-to-deal-with-stubble-burning-101610375244679.html

11-01-2021||Kolkata||'No difference!' Mamata Banerjee compares BJP with Donald Trump’s followers||The Bharatiya Janata Party will behave in a similar fashion like that of US President Donald Trump’s followers the day they lose the elections, Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said.“Haven’t you seen them? Trump keeps on insisting that he has won despite losing. Similarly, BJP will say 'hum jeeta hai, hum jeeta hai (We have won, we have won)', when they will lose. There is no difference,” said Banerjee, while addressing a rally in Nadia district.Thousands of protesters supporting US President Donald Trump breached the security of the US capitol late on Wednesday night as the Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.Attacking the BJP over the three contentious farm bills, Banerjee alleged that BJP leaders have staged lunch with farmer’s family in rural Bengal after arriving in chartered flights. They feasted on dishes prepared in five-star hotels and drank costly branded mineral water, she said while asserting that she always consumes locally bottled drinking water.“Where were you when farmers protest in Haryana? They are protesting for the last one month under the sun and rain. Some have died in the cold. You have shot people, attacked them with lathis and gas but justice hasn’t been delivered”"Life is not so easy my brother. If you want to meet success you will have to hit the roads. But there is not a speck of dirt on your clothes," she said.Also read: 'Centre to bear expenses for phase 1 of Covid vaccination' - PM ModiShe tagged the BJP as a junk party and christened it as the 'Bharatiya Junk Party', saying that corrupt politicians, who want to save themselves from central investigation agencies, defect to the BJP.“In the entire country, they (BJP) are somewhat afraid of me because they know very well that I cannot be purchased. I would stand in front of the barrel, but I won’t allow them to sell Bengal,” Banerjee said, as she upped her ante against the centre’s privatization and disinvestment policy.The BJP however stung back saying that the tone in which the chief minister has been speaking indicates that she has become bewildered and disappointed.“Her party’s leaders and old-timers are abandoning her. On the other hand, people are coming to attend BJP rallies in large numbers. She is not able to take this. Hence she is sometimes making some contradictory statements. It is better not to reach to her comments,” said Dilip Ghosh, head of BJP’s Bengal unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/no-difference-mamata-banerjee-compares-bjp-with-donald-trump-s-followers-101610371744302.html

11-01-2021||Dehradun||3 Akhadas to herald Mahakumbh 2021 on January 25||By Sandeep RawatAnnouncement by three Akhadas of their arrival in Haridwar for Mahakumbh 2021 from January 25 has heralded the first major religious activity related to Mahakumbh 2021.Shri Panch Dasnam Juna Akhada, Aahwan Akhada and Agni Akhada will be entering the Kumbh city on January 25 by carrying out a religious processions, installation of traditional Kumbh Dharma Dhwaja (flag) and worshipping at major shrines on the pathway.Ramta Panch (the roaming ascetics) will be leading these Akhada processions which are a major attraction for pilgrims, tourists and locals, drawing crowds on both sides of the path through which the royal processions of Akhadas will pass through.According to Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, who is also the international convener of Juna Akhada, the first bhoomi pujan will be performed at Juna Akhada on January 16 after which the holy flag will be installed which will remain throughout the Kumbh fair. After this ritual, the Akhada seers will start arriving in a religious procession from other parts of the country.“Juna Akhada, Aahwan Akhada and Agni Akhada seers will be entering Uttarakhand from Najibabad side of Uttar Pradesh on January 25 and through the path, they will worship and offer rituals to deities, sacred Ganga, shrines of Mata Chandi Devi, Siddhpeeth Dakshin Kali, Gauri Shankar Mahadev, Mayadevi and Daksheshwar Mahadev, among others. The flag hoisting is done at Juna Akhada only by these three Akhadas,” said Mahant Hari Giri.The Kumbh mela administration has also started preparing for the mega fair with infrastructural works being done in mela zone at a fast pace.“Along with the mela officials, I have inspected the ongoing works at Akhadas. All the arrangements will be done in time before the flag hoisting event and the entry of Akhadas seers into Kumbh city,” said Mela officer-in-charge Deepak Rawat.Akhada Parishad has also demanded waiver during Mahakumbh from mandatory verification of pilgrims coming from other states during Mahakumbh citing downfall in number of Covid-19 cases in Uttarakhand and across the country in the past few weeks.To this, state urban development minister Madan Kaushik pointed that Kumbh fair is scheduled to be held in a grand fair though standard operating procedures regarding the spread of Covid-19 and a notification to be issued next month regarding the Mahakumbh fair will make the overall picture clearer.While the state government and the Mela administration are taking this year’s Mahakumbh as a 48-day affair assuming core Kumbh fair from March 11 till April 27, Kumbh Mela Security Force administration is taking the mega fair as a 60-day event, also taking into account the tentative notification date issuance in late February."The arrival of security forces, their deployment, traffic plan need to be chalked out beforehand. By February 28, the state government will issue a notification for Kumbh. We are taking the mela as a 60-day affair from that very date itself," said Director General of Uttarakhand Police, Ashok Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/3-akhadas-to-herald-mahakumbh-2021-on-january-25-101610368512504.html
11-01-2021||Dehradun||Harish Rawat urges Cong high command to declare CM candidate for 2022 polls||Senior Congress leader and former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat has urged party high command to declare the chief ministerial candidate for the 2022 polls to stop damage due to ongoing factionalism in the party. He said it should also be made clear that the person who leads the party in the elections will be the chief ministerial candidate. This is being seen as a direct claim by Rawat for leading the party in the polls.Rawat, while expressing his gratitude to the Uttarakhand Congress in-charge Devendra Yadav, tweeted on Monday, “Thank you Devendra Yadav ji…for increasing my respect…But why Harish Rawat….the electoral fight is incomplete without every single leader and party worker….without much delay, the party should declare the commander (senapati) of the electoral strategy for 2022 elections…the party should also make this clear that in the case Congress wins the elections, the same person would be chosen as the chief minister…”“If we go into elections not clear about all this, it will not be good for the party… the morale of the party cadre is getting affected by undue speculations and groupism….factionism has reached to the level of workers… whosoever the party decides as the leader, I will be behind that person….we have many experienced and energetic people in the party…the high command needs to declare one name and lead us ahead,” his tweet read.Rawat’s bold assertion has not gone well with senior party leaders in the state.Suryakant Dhasmana, Congress state vice president said recently, during the three-day tour of Devendra Yadav, he had said that Pritam Singh is the party president and the elections would be fought collectively with the blessings of Harish Rawat and leader of opposition Indira Hridayesh.Also read: 'Centre to bear expenses for phase 1 of Covid vaccination' - PM Modi“So it has been made clear that the Congress doesn’t believe in declaring the CM candidate before the elections. We will fight collectively and then when we win the elections, the party will decide the CM candidate,” he said.The BJP said it was Congress’s internal matter, but indicative of the fact that Congress is ridden with factionalism.State BJP president Bansidhar Bhagat said Congress is dreaming of winning elections. “People know who they have to choose. It doesn’t concern us at all what Congress is doing about its CM candidate,” he said.The bickering in Uttarakhand Congress over who will lead the party as the chief ministerial candidate in the 2022 assembly polls has come out in the open in the last few months.Congress had even issued a statement in November that it will be state Congress president Pritam Singh who will lead the party in 2022 elections.Many senior Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha member Pradeep Tamta, senior Congress MLA Govind Singh Kunjwal, Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami, former Almora MLA Manoj Tiwari, have been projecting Harish Rawat as the party’s chief ministerial candidate in the forthcoming assembly elections in 2022. This has not gone well with state president Pritam Singh and his supporters.The infighting in the state unit is raging ahead of the elections, especially at a time when the party is trying to strengthen itself at the grassroots level. Some Congress leaders have even indirectly attacked Harish Rawat, blaming him for the 2017 election loss.Rawat had responded saying, “I have been at the forefront of election campaigns from 2002 to 2019. These statistics masters ought to stop counting my wins and losses and move forward”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/harish-rawat-urges-cong-high-command-to-declare-cm-candidate-for-2022-polls-101610368078208.html
11-01-2021||Mumbai||Bird flu outbreak in Maharashtra, confirms central laboratory||The National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, a nodal body for testing bird flu cases, has confirmed that the cause of death of poultry birds (chicken) in Parbhani district is bird flu or avian influenza. Maharashtra has become the eighth state to have been affected by bird flu. The central laboratory has confirmed to the state animal husbandry department that the poultry birds died owing to H5N1 virus, the most common strain of the virus that causes severe respiratory diseases in birds. State animal husbandry commissioner Sachindra Pratap Singh confirmed the development.On Friday, around 800 poultry birds (chicken) and two herons were found dead in Parbhani district of central Maharashtra and their samples were sent to NIHSAD the same day to ascertain the cause of death. Dapoli in Ratnagiri district and Beed district in central Maharashtra, too, had reported deaths of six and 11 crows respectively.“Following the guidelines issued by the Central government, we will have to start culling poultry birds within one km radius of the infected zone in Parbhani district,” said a senior official from animal husbandry department, requesting anonymity. In addition, the area from 1 km to 10 km will be declared as ‘surveillance zone’, he added.“We are still awaiting detailed reports from NIHSAD which could give us clarity on the possibility of the presence of H5N8, which may have caused the bird deaths in other districts too,” said another official from the department.This is second time that Maharashtra is affected by bird flu in the past two decades. Last time, H5N1 outbreak was reported in Navapur village of Nandurkar district in 2006.On Sunday, 160 more birds were found dead in several districts of the state. Of them, 43 and 40 poultry birds were found dead in Parbhani and Latur districts, respectively. In addition, 50 parrots in Nagpur, 29 poultry birds in Amravati, etc, were found dead and their samples were sent to NIHSAD for testing to find out the cause of death, stated a release issued by the animal husbandry department on Sunday.On Saturday, around 200 poultry birds in Latur district, one crow in Akola, two crows each in Gondia and Chandrapur, one heron in Thane and three crows in Dapoli at Ratnagiri district were found dead.Four days ago, 15 pond egrets, two parrots were found dead in Thane and three crows were found dead in Mumbai and test reports of primary investigation conducted at Western Regional Disease Diagnostic laboratory (WRDDL) Pune had come negative.Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat have been other states confirmed to have affected of the bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bird-flu-outbreak-in-maharashtra-confirms-central-laboratory-101610366545310.html

Two public water tanks constructed opposite the Dorabjee Heritage mall are now abandoned, a spot for selfie seekers, if at all. The water tanks were constructed to solve water crisis in Mohamadwadi, but seem to be have been forgotten by the PMC.APRF co-founder Nitin Bokey, who has been spearheading the empowerment mission, said, “PMC has failed to provide water to residents and Mohammadwadi has been neglected all these years. We have huge monthly water bills to pay and citizens are suffering due to PMC apathy despite regular taxes being paid. The forum will raise its voice against the water injustice in Mohammadwadi and will ensure that PMC discharges its duty towards citizens.” Danish Shaikh, a resident of Imperial Housing Society, said, “We have been demanding round-the-clock water supply for the area for the past many years. We will take up the water issue through our citizens’ forum. Currently, water is being bought in private at high prices, despite us paying taxes. PMC must wake up to the reality and discharge its duty.” PMC’s water supply department chief, superintendent Aniruddha Pawaskar, said, “We have been supplying water regularly to Mohammadwadi. There is a water problem at some places in the area and we will try to resolve that issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohammadwadi-residents-form-citizens-forum-to-tackle-water-crisis-101610365704327.html
11-01-2021||Other||Disabled face a job crisis in the post-Covid world||Rizwan Safi, 24, gets distressed every time his wife asks him about when he is returning to work. Safi, had joined an auto parts company in September 2019 and his parents arranged his marriage soon after. In March last year, during the lockdown, his factory shut temporarily and Safi, who earned ₹9,000 a month, lost his job. “ My wife seems to feel that she and her family was cheated into marriage, which is devastating for me. They feel I never had a job in the first place,” says Safi, who is visually challenged. “My supervisor at the factory kept promising me that I would be called back soon, but that has not happened. Everyone else, except three totally blind people like me, have been called back to work. A blind person depends on physical touch, which is a taboo in these times of social distancing. I think it is the need for social distancing that has cost me my job,” adds a distraught Safi. Safi is not the only one. “ Almost half of the 200 people with disabilities I found placements for over the past few years lost their jobs or have been furloughed. Covid 19- is particularly harsh on the blind. These days employees have so many questions and apprehensions about hiring the blind, fearing they would not be able to maintain social distancing. My job as a placement person has never been so difficult in the past decade,” says Tejinder Singh Bisht, who helped place Safi and heads placement division at Blind Relief Association, a Delhi- based non-government organisation, which works for the empowerment of the blind people. People with disabilities—physically disabled, blind, the deaf -- have been disproportionately affected by the economic consequences of the Covid crisis, with thousands of them losing their jobs or being furloughed. They say even before the pandemic, disability-inclusive work culture was a mirage for them and they were hired mostly with a sense of charity. Covid- 19, they feel, has changed even that consideration on the part of companies, creating an unprecedented job crisis for them. And non-government organizations who provide them vocational training and find placement for them say finding jobs for them — most work in hospitality, retail, finance, BPO — has never been harder. Life for people with disabilities who lost their jobs has been a daily struggle. Take, for example, Shayam Sunder, 43, who is deaf. Sunder, who lives in Dwarka and worked as a linen and uniform attendant in a five-star hotel in Delhi, earned ₹11,000 a month before he was furloughed during the lockdown. He has since been desperately trying to find a job, but to no avail. “It was always difficult for a disabled person like me to find a job. The hospitality sector is hit hard, and since I am just class 10 pass, I am not sure if I will find employment in the near future. I have so far survived on my meagre savings and on support being provided by relatives. The feeling of being a burden on others is stifling, ” says Sunder, talking to HT through a sign language interpreter. “People with disabilities, who mostly have entry-level jobs in different sectors, have suffered massive job losses during the Covid -19 crisis. Many of them are the only bread earners in their families. The emotional cost of being unemployed is high as a lot of them are considered a burden by their own families,” says Arman Ali, executive director, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP), a cross-disability, non-profit organization that works with industry and government for the empowerment of people with disabilities. The problem , Ali adds, is that barring a few exceptions, most companies continue to consider employment for disable as part of their CSR activity and not their HR practice. “The pandemic has made it necessary that employment for people with disabilities is rethought. They should be part of the companies’ business plans and seen as drivers of profitability,” says Ali. According to World Bank data, India has 40 to 80 million people with disabilities. The 2011 census pegged this figure at 26.8 million, with the National Capital Territory of Delhi accounting for 2.34 lakh, a number disputed by disability rights activists, who say that the actual figure is much higher. While there is no data available about how many disabled people lost their jobs during the Covid-19 crisis, NCPEDP conducted a study during the lockdown—‘Locked Down and Left Behind’-- to assess the condition of people with disabilities across the country. Out of 1,067 who were surveyed, 57% said they were facing an employment-related financial crisis, 13% spoke of challenges in accessing rations, while 9% were facing obstacles in access to health care and medical aid. Praveen Jindal, a resident of Vishwas Nagar in Delhi, who has a disability in one leg says that every month he faces threat of eviction from his house by his landlord. His only income right now, he says, is ₹2500 that he gets as disability pension from the government. Until the lockdown, he worked with an agency that collected credit card payments for a bank. “My landlord has raised my rent from ₹4,000 to 6, 000 a month, which I just cannot afford to pay. For a few months, I survived with support from family and friends. Eventually, I had to sell my two-wheeler to survive,” says Jindal. Top e-commerce companies, says Ramya Miryala, the director of Deaf Enabled Foundation, an organization which helps train and find placement for people with hearing impairment across the country, have been the only ray of hope in the otherwise grim employment scene. “At least 220 people out of 750 we trained and found employment before the pandemic lost their jobs . In the 11 years that we have been working for the deaf, we have never seen so many people lose their jobs. Thankfully, we were able to place some of them with e-commerce companies where they are into loading, unloading and packing-tagging,” says Miryala. “The hearing impaired succeed very well in jobs where they do not have to take instruction and work is visual, but our placement numbers have decreased by 50% last year,” says Ruma Roka, founder Noida Deaf Society. AS Narayanan, president , National Association of the Deaf (NAD), says it will be difficult for a deaf to regain their jobs as a majority of them worked in the hospitality sector which was hit hard by the pandemic. “All the hotels are quite conscious of their social responsibility. The problem is they are working at reduced staff strength and are gradually calling back staff on a need basis, including people with disabilities, most of whom worked in spas, housekeeping and service departments. One needs to understand that many areas of hotels are still closed,” says KB Kachru, vice president, Hotel Association of India and chairman emeritus & principal advisor, South Asia, at Radisson Hotel Group. Arman Ali, whose organization is currently working with IIM (Bangalore) to understand the challenges and gaps in creating employment opportunities for the people with disabilities in the post-Covid world, however, sounds hopeful. “ The job scenario for people with disabilities will improve as new norms of work from home might eventually help them. In fact, people with disabilities have been demanding work from home and flexibility in work for years,” says Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/disabled-face-a-job-crisis-in-the-post-covid-world-101610364383989.html
11-01-2021||Other||Monday Musings: Everyone, except the locals, loves good spread of hyacinth||January is normally the season when Pune’s cultural calendar begins. It starts on high note with the Sawai Gandharva music festival, followed by the Pune international film festival and eventually, ends with Vasantostav, a programme named after late classical singer Vasantrao Deshpande. January is also the month when local newspapers, every year, report on hyacinth accumulated on the surface of several of the city’s water bodies. These aquatic weeds mask the water, reduce oxygen to marine life, and more importantly, become a breeding ground for mosquitos. The Covid pandemic has put a pause on cultural events this year, but the hyacinth has come up again. Be it the historically important Katraj lake or the three rivers – Mula, Mutha and Pavana - that flow through Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, the thick green cover is conspicuous by its presence. The rapid growth has often destroyed the ecology of these water bodies. And the presence has provided shelter to disease vectors and pests, a reason for complaints by locals, even as authorities have turned blind eye. Every year, the two municipal corporations of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad hand over contracts for removal of the hyacinth. In the process, crores of rupees are spent, and yet, no long-lasting solution has been found. Last year, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) was under the scanner for its tendering of a ₹23 crore plan for clearing the hyacinth from the Katraj and Pashan lakes. The tender was floated for a contract of five years when the hyacinth had already been removed by local corporators using their ward funds. Opposition members in the civic body alleged that tender was floated with an inflated cost - eight times higher than the provision made in the annual budget - leading to allegations. Eventually, after much uproar, the tender had to be scrapped and an inquiry was ordered by the then PMC commissioner Saurabh Rao, who is now divisional commissioner for Pune region. The inquiry did not bring out much and nobody knows what happened to the report. To spend ₹23 crore to remove hyacinth in two lakes, which are not more than half a kilometre in radius, each, is costlier than addressing the root cause. Rampant water pollution in upper and lower Katraj lake, built during the Peshwa era when it provided crucial source for water to city, has often provided a lease of life for weeds. The poor drainage line network in nearby areas has allowed polluted water to enter Katraj lake, which has seen hundreds of fish die, due to lack of oxygen, on multiple occasions in the past. Hyacinth prevents sunlight from reaching the waters, thus stopping generation of oxygen, which in turn kills all aquatic life forms. Due to the large amount of hyacinth, people residing in the surrounding areas have complained about contracting diseases like dengue and malaria. The story is not different for Pashan lake or the Mula, Mutha and Pavana rivers. However, instead of addressing the root cause – fixing drainage lines of nearby areas, which have seen rampant development due to availability of land at cheaper rates – PMC and PCMC (Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation) have allotted contracts worth crores of rupees to remove hyacinth, that will come up again next year. So what if environmental watchdogs such as the Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB) has served notices to PMC for not addressing the problem? For politicians and bureaucrats, fixing drainage lines would end the problem and put a full stop over allotment of contracts; something that will also halt money exchanging hands.Yogesh Joshi can be contacted at yogesh.joshi@htlive.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-everyone-except-the-locals-loves-good-spread-of-hyacinth-101610363845571.html

11-01-2021||Patna||Bihar GA to boycott assembly if budget session is curtailed, says Tejashwi Yadav||Leader of Opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday cautioned the government that any attempt to curtail the upcoming budget session would be opposed tooth and nail by the Rashtiya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Grand Alliance. He said that Grand Alliance leaders would boycott the assembly and gherao the residences of the chief minister and deputy chief minister.Yadav accused the government of running away from dealing with burning issues, claiming that this was the reason why there was talk of the budget session being curtailed. The Leader of the Opposition said he had expressed his opposition to the idea of a truncated budget session during his interaction with Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Sunday.Also Read: Umesh Kushwaha appointed as new Bihar chief of JDU“I have advised Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha that an all-party meeting should be called to decide the schedule of the budget session. The government is keen that budget be called early and truncated to four days which is totally unacceptable to us. If the House is not convened for the budget session that lasts over one-and-a-half months, we will boycott the session and also gherao the chief minister’s and deputy chief minister’s residence,” he said at a press conference.Earlier, he held a meeting with Grand Alliance leaders, including Congress state president Madan Mohan Jha, Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation state secretary Kunal and other allies. Yadav said the government’s argument that a vaccine for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) would be fully rolled out by March was only an assumption as no date had been fixed.“Even if the vaccine is rolled out fully by March, what is wrong if the budget session goes on ? It would rather help because MLAs would be able to get feedback as how the vaccination drive is going on in the state and what are the shortcomings. The officers would be under pressure to implement the drive with more alertness,”he said.Accusing the state government of doing little on the front of eradicating unemployment, implementation of state schemes and failing on the law and order front, Yadav said the very fact that the House sat for only four days last year was an indicator of how the government is shying away from discussing core issues related to common people. “In this new House, several MLAs are newcomers who have to learn about legislative business. If the House is truncated, how will they raise people’s issues and learn about legislative business? This is why we want the budget session to be conducted in a traditional manner,” he said.Human chain to protest against farm lawsSlamming the Central government for failing to resolve the protests over the farm laws, Yadav said the Grand Alliance was in full support of the farmers and would form a human chain in solidarity with them on January 30 across the state.“The farm laws are totally against the farmers and are an attempt to hand over the agriculture sector to private players. The Grand Alliance partners have decided to form a human chain on January 30 to show support to protesting farmers and withdrawal of the farm laws,” he said. He added the Central and state governments were totally insensitive towards the protesting farmers.Yadav also said the agriculture sector in Bihar had suffered big damage due to the Nitish Kumar government’s decision in 2006 to scrap agriculture marketing boards. “In Bihar, the migration and unemployment of farm labourers have increased drastically over the last 14 years because of the scrapping of marketing boards. The farm sector has completely been ruined and farmers are now forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices,” he said.On the reports of a rift between Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the RJD leader said the JD(U) is getting back what it had done to others. “JD(U) had betrayed us and now it is getting the same treatment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ga-to-boycott-assembly-if-budget-session-is-curtailed-says-tejashwi-yadav-101610361066690.html

11-01-2021||Chandigarh||Hry CM calls off meet after protesters vandalise venue||Farmers protesting against three central farm laws ransacked the venue of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s Kisan Mahapanchayat, in Karnal’s Kaimla village on Sunday, forcing the CM to cancel his programme. The protesters also clashed with the police personnel, participants of the event and villagers.Khattar’s Kisan Mahapanchayat was aimed to drum up support for the three contentious agriculture laws that have triggered widespread protests in North India, particulary at the borders of the national capital, where farmers have been protesting since November-end.Ahead of the programme, the police blocked all the roads leading to the village but protesters managed to reach the venue and broke chairs, tore banners and damaged the helipad where the CM's helicopter was supposed to land. The police used water cannons and lobbed teargas shells to prevent farmers from marching towards the village.According to eyewitnesses, a clash first broke out between the farmers and police personnel when they were marching towards the helipad.The villagers in favour of the panchayat also tried to stop the protesters. However, the protesters outnumbered the police and the pro-Kisan panchayat organisers and ransacked the venue.The CM returned to Chandigarh without addressing the gathering.Karnal superintendent of police, Ganga Ram Punia said “Three farmers have been arrested under preventive measures and they will be produced in the court on Monday.” He said, so far, 71 farmers have been booked under various sections of IPC for rioting and assault on public servants.Describing ransacking of the venue in Karnal as an act of “betrayal by the farm union leaders”, Khattar accused Bharat Kisan Union (BKU) state leader, Gurnam Singh Charuni responsible for the vandalism. Notably, on January 6, the BKU(Charuni) had threatened that they would oppose the ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ event.“Vishwasghat kiya gaya unke dwara (This is an act of betrayal by farm union leaders). The leaders of the agitating farmer unions had assured the administration on Saturday that they will hold symbolic protest... but they did not keep the promise,” the chief minister said.In a video message, BKU (Charuni) president, Gurnam Singh Charuni took the responsibility of the incident in Kaimla village and said, “Yes we have done this because the BJP wad holding parallel programmes to weaken our agitation. The BJP has announced to hold 700 rallies in favour of three contentious laws and we will oppose all such meetings”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hry-cm-calls-off-meet-after-protesters-vandalise-venue-101610326476319.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Anxious wait for test results as count of dead birds in Capital climbs to 140||More than 140 birds, mostly crows, have been found dead across locations in Delhi over the past four days, with the state government declaring the Sanjay Lake area an “alert zone” after 17 more ducks were found dead on Sunday, even as district officials were directed to ensure that unauthorised wholesale poultry markets remained closed for 10 days amid concerns of the spread of avian influenza.The move came a day after the Delhi government announced the closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the import of live birds in the Capital as a preventive measure to stop the potential spread of bird flu.The dead birds — recorded till Sunday afternoon — have been found in groups ranging between two to 17 in places that include the green area around Sanjay Lake, Hastsal Park, Golden Jubilee Park, an area near the Red Fort and several other parks in Mayur Vihar, Yojana Vihar, Preet Vihar’s sectors 5 and 9 in Dwarka, Dilshad Garden and Ashok Niketan, a senior government official said.“So far, more than 140 dead birds have been found across several locations in the city – of which 27 are ducks and the rest are crows,” the official said on condition of anonymity.He said samples of 115 birds — which include samples taken from both dead birds and live birds – have so far been sent for testing from Delhi. The first set of results is scheduled to arrive on Monday, the official added.A helpline set up by the Delhi government received 120 bird death-related calls in three days, said the official quoted above, adding that only instances in which two or more birds were found dead in a location at a time were added in the total figure and eventually considered for sampling. “For a group of birds found dead in one location, samples would often be collected from a few,” said the official.Another senior government official said district officials have been directed to make sure unauthorised wholesale poultry markets in their areas are shut for the next 10 days. “District officials have been asked to ensure closure of unauthorised poultry markets as a preventive step against the possible spread of bird flu,” the official added.Delhi has a daily demand of about 350,000 poultry birds, of which around 250,000 are supplied from Ghazipur market, said a government official. The remaining comes from unauthorised poultry markets scattered across the city, the official added.The green area of Sanjay Lake, which is popular among joggers in east Delhi localities, has been declared an “alert zone” by the government’s animal husbandry department. Access to the area – which has a concrete boundary wall – is prohibited and it is being periodically sanitised, said the first official quoted above.“Sanjay Lake was declared an alert zone with an increase in the number of dead ducks from 10 to 27. The rapid response team of the animal husbandry department visited the site today again,” said a senior official of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) – the agency that maintains the lake and the area around it. “The dead birds have been buried deep in the ground on the instruction of experts,” the official said.Dr Rakesh Singh, the director of Delhi’s animal husbandry department said, “In Delhi, it has so far been only crows and ducks. We are closely monitoring the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/anxious-wait-for-test-results-as-count-of-dead-birds-in-capital-climbs-to-140-101610325174173.html

11-01-2021||Delhi||AAP holds 450 mohalla sabhas to highlight corruption in MCDs||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday organised public gatherings in 450 locations across the city, highlighting alleged corruption in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD).“Today, the AAP organised 450 Mohalla Sabhas in 65 assembly constituencies. They were collectively attended by around 45,000 people… Enthusiasm and spontaneity of the people in Mohalla Sabhas prove that they are tired of corruption in the BJP-led MCDs. They have decided to throw the BJP out of power… People have realised that the MCDs have enough resources but the corrupt BJP has no will to run the MCDs,” said the AAP in a statement.The AAP had announced on Monday that it will hold 2,500 mohalla sabhas (public meetings) across Delhi between January 7 and 15 to highlight the alleged rampant corruption within the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations.Announcing the campaign on Monday, AAP leader MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak had said that through these meetings, the AAP will apprise the people of Delhi about the alleged “scams done by the BJP” during its tenure of 15 years in the civic bodies. He said the party has identified around 600 speakers who will address these mohalla sabhas. Pathak said members such as AAP MLAs, councillors, district in-charges, Lok Sabha in-charges, sangathan mantris and ward in-charges have been trained by the party to communicate with people during these public gatherings.Both the AAP and the BJP have intensified their outreach ahead of the municipal elections scheduled to be held next year. While the AAP has been targeting the BJP over rampant corruption and poor financial health of the three municipal corporations, the BJP had claimed that the AAP government in Delhi has denied funds to the MCDs leading to financial crunch.The BJP dismissed the allegations of corruption as “baseless”.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. All these numbers about the size of gatherings are just lies. People of Delhi will not forgive the AAP for stopping funds of the MCDs which led to strikes by sanitation workers and other staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-holds-450-mohalla-sabhas-to-highlight-corruption-in-mcds-101610310951960.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Obscene posts in class WhatsApp group may lead to FIR against parents: North MCD||New Delhi: After receiving complaints from several schools about obscene messages being posted and inappropriate videos and pictures being circulated on WhatsApp groups created to share online study material with students, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation warned parents of legal action if found responsible for any such activity.The warning was issued after the north body’s education department received a complaint from a school in the Narela zone.In an order issued on January 5 and addressed to all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, principals, and zonal education officers, the department said, “A complaint has been received from Narela Zone about posting of pornographic content by a parent in a class’ WhatsApp groups. It is a serious matter, and all parents and guardians must be warned to not use any irrelevant content in the WhatsApp groups of classes created for the purpose of online classes and must be directed to take more precautions to avoid any legal action.”“In case of any repetition, FIR must be lodged against the erring person without any delay,” it added.An official at the north civic body said, “The order was issued after receiving similar complaints from several schools. No one can harass teachers in this manner. The young students in the group will also read the messages, which can possibly create an unfavourable impact.”To be sure, officials said it was not immediately clear whether these messages were sent by parents, students, or a third party. However, these messages were received from the official registered mobile number, which is why parents were warned, officials of the civic body said.The principal of a civic body-run school in Jahangirpuri, requesting anonymity, said, “We had received an objectionable video clip in a class 5 WhatsApp group last month. The clip was sent from a student’s registered number. We summoned the students’ parents, but they denied sending the message. Our teachers regularly send messages on the groups requesting parents not to share anything on the group other than any queries related to online classes. Now, we have shared this order issued by the education department.”Ramnivas Solanki, general secretary of civic body teachers’ association, said, “A female teacher in our school had received an objectionable picture from a registered mobile number recently. When we summoned the parents, they claimed that a neighbour had sent the message. It’s good that the department has sent out such an official order in this regard. Principals will now directly file a police complaint in case anything like this happens.”North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said, “The corporation will take serious action against those found responsible for sending such obscene messages on WhatsApp groups meant for study material to be shared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/obscene-posts-in-class-whatsapp-group-may-lead-to-fir-against-parents-north-mcd-101610310093545.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||North MCD to create parking slots for 13000 cars||New Delhi: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation proposes to create space for parking nearly 13,000 cars across at least 20 sites, in a massive ramp up of the infrastructure in north Delhi areas where haphazard parking is one of the major reasons for congestion.North MCD officials say the plan, which was proposed in the civic body’s budget for 2021-22, will help bring in additional revenue for the civic body. The corporation is going through a financial crunch, forcing it to withhold salaries of its staff.According to the plan, the North corporation will build nearly 17 multilevel parking lots and three stack facilities across several areas under its jurisdiction. Currently, the North corporation runs 130 parking lots.The new multilevel parking lots are proposed to come up at 17 locations. These are Shivamarket in Pitampura (500 cars), Gandhi Maidan (2,338 cars), Qutub Road (174 cars), Sant Nagar in Rani Bagh (600 cars), Idgah Road (3150 cars), Shastri Park (577 cars), Rajendra Nagar (464 cars), U&V-block, Shalimar Bagh (288 cars), AC Block, Shalimar Bagh (350 cars), Bank Street in Karol Bagh (500 cars), Madipur (580 cars), Udyog Nagar (470 cars), Punjabi Bagh (324 cars), Nangloi (1000 cars), Mundka Metro Station (1,000 cars), RG Complex Paharganj (350 cars) and Pratap Nagar (250 cars).Stack parking lots for a total of 291 cars will come up at Nigambodh Ghat, Salim Garh near Hanuman Setu and Bagh Diwar at Fatehpuri.“Work on most of the major projects have started. At some places, construction has begun while some are in planning and tendering stage. Parking facilities at Nigambodh Ghat and Fatehpuri are likely to be opened in the beginning of next financial year while multilevel lots at Shivamarket in Pitampura, Qutub Road near Sadar and Gandhi Maidan near Chandni Chowk are likely to be made operational by the end of next year,” a senior official of the north corporation said on the condition of anonymity.He said that construction work on multilevel parking at Shivamarket, Qutub Road and Gandhi Maidan is already underway while bidding process for facilities at Sant Nagar in Rani Bagh, Shatri Park and Rajendra Nagar is likely to be started next week. Parking at Idgah Road and Mundka will be developed in collaboration with the Delhi Metro. He said that a memorandum of understanding has already been signed with the Delhi Metro for Idgah Road parking. The official further said that all the multilevel parking facilities will be at least six floors high, including basement.Officials said these parking spaces will also help in reducing traffic bottleneck in different areas.“Paharganj has featured on the traffic department’s list of most clogged areas. During our study we found out that the area is prone to traffic logjams because of haphazardly parked vehicles near RG Complex in Paharganj. We worked out a solution that a multilevel parking should be constructed to accommodate over 350 cars which spill over nearby roads. Approval from the House has been given for this project and we will soon start the process to acquire a piece of land from the DDA (Delhi Development Authority). The project will be completed in two years,” another official privy to the development, said.Jai Prakash, mayor, north corporation, said these remunerative projects will not only solve parking and traffic congestion problems but also help the civic body in generating revenue.He said the modalities of several of these projects are yet to be worked out but some of these are likely to be carried out on the basis of public private partnership.“All of these parking facilities will be made operational in next two to three years. This will help great deal in solving parking menace and traffic issues. We are also hoping to generate more annual revenue from such remunerative projects. We will also look for more new sites where multilevel, stack or surface parking sites can be developed,” Prakash said.KS Mehra, former commissioner of the unified MDD, said these are much needed initiatives and such projects will financially help the cash-strapped civic body.“This is the right approach as these projects will not only give a solution to the parking menace in congested areas like Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh but also help the municipality in augmenting their revenue collection. These projects can be developed on PPP mode and I suggest that the government should also support such initiatives,” he said.Mehra also suggested that the civic body should also implement dynamic parking charges — charge extra during peak hours near markets — not only to streamline parking problems but also to earn more revenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-mcd-to-create-parking-slots-for-13000-cars-101610309860393.html

11-01-2021||Bhopal||People in MP village go on digging spree in hope to find Mughal-era treasure||Scores of people are camping on the bank of dry Parbati river in Madhya Pradesh's Rajgarh district, 141 kilometres north of Bhopal, for the past three days to dig the riverbed in hope to find treasure dating back to the Mughal period.After a section of people found ancient coins on the bank of river in Shivpura village a few days ago, some people spread a rumour of the presence of Mughal-era treasure in the river. With the spread of the rumour, a large number of people from Rajgarh, Guna and Sehore districts gathered in the village for a treasure hunt, said an officer of local administration.Heavy gathering of people led to the deployment of police and district administrative officers to keep a vigil on the situation and maintain law and order.Rajgarh superintendent of police Pradeep Sharma said, “We are taking care of the law and order situation in the area with ensuring the safety of people. We are telling them not to believe in rumours.”"People of different age groups are digging at different places of the river bank to test their luck as we came to know that these coins have value of lakhs of rupees," said Ranu Yadav, 18, who is a local.“We are trying our luck 24x7 and we are sure that we will get the coins,” said Ramnaresh Singh, 37, a resident of Ahmedpur, Sehore.Also read: PM Modi to meet chief ministers on Monday over Covid-19 vaccine rolloutThe district administration is also investigating the matter.Rajgarh collector Neeraj Kumar Singh said, “A few days ago, some people found some ancient coins on the bank of river of the district. Later, a rumour spread in the area about hidden treasure.”“We have asked the archaeology department about the importance and the era of the coins. We also checked with jewellers to evaluate the value of the coins but they informed that coins are made of bronze and iron and don't have any value.”“We are spreading awareness to make people understand that these coins have no value but people are not paying any attention to our request,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/people-in-mp-village-go-on-a-digging-spree-in-hope-to-find-mughal-era-treasure-101610304625713.html

Our next target is to bring Asian tour event to Chandigarh. If we are able to pull it off, it will be a big boost for golf in the region,” said Ravibir Singh Grewal, 55, the club’s new president.On Sunday, the CGC general house formally ratified the unanimous election of Grewal and 11-member governing council for its one-year tenure. This is Grewal’ s second term at the helm of the region’s premier golf center. He had also served as the acting president in 2016-17 after the demise of the then incumbent president, IPS Mann. An avid golfer and an alumnus of Doon School, Grewal comes from an illustrious family - he is the grandson of former Punjab chief minister Justice Gurnam Singh.After the lockdown, when professional golf circuit was resumed in the country in the first week of November, Chandigarh Golf Club (CGC) hosted two events — ₹40-lakh TATA Steel PGTI Players Championships and ₹1.5-crore Jeev Milkha Singh Invitational Tournament — of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI). In fact, CGC was the only club in the country to host two professional prize money tournaments in the 2020 season. ‘Brought back professional golf to CGC’ During his previous tenure as president in 2017-18, Grewal,55, was credited for bringing back professional golf tournaments to CGC after a gap of four years .

Professional golf organsiers endorse Grewal’s ‘mission statement’. “As far as golfing facilities and standard of the course are concerned, Chandigarh Golf Course meets the mark for hosting the event. Moreover, Chandigarh as a city easily meets the hospitality and logistics requirements. The only challenge is sponsorship for the event,” said Uttam Singh Mundy, CEO, PGTI. No election this yearSince the annual elections of CGC, due in April last, couldn’t be held due to Covid-19 pandemic, the term of incumbent executive committee led by president Bobby Sandhu got extended till January this year.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to inaugurate the tunnelling work that will be conducted in the 3-kilometre-long stretch between Chowpatty and Priyadarshini Park.For the next 18 months, about 100 workers will drill day and night daily to complete the tunnelling by June 2022. The entire coastal road is expected to get ready by mid-2023. The 9-kilometre-long stretch of the coastal road is being constructed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).The overall tunnelling work is expected to take 18 months. The BMC has set a deadline of June 2022 for the completion of the tunnelling work. There will be tunnels for both up towards south Mumbai and down towards Worli end. Boring work for each tunnel will take around nine months.The tunnel boring machine (TBM), which is said to be the largest in India, and named 'Mavala' will be used to create a 3.45-kilometre twin undersea tunnel from Priyadarshini Park to Girgaum Chowpatty. Currently, the BMC has completed the assembling of the parts of the TBM, that it had purchased from China last year, at the worksite at Priyadarshini Park in Malabar Hill. The machine had arrived in April last year and was taken to the site in many dismantled parts on 17 trailer trucks.Also read: PM Modi to meet chief ministers on Monday over Covid-19 vaccine rolloutThe tunnelling work has been much delayed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic which initially delayed the delivery of the TBM from China and. Also, the BMC had to tweak its plan for not using Chinese experts for the assembling of the TBM in the backdrop of border tensions between India and China.According to the plan, the TBM that will start boring from Monday will be used to drill the 3.4-kilometre-long twin tunnels partially running under the sea, between Girgaum and Malabar Hill, as part of the 9.98-kilometre-long Coastal Road between Priyadarshini Park, and the Worli end of the Bandra Worli Sea Link.It will operate 25 metres below the surface at Girgaum and 75 metres below the surface at Malabar Hill. The width of each tunnel will be 12 metres, with two lanes – each 3-3.2 metres wide – and one emergency lane. The BMC claims to have completed over 20 per cent of the work for the Coastal Road Project and has set a deadline of July 2023 to complete the entire project.Vijay Nighot, chief engineer, BMC's Coastal Road Project, said, "At any given time, there will be a total 100 workers including technical persons, skilled and unskilled labour working for the tunnelling to undertake using the TBM. The tunnelling work will be done on all days for 24 hours. The aim is to timely complete the project."Municipal commissioner of the BMC, Iqbal Singh Chahal said, "This is the largest diameter TBM (12.1 metres) till date in our country and we plan to complete two tunnels fully in 9 months each. Considering this timeline, the overall tunnelling would be completed by June 2022. This project will ease traffic movement in Mumbai from Nariman Point to Bandra."Post-construction of Coastal Road, motorists will be able to reach Worli from Nariman Point within minutes.However, beyond this towards the western suburbs, the state government is yet to take a call on the construction of a sea link or a coastal road beyond Versova. Initially, a decade ago, Coastal Road Project project was planned between Nariman Point and Kandivali claiming it will ease traffic for those travelling between north and south Mumbai. However, now there is a question whether there should be a Coastal Road or a Sea-Link beyond Versova to connect the suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tunnelling-for-mumbai-s-coastal-road-set-to-begin-100-workers-to-drill-24x7-101610304343718.html

The woman had fought back and also managed to snatch the phone of one of the alleged attackers, which helped Dombivli’s Vishnu Nagar police to nab the accused in 24 hours. According to police officers, the incident happened on Friday evening, when Ashok Gori, 61, a retired bank employee officer, was alone at his Vishnu Nagar home. His daughter and wife had been out. Gori’s wife had left the door open so that he did not have to get up and open the door in case there were visitors. “Four attackers entered the house but Gori didn’t realise it as he was sitting near the window and his back was towards the door. The accused tied his hands and mouth and tried to rob valuables. When Gori’s daughter Pratiksha entered the house, she saw her father tied up and two of the accused tried to nab her. The woman managed to rush to the neighbours and attack them but the attackers pulled her and tied her mouth with cloth. However, by then her neighbours had gathered at Gori’s door, forcing the accused to flee from the house. The woman managed to snatch one of their phones and later handed it over to the police.” Through the number, the accused was traced and arrested three accused – Dinesh Rawal, Chetan Makwana and Abdul Shaikh.

11-01-2021||Delhi||Bird flu fears: As demand falls, cost of eggs set to tumble in Delhi||As fears of the emergence of avian influenza grip the national capital, traders on Sunday said the prices of eggs were set to tumble, while those of mutton would likely increase.In Delhi, the state government has shut the wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur for 10 days and prohibited the arrival of live birds from other states, starting Sunday, as a preventive measure against potential spread of the bird flu, which has been confirmed in seven states so far. These include Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.To be sure, no confirmed case has been recorded in Delhi as of Sunday evening.“The demand for eggs has already gone down over the last four days, after news about the emergence of bird flu [in other states]. Crates of 30 eggs that were selling for ₹140 around four days ago, are now selling for ₹120. The rates can further go down this week if demand does not pick up,” said Rashid Alam, a trader based in Delhi’s Seelampur.As on Sunday, prominent retail supermarkets in the city sold crates for between ₹180 – 200, compared to ₹210 – 220 last week.While the Ghazipur wholesale market has been closed, there is no restriction on sale of chicken by retailers from their existing stock. Chicken currently sales for around ₹160 – 200 per kilogram in Delhi.The government has not, so far, imposed any restrictions on the trade of eggs.“We saw this happening in 2006 when bird flu was reported across several countries, and in 2016 when it was last reported in Delhi. It is about to happen once again. Even though there is no recorded instance of people getting the flu through cooked chicken or eggs, there is large-scale fear. The demand for eggs falls every time there is such a scare about bird flu, even if it is based on rumours,” said Iqbal Qureshi, vice-chairperson of Ghazipur wholesale poultry market.Each time there has been a bird flu scare, Delhi has seen a significant shift in consumption from poultry to mutton and, a concurrent spike in the cost of the latter. Several traders who HT spoke to on Sunday recalled how rumours about poultry contributing to transmission of Covid-19 had hit the market in mid-2020, and the retail price of mutton had touched ₹1,100 a kilo in several locations across the city.Mutton currently costs anything between ₹530 to ₹580 per kilo in most retail stores across Delhi. “However, the shift from chicken to mutton has already started happening. In the last seven days, demand for mutton has gone up and the price will increase in no time because supply is a problem,” said Shamim Qureshi, a Delhi-based mutton trader.For poultry and meat consumption, Delhi needs around 350,000 birds, two million eggs and 10,000 goats per day, said traders. The Capital’s main sources of poultry and meat are Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“Goat slaughter is a difficult affair, compared to poultry. Ghazipur has an organised system, but it only accounts for half of the city’s mutton supply. There are several slaughterhouses, mostly illegal, scattered across the city which account for the other half. Space and hygiene are major issues. So, supply of mutton usually fails to cater to an abrupt rise in demand, for which price witnesses sharp increase,” said Shamim Qureshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-fears-as-demand-falls-cost-of-eggs-set-to-tumble-in-delhi-101610301990142.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Eye on municipal polls, BJP plans public outreach||Gearing up for the municipal polls scheduled next year, the Delhi BJP will start a public outreach programme from February to tell people about how the functioning the three civic bodies has been adversely affected due to alleged non-payment of dues by the AAP government in Delhi.During this one-and-a-half month programme, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta will be covering two assembly constituencies in a day where he, along with senior party leaders, will be meeting people from different walks of life.This outreach is planned at a time when the BJP and the AAP are at loggerheads over municipal funds. While the BJP has been claiming that the Delhi government owes the corporations ₹13,000 crore (approx.), the AAP is campaigning against the BJP alleging a ₹2,500 crore scam in the functioning of North Delhi Municipal Corporation. The AAP is holding mohalla sabhas since January 7 till January 15 to highlight the alleged scams by the BJP-led corporations.Gupta said, “It is important to tell people about how the AAP government has failed people of Delhi on multiple counts. The government has made it impossible for the three civic bodies to function, as it is yet to release ₹13,000 crore. The corporations are unable to pay salaries to its employees, as they don’t have adequate funds. We will also highlight the failures of the Delhi government. I will be meeting various group of people where we will also discuss about the work done by the central government. We will start this outreach programme from February.”The BJP is eyeing a fourth consecutive term in the civic bodies, elections for which are due in March-April next year. In 2017, the party had won 181 out of 270 wards spread across three civic bodies despite anti-incumbency.The BJP has decided to start its preparations much in advance. Giving details of the outreach programme, a Delhi BJP spokesperson said, “We will cover two assembly constituencies in a day. In each constituency, we will meet people from different sections of society. A team in each constituency will soon be formed which will plan meetings with resident welfare associations, professionals, traders, etc. We will also cover slums and unauthorised colonies.”AAP senior leader and in-charge of municipal corporation issues Durgesh Pathak said,”The BJP is in power in the municipal corporations for the last 15 years and they have done so much corruption that today the corporations have no money to pay the salaries to their employees. On one hand the poor employees of the BJP-ruled corporations are starving and on the other hand, the BJP councillors are becoming richer.”He added, “In the last 15 years, the BJP has transformed the MCDs into a den of corruption. The BJP has only gifted three huge landfills to the citizens of Delhi. If you go anywhere in Delhi you will see heaps of garbage, and during monsoon Delhi faces waterlogging because the BJP-ruled MCDs neither clean the capital nor the drains of the city.”Pathak added, “There is a scam of ₹2,500 crores in the MCDs, which is the biggest scams in the history of Delhi. This scam is bigger than the Commonwealth Games scam. To divert the attention of the citizens of Delhi from these massive scams, the BJP-ruled MCD has come up with such fabricated allegations against the Aam Aadmi Party government. To build a house in Delhi, owners need to pay bribes to the MCD. The MCD councillors take money on per lintel basis to build any new house in Delhi from the owners.”He added, “The Aam Aadmi Party believes that the BJP has no moral right to continue ruling the MCD. The Aam Aadmi Party demands that the BJP should immediately resign from the MCD and hold fresh elections. The Aam Aadmi Party believes that the citizens of Delhi have made up their mind to throw BJP out of the power in the MCD.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/eye-on-municipal-polls-bjp-plans-public-outreach-101610301930806.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi records its lowest Covid positivity rate||The national capital on Sunday recorded a Covid-19 test positivity rate of 0.51%, the lowest since the Delhi government started releasing testing data in April last year.The Capital added 399 new infections according to Sunday’s health bulletin, which reflects data primarily from the previous day. These infections came on the back of 77,600 tests, a majority of which used the more reliable reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method.Experts regard test positivity rate as a vital metric to judge the spread of an infection. The World Health Organization recommends a number below 5% for two weeks for an infection to be considered under control.The positivity rate in the Capital has been below 5% for 39 days now, since the third wave of the infection — the most severe so far — subsided in the Capital. Further, the city has also added less than 1,000 cases of the infection, which has claimed 10,678 lives so far, for 17 consecutive days.The seven-day case average as on Sunday was the lowest in the city since mid-May. In the seven days ending December 10, Delhi added an average of 475 cases of the infection, compared to a peak of 7,341 cases a day in the week ending November 14, when the city was in the throes of the third wave of infections.While experts said the precise causes for this sharp drop were unclear, some said it may have to do with immunity built up over time.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “Immunity to this infection lasts at least for five or six months, which may be one of the reasons for the drop.”According to the health bulletin on Sunday, Delhi added 12 more fatalities of the infection. Over the past seven days, Delhi recorded an average of 13 deaths due to Covid-19, a sharp fall from the average of 116 daily deaths during the third week of November.Kant, however, warned residents of the city against letting their guard down. “One thing is clear — whenever there has been a peak, it has been followed by a trough. So, since the vaccine is on the anvil, we should take advantage of this decline in cases by immunising as many people as possible.”State health minister Satyendar Jain said, “The Covid-19 situation in Delhi has improved a lot and is now under control”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-records-its-lowest-covid-positivity-rate-101610301929734.html
11-01-2021||Delhi||Singhu farmers put up new signage, rename protest areas||Farmers protesting at Singhu border on Sunday installed a green signage near the main stage designating new names for different areas in a radius of several kilometres on the Kundli Highway. According to organisers, the signage has been installed to remember freedom fighters of our country and is a symbol of the cultural movement at Singhu border.The over ten kilometre-long protest spot has been divided into seven areas and has been named after freedom fighters like Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad, Kartar Singh Sarabha, along with Sikh warrior Banda Singh Bahadur.For instance, the area from the main stage to Kessel Grand mall – one of the most crowded stretches – has been renamed as Banda Singh Bahadur Nagar, after the 17th century Sikh warrior. The stretch from Kessel Mall to HP Petrol Pump has been renamed as Sardar Bhagat Singh Nagar.The signage is among the many elements installed in the past 46 days by farmers, who have transformed the Kundli highway into a town having its own makeshift hospital, mall, library, gurdwara, and gym, among other facilities.Jagjit Singh, 20, a Nihang Sikh from Chamkaur Sahib in Punjab, who was present when the signage was installed early on Sunday, said, “We have been at the Singhu border for over a month now. Until the farm laws are repealed, the area will be a home for protesting farmers and it is our colony. This is why we decided to name the area in the memory of our leaders.”The green signage was suspended from the shed of the main stage area on early Sunday morning. Harinder Singh, media coordinator of the Samyukt Kisaan Morcha – an umbrella organization of over 40 farmer groups — said installing the signage was a symbolic gesture. “The ongoing agitation is not just a farmers’ protest, but also a cultural movement. We need to remember the legacy of our freedom fighters and leaders, which is why their names have been given to different key points across the highway.”Jaspreet Kaur, 32, a resident of Ludhiana, who joined the protest last week, said, “We have a Sarabha Nagar market in our city as well. It is nice to see that the names of our leaders are being included at this historic protest in Delhi as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/singhu-farmers-put-up-new-signage-rename-protest-areas-101610301870044.html
11-01-2021||Other||A day after another farmer suicide during stir, protesters set focus on mental health||A day after another farmer died by suicide at Singhu border, several internal committee members of an umbrella body of farmers’ union on Sunday said they have planned to rope in mental health experts along with celebrities, religious leaders, and motivational speakers to spread messages of hope among farmers and steer them away from depression.Harinder Singh, media coordinator of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which is the umbrella body of farmers’ unions, said they have been talking about these initiatives since the beginning of the protests. “Six farmers have died by suicide since protests started, including two farmers who went back to their homes and took their own lives. We understand the need of doing something to address the problem. We also need to ensure that these deaths do not become a public spectacle or get glorified in any way.”Singh, a PhD student from Rajasthan, said they were now planning to address the issue in two ways. “In addition to asking celebrities, religious leaders, and farm leaders to motivate farmers and share these videos on social media, we also plan to share positive stories with the farmers of people coming in to support our agitation from across the country. We plan to share these stories on the main stage for at least an hour everyday,” he said.The committee members also plan to form groups and personally visit tractor-trolleys and talk to farmers to help them. “We will ask the youth to connect with the elderly and see if they need any assistance, or tell us if they are anxious or depressed. These farmers could be referred to therapists and counsellors at medical camps on the protest site. We are still in talks with several organisations to see how many therapists, psychiatrists, and counsellors can be arranged for the protest spots,” Singh said.On Sunday, Darshan Pal, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union Punjab, issued an appeal to protesting farmers asking them not to “contemplate any extreme action like taking your own life.”“This is a strong movement with all of you being there. The government has to accept the demands sooner or later. Stay alive, stay safe. Many activities will be organised by the Kisan Morcha in the coming time to prevent such incidents,” he said in his statement.Volunteers working at the spot said farmers have been agitated and stressed over a variety of reasons, including no resolution over the farm laws, death of their fellow farmers, the cold weather, trying conditions, and staying away from the family. Sanya Kataria, 26, a clinical psychologist pursuing a doctorate degree from Amity University, said she sees around 10 farmers everyday since January 4 at the counselling camp set up by the United Sikhs NGO.“Though the environment is a challenge since there is little privacy and constant disruptions, we have been working with the farmers and sharing the basics of psychoeducation, depression, and anxiety with them,” she said.Virender Singh, 42, a farmer from Mandiala village in Jalandhar said, “My friends and I keep ourselves busy throughout the day through seva at langars or by cleaning the roads so that we don’t think any negative thoughts. We are sad for the families of those farmers who died by suicide but this is the way out. We have to fight for our rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-day-after-another-farmer-suicide-during-stir-protesters-set-focus-on-mental-health-101610301869618.html

The by-poll to the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat was necessitated after the sudden death of Union minister Suresh Angadi due to Covid-19.After landing in Bengaluru, Yediyurappa told media that about seven members would be inducted in the cabinet "with the oath-taking ceremony likely to take place on the afternoon of January 13."The Maski assembly seat by-poll became due because Pratap Gowda Patil who was elected on a Congress ticket and chose to cross over to the BJP. The Basava Kalyan seat became vacant after the incumbent Congress MLA, B Narayan Rao, died due to Covid-related complications.Also read: 'Despite internal problems with alliance partner...' - Manjhi salutes NitishYediyurappa, who has made several trips to the capital for ensuring clearance for a cabinet expansion, sounded upbeat about its prospects, saying that "this was the last meeting for that (issue). We had a detailed discussion. You will all hear the sweet news shortly."Asked whether it was cabinet expansion or there would be a reshuffle also, he said, "Please wait and see, all (issues) will be resolved shortly."Asked whether he would continue to remain the CM for the remaining two and half year term, Yediyurappa ducked the question telling the media, "you should tell me that." According to a person privy to the meeting, “Shah appreciated the BJP’s performance in the gram panchayat polls where BJP-backed candidates doubled their numbers and for winning two assembly seats in the by-elections in Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar constituency”.On whether the CM will initiate the process of expanding the cabinet following Sunday’s meeting with the party brass, a second functionary said the CM had “many issues to discuss”.The cabinet expansion in the state has been on the cards for over a year now.The first functionary said the meeting will also put to rest the speculation that the party unit is still bickering. “There is no substance in the claims that the CM will be replaced. He has been a consistent performer and has delivered,” the functionary said. The second leader added that the central leadership will revert on the issue of cabinet expansion by Monday evening.AH Vishwanath, MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar - three legislators who quit their MLA posts to help the BJP topple the Congress-JDS coalition government - are demanding that "their sacrifices be recognised and rewarded with a cabinet berth as promised."Also read: Why is Indonesia prone to plane crashesWhile Nagaraju and Vishwanath contested on a BJP ticket and lost in by-polls held in November 2019, both of them, along with Shankar, were sent to the Vidhana Parishat, the upper house. However, Karnataka HC has ruled that Vishwanath cannot be inducted as he was nominated in the literature category rather than being elected by legislators as Nagaraju and Shankar were.Also 'original' BJP legislators like Renukacharya, Umesh Katti, MP Kumaraswamy, GH Thippareddy, Poornima Srinivas and several others have publicly said that they should be inducted into the cabinet as they have been steadfastly loyal to the party.In the 224 member assembly, BJP has 119 members plus the support of three independents while the Congress has 67 and the JDS has 33 with two seats vacant. The maximum number of cabinet berths can be 34, including the chief minister.Currently there seven vacancies. Political analyst Aravind said that Yediyurappa might go in for a cabinet reshuffle along with an expansion and drop some of the non-performing ministers. "He would like to keep at least two vacancies empty so as to stave off any dissidence. But looks like finally, he has got the green signal from the party high command and he may go in for a mix of party veterans plus rewarding MTB Nagaraju and R Shankar."The analyst added that the tricky challenge lay in identifying a candidate for the Belagavi LS seat especially as Anagadi's family is demanding it for one of its members, something the party was unlikely to agree. "Also Yediyurappa's second son, the ambitious Vijayendra, has been eyeing the Basava Kalyan seat and therefore it would be interesting to see who gets that ticket," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-meets-shah-and-nadda-promises-sweet-news-on-cabinet-expansion-101610290784845.html
11-01-2021||Jaipur||Youth suspected of killing mother, her live-in partner in Jaipur rural||A couple in a live-in relationship were allegedly shot dead in Jaipur rural area on Saturday morning. Rajasthan police suspects the duo was killed by the son of the murdered woman (40) as he was unhappy with his mother’s relationship with a married man (41) with five children.The killings took place in a house located in Shiv Colony near Kotputli town. Senior policemen including Jaipur rural superintendent of police (SP) Shankar Dutt Sharma, along with a dog squad and a forensics team, reached the spot soon after the incident.“Body of the couple with bullet shots on their head was recovered from a room of the house. We suspect that the 20-year-old son of the lady is behind the murder and we have formed teams to nab him,” said Sharma.The SP said the deceased woman was a native of Bhakri village of Pragpura town in Jaipur rural. Some 20-years ago, she got married to a man in Budhwal village of Mahendragarh district in Haryana. In 2009, she left her husband and started living with her two children including the absconding son and a daughter in Kotputli area.She came in contact with her partner, a native of Bansur town some years ago“Preliminary probe reveals that the son of the woman was angry with his mother's relationship. On Saturday, he shot his mother and her alleged lover. Further, he called his sister and said that somebody had shot the couple dead and asked her to inform the police and call an ambulance,” said Sharma.He added that after calling his sister, the suspect fled the spot and his mobile phone was switched-of.Family members of both the deceased have been informed and a case under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered.Statements of the neighbours, relatives and others are been taken while the technical cell is trying to trace the mobile location of the victim.The bodies have been handed over to the families after the post-mortems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/youth-suspected-of-killing-mother-her-live-in-partner-in-jaipur-rural-101610274165085.html
11-01-2021||World||Covid-19 latest updates: India vaccination drive from Jan 16, UK at worst point||While India is set to begin the “world’s largest vaccination drive” from January 16, Britain is ramping up its mass rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations despite which the next few weeks of the pandemic may be the worst yet, according to a top medical officer.Meanwhile, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE raised their Covid-19 vaccine production target for this year to two billion shots. The previous production target was 1.3 billion doses.Here are latest updates on the pandemic from around the world:India: The government has sent the much-delayed purchase order for 11 million coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses to Serum Institute of India (SII), according to people familiar with the development. With that, the movement of vaccine shipments is likely to begin either by late Monday night or early Tuesday morning to different states. The vaccination drive in the country will begin on January 16. In the first phase, around 30 million health and frontline workers will be given the vaccine.UK: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned his government may be forced to tighten the coronavirus lockdown if people fail to follow the rules. Any “complacency” about the pandemic is completely misplaced, Johnson said, even though an immunisation program is well under way and two million people have received shots so far.England’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty has warned the next few weeks of the pandemic will be the worst yet, with deaths and cases hitting record highs, putting the health service under huge pressure. This comes at a time when a new variant of the coronavirus has emerged in the UK, following which many countries have restricted travel to and from Britain.US: When asked when the US could achieve Covid-19 herd immunity, Moncef Slaoui, the White House head of the Warp Speed Operation Initiative, said “I hope in May or June.” Meanwhile, New York City is vaccinating at more than twice the national rate, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We are going to keep speeding that up further and further,” he said.China: A team of international experts from the WHO will arrive in China on January 14, Chinese authorities said on Monday. However, a health expert affiliated with the WHO said, expectations should be "very low" that WHO team tasked with investigating the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic will reach a conclusion from their trip to China this month.What WHO says about vaccination: As India launches the world's most ambitious vaccination drive against Covid-19, the country will encounter the formidable challenge of rapidly scaling up distribution of the vaccines to secure immunity for its entire population, two prominent Indian scientists at WHO have said. This daunting challenge is not only for India but also for all the governments across the globe as they start inoculating their populations to tackle the pandemic, noted Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist of WHO, and Dr Hamsadvani Kuganantham, consultant, WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-latest-updates-india-vaccination-drive-from-jan-16-uk-at-worst-point-101610387364038.html
11-01-2021||World||Democrats file motion to impeach Trump, to give Pence time to act||Democrats on Monday filed an article of impeachment against US President Donald Trump accusing him of “incitement of resurrection” for the storming of the Capitol. They also introduced a resolution calling upon Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump declaring him “unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office”.ALSO WATCH | ‘Worst President ever’: Arnold Schwarzenegger compares US Capitol mob to NazisA vote on the non-binding resolution, which Democrats had hoped to get on Monday, will be taken on Tuesday because Republicans blocked “unanimous consent”, a parliamentary procedure to speed up approval, without requiring a vote. It will give Pence 24 hours to oust Trump invoking the 25th Amendment.If the vice-president does not respond, Democrats plan to proceed to impeach the president in a vote possibly on Wednesday, making Trump the first president impeached twice.The four-page article of impeachment, moved by Representatives Jamie Raskin, Ted Lieu and David Cicilline alleges Trump engaged in high crimes and misdemeanours by “wilfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States” for the events that took place on January 6.The article says that shortly before congress convened a joint session to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory, Trump addressed supporters and “wilfully made false statements that encouraged — and foreseeably resulted in — imminent lawless action at the Capitol”.“Incited by President Trump, a mob unlawfully breached the Capitol, injured law enforcement personnel, menaced members of Congress and the vice-president, interfered with the joint sessions’ solemn constitutional duty to certify the election results and engaged in violent, deadly, destructive and seditious acts.”The article also detailed Trump’s efforts to overturn the election results and his appeal to Georgia election officials to “find” the votes he needed to make up the deficit by which he lost to Biden.“In all of this,” the motion said, “President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States, and its institutions of government. He threatened the integrity of democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of government. He, thereby, betrayed his trust as president, to the manifest injury of the of the United States.”The article further said that by such conduct, he has demonstrated that “he will remain a threat to national security, democracy and the constitution if allowed to remain in office.”In a Saturday letter to fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had said the resolution “calls on the vice-president to convene and mobilise the cabinet to activate the 25th Amendment to declare the president incapable of executing the duties of his office, after which the vice president would immediately exercise powers as acting president”.“We are calling on the vice-president to respond within 24 hours,” she had added. “Next, we will proceed with bringing impeachment legislation to the floor.”Pence is said to be reluctant to the removal of the president through the use of either the 25th Amendment or impeachment, fearing that it could push Trump, known for his unpredictability, to act rashly. But he has retained the option of invoking the 25th if Trump “become more unstable”, according to reports citing sources close to him.The proposed resolution said, among other things, Trump “tweeted to his supporters that ‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country’ after the Capitol had been overrun and the Vice President was in hiding”.”President Trump’s isolation in the final 10 days of his presidency has been exacerbated by growing backlash from the private sector, which was his world before the presidency.Marriott hotel chain has cut off donations to senators who tried to block the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s election. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J P Morgan Chase are reviewing their political donations after the Capitol riots. Citi has said it will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.First Lady Melania Trump, meanwhile, joined in condemning the riots triggered by her husband, saying she was “disappointed and disheartened”. She went on to condole the deaths of the two police officers as also the four men and women who were part of the mob that attacked the Capitol, all in the same sentence.US military, in the meantime, is reviewing the role played by a Psyops officer, Capt Emily Rainey, in the January 6 riot. She had led a group from North Carolina to the rally. She told the Associated Press she had participated in the rally as a private citizen and no one in her group broke the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-file-motion-to-impeach-trump-to-give-pence-time-to-act-101610386837321.html
11-01-2021||World||Who were they? Records reveal Trump fans who stormed Capitol||They came from across America, summoned by President Donald Trump to march on Washington in support of his false claim that the November election was stolen and to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden as the victor.“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted a week before Christmas. “Be there, will be wild!”The insurrectionist mob that showed up at the president’s behest and stormed the US Capitol was overwhelmingly made up of longtime Trump supporters, including Republican Party officials, GOP political donors, far-right militants, white supremacists, members of the military and adherents of the QAnon myth that the government is secretly controlled by a cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophile cannibals. Records show that some were heavily armed and included convicted criminals, such as a Florida man recently released from prison for attempted murder.The Associated Press reviewed social media posts, voter registrations, court files and other public records for more than 120 people either facing criminal charges related to the Jan. 6 unrest or who, going maskless amid the pandemic, were later identified through photographs and videos taken during the melee.The evidence gives lie to claims by right-wing pundits and Republican officials such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., that the violence was perpetrated by left-wing antifa thugs rather than supporters of the president.“If the reports are true,” Gaetz said on the House floor just hours after the attack, “some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters. They were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa.”Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters that investigators had seen “no indication” antifa activists were disguised as Trump supporters in Wednesday’s riot.The AP found that many of the rioters had taken to social media after the November election to retweet and parrot false claims by Trump that the vote had been stolen in a vast international conspiracy. Several had openly threatened violence against Democrats and Republicans they considered insufficiently loyal to the president. During the riot, some livestreamed and posted photos of themselves at the Capitol. Afterwards, many bragged about what they had done.As the mob smashed through doors and windows to invade the Capitol, a loud chant went up calling for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence, the recent target of a Trump Twitter tirade for not subverting the Constitution and overturning the legitimate vote tally. Outside, a wooden scaffold had been erected on the National Mall, a rope noose dangling at the ready.So far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Among them was Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 70, an Alabama grandfather who drove to Washington to attend Trump’s “Save America Rally” in a red GMC Sierra pickup packed with an M4 assault rifle, multiple loaded magazines, three handguns and 11 Mason jars filled with homemade napalm, according to court filings.The truck was found during a security sweep involving explosives-sniffing dogs after two pipe bombs were found and disarmed Wednesday near the national headquarters of the Republican and Democratic parties. Coffman was arrested that evening when he returned to the truck carrying a 9mm Smith & Wesson handgun and a .22-caliber derringer pistol in his pockets. Federal officials said Coffman is not suspected of planting the pipe bombs, though he was charged with having Molotov cocktails in the bed of his truck.His grandson, Brandon Coffman, told the AP on Friday his grandfather was a Republican who had expressed admiration for Trump at holiday gatherings. He said he had no idea why Coffman would show up in the nation’s capital armed for civil war.Also facing federal charges is Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr., a Georgia man who in the wake of the election had protested outside the home of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, whom Trump had publicly blamed for his loss in the state. Meredith drove to Washington last week for the “Save America” rally but arrived late because of a problem with the lights on his trailer, according to court filings that include expletive-laden texts.“Headed to DC with a (s—-) ton of 5.56 armor-piercing ammo,” he texted friends and relatives on Jan. 6, adding a purple devil emoji, according to court filings. The following day, he texted to the group: “Thinking about heading over to Pelosi (C——'s) speech and putting a bullet in her noggin on Live TV.” He once again added a purple devil emoji, and wrote he might hit her with his truck instead. “I’m gonna run that (C—-) Pelosi over while she chews on her gums. … Dead (B——) Walking. I predict that within 12 days, many in our country will die.”Meredith, who is white, then texted a photo of himself in blackface. “I’m gonna walk around DC FKG with people by yelling ‘Allahu ak Bar’ randomly.”A participant in the text exchange provided screenshots to the FBI, who tracked Meredith to a Holiday Inn a short walk from the Capitol. They found a compact Tavor X95 assault rifle, a 9mm Glock 19 handgun and about 100 rounds of ammunition, according to court filings. The agents also seized a stash of THC edibles and a vial of injectable testosterone.Meredith is charged with transmitting a threat, as well as felony counts for possession of firearms and ammunition.Michael Thomas Curzio was arrested in relation to the riots less than two years after he was released from a Florida prison in 2019 after serving an eight-year sentence for attempted murder. Court records from Florida show that he shot the boyfriend of his former girlfriend in a fight at her home.Federal law enforcement officials vowed Friday to bring additional charges against those who carried out the attack on the Capitol, launching a nationwide manhunt for dozens of suspects identified from photographic evidenceThe FBI has opened a murder probe into the death of Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was hit in the head with a fire extinguisher, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly. He died at a hospital.The Trump supporters who died in the riot were Kevin D. Greeson, 55, of Athens, Alabama; Benjamin Philips, 50, of Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Ashli Babbitt, 35, of San Diego; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, of Kennesaw, Georgia.Boyland's sister told the AP on Friday she was an adherent of the QAnon conspiracy theory that holds Trump is America’s savior. Her Facebook page featured photos and videos praising Trump and promoting fantasies, including one theory that a shadowy group was using the coronavirus to steal elections. Boyland’s final post on Twitter — a retweet of a post by White House social media director Dan Scavino — was a picture of thousands of people surrounding the Washington Monument on Wednesday.“She would text me some things, and I would be like, ‘Let me fact-check that.’ And I’d sit there and I’d be like, ‘Well, I don’t think that’s actually right,’” Lonna Cave, Boyland’s sister, said. “We got in fights about it, arguments.”The AP's review found that QAnon beliefs were common among those who heeded Trump's call to come to Washington.Doug Jensen, 41, was arrested by the FBI on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, after returning home from the riot. An AP photographer captured images of him confronting Capitol Police officers outside of the Senate chamber on Wednesday.Jensen was wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with a large Q and the phrase “Trust The Plan,” a reference to QAnon. Video posted online during the storming of the Capitol also appears to show Jensen, who is white, pursuing a Black police officer up an interior flight of stairs as a mob of people trails several steps behind. At several points, the officer says “get back,” but to no avail.Jensen’s older brother, William Routh, told the AP on Saturday that Jensen believed that the person posting as Q was either Trump or someone very close to the president.“I feel like he had a lot of influence from the internet that confused or obscured his views on certain things,” said Routh, of Clarksville, Arkansas, who described himself as a Republican Trump supporter. “When I talked to him, he thought that maybe this was Trump telling him what to do.”Jensen’s employer, Forrest & Associate Masonry in Des Moines, announced Friday that he had been fired.Tara Coleman, a 40-year-old mother who lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was arrested at the Capitol for a curfew violation and for unlawful entry. On her Facebook page, Coleman re-posted articles supporting the QAnon beliefs about a “deep state” conspiracy to target children. The AP could not find a working phone number for Coleman and her attorney, Peter Cooper, did not respond to an email seeking comment.And Jake Chansley, who calls himself the “QAnon Shaman” and has long been a fixture at Trump rallies, surrendered to the FBI field office in Phoenix on Saturday. News photos show him at the riot shirtless, with his face painted and wearing a fur hat with horns, carrying a US flag attached to a wooden pole topped with a spear.Chansley’s unusual headwear is visible in a Nov. 7 AP photo at a rally of Trump supporters protesting election results outside of the Maricopa County election center in Phoenix. In that photo, Chansley, who also has gone by the last name Angeli, held a sign that read, “HOLD THE LINE PATRIOTS GOD WINS.” He also expressed his support for the president in an interview with the AP that day.The FBI identified Chansley by his distinctive tattoos, which include bricks circling his biceps in an apparent reference to Trump’s border wall. Chansley didn’t respond last week to messages seeking comment to one of his social media accounts.There were also current and former members of the US military in the crowd.Army commanders at Fort Bragg in North Carolina are investigating Capt. Emily Rainey’s involvement in the Wednesday rally. The 30-year-old psychological operations officer told the AP she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom who traveled to Washington to “stand against election fraud” and support Trump. She insisted she acted within Army regulations and that no one in her group entered the Capitol or broke the law.“I was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights,” Rainey told the AP.Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Larry Rendall Brock Jr. of Texas was charged in federal court on Sunday after he was identified in photos showing him standing in the well of the Senate, wearing a military-style helmet and body armor while holding a pair of zip-tie handcuffs.The insurrectionist mob also included members of the neofascist group known as the Proud Boys, whom Trump urged to “stand back and stand by” when asked to condemn them by a moderator during a presidential debate in September.Nicholas R. Ochs, 34, was arrested Saturday after returning home to Hawaii, where he is the founder of the local Proud Boys chapter. On Wednesday, Ochs posted a photo of himself on Twitter inside the Capitol, grinning broadly and smoking a cigarette. According to court filings, the FBI matched photos of Ochs taken during the riot to photos taken when Ochs campaigned unsuccessfully last year as the Republican nominee for a seat in the Hawaii statehouse.Proud Boys leader Henry “Enrique” Tarrio was arrested Monday in Washington on weapons charges and ordered to stay out of the nation’s capital. Tarrio is accused of vandalizing a Black Lives Matter banner at a historic Black church last month.Jay Robert Thaxton, 46, was arrested near the Capitol for curfew violations on Wednesday. A North Carolina man with the same name has also been linked to the Proud Boys. He told The Stanly News & Press in 2019 that he was a Proud Boys supporter but wouldn’t say if he was an official member of the group. Another North Carolina newspaper, The Jacksonville Daily News, published a photo of Thaxton wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat at a 2019 protest over the removal of Confederate statues.A man who answered a telephone number associated with Thaxton hung up on an AP reporter. The recipient of a text message to the same number responded with an expletive.Also arrested at the Capitol was William Arthur Leary, who owns a manufactured housing business in Utica, New York. In an interview Friday, Leary told the AP that he strongly believes the election was stolen from Trump and that he went to Washington to show his support.Leary said he doesn’t trust information reported by the mainstream media and that one of his main sources of information was Infowars, the far-right conspiracy site run by Alex Jones. He denied he ever set foot in the Capitol and complained that he was held for more than 24 hours and had his cell phone seized.“They treated us like animals,” he complained. “They took all our phones. I didn’t get to make a phone call to tell anybody where I was.”Leary said he remembers seeing a woman, Kristina Malimon, 28, sobbing at the detention center because she had been separated and not allowed to translate for her mother, who primarily speaks Russian. Both women had been charged with curfew violation and unlawful entry. According to a video posted on her Instagram account, the younger Malimon says she was born in Moldova, where her family had faced persecution under the Soviet-era regime for their Christian beliefs.Malimon, who traveled to D.C. from Portland, Oregon, is vice chairwoman of the Young Republicans of Oregon, according to the group’s website and is also listed as an “ambassador” for the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA. Her social media feeds are full of photos taken at Trump events, including the earlier “Million MAGA March” held in Washington last month. She also posted photos of herself posing with Donald Trump Jr. and Roger Stone, who was convicted of crimes including obstruction of justice and pardoned by Trump on Christmas Eve.Media reports from Oregon quoted Malimon in August as the primary organizer of a Trump boat parade on the Willamette River, where big waves created by speeding boats flying Trump flags swamped and sank a smaller boat that was not participating, throwing a family into the water to be rescued by the sheriff’s department.“Oregon, today you came out and showed your love and support for our wonderful President, Donald J. Trump thank you!” Kristina Malimon wrote on Facebook following the parade.Malimon also served as a Republican poll watcher in Georgia and spoke at an event organized by the Trump campaign in December, claiming to have seen voting machines and tabulation computers in Savannah, Georgia, with suspiciously blinking green lights she interpreted as a sign they were being secretly controlled by outside hackers — a claim debunked as false by GOP election officials in the state.A phone number listed for Kristina Malimon rang without being answered on Friday. At the address listed for her in southeast Portland on Friday night, her teenage brother answered the door as other family members, including young children, ran around.The family spoke Russian to each other and the brother, Nick Malimon, translated. He said his sister was still in Washington but had called the family following her release from jail and didn’t seem upset about her arrest.Others are facing consequences even beyond arrest.A Texas sheriff announced Thursday that he had reported one of his lieutenants to the FBI after she posted photos of herself on social media with a crowd outside the Capitol. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said Lt. Roxanne Mathai, a 46-year-old jailer, had the right to attend the rally but he’s investigating whether she may have broken the law.One of the posts Mathai shared was a photo that appeared to be taken Wednesday from among the mass of Trump supporters outside the Capitol, “Not gonna lie......aside from my kids, this was, indeed, the best day of my life. And it’s not over yet.”A lawyer for Mathai, a mother and longtime San Antonio resident, said she attended the Trump rally but never entered the Capitol.Brad Rukstales, a Republican political donor and CEO of Cogensia, a Chicago-based data analytics firm, was arrested with a group of a half-dozen Trump supporters who clashed with officers Wednesday inside the Capitol. Campaign finance reports show Rukstales contributed more than $25,000 to Trump’s campaign and other GOP committees during to 2020 election cycle.He told a local CBS news channel last week that he had entered the Capitol and apologized. He was fired Friday and did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Derrick Evans, a Republican recently sworn in as a delegate to the West Virginia House, resigned Saturday following his arrest on two charges related to the Capitol riot. He had streamed video of himself charging into the building with the mob.“They’re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we’re storming the building,” Evans, 35, says in the video, as the door to the Capitol building is smashed and rioters rush through. “The door is cracked! … We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!”On Saturday he issued a statement saying he regretted taking part.“I take full responsibility for my actions, and deeply regret any hurt, pain or embarrassment I may have caused my family, friends, constituents and fellow West Virginians,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-were-they-records-reveal-trump-fans-who-stormed-capitol-101610384612284.html
11-01-2021||World||What is the Insurrection Act of 1807 that officials feared Trump could invoke?||US President Donald Trump’s aide Roger Stone, a convicted felon, had last year suggested that the commander-in-chief should enforce martial law to seize power in case he loses the presidential election. Ahead of the certification of Electoral College and President-elect Joe Biden’s victory, elected officials of District of Columbia were reportedly analysing the risk of similar threat.According to a Buzzfeed report, the DC Attorney General’s office shared a memo with the 13-member City Council during a closed briefing last week. The memo was focussed on US president’s capability to take control of the city’s Metropolitan Police Department by invoking 214-year-old law - Insurrection Act of 1807.What is the Insurrection Act of 1807?According to The Washington Post, the Insurrection Act was framed during the era of Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers and third president of the United States, to prevent a suspected rebellion by his former deputy Aaron Burr. Since then, the law has undergone several amendments and it now empowers the president to send military forces to quell unrest and support civil law enforcement.Under normal circumstances, governors of states are responsible to maintain law and order within state boundaries. A law called the Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of the military in domestic law enforcement and the Insurrection Act provides a “statutory exception” to those limitations. This means the Insurrection Act empowers the president to deploy US Armed Forces and National Guard, at the request of a state government, to suppress an insurrection or “domestic violence”.Also Read | Who were they? Records reveal Trump fans who stormed CapitolHowever, the president must first issue a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse within a limited time, according to a Congressional Research Service report published in 2006. It says that the president may issue an executive order to send in troops if the situation does not resolve itself. The Insurrection Act has been invoked a number of times in the history of the United States to quell civil disturbances.

The price includes the first shot and the booster, which is injected 21 days later.Asked if Israel would permit the Palestinians to import the vaccines, Deputy Israeli Health Minister Yoav Kisch told Army Radio: "Anything to do with Palestinian Authority public health is taken care of by them, (so) I think they have that freedom."The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it expected to receive its first Covid-19 vaccine doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca in March, and accused Israel of shirking a duty to ensure vaccines are available in occupied territory.While Israel has become the world leader in vaccinations per capita, Palestinians in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip - where Hamas Islamists rule - have yet to obtain their first supplies.Outside Russia, where authorities say over a million people have now been inoculated with Sputnik V, the vaccine has also been approved for emergency use by local regulators in Algeria, Argentina, Bolivia, and Serbia, RDIF has said.Russian authorities have said that any Sputnik V export deals would involve only doses produced by such manufacturing partners abroad, with Russian-made vaccines primarily used to meet domestic needs.Hence Russia's first major international shipment of vaccine doses - 300,000 that left Moscow for Argentina last month - kindled an outcry at home as critics questioned why exports were being prioritised over domestic requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-approve-russian-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-in-self-rule-areas-101610383595376.html
11-01-2021||World||Democrats in US Congress begin second push to impeach Donald Trump||Congressional Democrats began a push on Monday to force US President Donald Trump from office, introducing one article of impeachment accusing him of inciting insurrection over a violent attack on the Capitol last week.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is expected to take up the matter as early as Wednesday. Passage would make Trump, a Republican, the only president in US history to be impeached twice.Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol last week, forcing lawmakers who were certifying Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory into hiding in a harrowing assault on the heart of American democracy that left five dead.The violence came after Trump urged supporters to march on the Capitol at a rally where he repeated false claims that his resounding defeat in the Nov. 3 election was illegitimate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, many of her fellow Democrats and a handful of Republicans say the Republican president should not be trusted to serve out his term, which ends on Jan. 20."In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both," Pelosi wrote to her fellow House Democrats on Sunday.Earlier, Republicans blocked an effort to immediately consider a resolution asking Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the US Constitution's never-used 25th Amendment to remove an unfit president.The House is expected on Tuesday to vote on the resolution calling for use of the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice president and the Cabinet to remove a president who is incapable of fulfilling his duties.Pence and his fellow Republicans have shown little interest in invoking the amendment.Dozens of people who attacked police officers, stole computers and smashed windows at the Capitol have been arrested for their role in the violence, and officials have opened 25 domestic terrorism investigations.Trump acknowledged that a new administration would take office on Jan. 20 in a video statement after the attack but has not appeared in public. Twitter and Facebook have suspended his accounts, citing the risk of him inciting violence.Representative Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said he expected the impeachment article to come to the floor for debate as soon as Wednesday, and he thought it would pass."What this president did is unconscionable, and he needs to be held to account," McGovern told CNN.Pence was in the Capitol along with his family when Trump's supporters attacked, and he and Trump are currently not on speaking terms. Pence's office did not respond to questions about the issue. A source said last week he was opposed to the idea of using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump.Pelosi had said the House could vote to impeach Trump on the charge of insurrection if Pence did not act. Aides to House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, who voted against recognizing Biden's victory, did not respond to a request for comment.House Democrats impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, but the Republican-controlled Senate voted not to convict him.Even if the House impeaches Trump again, the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans, would not take up the charges until Jan. 19 at the earliest, Trump's last full day in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/democrats-introduce-trump-impeachment-article-in-us-house-of-representatives-101610382823644.html
11-01-2021||World||Bar association seeks Rudy Giuliani's ban over 'combat' remarks||Rudy Giuliani is facing possible expulsion from the New York State Bar Association over incendiary remarks he made to President Donald Trump’s supporters last week before they violently stormed the US Capitol.The organisation said Monday that it has opened an inquiry into whether Giuliani should remain a member. Its bylaws state that “no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States” shall remain a member.Removal from the bar association, a voluntary membership organization dating to 1876, is not the same as being disbarred and banned from practicing law. That can only be done by the courts.A message seeking comment was left with Giuliani’s spokesperson. The bar association said he will be afforded due process and be given a chance to explain and defend his words and actions.Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, is Trump’s personal lawyer and has played a prominent role in the Republican president’s spurious fight to overturn his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat.The bar association said it has received hundreds of complaints about Giuliani’s work to perpetuate Trump’s baseless voter fraud claims, which culminated in fiery remarks last Wednesday in Washington as Congress met to count Biden’s Electoral College win.“If we’re wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we’re right, a lot of them will go to jail,” Giuliani told the crowd. “Let’s have trial by combat.”The bar association said in a statement that Giuliani’s words “quite clearly were intended to encourage Trump supporters unhappy with the election’s outcome to take matters into their own hands.”The bar association said it condemns the violence at the Capitol, calling it “nothing short of an attempted coup, intended to prevent the peaceful transition of power.”“We cannot stand idly by and allow those intent on rending the fabric of our democracy to go unchecked,” the organization said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bar-association-seeks-rudy-giuliani-s-ban-over-combat-remarks-101610381904666.html

Plans are underway to scale up testing at other locations throughout the county, the statement said."Vaccines are the surest route to defeating this virus and charting a course to recovery, so the city, county, and our entire team are putting our best resources on the field to get Angelenos vaccinated as quickly, safely, and efficiently as possible," Garcetti said."In this moment of darkness where cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are skyrocketing, this bold step of offering both Covid-19 testing and vaccines in the heart of Los Angeles, reflects the dual nature of this moment - it is dark, but simultaneously hopeful," said LA County Board of Supervisor Chair Hilda Solis.California's public health department on Sunday announced that anyone in the higher priority groups known as phase 1A including health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and those living in congregate settings, such as shelters will be eligible for vaccination, CNN reported.Data from the health department show about 33 per cent of the doses received have been administered statewide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-mayor-says-dodger-stadium-to-be-turned-into-covid-19-vaccine-site-101610381347230.html
11-01-2021||World||India not just commercial partner, but also rival to post-Brexit UK: Chatham House report||India being one of the key targets of the UK's post-Brexit Global Britain strategy should be viewed not just as an important commercial interest but also a rival, reflects a new influential report released on Monday on the UK's future as a non-member of the European Union (EU).'Global Britain, global broker: A blueprint for the UK’s future international role', compiled by the think-tank Chatham House – the Royal Institute of International Affairs, calls on Britain to focus its energies on investing in becoming a global broker to link together liberal democracies of the world and a continued alignment with the EU and its member-states as well as the US.Other economically significant Asia-Pacific democracies already part of British and US alliance structures – such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea – are also flagged as a priority, given the increasing pressure they face from a "stronger and more assertive China"."In contrast, some of the original targets of ‘Global Britain’ – China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey – may be important to the UK’s commercial interests, but they will be rivals or, at best, awkward counterparts on many of its global goals,” it warns.It accepts India’s importance to the UK as being "inescapable", given that it is set to be the largest country in the world by population very soon and have the third-largest economy and defence budget at some point in this decade, as also an English-speaking country with a large diaspora in the UK forming the basis of the two countries’ deep historical linkages. However, the think-tank strikes a note of caution over the two countries' shared colonial history proving a stumbling block to the promise of a deeper relationship."Developing the relationship with India, a pivotal regional democracy, as part of this shift in British strategic focus will prove a complex task," it points out."As a result, India is always on the list of countries with which a new UK government commits to engage. But it should be obvious by now that the idea of a deeper relationship with India always promises more than it can deliver. The legacy of British colonial rule consistently curdles the relationship," it notes.The report also points to India’s "complex, fragmented domestic politics", which make it one of the countries resistant to open trade and foreign investment. It highlights concerns raised by domestic groups as well as the United Nations and other democracy-watchers over a "crackdown on human rights activists and civil society groups" not being actively challenged by the judiciary."While giving India the attention it deserves, the UK government needs to accept that gaining direct national benefit from the relationship, whether economically or diplomatically, will be difficult,” the analysis notes.Against this backdrop, the report reflects on the prospect of including India within any new Democratic 10 or D10 coalition of 10 leading democracies at this time as it could make building meaningful consensus on policy or joint actions that much harder."India has a long and consistent record of resisting being corralled into a ‘Western’ camp. It led the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War and, in 2017, India formally joined the China- and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,” the report points out."Trying to corral groups of states into new, fixed caucuses is rife with difficulties," it adds.Instead, the advice is for the UK to use its G7 presidency this year as a prelude to the proposed Summit for Democracy, which incoming US President Joe Biden has committed to hosting in his first year in office."The UK should invest in becoming a global broker, leveraging its unique assets to link together liberal democracies at a time of strategic insecurity and engage alongside them with other countries that are willing to address shared international challenges constructively," it notes."At a minimum, the UK needs to be a leading member of the group of countries protecting and supporting liberal democracies and standing up for rules-based international collaboration. It can also be a broker helping to connect democratic and non-democratic governments in initiatives to tackle shared global challenges, from climate change to health resilience and equitable growth… The world needs less talk and more action. In this sense, an appreciation of Britain as a valued and creative global broker must be earned, not declared,” it concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-not-just-commercial-partner-but-also-rival-to-post-brexit-uk-chatham-house-report-101610380132762.html
11-01-2021||World||Aid groups, Yemenis fear more misery with US designation of Houthis||Global aid groups and ordinary Yemenis fear that a US plan to blacklist Yemen's Houthi movement will only heap more misery on a country blighted by death, disease, and poverty due to war.The majority of the population lives in northern Yemen under the control of the Iran-aligned group, which secretary of state Mike Pompeo said late on Sunday the State Department intended to designate as a foreign terrorist organisation.In the capital Sanaa, where pictures of Houthi leaders line the streets and members of the movement carry automatic weapons, Ahmad al-Wali frets the conflict will never end."Yemenis have suffered six years of war and hunger and this (US) decision will extend the war and will be catastrophic for Yemenis," Wali, a journalist, told Reuters.Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told Reuters that measures to ensure aid flows mentioned by Pompeo were not yet clear and said the immediate priority was to enact unambiguous exemptions for aid and commercial supplies."Pompeo must detail how the US government will not bring fuel to an already burning crisis by making our aid difficult and dangerous," he said. "Yemen is a country that imports 80% of its goods, and where four in five people need some form of humanitarian assistance, so we are talking about life or death."The United Nations (UN) says Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis and has warned that the long-impoverished Arabian peninsula nation was in imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades."This is going to add one more layer of misery," Oxfam America's humanitarian policy lead Scott Paul told Reuters, adding that the best case scenario now was for President-elect Joe Biden to revoke the designation.He said Pompeo's announcement was likely to "spook" businesses and banks working with Yemeni companies.Pockets of famine-like conditions have reappeared for the first time in two years and almost half the population is suffering high levels of food insecurity, recent UN data shows, as Covid-19, reduced remittances and underfunding of the 2020 aid response exacerbated matters.Fears and hopes"The people will pay the price," Hoda, a 19-year-old university student in Sanaa, told Reuters, adding that the designation could strengthen "Houthi obstinacy".The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the movement ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa.The conflict, which has killed more than 100,000 people, has been in military stalemate for years and is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Some Yemenis in the southern port city of Aden, interim base of the Saudi-backed government, said the US move was long overdue."It will make them (Houthis) submit because it will prevent them from securing funds," state employee Salah Abdullah, 58, told Reuters.United Nations special envoy Martin Griffiths has been trying to agree a nationwide ceasefire to revive peace negotiations last held in December 2018 to end the war.A UN official told Reuters that the designation may further polarise positions and present legal liabilities for convening talks that include the Houthis, hindering efforts to resolve the conflict "any time soon".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aid-groups-yemenis-fear-more-misery-with-us-designation-of-houthis-101610376879238.html

Experts believe the move is in line with Beijing’s efforts to ramp up connectivity and infrastructure for operations all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The imagery, shared on Monday by the open-source intelligence analyst who uses the name @detresfa on Twitter, shows infrastructure upgrades south of Xigatse airport that link the facility to a rail terminal. The imagery suggests the infrastructure will be part of a logistics hub for China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Among the under-construction structures captured by the imagery are a surface-to-air missile site, a suspected military support building, a new railway terminal and new railway line, and a possible fuel dump. The imagery also shows what appears to be a newly developed underground facility.Earlier, the imagery of this same suspected underground facility had captured what appeared to be two tunnel entrances.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the development.Sim Tack, a Belgium-based security analyst for Force Analysis, said there was mounting evidence in the form of satellite imagery of China’s massive upgrade of logistics facilities and connectivity across the Tibet Autonomous Region. The satellite imagery also suggested infrastructure is being upgraded or built to support military operations all along the LAC, from Aksai Chin to Arunachal Pradesh, he said.Also read: Covid-19 can result in balance sheet impairments, says RBI Governor“All of these logistical upgrades, including the construction of rail connectivity and utilities, appear to be aimed at quickly moving large numbers of forces within Tibet and from other parts of China to Tibet,” he said.Referring to the new underground facility being built near the airport at Xigatse, the second-largest city in the Tibet Autonomous Region, he said it could be a specialised facility where missile systems can be stored.Infrastructure upgrades south of Xigaze Airport, #Tibet show the aerodrome being linked to a rail terminal, possibly developing it into a future logistics hub for #China #PLA, additionally spotted nearby is a new suspected underground facility that warrants further monitoring pic.twitter.com/AeiqbxumVVThe railway station at Xigatse is one of the largest in the region and plays a crucial role in the movement of troops and military hardware. China also has plans to extend the line from Xigatse to the border with Nepal.“This new infrastructure is in line with China’s efforts to upgrade facilities all along the LAC. Earlier, there was evidence of the construction or upgrading of forward positions in Aksai Chin such as airbases, heliports and air defence sites. Now, there is evidence of the creation of logistical facilities,” Tack said.“Things are moving very rapidly and it’s almost as if things are popping up out of the ground every time we review satellite imagery. Almost every day, new positions seem to be coming up as part of a very large infrastructure drive. For example, a lot of infrastructure is also being created at Golmud,” he said, referring to a city in Qinghai province that is also the third-largest city on the Tibetan plateau.Also read: What PM Modi, chief ministers discussed at Covid vaccine roll-out meetRecent satellite imagery has also shown that China is setting up villages in hitherto uninhabited stretches along its disputed borders with India and Bhutan, particularly in Arunachal Pradesh. Experts believe the move is aimed at buttressing China’s territorial claims in these areas.Several villages have come up in the tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China, and the move dovetailed with the upgrading and construction of military facilities such as heliports and missile bases along the LAC in the aftermath of the 2017 standoff at Doklam.At least five new border villages have been built by China near Bum La, the border pass between Cona county in Tibet Autonomous Region and Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, a village has come up in Pangda area, which is claimed by Bhutan and located 10 kilometres from the site of the Doklam standoff.Chinese state-run media had reported last year that 27 households with 124 people had moved from Yadong county to Pangda village last September.A report authored last year by Sim Tack for Stratfor, a leading security and intelligence consultancy, had said that China began building at least 13 new military positions, including airbases and air defence units, near the LAC after the 2017 standoff at Doklam. Work on four heliports began after tensions erupted in Ladakh sector in April-May 2020.The new positions included three airbases, five permanent air defence positions and five heliports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-imagery-shows-china-creating-new-military-logistics-hub-in-tibet-101610376985245.html
11-01-2021||World||IAEA chief says matter of weeks left to revive Iran nuclear diplomacy||Reviving Iran's nuclear deal must happen within the coming weeks, UN atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Monday after Tehran resumed 20% uranium enrichment and its parliament threatened to curb access for UN inspectors in February."It is clear that we don’t have many months ahead of us. We have weeks," Grossi said in an interview for the Reuters Next conference.Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20% fissile strength at the underground Fordow nuclear plant earlier this month in a further breach of the nuclear pact with major powers since the United States withdrew from it in 2018, possibly complicating efforts by US President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal.Its parliament passed a law in November that obliges the government to halt inspections of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency and step up uranium enrichment if US sanctions are not eased.An Iranian lawmaker said on Jan. 9 said it would give the incoming Biden administration, which takes office on Jan. 20, until Feb. 21 to reverse sanctions."I must take it seriously because it's the law," Grossi said, adding that he believed the Islamic Republic's government intended to implement it.Grossi said Iran was progressing "quite rapidly" in 20% enrichment and that based on estimations it would be able to reach about 10 kilograms a month at its facility in Fordow.Uranium refined to 20% fissile purity is well above the 5% generally regarded as suitable for producing civilian nuclear energy and shortens Iran's potential path to 90% purity required for a nuclear bomb. Iran denies any intent to weaponise enrichment."There will have to be a clear understanding on how the initial terms and provisions of the JCPOA (nuclear deal) are going to be recomplied with," Grossi said.Tehran started violating the 2015 accord in 2019 in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from it in 2018 and to the reimposition of US sanctions that had been rescinded under the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iaea-chief-says-matter-of-weeks-left-to-revive-iran-nuclear-diplomacy-101610375567930.html
11-01-2021||World||Uganda accuses Facebook of 'interfering' in tense polls||A Ugandan official accused Facebook of meddling in Uganda's election after several accounts linked to the campaign of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni were removed for alleged inauthentic behaviour.Presidential spokesman Don Wanyama told The Associated Press on Monday that Facebook's action was evidence of what Ugandan authorities see as outside support of Bobi Wine, the leading opposition candidate in presidential elections scheduled for Thursday.“Facebook is interfering in the electoral process of Uganda,” he said. “If people wanted to have the evidence of outside interference, now they have it.”In a statement e-mailed to AP, Facebook said it removed a network of accounts and pages that “used fake and duplicate accounts to manage pages, comment on other people's content, impersonate users, re-share posts in groups to make them appear more popular than they were. Given the impending election in Uganda, we moved quickly to investigate and take down this network."That network is linked to Uganda's Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, the statement said.Wanyama charged that Facebook had blocked the accounts of Museveni's mobilisers, especially those who communicate in the local Luganda language.Among those affected is a singer known as Full Figure, who is a well-known campaigner for Museveni, he said.Some of the blocked Ugandan accounts campaigned harshly against presidential challenger Wine.The 38-year-old Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, has fired the imagination of many across Africa as he tries to unseat Museveni, who has deployed the military to prevent what he sees as opposition attempts to create civil unrest that could cause regime change. Wine's rallies are often disrupted by police, sometimes violently.Wine and other opposition figures have called the 76-year-old Museveni a dictator. Museveni has accused Wine of being an agent of “outsiders, homosexuals and others who don't like the stability and independence of Uganda.”Wine, a popular singer before he won a seat in parliament, has attracted national attention as the beret-wearing leader of a movement known as “People Power.”He has been arrested many times and sometimes beaten in the past year for alleged offenses such as disobeying lawful orders. He has not been convicted of any charges.Museveni has ruled Uganda since 1986. He has defied many calls for his retirement, saying he has been elected many times by Ugandans who love him.Ugandan polls are often marred by allegations of rigging. The country has never seen a peaceful transfer of power since independence from Britain in 1962.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uganda-accuses-facebook-of-interfering-in-tense-polls-101610373646394.html
11-01-2021||World||US Army investigating officer who led group to Washington rally||The Army is investigating a psychological operations officer who led a group of people from North Carolina to the rally in Washington that led up to the deadly riot in the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.Commanders at Fort Bragg are reviewing Captain Emily Rainey’s involvement in last week's events in the nation's capital, but she said she acted within military regulations and that no one in her group broke the law.“I was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights,” Rainey told The Associated Press on Sunday.Rainey said she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom, which describes itself online as a nonpartisan network promoting conservative values, to Washington to “stand against election fraud” and support Trump. She said the group attended the rally but she didn’t know of anyone who entered the Capitol and that they were headed back to their buses hours before an emergency curfew took effect.Rainey, 30, is assigned to the 4th Psychological Operations Group at Fort Bragg, according to Maj. Daniel Lessard, a spokesman for 1st Special Forces Command. Known as PSYOPS, the group uses information and misinformation to shape the emotions, decision-making and actions of American adversaries.Rainey made headlines back in May after she posted a video online of her pulling down caution tape at a playground that was closed under North Carolina’s Covid-19 restrictions.Police in Southern Pines, a community about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Fort Bragg, charged her with injury to personal property over the incident. The police told WRAL-TV that they let her off with warnings twice before after she tore down the tape closing off the playground.In Washington on Wednesday, insurrectionists took over the House and Senate chambers, smashed windows and waved Trump, American and Confederate flags. The riot followed the rally where Trump repeated false claims that the election had been rigged against him and said he and his supporters are going to have to “fight much harder” to protect democracy.So far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.Rainey said that her group and most people who traveled to Washington “are peace-loving, law-abiding people who were doing nothing but demonstrating our First Amendment rights.”Members of the US military are permitted to take part in political organisations and events out of uniform. However, there are caveats. The Department of Defense (DOD) directive prohibits active-duty service members from sponsoring partisan organisations. It is unclear if Rainey’s participation with her group on Wednesday went against DOD policy.Rainey said she attended the Trump rally while on leave and didn’t advertise that she was an Army officer. She said Sunday afternoon that her commanders had not inquired about her time in Washington, but she did not immediately respond to a subsequent inquiry about the Army's investigation.“I told my bosses before I went that I was going, and I told them when I got back,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-army-investigating-officer-who-led-group-to-washington-rally-101610371549856.html
11-01-2021||World||Covid-19: Here’s the list of countries with no reported case of infection||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has claimed over 1.93 million lives worldwide and most of the countries across the globe have reported cases of infection. The United States has remained the worst-hit country in terms of overall Covid-19 cases and related deaths, followed by India and Brazil.The pandemic has severely hit the global economy as a result of movement restrictions imposed by governments around the world to contain the spread of the virus. However, almost 10 months after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic, some countries are yet to report a single case of coronavirus.North Korea has not reported a single confirmed case of coronavirus, so far, to the UN health agency and it remains almost impossible for foreign media to independently confirm the claims. Despite declaring itself virus-free, North Korea has requested shipments of Covid-19 vaccines in an application to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations(GAVI), according to the Wall Street Journal.According to WHO’s situation report, Turkmenistan, a country in Central Asia, has also not reported any Covid-19 case. Experts believe that coronavirus cases likely exist in Turkmenistan but strict government control over the dissemination of information makes it difficult to assess the actual situation. Other countries with no cases of infection are mostly the islands located in the Pacific.Here’s the list of countries with no confirmed Covid-19 case so far:1. Palau2. Nauru3. Kiribati4. The Federated States of Micronesia5. Tuvalu6. Tonga7. SamoaMeanwhile, several Western nations have rolled out Covid-19 vaccines for priority groups like health care workers and senior citizens with underlying medical conditions. The Indian government has also started preparations to begin vaccinating priority groups from January 16. It will be the world’s largest immunisation drive against Covid-19 to inoculate about 30 million health care and frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-here-s-the-list-of-countries-with-no-reported-case-of-infection-101610373013283.html

These are free. The NHS will never ask for your bank details and vaccines are not being delivered to your front door by people who have not been identified as NHS staff."The minister's warning came after the National Crime Agency (NCA) last week urged the public to be vigilant, reporting that scammers were asking elderly and vulnerable people for payment in return for access to vaccines that were fake or non-existent."The current level of reported fraud in relation to the vaccine remains very low but is increasing," said Graeme Biggar, Director General of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA.The City of London police reported on Friday that a scammer had obtained 160 pounds from a 92-year-old woman and had jabbed her in the arm with what she described as a "dart-like implement" after he turned up unannounced at her home.Britain is in the grip of a devastating surge in infections which has pushed the total UK Covid-19 death toll above 81,000 and led to the imposition of national lockdowns in England and Scotland and tight restrictions in Wales and Northern Ireland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scammers-tricking-victims-into-paying-for-fake-covid-19-vaccines-101610371155530.html

Construction is planned to start in the first quarter.A news release described The Line as a walkable “belt of hyper-connected future communities, without cars and roads and built around nature.” It said the city would have 1 million residents and create 380,000 jobs by 2030. The infrastructure will cost $100 billion to $200 billion, the crown prince said.Neom is a major part of Prince Mohammed’s plan to diversify the economy of the world’s largest crude exporter. Announced in 2017, the project spans more than 10,000 square miles in a remote area of the country’s northwest. It’s described on its website as “a bold and audacious dream” that will become a hub for new technologies and businesses.The project has been plagued by skepticism and controversy since its launch, though, including opposition from residents forced to relocate to make way for construction. Analysts question if the plan is realistic and can attract the investment needed in a region that already has well-established transport and business hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar.“The backbone of investment in The Line will come from the $500 billion support to Neom by the Saudi government, PIF and local and global investors over 10 years,” the prince told reporters in the city of Al-Ula, referring to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.The announcement shows the extent to which Prince Mohammed is thinking about life after oil for the kingdom, which earned over half of government revenue from crude in 2020. The project was the first major development to be announced within Neom.“Why do we accept sacrificing nature for development?” the prince said, citing rising sea levels and carbon emissions in a manner rare for a Saudi official.No journey within The Line will be longer than 20 minutes, he said. The city would be built around “ultra-high-speed transit,” according to the statement.It will also contain one of the world’s largest airports, Neom chief executive Nadhmi Al-Nasr said in an interview with Al-Arabiya television channel. He didn’t provide a time frame for construction, saying only the airport would be the final element of The Line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/audacious-dream-saudi-crown-prince-plans-car-free-city-for-future-beyond-oil-101610371980016.html
11-01-2021||World||Israel announces new settlements, risking Joe Biden's anger||Israel on Monday advanced plans to build 800 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank, a move that could strain ties with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced the move, saying it would include 100 homes in a settlement where an Israeli woman was killed last month in an attack allegedly carried out by a Palestinian assailant.The announcement will burnish Netanyahu's right-wing credentials in a tough campaign ahead of March elections, but it could anger Biden, who is opposed to settlement expansion and has clashed with Israel over it in the past.Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state. Nearly 500,000 Israelis live in settlements scattered across the West Bank. The Palestinians view settlements as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace, a position with wide international support.The Palestinian Authority's Foreign Ministry condemned the latest announcement, accusing Israel of “racing against time” to build settlements before President Donald Trump leaves office.Trump's administration provided unprecedented support to Israel, including by abandoning a decades-old U.S. policy of opposing settlements. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year became the first top U.S. diplomat to visit a West Bank settlement.Biden has pledged a more even-handed approach in which he will restore aid to the Palestinians that was cut off by Trump and work to revive peace negotiations. The two sides have not held substantive peace talks in more than a decade.Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, who hopes to unseat Netanyahu in March, called the settlement announcement an “irresponsible step" that would spark a “battle” with the new U.S. administration.“The Biden administration has not yet taken office and the government is already leading us into an unnecessary confrontation,” he tweeted. “The national interest must also be maintained during elections.”The greatest threat to Netanyahu in the coming vote comes from the right, where Gideon Saar, a former ally and staunch supporter of settlements, has broken away and vowed to end his long rule. Polls show Netanyahu's Likud winning the most votes but falling short of a majority coalition in Israel's 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.The announcement said 100 homes would be built in Tel Manashe, a West Bank settlement where Esther Horgan, a 53-year-old mother of six, was killed last month while jogging in a nearby forest. Israel says it has detained a Palestinian suspect in the attack.It was not immediately clear how soon the homes would be built, as such construction usually requires approval from several government bodies and a tendering process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-announces-new-settlements-risking-joe-biden-s-anger-101610368631575.html

Violence is never acceptable,” she said in a statement released by the White House.Trump called on all “citizens” to “take a moment, pause, and look at things from all perspectives.”“I implore people to stop the violence, never make assumptions based on the color of a person’s skin or use differing political ideologies as a basis for aggression and viciousness,” she said.She also scorned unspecified “false misleading accusations” about her from people she said are “looking to be relevant.”“This time is solely about healing our country and its citizens. It should not be used for personal gain,” she said.On Wednesday, a mob encouraged by President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol, sending lawmakers fleeing to safety. The rampage left five people, including a police officer, dead.Trump lamented the deaths and said she prayed for their families.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders have called on the president to resign because of the violence and said they will act to remove him from office if he does not.Melania Trump nodded to the fact that she will be leaving her role in the coming days.“It has been the honor of my lifetime to serve as your first lady. I want to thank the millions of Americans who supported my husband and me over the past 4 years and shown the incredible impact of the American spirit,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melania-trump-disappointed-by-capitol-riot-laments-deaths-101610368115049.html
11-01-2021||World||Nancy Pelosi says House will impeach Trump, pushes VP to oust him||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will proceed with legislation to impeach President Donald Trump as she pushes the vice president and the Cabinet to invoke constitutional authority to force him out, warning that Trump is a threat to democracy after the deadly assault on the Capitol.The House action could start as soon as Monday as pressure increases on Trump to step aside. A Republican senator, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, joined Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in calling for Trump to “resign and go away as soon as possible.”A stunning end to Trump's final 10 days in office was underway as lawmakers warned of the damage the president could still do before Joe Biden was inaugurated Jan. 20. Trump, holed up at the White House, was increasingly isolated after a mob rioted in the Capitol in support of his false claims of election fraud.Judges across the country, including some nominated by Trump, repeatedly dismissed cases and Attorney General William Barr, a Trump ally, said there was no sign of any widespread fraud. Pelosi emphasized the need for quick action.“We will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat,” Pelosi said in a letter late Sunday to colleagues.“The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.”On Monday, Pelosi's leadership team will seek a vote on a resolution calling on Vice President Mike Pence and Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment, with a full House vote expected on Tuesday.After that, Pence and the Cabinet would have 24 hours to act before the House would move toward impeachment.During an interview on “60 Minutes” aired Sunday, Pelosi invoked the Watergate era when Republicans in the Senate told President Richard Nixon, “It’s over.”“That’s what has to happen now,” she said.With impeachment planning intensifying, Toomey said he doubted impeachment could be done before Biden is inaugurated, even though a growing number of lawmakers say that step is necessary to ensure Trump can never hold elected office again.“I think the president has disqualified himself from ever, certainly, serving in office again,” Toomey said. “I don’t think he is electable in any way.”Murkowski, long exasperated with the president, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply “needs to get out.” A third, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., did not go that far, but on Sunday he warned Trump to be “very careful” in his final days in office.House Democrats were expected to introduce articles of impeachment on Monday. The strategy would be to condemn the president's actions swiftly but delay an impeachment trial in the Senate for 100 days. That would allow President-elect Joe Biden to focus on other priorities as soon as he is inaugurated Jan. 20.Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat and a top Biden ally, laid out the ideas Sunday as the country came to grips with the siege at the Capitol by Trump loyalists trying to overturn the election results.“Let’s give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,” Clyburn said.Corporate America began to show its reaction to the Capitol riots by tying them to campaign contributions.Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's CEO and President Kim Keck said it will not contribute to those lawmakers — all Republicans — who supported challenges to Biden's Electoral College win. The group “will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy," Kim said.Citigroup did not single out lawmakers aligned with Trump's effort to overturn the election, but said it would be pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year. Citi’s head of global government affairs, Candi Wolff, said in a Friday memo to employees, “We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.”Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said an impeachment trial could not begin under the current calendar before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.While many have criticized Trump, Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive in a time of unity.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that instead of coming together, Democrats want to “talk about ridiculous things like ‘Let’s impeach a president’" with just days left in office.Still, some Republicans might be supportive.Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said he would take a look at any articles that the House sent over. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic, said he would “vote the right way” if the matter were put in front of him.The Democratic effort to stamp Trump's presidential record — for the second time — with the indelible mark of impeachment had advanced rapidly since the riot.Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, said Sunday that his group had 200-plus co-sponsors.The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors to acquit or convict Trump. If convicted, Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president. It would be the first time a U.S. president had been impeached twice.Potentially complicating Pelosi's decision about impeachment was what it meant for Biden and the beginning of his presidency. While reiterating that he had long viewed Trump as unfit for office, Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress did “is for them to decide.”A violent and largely white mob of Trump supporters overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College.Toomey appeared on CNN's “State of the Union” and NBC's “Meet the Press.” Clyburn was on “Fox News Sunday” and CNN. Kinzinger was on ABC's “This Week,” Blunt was on CBS' “Face the Nation” and Rubio was on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-says-house-will-impeach-trump-pushes-vp-to-oust-him-101610367977442.html
11-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un appears to hold military parade after blasting US||North Korea appeared to stage a military parade as part of a grand party congress that laid out the scale of the challenge U.S. President-elect Joe Biden faces to rein in Kim Jong Un’s nuclear program.There were signs that North Korea held a parade late Sunday evening, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday, in what would be the second such event in since October. U.S. and Seoul Korean intelligence officials were tracking the movements in Pyongyang, the joint chiefs said, which could provide more insight into recent military advances by the regime.The event came amid a Workers’ Party Congress, in which Kim renewed his saber-ratting toward the U.S. and outlined plans for a broad upgrade of his nuclear forces to improve his capacity to strike across the Pacific. In a chilling warning to the incoming Biden administration, North Korea declared the U.S. its “biggest main enemy” and predicted that Washington’s “hostile policy” toward Pyongyang would remain no matter who comes to power.The congress -- only the third such event in the past four decades -- signaled a contentious approach toward the new administration after three largely fruitless meetings with President Donald Trump. North Korea has a history of testing new U.S. presidents with provocations as a way to pressure them to return the negotiating table.The event also ushered political changes that would likely be analyzed for months, with the congress’s main report running some 13,500 words in English. Kim received the new title of “general secretary” of the ruling party -- a moniker previously reserved for his late father. Meanwhile, his prominent sister, Kim Yo Jong, was left off a list of alternate members of the Politburo without explanation, sparking speculation that she had suddenly fallen out of favor.North Korea’s weapons plans include making smaller and lighter nuclear weapons, proceeding with the development of large warheads and improving the ability to strike targets within 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles) -- or all of the continental U.S. Kim is seeking to develop solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear-powered submarines while strengthening intelligence-gathering capabilities with satellites, according to KCNA.“It lights a fire under the Biden administration,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton Senior Fellow in the in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Kim is making clear that if Biden decides not to prioritize North Korea policy, Pyongyang will resume testing and qualitatively advancing its nuclear capabilities in ways that would be seriously detrimental for Washington and Seoul.”It was unclear if and when North Korea would release footage of the military activities in Pyongyang. The regime waited almost a day before broadcasting images of its previous parade in October, an event that included the debut of what experts believe to be the world’s largest road-mobile ICBM. As of 8 p.m. Monday, no video of the latest parade had been aired.North Korea launched a long-range rocket and a detonating a nuclear device after President Barack Obama took power in 2009. Trump was welcomed with a series of ballistic missile tests that culminated with the November 2017 launch of an ICBM that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to the entire U.S.While Kim did leave the door open for further talks with the U.S., he reaffirmed his longstanding demand that Washington drop its “hostile policy,” a collection of grievances that include the presence of American troops on the peninsula. He put a similar condition restoring ties with South Korea, a request that appeared intended to put strain on the alliance between Seoul and Washington.In his own new year’s speech Monday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed a efforts to achieve a “big change” in relations between the U.S. and North Korea. The longtime proponent of engagement with Pyongyang said there was no change in his willingness to improve ties.North Korea’s sanctions-battered economy was dealt further blows last year by natural disasters and Kim’s decision to shut borders due to the coronavirus. Gross domestic product likely shrank by 8.5% in 2020, according to a projection by Fitch Solutions, leaving it smaller than when Kim took power in 2011 with a pledge to improve people’s living standards.Kim issued a dire warning in opening remarks to the congress of 5,000 delegates, saying the previous five-year plan fell far short of goals and the party would explore a “new path” for making a “big leap forward.” His new title as general secretary of the party fit with a pattern of assuming mantels associated with his revered forebearers as he consolidates power.Less clear was the significance of the personnel changes. The congress saw Kim Yong Chol, who twice met Trump at the White House, return as the party’s United Front director, despite rumors of his purge. Although Kim Yo Jong was conspicuously left off the Politburo line-up, she was given a seat of honor just behind the leader, undercutting speculation that she had fallen from favor.Kim Yo Jong would “continue to play a pivotal role,” said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul who has advised the South Korean government. “It is not a demotion,” Yang said. “Kim Yo Jong remains to be one of the most influential figures in North Korea, and someone who appears to connect her brother with the country’s ordinary people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-appears-to-hold-military-parade-after-blasting-us-101610364051778.html
11-01-2021||World||Post-Brexit Britain better-off as a global broker: Report||Britain can remain internationally influential if it serves as a broker to global challenges such as climate change, equitable economic growth and health resilience, rather than as a miniature ‘great power’, an influential think-tank said in a major report on Monday.Chatham House, also known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said in the report titled ‘Global Britain, Global Broker’ that the UK needs to accept that while giving India attention, gaining direct national benefit from the relationship, whether economically or diplomatically, will be difficult.“India is always on the list of countries with which a new UK government commits to engage. But it should be obvious by now that the idea of a deeper relationship with India always promises more than it can deliver. The legacy of British colonial rule consistently curdles the relationship”, the paper by Chatham House director Robin Niblett says.The paper lays out six international goals for the UK that offer the best points of connection between its interests, resources and credibility: protecting liberal democracy; promoting international peace and security; tackling climate change; enabling greater global health resilience; championing global tax transparency and equitable economic growth; and defending cyberspace.It notes that part of the logic of Brexit was that a more sovereign ‘Global Britain’ could pursue its commercial interests more successfully and enhance its voice internationally, but today the UK must contend with greater protectionism, a more introspective US, no ‘golden era’ in relations with China, and gridlock in most international institutions.The European Union, United States and Asia-Pacific democracies such as Australia, Japan and South Korea should continue to be focus in the post-Brexit phase, the paper says adding that the original targets of ‘Global Britain’ – China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey – may be important to the UK’s commercial interests, “but they will be rivals or, at best, awkward counterparts on many of its global goals”.The paper notes that the post-Brexit UK embarks on its solo journey with important assets: It will still be the sixth- or seventh-largest economy in the world in 2030, at the heart of global finance, and among the best-resourced behind the US, China and India in terms of combined defence, intelligence, diplomatic and development capabilities. The paper says: “Even outside the EU, its government will be better networked institutionally than almost any other country’s. And the soft power inherent in its language, universities, media and civil society can enhance the influence of British ideas”.“But assets do not automatically equate with influence. There needs to be a vision for Britain’s international role, and the political will, resources and popular support to put this vision into action”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/postbrexit-britain-better-off-as-a-global-broker-report-101610366184992.html

He rose through the ranks of the diplomatic corps to become deputy secretary of state before retiring in 2014 to run the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace.Amid tumult in the State Department after Donald Trump took office in 2017, Burns held his tongue until last year when he began writing highly critical pieces of the Trump administration's policies in Foreign Affairs and other publications.“Bill Burns is an exemplary diplomat with decades of experience on the world stage keeping our people and our country safe and secure," Biden said. "He shares my profound belief that intelligence must be apolitical and that the dedicated intelligence professionals serving our nation deserve our gratitude and respect. Ambassador Burns will bring the knowledge, judgment, and perspective we need to prevent and confront threats before they can reach our shores.

The National Health Commission, which announced the arrival date, delayed from its early January schedule, did not detail the team's itinerary, however.China has been accused by some of a cover-up that delayed its initial response, allowing the virus to spread since it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan late in 2019.The United States has called for a "transparent" WHO-led investigation and criticised its terms, which allowed Chinese scientists to do the first phase of preliminary research."I think it's an important meeting but it shouldn't be overrated in terms of an outcome this time," said Fisher, who took part in a WHO mission to Wuhan last year.The experts will meet their Chinese counterparts and exchange notes on what data they have and what studies they will further have to do, said Fisher, who is also a professor of medicine at the National University of Singapore.Though he doesn't expect all the answers from this trip, Fisher believes the chances of finding the origin of the pandemic are much better than they were year ago, because experts now know a lot more about what data they will need to collect based on information they already have: for example, antibody studies from residual serums in other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-health-expert-says-expectation-low-on-conclusion-from-agency-s-china-visit-101610364006324.html
11-01-2021||World||Explainer: How will Trump get his message out without social media?||The decision by tech companies to clamp down on President Donald Trump's ability to speak to followers through mainstream social media may force him to tap more traditional methods of communication or more isolated conservative online channels during his final days in office, experts say.Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc-owned Google, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc took their strongest actions yet against Trump to limit his reach, fearing continued violence stemming from his posts after his supporters attacked the US Capitol building last week. They were joined by smaller tech companies including Twitch, Snapchat, Reddit, Shopify and TikTok.Trump, who has without evidence challenged the validity of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory, praised and egged on supporters before they laid siege on Wednesday to the Capitol, where lawmakers were certifying the Electoral College vote for Biden. Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the assault.Apple, Google and Amazon have suspended Parler - a pro-Trump app where users have threatened more violence - from their respective app stores and Web-hosting services, a set of moves that stand to severely handicap the service.The platform has 12 million users and Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric are active on it, but it will now have to find a new Web host to replace Amazon to even stay in business.How can Trump reach his followers?Immediately after the Twitter ban - a platform the president has been obsessed with since he first ran for office and where he regularly spoke to his 88 million followers - Trump vowed he would "not be SILENCED!" and promised a "big announcement soon."Trump also tweeted from the @POTUS Twitter account shortly after the ban and railed against the tech company, Democrats and a law protecting internet companies called Section 230, and said he was considering building his own social media platform. His tweets were almost immediately deleted by the company.But striking out on his own will take time. For the moment, Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20, is left with alternatives such as online conservative platform Gab, a free-speech network with almost no censorship rules, that has far less of a reach.Aides and supporters are already turning to Gab and the platform MeWe to amplify his messages in the coming days, experts said. Other likely outlets are video platform Rumble and video streaming service DLive, along with alternate news sites such as American Media Periscope, said Monica Stephens, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo, whose research focuses on topics including social media."I don't think Trump will join these smaller platforms himself. It is more likely he will create something on his own as opposed to joining something subjected to somebody else's controls," she said.In the meantime, he can tap Trump-friendly networks such as Fox News, OAN and Newsmax to get his message out. The other underutilized option is the White House press office, experts said. He can continue to hold briefings or distribute statements and videos until the end of his term.What are his followers and supporters saying?Immediately after the Twitter ban, backers such as Angela Stanton-King, a Republican supporter of the QAnon conspiracy group who ran in November to represent Georgia's 5th Congressional District, and Republican Representative Thomas Massie began sharing their Parler accounts on Twitter, encouraging followers to move there.Others such as conservative media host Rush Limbaugh deactivated their Twitter accounts.Numerous Republican lawmakers denounced the social media company decisions as an attempt to stifle conservative voices and argued the moves would further polarize the country."We're now living in a country where four or five companies - unelected, unaccountable - have the power, a monopoly power to decide, we're going to wipe people out, we're going to just erase them from any sort of digital platform," Senator Marco Rubio said on Fox News.Some liberal free-speech activists were uncomfortable with the moves too. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, defended the right of Twitter and others to "curate their platforms," but called for more transparency and consistency in decision making.The American Civil Liberties Union said it "should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions."Can online platforms silence Trump and his followers?Silicon Valley companies have frequently tried, often without much success, to go after those peddling harmful content - from election disinformation to hate speech and violent threats - but their actions in recent days have been the toughest so far.The First Amendment guaranteeing free speech does not generally apply to private-sector companies, allowing them to moderate speech that incites violence on their platforms."I think there was a legitimate public policy interest over the last four-plus years in maintaining the president and his voice on Twitter and other platforms. But clearly, what he has done has exceeded any reasonable public policy interest," said Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-will-trump-get-his-message-out-without-social-media-101610363725871.html
11-01-2021||World||English health official warns pandemic entering worst weeks||England’s chief medical officer warned Monday that the coming weeks would be the worst of the pandemic for the National Health Service (NHS) as he appealed to the public to strictly follow guidelines meant to prevent the spread of the disease.Chris Whitty said political leaders are considering tightening the rules as a new, more transmissible variant of Covid-19 aggravates an already difficult situation. Hospitals are overflowing and exhausted medical staff are under strain.“I think everybody accepts that this is the most dangerous time we’ve really had in terms of numbers into the NHS,’’ Whitty told the BBC.The warning comes as hospitals in England struggle to keep up with a surge in coronavirus infections that has seen the number of beds filled by Covid-19 patients rise steadily for more than a month. English hospitals are now treating 55% more Covid-19 cases than during the first peak of the pandemic in April.“In a sense, tinkering with the rules may be useful, but the far more important thing is that everybody abides by the spirit of the rules that are there at the moment," Whitty said. “Everybody knows what they need to do. And I think that’s the key thing — minimize the number of contacts.”England last week entered a third national lockdown that closed all nonessential shops, schools, colleges, and universities for at least six weeks. But police report many violations of rules that require people to stay home except for essential reasons such as exercise and grocery shopping.The government hopes the restrictions will reduce the strain on the NHS while it ramps up a nationwide mass vaccination program. Seven new large-scale vaccination centers are set to open Monday, joining around 1,000 other sites across the country, including hospitals, general practitioners’ clinics and some drugstores.The UK government’s goal is to vaccinate 15 million people by mid-February, targeting people over 70, front line healthcare workers and others who are especially vulnerable to the virus. That will protect people who account for almost 90% of coronavirus-related deaths and may allow restrictions to be eased, the government says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/english-health-official-warns-pandemic-entering-worst-weeks-101610363702632.html
11-01-2021||World||Pope says women can read at Mass, but still can't be priests||Pope Francis has changed church law to explicitly allow women to do more things during Mass, while reaffirming they cannot be priests.Francis amended the law to formalize what is common practice in many parts of the world: that women can read the Gospel and serve on the altar as eucharistic ministers. Previously, such roles were officially reserved to men even though exceptions were made.Francis said he was making the change to increase recognition of the “precious contribution” women make in the church, while emphasizing that all baptized Catholics have a role to play in the church’s mission.But he also noted that doing so further makes a distinction between “ordained” ministries such as the priesthood, and ministries open to qualified laity. The Vatican reserves the priesthood for men.The change comes as Francis remains under pressure to allow women to be deacons — ordained ministers who perform many of the same functions as priests, such as presiding at weddings, baptisms and funerals. Currently, the ministry is reserved for men.Francis has created a second study commission of experts to study whether women could be deacons, after a first one failed to reach a consensus.Advocates for expanding the diaconate to include women say doing so would give women greater say in the ministry and governance of the church, while also helping address priest shortages in several parts of the world.Opponents say allowing it would become a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-says-women-can-read-at-mass-but-still-can-t-be-priests-101610363449864.html
11-01-2021||World||Biden’s inauguration: Here’s list of Indian-Americans nominated for key roles||The nominations by US President-elect Joe Biden for his incoming administration have been in stark contrast with that of Trump administration in terms of diversity. Biden had promised a diverse team that will “look like the country”, which reflected in the selection of his running mate, Kamala Harris, and the nominations announced in the past few weeks.After the election results were declared in November 2020, Biden named over 20 Indian-Americans to his agency review teams (ARTs), providing a glimpse to his nomination strategy. However, President Donald Trump’s reluctance to concede defeat created a major problem for Biden’s transition team, which was followed by riots in US Capitol on January 6, the day when Congressional leaders had gathered to certify the Electoral College vote.The US Congress finally certified Biden’s victory on the early morning of January 7 after law enforcement agencies brought things under control. The focus has again shifted to Biden’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, and the representation of Indian-American community in the administration has grabbed the limelight.Also Read | From Biden to Harris, leaders who have taken a shot of the Covid-19 vaccineHere’s the list of Indian-Americans nominated for key positions in Biden administration:1.

11-01-2021||World||From Biden to Harris, leaders who have taken a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine||Global caseload of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has crossed 90 million, out of which nearly two million patients have lost their lives, according to Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker. Vaccination drives are currently underway in several countries, with India slated to start what will be the largest global immunisation drive, on January 16. However, many leaders from the opposition parties have suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take the first shot to build people’s trust.Also Read | India’s vaccine drive to kick off on Jan 16Several global leaders have taken a shot of the vaccine, while others have volunteered to take one. Here’s a list of a few such leaders:1. Joe Biden: The President-elect of the United States of America will take his second vaccine shot on Monday. Biden took his first shot on December 21 in front of the media. Two Covid-19 vaccines are currently being used in the US, one each by Pfizer Inc-BioNTech SE and Moderna.Also Read | Joe Biden to receive second Covid-19 vaccine dose Monday2. Kamala Harris: The US Vice President-elect took her first vaccine shot on December 29, getting herself injected with the Moderna vaccine, on live TV, just like Biden. “I am incredibly grateful to our frontline health care workers, scientists and researchers who made this moment possible,” she had tweeted after her vaccination.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage3. Mike Pence: Harris’ predecessor in the office, the incumbent and outgoing US Vice President, along with wife Karen, took a shot of the Pfizer vaccine on December 18. The Pence couple, just like Biden and Harris, received their jabs on live television. “I didn’t feel a thing. Well done,” Pence said later.4. Benjamin Netanyahu: Israel’s Prime Minister was vaccinated for a second time on January 9, after becoming the first Israeli citizen to be vaccinated against Covid-19, on December 20, when he received a shot of Pfizer’s vaccine.5. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip: The 94-year-old British monarch and her 99-year-old husband were vaccinated on January 9. “The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received Covid-19 vaccinations,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson had said in a rare public comment on the Queen’s private health matters.6. Anil Vij: Though India approved its first Covid-19 vaccines in January itself, and will start immunisation drive on January 16, Vij, the home minister of Haryana state, received a shot of Bharat Biotech International Limited’s Covaxin, during trials on November 20.7. Joko Widodo: Indonesia has approved Covid-19 vaccine of China’s Sinovac Biotech Limited. President Joko Widodo announced on social media he would be the first person to take a shot of the vaccine, called CoronaVac. ‘It’s not about putting myself first, but to ensure everyone that this vaccine is safe and halal,” Widodo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-biden-to-harris-leaders-who-have-taken-a-shot-of-the-covid-19-vaccine-101610360650293.html
11-01-2021||World||China denies coercive birth control measures in Xinjiang||A Chinese official on Monday denied Beijing has imposed coercive birth control measures among Muslim minority women, following an outcry over a tweet by the Chinese Embassy in Washington claiming that government polices had freed women of the Uighur ethnic group from being “baby-making machines.”Xu Guixiang, a deputy spokesperson for the Xinjiang regional government, told reporters Monday that birth control decisions were made of the person’s own free will and that “no organization or individual can interfere.”“The growth rate of the Uighur population is not only higher than that of the whole Xinjiang population, but also higher than that of the minority population, and more significantly higher than that of the (Chinese majority) Han population," Xu said. “As for the so-called forcing ethnic minority women in Xinjiang to wear IUDs, or undergo tubal ligations or abortions, it is even more malign.”An Associated Press investigation in June found that the Chinese government was forcing draconian birth control measures on Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including IUD fittings, contraceptives, and even abortions and sterilizations.The measures are backed by the threat of detention, with parents with three or more children swept into camps and prisons if they’re unable to pay massive fines. As a result, the birth rate in Xinjiang’s minority regions plummeted by over 60% in just three years, even as Beijing eases birth restrictions on the Han population ahead of a looming demographic crisis.Twitter took down the Chinese Embassy's Jan. 7 tweet following protests by groups that accuse Beijing of seeking to eradicate Uighur culture. Users complained the tweet was a violation of rules set by Twitter, which is blocked in China along with Facebook and other American social media platforms.“China’s fascist government is now openly admitting and celebrating its use of concentration camps, forced labor, forced sterilizations, and abortions, and other forms of torture to eliminate an ethnic and religious minority," Nihad Awad, national executive director of The Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in an emailed statement.China has been waging a years-long campaign against what it calls terrorism and religious fanaticism in Xinjiang and the embassy's tweet referenced those polices, saying: “Study shows that in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uygur women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines."The tweet cited a study by Li Xiaoxia, a Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences researcher who has asserted that the birth control measures in Xinjiang are voluntary.Li’s papers in past years laid the theoretical foundations for justifying mass birth control measures. In one 2017 paper, Li said having many children was a sign of “religious extremism and ethnic separatism.” Li worried that predominantly minority districts were breeding grounds for terrorism, calling it “a big political risk.”Monday's news conference was the latest attempt by Beijing to deflect rising international criticism over its policies in Xinjiang, particularly over alleged forced labor and the detention of more than 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and others in prison-like centers for political indoctrination. China says the centers are intended to combat extremism and teach job skills, but former residents and rights groups say they target Islam and minority languages and culture.Elijan Anayat, another regional government spokesperson, said all those at the centers had “graduated" as of October 2019, countering reports that China continues to expand the system.“With the help of the government, they have achieved stable employment, improved the quality of life and lived a normal life,” Anayat said. “At present, there is no education and training center in Xinjiang.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-coercive-birth-control-measures-in-xinjiang-101610356520399.html

11-01-2021||World||China threatens 'counterstrike' over US contact with Taiwan||China on Monday threatened a "counterstrike" against a move by the United States to lift restrictions on official contacts with Taiwan as military tensions grow between Beijing and the self-ruled island.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday Washington would lift "complex internal restrictions" on contacts with Taipei by diplomats, after a year of mounting US-Chinese friction on topics including human rights, trade and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Beijing says Taiwan is an inviolable part of China to be reclaimed, by force if necessary, and opposes any diplomatic recognition of the democratic island.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Beijing "strongly condemns" the move and accused the United States of violating the terms of Washington's diplomatic relations with Beijing."Any action that harms China's core interests will receive a resolute counterstrike from China," Zhao warned, urging Pompeo to retract the decision or face "severe punishment".It was not clear what the change means in practice, with Pompeo saying executive branch communications with Taiwan will be handled by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which is owned by the US government and serves as the de facto embassy.The AIT was founded in 1979, when the United States extended diplomatic recognition to mainland China under a historic agreement requiring it to end formal recognition of Taiwan.But Washington remains a staunch ally of Taipei and is bound by Congress to sell it weapons for self-defence. It opposes any move to change Taiwan's current status by force.Military tensions between mainland China and Taiwan have grown sharper in the past year -- reaching their worst since the mid-1990s, some analysts say.Chinese jets made a record 380 incursions into Taiwan's defence zone last year, a military official said Tuesday.Beijing's animosity has increased dramatically since Tsai Ing-wen won election as Taiwan's president in 2016 -- she rejects Beijing's insistence that the island is part of "one China".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-counterstrike-over-us-contact-with-taiwan-101610357554027.html
11-01-2021||World||Indonesia approves emergency use of Covid-19 vaccine of China's Sinovac||Indonesia's Food and Drug Authority on Monday green-lighted emergency use of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd., with vaccinations of high-risk groups expected to start later this week.Conditional vaccination of healthcare workers and other civil servants using the vaccine, called CoronaVac, is expected to begin this week.“Based on the data and considering the guidance from (the World Health Organization), CoronaVac has met the requirements to get the permit to use the vaccine,” the chief of Indonesia Food and Drug Monitoring Agency, Penny Lukito, said at a news conference.Indonesian President Joko Widodo said he would be the first person to receive the vaccine.“Why is the President first? It's not about putting myself first, but to ensure everyone that this vaccine is safe and halal,” Widodo said on social media.The vaccine was cleared for emergency use after Indonesian authorities reviewed clinical trial data from Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia, which are all taking part in Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine.Brazil's Instituto Butantan said last week that the vaccine was 78% effective in mild cases and 100% effective against severe and moderate infections based on 220 COVID-19 cases from 13,000 volunteers.In December, Turkish authorities announced an efficacy rate of 91.25% from interim analysis of 29 cases in a trial with 7,371 volunteers. Some 12,450 volunteers, including 1,500 healthcare workers, are involved in the Phase III clinical trials. Further results have not been made publicly available.Indonesia conducted its own Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine with 1,620 volunteers. Results announced at Monday's news conference said the efficacy rate was 65.3 per cent.Indonesia's highest Islamic body, the Indonesian Ulema Council, announced last week that the COVID-19 vaccine is halal, or fit for consumption by Muslims, further paving the way for use and distribution in the world's most populous Muslim country.But some experts have said they would prefer more data from the clinical trials. Griffith University epidemiologist Dr. Dicky Budiman said that many people have questioned and expressed doubt about the vaccine, as the data Indonesia used for emergency authorisation is only preliminary.Research into the vaccine is not completed yet and will still take some time, he said.Sao Paulo's Butantan Institute, Sinovac Biotech Ltd.'s partner in Brazil, did not disclose data such as results by age and gender or the number of asymptomatic volunteers in the sample, which many epidemiologists require to assess whether the shot complies with safety standards. Officials in Brazil said details would be published after Brazil's health regulatory agency approves the vaccine.Authorities in China and Bolivia have both issued emergency authorization for the CoronaVac vaccine. Chinese health officials have said that some 9 million doses have been administered in China, though the number of people being vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine has not been disclosed. Bolivia has yet to start vaccinations with the CoronaVac vaccine.Several other countries that were not involved in clinical trials have signed agreements or are in negotiations to secure doses from Sinovac Biotech Ltd., including the Philippines, Singapore, Ukraine, Bolivia and others.Indonesia has recorded more than 828,000 cases of the virus, including over 24,000 deaths.

11-01-2021||World||Poll says China's export growth seen slowing in December; imports steady||China's exports likely grew solidly in December but at a slower pace than in the previous month, as demand from its coronavirus-hit trading partners cooled, while imports held steady, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.Exports likely rose 15% from a year earlier, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 25 economists, cooling from a 21.1% jump in November.Buoyant exports helped drive an impressive rebound in China's manufacturing sector last year, which aided the country's economic recovery from a coronavirus slump in early 2020."We think the recovery of global growth in previous months has likely continued to support export growth, but the higher demand for consumer goods before the holiday season may have unwound in December, which could be a small drag to export growth in December," Goldman Sachs economists said in a note.Analysts also said export growth was coming from a high base this time last year, likely weighing on the headline number.The forecast came in line with more modest growth in new export orders in manufacturing surveys in December.Imports likely rose 5% in December versus a year ago, the poll showed, still at a moderate pace but marginally higher than 4.5% in the previous month.Import growth was likely helped by improved construction demand due to ongoing stimulus, and favourable commodity prices, analysts said.China's trade surplus is expected to have narrowed a bit to $72.35 billion in December from $75.40 billion in November, according to the poll. The data will be released on Thursday.Chinese exports saw a robust performance in the second half of last year, helped by strong demand for Chinese goods and coronavirus-related disruptions to production in other countries. China managed to get the virus under control with strict lockdowns last year after the initial outbreak in late 2019 and early 2020.Some worry a recent rally in the local currency could squeeze exporters' profits and reduce overseas orders.The onshore yuan strengthened 6.7% in 2020 -- its first annual rise in three years. The yuan appreciation since May has led to sharp losses for some exporters, China's foreign exchange regulator said last month in a survey of foreign trade companies in eastern Shandong province.But UBS economist Tao Wang expects Chinese exports to grow a robust 10% in 2021, up from about 3% in 2020, as the global economy recovers with the help of multiple vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-export-growth-seen-slowing-in-december-imports-steady-poll-101610355515748.html
11-01-2021||World||Pakistan launches new anti-polio drive amid tight security||Despite a steady rise in coronavirus cases, Pakistan on Monday launched a five-day vaccination campaign against polio amid tight security, hoping to eradicate the crippling children’s disease this year.The drive is the first anti-polio campaign in 2021. The previous campaign took place last August — during a brief decline in fatalities and infections from the coronavirus — and included former Taliban strongholds bordering Afghanistan.This time, polio workers will try to vaccinate 40 million children across Pakistan while at the same time following social distancing measures and other precautions due to the coronavirus, said Zulfiqar Babakhel, a spokesman for the polio program.Supplementary vitamin A drops will be given to “help build general immunity," he said, adding that the polio workers will don gloves and face masks and go house-to-house during the campaign.There has lately been a steady increase in both fatalities from Covid-19 and the number of new infections in the country. Pakistan has registered more than 504,000 cases of the virus, including 10,676 deaths since the first infection was detected in February. On Monday, it reported 1,877 new cases and 32 deaths in the past 24 hours.Pakistan had hoped to eliminate polio back in 2018, when only 12 cases were reported. But in the years since there has been an uptick in new cases.Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two remaining countries in the world where polio is endemic, after Nigeria was last year declared free of the wild polio virus.Eradicating polio requires that more than 90% of children be immunized, typically in mass campaigns involving millions of health workers — a challenge under the coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed.The Taliban and other militants regularly stage attacks on polio teams and security forces escorting them, as well as vaccination centers and health workers, claiming the anti-polio drive is part of an alleged Western conspiracy to sterilize children or collect intelligence.These attacks increased after it was revealed that a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign was used as a ruse by the CIA in the hunt for al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was killed by US commandos in 2011 in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-launches-new-anti-polio-drive-amid-tight-security-101610355397004.html
11-01-2021||World||Bans on Parler and Trump show Big Tech’s power over web conversation||As Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. banished users and groups supporting the violent mobs at the US Capitol last week -- including President Donald Trump himself -- downloads surged for a less restrictive social media app called Parler. But in an effort to prevent further riot organizing, Google Inc. and Apple Inc. booted Parler from their app stores, and Amazon.com Inc. shut off its web services.“We will not cave to pressure from anti-competitive actors!” John Matze, Parler Inc.’s chief executive officer, said on his site Friday. “We WON’T cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!”In reality, Matze doesn’t have much choice. His free-speech-centric network, where some extremists turned to rally insurgents and organize future uprisings, was deemed an “ongoing and urgent public safety threat” by Google. Apple quickly rejected as insufficient a Parler plan to moderate its content. Amazon employees asked that the web giant “deny Parler services until it removes posts inciting violence, including at the Presidential inauguration.”Access to the website appeared to be cut off after midnight in California on Sunday when Amazon shut down access to its servers. With an internet ecosystem dominated by a few big players, the app has little chance of survival without access to these mainstream channels.The Parler restrictions underscore how technology companies have increasingly been held accountable for the potential consequences of what happens on their services, where they have greater visibility than governments do -- and the ability to take quicker action. For years, large tech companies avoided such debates by claiming to be content-neutral. Meddling and misinformation campaigns in the 2016 presidential election made it clear that these companies, and their software algorithms and content moderation, had real-world impact.Now, pressured by lawmakers, civil rights advocates and even their own workers, the big tech companies are realizing just how much power and responsibility they have over public conversation -- including over apps they didn’t create.Such monopoly-like powers are already under scrutiny by US regulators, with Google and Facebook battling government antitrust lawsuits. At the same time, the companies have come under fire for their lackadaisical practices on content moderation, when being too permissive on incendiary speech can lead to real-world violence or illegal activity.The tech companies’ moves were mostly applauded by government officials and critics, and many openly asked why it took so long to crack down. But their subjective nature worried some advocates.“It should concern everyone when companies like Facebook and Twitter wield the unchecked power to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable for the speech of billions -- especially when political realities make those decisions easier,” Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement after Trump was banned on the platforms. “It is our hope that these companies will apply their rules transparently to everyone.”Parler already faced major hurdles. The company is seeking to take on much larger services with established user bases, including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The Henderson, Nevada-based upstart network gained some traction in 2020 as it capitalized on fears of anti-conservative bias by the main platforms, and it worked. Backed by Trump supporter Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of hedge fund investor Robert Mercer, Parler was the top program on Apple’s App store Saturday before it was banned, with millions of total downloads. The app functions similarly to Twitter, where users post short messages in a feed where others can follow and interact.As Twitter and Facebook became increasingly willing to label or fact check Trump’s content in recent months, some Republican lawmakers and media figures, like South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and conservative radio personality Mark Levin, encouraged supporters to follow them on Parler. Yet because of its narrower focus on right-wing users seeking more freedom from the big tech company’s rules, some Parler users complained that it felt like an echo chamber of like-minded people rather than a place to engage in the debate -- or conflict -- that has become a hallmark of Twitter’s service. Trump himself doesn’t have a Parler account.While Facebook and Twitter have stricter content policies, those networks were also found to have hosted users planning the mob violence at the Capitol, including those who directed large followings to shift over to Parler. When it permanently axed Trump’s account, Twitter said it saw evidence of new riots planned for Jan. 17, while Facebook said it has so far taken down 600 militarized social groups, and was banning posts from those saying they planned to take weapons to government buildings.The platforms’ artificial intelligence has been improving at catching offending posts, in some cases before they are seen by a significant number of users. Even if the mainstream apps didn’t aggressively take down such content, the overwhelming volume of posts and users also probably means they’d be unlikely to face Parler-level scrutiny from app stores.“Perfect moderation is impossible but there’s a difference between trying and not trying,” wrote Benedict Evans, an independent technology analyst and former partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, on Twitter. “And these problems are independent of business model -- they apply to every network and model.”Parler CEO Matze encouraged users to find workarounds, like using the website on a browser or installing the app on Android phones through online stores besides Google Play. He also told them to cancel their Amazon subscriptions, dump Apple, and to “call, write and email your congressman and senators and expose this anti-competitive behavior.”On Sunday, after the crackdown on his app, Matze issued a statement to clarify his earlier comments.“In an interview this week, some believe I gave the impression that I somehow did not care whether Parler is used to incite violence. I want to set the record straight: That interpretation could not be further from the truth,” he said. “We do not condone or accept violence on our platform and we never will.”He said Parler’s community guidelines expressly prohibit threats of violence or incitement, and the company has been working to enforce the rules.Even as its technological backbone is disabled by the tech giants, Parler may continue to exist on a smaller scale. Google restricted Gab, another “free speech”-branded site popular with right-wing extremists, in 2017 for violating its hate speech policy. In 2018, Gab was banned by domain provider GoDaddy.com and PayPal after an anti-Semitic user shot 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Since the Capitol insurrection, Gab has been tweeting about such bans as a badge of honor, and noting that it’s seen a surge in users and job applications, necessitating new servers to keep the site running.“The paradigm shift to new platforms that support free speech will happen overnight,” Gab’s account tweeted. To Parler’s Matze, Gab said: “Best of luck, sincerely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bans-on-parler-and-trump-show-big-tech-s-power-over-web-conversation-101610354232832.html

It is not up to the scientific council to decide this, but we want to raise the issue."French authorities said on Sunday that the more infectious variant had now been detected in France's Mediterranean port of Marseille and in the Alps."The new Covid-19 variant is nearly a new epidemic within the epidemic," Fontanet said.He said the new variant was more contagious, but that for now there were no signs that its mortality rate was higher.Fontanet also said on BFM television that to get the epidemic under control, France needed to vaccinate 10 to 15 million people by the end of March and 25 to 30 million people by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-should-consider-closing-borders-with-uk-epidemiologist-101610355147698.html
11-01-2021||World||Washington mayor asks for increased security around Joe Biden's inauguration||Washington's mayor has asked for increased security around the inauguration of US President-elect Joe Biden after last week's storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.Describing last week's assault as an "unprecedented terrorist attack", Mayor Muriel Bowser said that Biden's inauguration on January 20 will require a "different approach" compared to past inaugurations."While I will be reaching out to a broad range of local, regional and federal partners to enhance cooperation among our bodies, I strongly urge the United States Department of Homeland Security to adjust its approach to the Inauguration in several specific ways", Bowser wrote in a letter to Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the department.The letter was dated Saturday and made available on Sunday.The storming of the Capitol building last week by Trump supporters delayed the certification of Biden's election victory.Trump, who has without evidence challenged the validity of Biden's election win, initially praised his supporters but later condemned the violence.Lawmakers were forced to flee, as the building was mobbed by the president's supporters who overwhelmed security forces. Five people died in the violence including one Capitol Police officer who was beaten as he tried to ward off the crowds.In her letter, Bowser said the District of Columbia was submitting a request for a "pre-disaster declaration" to allow for federal assistance.She also urged the Homeland Security Department to coordinate with the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, the Supreme Court and the Congress to establish a federal force deployment plan for all federal property.Washington remains on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration. The event traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city, but has been scaled back dramatically because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump said last week he would not attend Biden's inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-mayor-asks-for-increased-security-around-joe-biden-s-inauguration-101610354504892.html
11-01-2021||World||Conservative website Parler forced offline: Web trackers||The conservative social network Parler was forced offline Monday, tracking websites showed, after Amazon warned the company would lose access to its servers for its failure to properly police violent content.The site's popularity soared in recent weeks, becoming the number one free app in Apple's App Store after the much larger Twitter banned US President Trump from its platform for his role in inciting a riot at the US Capitol last week.Messages of support for Wednesday's attack in Washington DC -- along with calls for new demonstrations -- had flourished on the platform, leading Google to remove it from its app store on Friday, followed by Apple on Saturday.Amazon then confirmed it would suspend the platform from its cloud hosting services for allowing "threats of violence."In a letter to the Parler's owners, the web giant said it would suspend service by 11:59 PM on Sunday (0759 GMT Monday).Tracking website Down For Everyone Or Just Me showed Parler offline just after midnight, suggesting its owners had not been able to find a new hosting partner.In a series of posts on Parler on Saturday, CEO John Matze said the site would go down the following day, and accused the tech giants of a "war on free speech.""They will NOT win! We are the worlds last hope for free speech and free information," he said.Parler did not respond to a request for comment from AFP.The social network, launched in 2018, operates much like Twitter, with profiles people can follow and "parleys" instead of tweets.In its early days, the platform attracted a crowd of ultra-conservative or even extreme-right users.But it now attracts many more traditional Republican voices.Fox News star host Sean Hannity has 7.6 million followers, while his colleague Tucker Carlson has 4.4 million.Elected officials present include Republicans Devin Nunes, a California congressman, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.Trump is not known to have a Parler profile.Parler's recent growth was supercharged after last week's violence in DC as new users, furious over Twitter's ban on Trump, flocked to the app calling for fresh protests.In one now-deleted post, an account purporting to belong to Lin Wood, a pro-Trump lawyer, called for Vice President Mike Pence to be put in front of a firing squad -- threats which US media have reported led to a secret service investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conservative-website-parler-forced-offline-web-trackers-101610354236728.html
11-01-2021||World||Joe Biden faces challenge in guiding America past Trump era||President-elect Joe Biden appeared on television last week as a bipartisan group of lawmakers huddled in an undisclosed location to protect them from a violent mob that was ransacking the U.S. Capitol.“The whole room went silent,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., recalled as everyone listened to Biden denounce the insurrection and call for calm.The respectful manner in which the lawmakers listened to Biden during one of America's darkest moments gave Klobuchar hope that the new president has an opportunity to guide the country past the tumultuous final stretch of Donald Trump's presidency.That's quickly becoming one of Biden's top tasks as he prepares to take office on Jan. 20. It's an immensely complex challenge, requiring him to balance demands for accountability after Trump incited the riot against those who worry about further dividing the country.Any misstep could not only intensify the nation's polarization, but threaten Biden's ability to win quick congressional approval of his Cabinet picks and other priorities such as coronavirus response legislation.For now, Biden seems content to leave decisions about Trump's fate to Congress.“What the Congress decides to do is for them to decide," Biden told reporters last week. “But I’m going to have to and they’re going to have to be ready to hit the ground running, because when Kamala (Harris) and I are sworn in, we’re going to be introducing, immediately, significant pieces of legislation that will deal with the virus, deal with the economy, and deal with economic growth.”Two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, have called on Trump to resign.Absent that, House Democrats are moving quickly to introduce articles of impeachment on Monday and vote as soon as Tuesday. That would give an outlet for lawmakers to formally condemn Trump, but would delay a Senate trial until after Biden addresses other priorities during his first 100 days.Biden essentially framed his presidential campaign as a response to Trump, pledging to “restore the soul” of America. He has said he decided to seek the White House after watching Trump say there were “very fine people on both sides” of a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.Still, the insurrection sharpens the debate over how to break with the Trump era.Many Democrats say the best way for Biden to unify the nation and restore faith in government is to achieve tangible results on issues that matter to all Americans, including the coronavirus pandemic and the economy.“We need to get the vaccine out," she said. “We need to get the economy back to where it was so that’s number one on his agenda number one on our agenda so you start with what’s number one on everyone’s agenda."Steve Israel, a former New York Democratic congressman, said that in his experience in Congress, when lawmakers “sense that things are going too far, you want to take a few steps back.”“I think that there are a lot of Republicans now who are going to want to take a few steps back towards the middle,” he said.But he also emphasized that if Biden hopes to move past Trump, he’ll need to move fast to show that bipartisan action is possible.“If President Biden tests the appetite of Republicans to try and get a quick and substantive win on a Covid relief package, or perhaps infrastructure investments, that will send a message to the entire country that bipartisanship and healing is possible,” he said.Biden will also have to navigate a number of ongoing investigations into Trump’s actions during the U.S. Capitol breach and in trying to pressure state officials to overturn the results of the election in his favor.He has repeatedly said that his Justice Department will remain entirely independent and that he won’t interfere in any ongoing investigations into his predecessor.Democrats say that’s exactly the tone they’d like him to take. But it’s also important, as Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy put it, to hold those involved in the events of this week accountable.“There were an enormous number of crimes, felonies, that were committed. We have to make sure those are handled,” he said. “If we just totally ignore it, we tell everybody else you can commit any crime you want because the Congress will ignore it.”So far, at least 90 people have been arrested on charges ranging from misdemeanor curfew violations to felonies related to assaults on police officers, possessing illegal weapons and making death threats against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California.While Democrats emphasize that they want Biden to focus on the issues confronting his administration and not the investigations into his predecessor, they also say it’s important to address the systemic issues again laid bare by the unequal police treatment of the violent Capitol rioters.Many have noted that the police presence and response to the largely white mob was far smaller and less aggressive than that seen at a number of peaceful Black Lives Matter protests where the crowd was much more diverse. It’s important, said Democratic strategist Karen Finney, for Biden to acknowledge that.“This is who we are but it’s not who we have to be,” she said. ”If that’s the message, it would be a powerful one to try to start to bring us together.”The last time the nation faced such serious questions about how a new president would respond to the actions of his predecessor was in 1974. Gerald Ford assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace over his role in the Watergate break-in.Ford ultimately pardoned Nixon, a move that was initially deeply unpopular but was later viewed as an important step toward healing.Historian Mark Updegrove, the president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation, said that because of the magnitude of Trump’s actions — and the fact that the country is far more divided over his presidency than they were on Nixon’s — it’s better for Biden to stay away from any actions taken against Trump once he leaves office.“Richard Nixon, while he lied to the American people and participated in obstructing justice in the Watergate investigation, he did not orchestrate an insurrection on our Capitol and try to overturn the election,” he said.“Biden has to be very conscious of dealing with President Trump," Updegrove continued. "I think it’s probably rightfully left in the hands of Congress right now, and the judicial branch.”Klobuchar will play a leading role into a bipartisan investigation into what went wrong at the Capitol, and said whatever her team finds, it will be up to the Justice Department to decide how to act.But the senator said the inauguration itself may offer the most important opportunity for Biden to set a forward-looking tone.“I can’t think of another year that the peaceful transition of power was more important than this one,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-faces-challenge-in-guiding-america-past-trump-era-101610353921992.html
11-01-2021||World||US plans to designate Yemen's Houthi movement as foreign terror group||worldThe United States plans to designate Yemen's Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late on Sunday, a move that diplomats and aid groups worry could threaten peace talks and complicate efforts to combat the world's largest humanitarian crisis.The decision to blacklist the Iran-aligned group, which was first reported by Reuters hours earlier, comes as the administration of President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take over from the Trump administration on Jan. 20."The Department of State will notify Congress of my intent to designate Ansar Allah sometimes referred to as the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)", Pompeo said in a statement late on Sunday.The Trump administration has been piling on sanctions related to Iran in recent weeks, prompting some Biden allies and outside analysts to conclude that Trump aides are seeking to make it harder for the incoming administration to re-engage with Iran and rejoin an international nuclear agreement."I also intend to designate three of Ansar Allah's leaders, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Din al-Houthi, and Abdullah Yahya al Hakim, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists", Pompeo said.The United States planned to put in place measures to reduce the impact of the step on humanitarian activity and imports into Yemen, he added.Pompeo said that with the implementation of these designations on Jan. 19, the U.S. Treasury Department will provide some licenses that will apply to some humanitarian activities conducted by non-governmental organizations in Yemen and to certain transactions related to exports to Yemen of critical commodities like food and medicine.The Treasury Department has the power to carve out exceptions by issuing special licenses to humanitarian groups to ship food and medical supplies to heavily sanctioned countries, as it has done with Iran and Venezuela.The designation has been the subject of weeks of fierce debate within the Trump administration and internal disagreements over how to carve out exceptions for aid shipments held up a final decision on the blacklisting, multiple sources told Reuters.A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthi group. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the Covid-19 pandemic.The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need of help. Top U.N. officials have warned that millions of people are facing famine and more money is needed to deliver aid.The Houthi group is the de facto authority in northern Yemen and aid agencies have to work with it to deliver assistance. Aid workers and supplies also come in through Houthi-controlled Sanaa airport and Hodeidah port."This serves no interest at all," Ryan Crocker, a retired U.S. ambassador who served in the Middle East, said of the designation. "Are there elements among the Houthis who have been involved in terrorist acts? Sure. Just as with other groups in the Middle East.""The Houthis are an integral part of Yemeni society. They always have been. This is making a strategic enemy out of a local force that has been part of Yemen for generations. They are not Iranian pawns."In November U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Yemen was in "imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades," warning against any unilateral moves as the United States threatened to blacklist the Houthis.A spokesman for Guterres declined to comment on Sunday. Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But international relief officials have said such measures have often failed to unblock the flow of aid because banks and insurance companies are worried about running afoul of U.S. sanctions, and that this could also be the case with Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-to-designate-yemen-s-houthi-movement-as-foreign-terror-group-101610344714499.html
11-01-2021||World||President-elect Joe Biden pushes for USD 2000 'stimulus check' for Americans||US President-elect Joe Biden has called for a USD 2,000 "stimulus checks" to his fellow Americans, arguing that the current USD 6,00 coronavirus relief payment is not enough to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table.Biden has called the current USD 600 round of cash a "down payment," and early last week he said USD 2,000 checks would go out "immediately" if his party took control of both houses of Congress.With the Democrats now having a majority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, and Biden set to be sworn in as the 46th President of the US on January 20, the former vice president is likely to push for a new stimulus package later this month."USD 600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying rent or putting food on the table. We need USD 2,000 stimulus checks," Biden said on Sunday.Outgoing US President Donald Trump has also pitched for a USD 2,000 check. In December, the House of Representatives also passed a bill. However, the move was blocked by the Republicans who then had a majority in the Upper Chambers.Two Indian-American lawmakers, Congressman Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal, have also demanded USD 2,000 stimulus checks for Americans.Biden is expected to present more details on his proposal in the coming week. But he has been talking about moving rapidly to get USD 2,000 into the hands of Americans.Biden made the call for new assistance - including boosting stimulus checks to USD 2,000 - after an unexpectedly poor December jobs report that reflected a plunge in restaurant employment. President Trump signed a USD 900 billion relief bill last month, which included supplemental unemployment benefits extended to mid-March - a timeframe that could serve as a deadline forlawmakers to move on to the next package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/presidentelect-joe-biden-pushes-for-usd-2000-stimulus-check-for-americans-101610343532429.html
11-01-2021||World||EXPLAINER: Why Indonesia's plane safety record is a concern||Saturday's plane crash in Indonesia, in which a Sriwijaya Air carrying 62 people plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, has once again cast the limelight on the safety of the country's aviation industry.Indonesia's aviation record is one of the worst in Asia, with more civilian airliner passenger accidents since 1945 than any other country in the region. Past accidents have been attributed to poor pilot training, mechanical failures, air traffic control issues and poor aircraft maintenance.While experts say there have been many improvements in recent years, the latest crash has experts questioning the true progress of Indonesia's aviation oversight and regulation.WHY HAS INDONESIA HAD SO MANY PLANE CRASHES?It's due to a combination of economic, social and geographical factors.The industry had little regulation or oversight in the early years of Indonesia's aviation boom, after the economy was opened following the fall of Suharto in the late 1990s and end of decades of dictatorships.Low-cost air carriers bloomed and flying became a common way for people to travel across the vast archipelago nation where many areas still lack efficient or safe transportation infrastructure.According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, Indonesia has had 104 civilian airliner accidents with over 1,300 related fatalities since 1945, ranking it as the most dangerous place to fly in Asia.The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country from 2007 to 2016 because they were “deficient in one or more areas, such as technical expertise, trained personnel, record-keeping or inspection procedures.” The European Union had a similar ban from 2007 until 2018.HAVE THINGS IMPROVED?Yes, they have.“Engagement with the industry has significantly improved and oversight has become more rigorous,” aviation expert and editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com Geoffrey Thomas told The Associated Press.That includes more frequent inspections, stronger regulation of maintenance facilities and procedures, and better pilot training, he said.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration granted Indonesia a Category 1 rating in 2016, meaning it determined that the country complied with International Civil Aviation Organization safety standards.WHY DID THE LATEST CRASH HAPPEN?It's too soon to tell. The plane left from Jakarta during heavy rain, but experts said poor weather was among several possible reasons, including human error and the plane's condition.Fishermen in the vicinity of the crash said they heard an explosion, followed by debris and fuel surrounding their boat. But heavy rain impaired their vision and they were unable to see much more.Sriwijaya Air has had only minor incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when one of its planes went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue.The airline's president director, Jefferson Irwin Jauwena, said the plane that crashed was airworthy. It was a Boeing 737-500 that was 26 years old and had previously been flown by airlines in the United States. He told reporters the plane was flown earlier in the same day of the crash.But experts said an investigation is needed to determine whether the plane was in fact fit to fly.WHEN WILL WE KNOW MORE?Plane parts are among the debris being recovered from the water and could provide insight. The location of the black boxes in seabed mud has been identified, and divers and others are working to retrieve the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the sea.But the investigation could take weeks, likely months, said Indonesian aviation consultant Gerry Soejatman.Indonesia is expected to lead the investigation, with international observers typically welcomed as well. There should be an interim report from Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee within a month, Soejatman said.“The analysis will start with that report," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-why-indonesia-s-plane-safety-record-is-a-concern-101610342926353.html

11-01-2021||World||Democrats give Mike Pence 24 hours to oust Donald Trump as US President||US Democrats plan to pass a resolution in the House of Representatives on Monday calling upon Vice-President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment of the constitution to remove President Donald Trump from office, declaring him “unable to successfully discharge the duties and powers of his office”.They will wait for 24 hours for Pence to do so and then, on Tuesday, they will introduce a legislation to impeach the president, charging him with, according to a draft in circulation, “incitement of insurrection” for the January 6 storming of the Capitol by his supporters.The first part of the Democrats’ plan to remove Trump from office was a demand for him to resign on his own “immediately”. That did not happen.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter on Sunday to fellow Democrats that a resolution will be moved in the morning that “calls on the vice-president to convene and mobilise the cabinet to activate the 25th amendment to declare the president incapable of executing the duties of his office, after which the vice-president would immediately exercise powers as acting president”.“We are calling on the vice-president to respond within 24 hours,” Pelosi added. “Next, we will proceed with bringing impeachment legislation to the floor.”Pence is said to have been reluctant over Trump’s removal as the president through the use of either the 25th amendment or impeachment process, fearing that it could push Trump to act rashly. But Pence has eventually retained the option of invoking the 25th amendment if Trump “become more unstable”, according to reports citing sources close to him. Democrats are moving swiftly to hold Trump responsible for the storming of the Capitol. Inflamed by Trump, his son Don Trump Jr and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani at a rally nearby, supporters stormed the Capitol aiming to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory. They had forced their way in, overpowering the Capitol’s security. They vandalised offices and forced lawmakers to hide wherever they could. They had roamed the corridors chanting “Hang Mike Pence” and “Where’s Nancy”.The resolution to oust Trump from the presidency slated to be introduced Monday will recount the Capitol attack in details, setting up the impeachment legislation. Trump “tweeted to his supporters that ‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country’ after the Capitol had been overrun and the vice-president was in hiding”, the resolution said, highlighting a particularly sore time in their relationship.People close to Pence have said, according to reports, the vice-president was disappointed that Trump did not call to check on him and family at the time when they were sheltering for their lives. He has not called up still, reportedly. But Pence is playing his cards close to the chest. He has not publicly criticised Trump or complained explicitly.But he has signalled his frustration and disappointment with Trump’s payback for his four years of loyalty through some of the most challenging times. Pence plans to attend Biden’s inauguration in a striking repudiation of Trump, who will not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-give-mike-pence-24-hours-to-oust-donald-trump-as-us-president-101610341052027.html
11-01-2021||World||Indonesia intensifies search for crashed plane's black boxes||The search for the black boxes of a crashed Sriwijaya Air jet intensified Monday to boost the investigation into what caused the plane carrying 62 people to nosedive at high velocity into the Java Sea.The Boeing 737-500 jet disappeared minutes after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, during heavy rain on Saturday, and the search so far has yielded plane parts and human remains but no sign of survivors.Authorities have said signals from the boxes containing the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were detected between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain just north of Jakarta's coast. Officials said they have marked a location where the sounds were being emitted from the black boxes, which detached from the tail of the aircraft when it plummeted into the sea.The cockpit voice recorder holds conversations between pilots, and the data recorder tracks electronic information such as airspeed, altitude and vertical acceleration. When found, they will be transported to port and handed to the National Transportation Safety Committee overseeing the crash investigation.More than a dozen helicopters, 53 navy ships and 20 boats, and 2,600 rescue personnel have been searching since Sunday and have found parts of the plane in the water at a depth of 23 meters (75 feet), leading rescuers to continue searching the area.Television footages showed landing gear, wheels and a jet engine among the parts found, while other rescuers brought a dozen body bags containing human remains to a police hospital in eastern Jakarta for the identification process.The National Search and Rescue Agency chief Bagus Puruhito said divers using high-tech “ping locator” equipment were looking for an identified target beneath 20 meters (65 feet) of seabed mud.The transport committee’s chairman, Soerjanto Tjahjono, said the black boxes could provide valuable information to investigators. Once the device is found and taken to the investigators' facility, it will take three to five days to dry and clean the device and to download its data, Tjahjono said.He said it need more time to analyze it, “depending on the complexity of the problem.”The committee’s investigator Nurcahyo Utomo, said they have collected recordings and transcripts of the conversation between the pilot and air traffic controllers as part of their investigation into the cause of the crash.Utomo said his team is still examining radar data on the plane’s movements and interviewed the air traffic officers who were in charge of controlling the crashed flight. More interviews of witnesses, including with the airlines’ technicians, fishermen and experts, will be done in the near future.Investigators are investigating all parts of the plane found by searchers from the seafloor such as the Ground Proximity Warning System, a device that could warn the pilot if the plane is too close to the ground, a radio altimeter and several other parts mostly from the lower side of the aircraft’s tail, Utomo said.He said that Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau will help his committee in searching for the black boxes and the United States’ National Transportation Safety Board will join in investigating the crash.Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation, with more than 260 million people, has been plagued by transportation accidents on land, sea and air because of overcrowding on ferries, aging infrastructure and poorly enforced safety standards.In October 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air plunged into the Java Sea just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. The plane involved in Saturday’s disaster did not have the automated flight-control system that played a role in the Lion Air crash and another crash of a 737 MAX 8 jet in Ethiopia five months later, leading to the grounding of the MAX 8 for 20 months.The Lion Air crash was Indonesia’s worst airline disaster since 1997, when 234 people were killed on a Garuda airlines flight near Medan on Sumatra island. In December 2014, an AirAsia flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore plunged into the sea, killing 162 people.Sriwijaya Air has had only minor incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when a plane went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue.The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country in 2007, but reversed the decision in 2016, citing improvements in compliance with international aviation standards. The European Union has previously had similar bans, lifting them in June 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-intensifies-search-for-crashed-plane-s-black-boxes-101610335423667.html

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.The Shia community had been protesting against the killing of miners from the last six days.The Baloch Republican Party said that Imran Khan government is deliberately turning a deaf ear to the voices of Balochs, Hazaras, Sindhis and minorities.BRP spokesperson Sher Mohammad Bugti said in a tweet that the latest case of the brutal killing of 11 Hazaras is another testimony to the lawlessness and persecution of minorities in Pakistan."Imran Khan government is deliberately turning a deaf ear to the voices of Balochs, Hazaras, Sindhis and minorities who just seek a peaceful life with dignity," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-cleric-demands-imran-khan-to-end-killings-of-pakistan-s-minorities-101610335417891.html
11-01-2021||World||Businesses rethink political donations after US Capitol siege||Businesses are rethinking political contributions in the wake of the deadly Capitol siege by President Donald Trump’s supporters on Wednesday.Citigroup confirmed Sunday that it is pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year. Others, like Marriott, are only stopping donations to the 147 Republicans who opposed certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election.In a memo to employees Friday, Citi’s head of global government affairs Candi Wolff said “we want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.”“We support engaging with our political leaders even when we disagree, and our PAC is an important tool for that engagement,” Wolff wrote, adding that the company in 2019 donated $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who represents a state in which Citi has a lot of employees.In all, Citi's political action committee donated $742,000 to federal candidates in 2019-2020 according to OpenSecrets, a group that tracks political donations. Of this, $413,500 — or about 56% — went to Republicans and the rest to Democrats.Unlike other companies, Citi says it is pausing all federal contributions. Medical device maker Boston Scientific said Sunday it is doing the same, while it reviews its approach to political donations. The company said it believes in “respecting the integrity of the democratic process, the election outcome and the peaceful transition of power.”The trade group representing one of the nation’s best known health insurance brands, meanwhile, said it’s suspending political contributions to lawmakers who voted last week to reject the Electoral College results that cemented Democrat Joe Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump in the November election.The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association represents 36 regional and local insurers who use the brand, together covering about 1 in 3 Americans.In a statement, Kim Keck, the group’s CEO and president, says it will continue to support lawmakers and candidates in both political parties who “will work with us to build a stronger, healthier nation.”Hotel giant Marriott said Sunday it has taken “the destructive events at the Capitol to undermine a legitimate and fair election into consideration” and will be pause political donations to those who voted against certification of the election.The company's PAC has donated $108,500 to Democrats and $89,500 to Republicans in the 2019-2020 federal election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/businesses-rethink-political-donations-after-us-capitol-siege-101610335177805.html

The country also saw 18 new imported infections from overseas.The total number of new Covid-19 cases stood at 103, the highest since 127 cases were reported on July 30.Though the new cases being reported in recent days remain a small fraction of what the country saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020, authorities are moving aggressively to curb the spread of the disease and prevent another national wave of infections.Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital and the epicentre of the new outbreak in the province, is in lockdown, with people and vehicles barred from leaving the city as authorities move to curb the spread of the disease. Public transport in the city has also been halted.The city's steps are in line with a usual package of Covid-19 restrictions local authorities in China implement when they see a cluster emerge.Wangkui county, under the jurisdiction of Suihua city in Heilongjiang province, reported eight new asymptomatic cases and moved on Monday to close all non-essential businesses, banned people from leaving the city and blocked all non-essential traffic, state television also reported.Each family in the county can have one person leave their home once every three days to buy necessities, the report said.Hebei's highway authority said on Monday that multiple sections of highways in the province have been closed for Covid-19 prevention and that vehicles registered to Shijiazhuang and Xingtai will be asked to go back. The latter city has also reported Covid-19 cases in recent days.The NHC reported 76 new asymptomatic patients for all of mainland China, up from 27 a day earlier. China does not count these individuals, who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but not exhibiting symptoms, as confirmed Covid-19 cases.Total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 87,536, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sees-biggest-daily-covid-19-case-rise-in-over-5-months-101610330406736.html
11-01-2021||World||Kim Jong Un gets a new job title: General secretary of ruling party||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was given a new title, “general secretary” of the ruling Workers’ Party, formerly held by his late father and grandfather, state media reported Monday, in what appears to a symbolic move aimed at bolstering his authority amid growing economic challenges.The party’s ongoing congress, the first in kind in five years, announced Kim’s new title during its sixth-day session on Sunday. A congress statement said Kim “has gloriously realized the historic mission to complete the country’s nuclear build-up plan,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency.It’s largely a symbolic appointment as Kim already was the party’s top leader. During a 2016 party congress, he was named to “party chairman,” the equivalent of “general secretary” held by his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung. Before the 2016 congress, Kim Jong Un had led the party with the title of “first secretary.”Since inheriting power upon his father’s death in late 2011, Kim, 37, has gradually consolidated his grip on power through a series of high-profile executions and purges that removed his potential rivals. He has also taken up a spate of top jobs that includes chairman of the State Affairs Commission and supreme commander of the North’s 1.2 million-member military, along with the top party post.The two late North Korean leaders have kept posthumous titles — Kim Jong Il remains “eternal general secretary” and Kim Il Sung is “eternal president.”The Kim family has ruled North Korea with a strong personality cult that elevated key family members to a god-like status since Kim Il Sung founded the country in 1948. Their family’s mythical “Paektu” bloodline, named after the highest peak on the Korean Peninsula, only gives their direct family members the rights to rule the impoverished yet nuclear-armed nation.Among notable personnel changes announced Monday was the name of Kim Jong Un’s influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, missing from a new list of officials at the party’s powerful Politburo. Being in charge of relations with rival South Korea, she was an alternate member of the Politburo and some observers earlier predicted she would be promoted to a full member of the bureau in a bid by her brother to reinforce the Kim family’s rule. It wasn’t immediately clear why the 32-year-old was dismissed from her Politburo post.On Sunday, state media said the congress had determined to change the party’s “Executive Policy Council into Secretariat.” The decision would lead to party officials to relinquish their current titles such as chairman and vice chairman and start using old titles such as secretary or vice secretary.Under the previous title systems, there were too many chairmen and vice chairmen at various levels and authorities likely thought that wasn’t helpful for Kim Jong Un’s authority, Cheong Seong-Chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center’s Asia Program said. He said Kim was believed to have restored the old “general secretary” title because that would benefit his dictatorship.Kim has previously inherited other high-profile titles by his father and grandfather, such as the military's supreme commander.The congress is being held as Kim faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule amid the COVID-19 pandemic and following a series of natural disasters this past summer.During the congress, Kim Jong Un vowed to enlarge his nuclear arsenal and build more sophisticated weapons systems to cope with what he calls intensifying U.S. hostile policy. He also admitted a previous five-year economic development plan failed and disclosed a new development that focuses on building a stronger self-reliant economy.Kim has pushed the so-called “byungjin” policy of simultaneously seeking economic growth and the expansion of his nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the U.S. After claiming to have achieved the ability to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons, Kim launched high-stakes summits Trump in 2018, but their diplomacy later fell apart due to wrangling over the sanctions the following year.South Korea’s military said Monday it has obtained intelligence showing North Korea staged a military parade at a Pyongyang square the previous night. A statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it was checking whether that was an actual parade or its rehearsal.South Korea’s spy agency earlier said the North would hold a massive military parade in celebrations of the congress and in show of force against the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-gets-a-new-job-title-general-secretary-of-ruling-party-101610328562501.html

The power supply has now been restored in parts of Pakistan.According to Federal Minister for Energy Omar Ayub Khan power has been restored at all Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco) stations. It was resumed in Gujarat and Mandi Bahauddin districts.Power was also restored at the 500kv Rawat-Naukhar circuit and the 500kv Tarberla-Rawat circuit as well.Omar Ayub in his Twitter post said that 132kv grid stations around Lahore have been energised including Shadman, Qartaba, Mc Leod Road, Gulshan Ravi, Fort, Saidpur, Shamke, Sagihan, Ravi, Bund Road, Badami Bagh, Sabzar, Sheikhupura, Orient, and Sapphire.Earlier, in a tweet, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat said the blackout was caused by the tripping of the National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) system.Later, Omar Ayub explained that the power breakdown occurred when the frequency in the national power distribution system (NTDC) suddenly fell from 50 to zero.Following the blackout, citizens took to social media to vent their ire on the situation and mocked Prime Minister Imran Khan for his inability to handle the crises Pakistan is going through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-officials-suspended-for-negligence-after-massive-power-failure-in-pakistan-101610326204011.html

It (the hearing) isn't a constitutional or legal one as it's a political query on how a country is governed and how it should be governed. The court should dismiss it as no answer is required," Oli said while addressing the Upper House on Sunday."Political decisions would direct politics as per the constitution, and democratic values are paving the way to go ahead. The current situation would also pass in similar ways. It is based on the doctrine of necessity," Oli added.A total of 13 petitions are filed in the Supreme Court of Nepal, challenging the decision of Oli and President Bidhya Devi Bhandari to dissolve the House of Representatives, the lower house parliament, claiming it unconstitutional. The apex court has yet to give a verdict on the writ petitions.Following the dissolution of the Lower House and the announcement of midterm elections, the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) witnessed its vertical split as the already-strained ties between the two rival factions of the party have further deepened.The Oli-led faction of the ruling party is backing the dissolution of the House while the other faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal is firmly opposing the government's move and demanding the restoration of parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parliament-dissolution-a-political-issue-sc-should-dismiss-the-case-nepal-pm-oli-101610325931004.html

Trump made the decision independently of public pressure, a person familiar with the matter said.“He made the ultimate sacrifice, for the greater glory, and laid down his life in protection of our democracy,” Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, said in a letter to Trump on Sunday. Noting that the flag over the Capitol dome has been lowered to half-staff, she said “we ask that the flag flown above the White House be ordered to do the same.”The White House flag was lowered in early afternoon. Flags at the neighboring Eisenhower Executive Office Building hadn’t been lowered as of 4 p.m. Sunday.Trump hasn’t contacted Sicknick’s family to offer his condolences, the New York Times quoted an unidentified aide to Vice President Mike Pence as saying.Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, earlier on Sunday ordered all US and Virginia flags to be flown at half-staff to honor Sicknick, a resident of suburban Virginia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-lowers-white-house-flag-after-capitol-police-death-in-riot-101610325451229.html
11-01-2021||World||House 'will proceed' to impeachment of Trump: Pelosi||House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday the House will proceed with legislation to impeach President Donald Trump, calling him a threat to democracy after the deadly assault on the Capitol.Pelosi made the announcement in a letter to colleagues. She said the House will act with solemnity but also urgency with just days remaining before Trump is to leave office on Jan. 20.“In protecting our Constitution and our Democracy, we will act with urgency, because this President represents an imminent threat to both,” she said.“The horror of the ongoing assault on our democracy perpetrated by this President is intensified and so is the immediate need for action.”With impeachment planning intensifying, two Republican senators want Trump to resign immediately as efforts mount to prevent Trump from ever again holding elective office in the wake of deadly riots at the Capitol.House Democrats are expected to introduce articles of impeachment on Monday and vote as soon as Tuesday. The strategy would be to condemn the president's actions swiftly but delay an impeachment trial in the Senate for 100 days. That would allow President-elect Joe Biden to focus on other priorities as soon as he is inaugurated Jan. 20.Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third-ranking House Democrat and a top Biden ally, laid out the ideas Sunday as the country came to grips with the siege at the Capitol by Trump loyalists trying to overturn the election results.“Let’s give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running,” Clyburn said.Pressure was mounting for Trump to leave office even before his term ended amid alarming concerns of more unrest ahead of the inauguration. The president whipped up the mob that stormed the Capitol, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five dead.Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Sunday joined Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in calling for Trump to “resign and go away as soon as possible."“I think the president has disqualified himself from ever, certainly, serving in office again,” Toomey said. “I don’t think he is electable in any way.”Murkowski, who has long voiced her exasperation with Trump’s conduct in office, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply “needs to get out.” A third Republican, Sen. Roy Blunt, of Missouri, did not go that far, but on Sunday he warned Trump to be “very careful” in his final days in office.Corporate America began to tie its reaction to the Capitol riots by tying them to campaign contributions.Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's CEO and President Kim Keck said it will not contribute to those lawmakers — all Republicans — who supported challenges to Biden's Electoral College win. The group “will suspend contributions to those lawmakers who voted to undermine our democracy," Kim said.Citigroup did not single out lawmakers aligned with Trump's effort to overturn the election, but said it would be pausing all federal political donations for the first three months of the year. Citi’s head of global government affairs, Candi Wolff, said in a Friday memo to employees, “We want you to be assured that we will not support candidates who do not respect the rule of law.”House leaders, furious after the insurrection, appear determined to act against Trump despite the short timeline.Late Saturday, Pelosi, D-Calif., convened a conference call with her leadership team and sent a letter to her colleagues reiterating that Trump must be held accountable. She told her caucus, now scattered across the country on a two-week recess, to “be prepared to return to Washington this week” but did not say outright that there would be a vote on impeachment.“It is absolutely essential that those who perpetrated the assault on our democracy be held accountable,” Pelosi wrote. “There must be a recognition that this desecration was instigated by the President.”Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said an impeachment trial could not begin under the current calendar before Inauguration Day, Jan. 20.Clyburn said that Pelosi "will make the determination as when is the best time” to send articles of impeachment to the Senate if and when they are passed by the House.Another idea being considered was to have a separate vote that would prevent Trump from ever holding office again. That could potentially only need a simple majority vote of 51 senators, unlike impeachment, in which two-thirds of the 100-member Senate must support a conviction.The Senate was set to be split evenly at 50-50, but under Democratic control once Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and the two Democrats who won Georgia's Senate runoff elections last week are sworn in. Harris would be the Senate's tie-breaking vote.House Democrats were considering two possible packages of votes: one on setting up a commission to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office and one on the impeachment charge of abuse of power.Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., who was part of the weekend leadership call, said he expected a “week of action” in the House.While many have criticized Trump, Republicans have said that impeachment would be divisive in a time of unity.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that instead of coming together, Democrats want to “talk about ridiculous things like ‘Let’s impeach a president’" with just days left in office.Still, some Republicans might be supportive.Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said he would take a look at any articles that the House sent over. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a frequent Trump critic, said he would “vote the right way” if the matter were put in front of him.The Democratic effort to stamp Trump's presidential record — for the second time — with the indelible mark of impeachment had advanced rapidly since the riot.Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I, a leader of the House effort to draft impeachment articles accusing Trump of inciting insurrection, said Sunday that his group had 200-plus co-sponsors.The articles, if passed by the House, could then be transmitted to the Senate for a trial, with senators acting as jurors to acquit or convict Trump. If convicted, Trump would be removed from office and succeeded by the vice president. It would be the first time a US president had been impeached twice.Potentially complicating Pelosi's decision about impeachment was what it meant for Biden and the beginning of his presidency. While reiterating that he had long viewed Trump as unfit for office, Biden on Friday sidestepped a question about impeachment, saying what Congress did “is for them to decide.”A violent and largely white mob of Trump supporters overpowered police, broke through security lines and windows and rampaged through the Capitol on Wednesday, forcing lawmakers to scatter as they were finalizing Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College.Toomey appeared on CNN's “State of the Union” and NBC's “Meet the Press.” Clyburn was on “Fox News Sunday” and CNN. Kinzinger was on ABC's “This Week,” Blunt was on CBS' “Face the Nation” and Rubio was on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/house-will-proceed-to-impeachment-of-trump-trump-101610323482074.html

Three years earlier, they had also found a 9-foot 3-inch giraffe in a Ugandan wildlife park. They published their findings in the British Medical Journal at the end of last month.In both cases, the giraffes had the standard long necks but short, stumpy legs, the paper said. Skeletal dysplasia, the medical name for the condition, affects humans and domesticated animals, but the paper said it was rare to see in wild animals.Footage taken by the foundation showed the Ugandan giraffe standing on thick, muscled legs in the dry savanna of Murchison Falls national park in northern Uganda, while a taller animal with the usual long, stick-like legs walked behind it.“Unfortunately there’s probably no benefit at all. Giraffes have grown taller to reach the taller trees,” Fennessy said. He added that it would most likely be physically impossible for them to breed with their normal-sized counterparts. Numbers of the world’s tallest mammal have declined by some 40% over the past 30 years to around 111,000, so all four species are classified by conservationists as ‘vulnerable’.“It’s because of mostly habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, growing human populations, more land being cultivated,” Fennessy said. “Combined with a little bit of poaching, climate change”.But conservation efforts have helped numbers start to recover in the past decade, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-surprised-to-spot-2-dwarf-giraffes-in-namibia-uganda-101610321826450.html

11-01-2021||World||Donald Trump's demoralized staff count down final days of Presidency||President Donald Trump has lost the support of many former loyalists in his administration after a riot at the US Capitol that he helped provoke, and his White House is in "meltdown" as it lurches through his final days, current and former officials said.While Democrats plan to introduce an article of impeachment against Trump on Monday, many White House staff members are upset and embarrassed by the turn of events, and are eager to move on. They said they have faced criticism from peers and are worried about damage to their reputations and job prospects.Some who weighed resigning in the last few days have decided to stay on to help ensure a smooth transfer of power and, within the agencies that report to the White House, to protect against rash moves by the president or his remaining inner circle."He has lost us. He's lost his own administration. As I said, many of us feel betrayed," said one senior administration official at an agency outside the White House. "In terms of taking any direction on policy or any last minute fly-by sort of changes, I think we're all resisting."Throughout the government, officials are counting down the days until Trump's term ends on January 20."All I've heard is that it's a complete meltdown. But the President is not backing down. They're going to double down on this," one former White House official said.Trump in a video on Thursday called the attack on Congress "heinous" and pledged a smooth transfer of power to the next administration. He did not concede that he lost the election, or drop his unsubstantiated claim that it was fraudulent, or mention President-elect Joe Biden by name.Trump and his inner circle are trying to draw attention away from the siege of the Capitol and back onto his main policies in the final days of his presidency.This week, Trump plans to visit the US-Mexico border on a trip to Texas to tout his immigration policies and visit a section of the border wall he had built to stop migrants crossing into the country. He also will hold new Medal of Freedom ceremonies at the White House.In one last policy push, Trump and his allies are fighting back against Twitter's decision on Friday to ban the president's personal account for inciting violence."There is a very good chance that we could see some additional action regarding big tech in the near future, as well as a reminder of several of the legacy policies started by President Trump that will be highlighted," said Jason Miller, a senior adviser on Trump's 2020 campaign.Some in the White House see any move aimed at highlighting his perceived accomplishments as tone deaf."No one cares. At all," one current White House official said. "Everyone's ... defeated and honestly just want the next two weeks to just go by."The mood has been further soured by the collapse in relations between Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.Trump lambasted Pence for not finding a way to prevent Congress from certifying the election results, a power the vice president does not have. He also did not reach out to Pence to check on his safety during the riot at Congress, when Pence was evacuated along with lawmakers.The two men are now not speaking, a striking end to their four years at the White House, where Pence had been a loyal lieutenant through multiple crises.Pence gave a goodbye pep talk to his staff in an emotional meeting on Friday before many of them leave this week.He cited a Bible verse that his chief of staff, Marc Short, texted him on Thursday morning after Pence formally certified Biden's victory."We have fought the good fight, we have kept the faith and we finished the race," Short said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-demoralized-staff-count-down-the-final-days-of-presidency-101610315784236.html
11-01-2021||World||Pence hasn’t ruled out using ‘unfit to rule’ provision against Trump||US Vice-President Mike Pence has not ruled out invoking a constitutional provision to remove President Donald Trump from office for being unfit to rule, reports said.Democrats’ move to impeach the president, for the second time, gathered momentum, for a scheduled launch on Monday.Pence has not ruled out invoking the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution if Trump “becomes more unstable”, CNN reported on Saturday citing sources close to the vice-president. The constitutional provision empowers the vice-president, working with the majority of the cabinet or a body formed by Congress, to remove the president for being unfit to govern.CNN also reported that the vice-president’s team believes there is some risk in using the 25th amendment or impeachment to remove Trump as they may push him to rash actions. This may be the reason for reluctance to use the provision, despite his growing estrangement from the president.Relations between the two men have collapsed according to reports, especially after the January 6 storming of the Capitol. Trump is livid that Pence refused to block Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Pence is disappointed that Trump put him in an impossible position by pressuring him to do something he could not constitutionally — block the certification. And then Trump did not call or inquire about his safety, and his family who were there also, when rioters overran the Capitol, with some of them chanting “Hang Mike Pence”.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, the senior-most congressional Democrats, have demanded that Trump should resign over the storming of the Capitol by his supporters, or Pence should use the 25th amendment to remove him. In the event that neither happens, Democrats will introduce an impeachment motion as early as Monday.“We’ve just hit 180 co-sponsors of the Article of Impeachment,” tweeted Ted Lieu, Democratic lawmaker who has co-written the drafted the motion. He added, “We will introduce the Article of Impeachment this Monday during the House’s pro forma session.” The motion charges Trump with “incitement of insurrection”.Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, expect to impeach the president in the coming week. But a conviction by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans for the next some days, is unlikely. Democrats could try after they take control of the chamber on January 19.And even then it will not be easy, because they will need the support of Republicans to secure a conviction. Though Trump will be out of office by then, a conviction will bar him from holding a federal office for ever, blocking him from running agai;n.Trump is preparing to contest the impeachment. He is said to be considering to enlist defence Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer who led his election fraud lawsuits, and Alan Dershowitz, who was part of his defence team for the first impeachment in December of 2019. As part of a pre-emptive strategy, his allies have begun calling for dropping the move in the interest of healing and uniting the country.Meanwhile, more than 80 Capitol rioters have been arrested and charged, including most of those seen in pictures around the world. Among them are the man with fur hat and buffalo horn who has sat in the Senate president’s seat in the well of the chamber; Jacob Anthony Chansley, also called Jake Angeli who was seen carrying away Speaker Pelosi’s lectern; Adam Christian Johnson; and Richard Barnett. the man with his foot up on Pelosi’s desk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pence-hasn-t-ruled-out-using-unfit-to-rule-provision-against-trump-101610263887735.html
11-01-2021||India||Will win over 100 seats: Nadda at Assam rally||GUWAHATI:Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Monday expressed confidence that the party would return to power in Assam, predicting that it would win over 100 of the 126 assembly seats in upcoming elections . Nadda addressed a “Vijay Sankalpa” (victory pledge) rally in Barak Valley’s Silchar, beginning the party’s campaign for the assembly elections, likely to be held in April-May. The BJP has given due recognition to Assam’s culture, language and identity, since coming to power in the northeastern state in 2016, Nadda said. “The task of protecting Assam’s culture, language and identity has been done well by the BJP governments at the Centre and the state and we will continue that. We have been sensitive about the rights of Assamese people,” said Nadda. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and senior party leaders including general secretary (organization) BL Santosh and state in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda were also present at the rally. “The BJP has been working peacefully for the development of Assam, taking into consideration the interests of all communities. It has fulfilled their demands without harming others…Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah resolved the 50-year-old Bodo issue by signing a peace accord and bringing the militants to the mainstream. All stakeholders were taken into confidence and the accord ensured that their demands were given due recognition,” he said.Nadda also cited the proposed grant of scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities and the smart fencing of border areas with Bangladesh. At the rally, the BJP chief targeted the Congress, alleging that there had was no progress in the state in the 15 years of Congress rule between 2001 and 2016. “During those 15 years, the state saw killings of 2,155 civilians and 284 security personnel and over 12,000 people were kidnapped. Over 51% area of the state was not covered by electrification and 56% homes didn’t have toilets. All that has changed in the past years,” he said. “During 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre, Assam received ₹50,000 crore in assistance. But since 2014, when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP came to power, the state has got ₹300,000 crore till date,” Nadda said. Reacting to Nadda’s statement, senior Congress leader Debabrata Saikia said, “Most of the development that took in Assam happened during the 15 years of Congress rule. Nadda seems to be unaware of it. He also seems to have no idea that crime rate in Assam hasn’t improved and the state has the highest rate of crimes against women.”The BJP president’s comments come close on the heels of the launch of several new regional parties in the state, which have accused the ruling party of not being sincere in safeguarding Assam’s ‘jaati’ (community), ‘maati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (base). Two student organisations, All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), who were spearheading the anti-Citizenship Ament Act (CAA) protests in the state in December, 2019, have joined hands to form Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP).Another organisation at the forefront of the anti-CAA stir, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), has also formed a political party called Raijor Dal. The organisation’s leader, Akhil Gogoi, who is in jail since December, 2019, for his role in the violent protests, was named president of the new party last week.The BJP president, who arrived here on Monday on a two-day visit, is set to leave later in the day for Guwahati, where he will hold meetings with members of the party’s state unit core committee, election committee and other office bearers.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-win-over-100-seats-nadda-at-assam-rally-101610389597408.html
11-01-2021||India||Poultry sector predicts losses of over ₹1k-cr||A surge in avian influenza or bird flu, an outbreak that has now spread to 10 states, has decimated over three dozen large farms, shut down hundreds of hatcheries and upended supply chains as more poultry farmers confront the pervasive fear of its rapid spread. Even in states free from the avian flu so far, consumption of poultry has plunged, several stakeholders said. Regions where H5N8 cases have been confirmed are spread out across the country, forming a south-to-north arc, raising the threat for other central and eastern states, an official from the department of animal husbandry said. Samples of dead birds are piling up at the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) as the epidemic tears through 10 states: Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. “Our estimate is that business losses are to the tune of ₹1,500 crore. This includes layers, or poultry farms specialising only in egg production,” said Surinder Khanna,a former poultry development officer with the Haryana government and a consultant. Avian flu has significant economic impact. Poultry farmers are counting losses from devastated farms. “My farm is empty now. It is one of the six medium sized layers where 100% culling took place. Nearly 3,000 day-old chicks and 3,000 30-day-old chicken were culled, causing losses of ₹2,40,000,” said P. Suresh of Dynamix Poultry Cooperative in Kerala’s Allapuzha. According to Khanna and other analysts, an estimated half-a-million birds may have been culled so far, although no official figures are available. Industry figures show that a one-day-old chick sells for ₹45, while it costs poultry farmers ₹80-90 to raise a chicken for 30 days. Wholesale prices of chicken and eggs have crashed 80% and 60%, according to figures from the Poultry Federation of India.India’s poultry business runs largely on a contract model, whereby poultry firms enter into written contracts with raisers. “During outbreaks of bird disease, if affected population in a firm is more than 10%, which is usually the case in epidemics, farmers aren’t paid anything in accordance with contract terms,” Khanna said. Union minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday that the Centre was “coordinating with states to implement a national action plan” and there was no need for panic. The flu has a domino effect in related supply chains. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm. Maize is a major feed used for poultry, which consumes 14 million tonnes of corn annually.“Poultry consumption in eastern Indian states, unaffected by bird flu, has fallen by an estimated 70%,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, the editor of industry poultry journal Pashudhan Praharee. According to official data, India’s layer farms produce 250 million eggs a day. The country produces 1.5 billion broilers a year, while 380 million chicken are raised annually for laying eggs. Poultry is one of the fastest growing segments of the agricultural sector in the country. While output of crops has seen a decadal rise at a rate of 1.5-2% annually, that of eggs and broilers has been rising at a rate of 8-10% annually, according to agriculture ministry data. India has among the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, showing how difficult it is to prevent poultry diseases in the country. Bird flu epidemics have occurred 24 times in the country since the first outbreak in 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, when the flu infected poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and MP. Kerala and Haryana have completed several rounds of culling in accordance with national animal disease guidelines. Avian flu mostly comes from infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their faeces. In India, the disease mostly is spread by migratory birds, such as geese, ducks and shorebirds. Since 2004, compensation worth ₹400 crore from federal funds were given to poultry farmers who faced the epidemic, aside from financial aid from states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poultry-sector-predicts-losses-of-over-1kcr-101610389536913.html
11-01-2021||India||Bird flu spreads to 10 states, govt says human threat low||New Delhi:Bird flu spread to 10 states on Monday with Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand confirming the viral outbreak, which experts said would be difficult to control because a large number of birds in the wild had been infected. The Central government moved to ease concerns of the infection spreading to humans through contaminated meat or chicken, saying that in India the disease had been spread mainly by migratory birds and added that the secondary spread to poultry birds had occurred only at a few places.“There are no scientific reports on transmission of bird flu to humans and consumers should not be scared,” minister for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairy Giriraj Singh told reporters on Monday, asking the states not to close wholesale markets or restrict the sale of poultry products.Delhi, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand joined Himachal Pradesh , where close to 4,000 migratory birds have died in Pong Dam, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana in confirming bird flu cases. While transmission of the virus to humans is rare, it easily spreads among birds through droppings. “The entire water body gets infected with the virus, a reason for so many birds dying in Pong Dam in Himachal. Also, it spreads the disease from one species to another,” said Suresh Kumar, a scientist with the Wildlife Institute of India and migratory bird expert.Migratory birds reach India at wintering sites through the Central Asian flyway, which extends from the Artic in the north to Maldives in the south and from central China in the east to eastern Europe in the west. It is one of the eight major migratory bird flyways and least studied among all, said a report in Birdlife International, a global partnership of non-government organisations devoted to avian conservation. Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said the birds from Central Asia, China, Mongolia and Siberia cover more than 5,000 kms to reach hundreds of wintering sites in the Indian subcontinent and some of them even fly to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Sri Lanka.Close to 90% of the 370 identified species in the CAF reach the Indian subcontinent and spread across the country. “You can find Bar-headed Goose in Kaziranga and Pong Dam. They may enter India through two ends of Tibetan plateau. They are of same species but represent different populations,” Kumar said. Rahmani said that some of these migratory birds may be carriers of bird flu although they may not perish. Not much research has been done on bird diseases, and it would not be possible to say which birds carry which strain of bird flu, he added.Testing by Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) indicates that both the strains of bird flu came from migratory birds. H5N8, a sub-type of avian influenza found in poultry and wild animals, has been found in crows in Rajasthan, Uttarkand and Madhya Prades; the strain came from migratory birds. The other strain is H5N1, found in ducks in Kerala and the Bar-headed Goose in Himachal. While H5N8 transmission to humans is not known, there have been cases of H5N1 transmission to humans, although rare.“There is no way one can control bird flu in wild birds,” Kumar said, noting that it spreads from droppings in water bodies that are impossible to clean. “Poultry bird flu is easier to contain as all birds can be culled and cleaning operations can be completed in 90 days.”That could be a probable reason that Kerala and Haryana, where the virus was reported in poultry, were able to control bird flu and not Rajasthan, Himachal and Madhya Pradesh, where it was present in birds in the wild.On Monday, Madhya Pradesh’s animal husbandry director Dr RK Rokde said the latest reports had confirmed bird flu in pigeons, sparrows and herons, but morbidity was the highest among crows.“As of now, 1,300 birds have died of bird flu in about 35 districts of MP and spread of avian influenza has been confirmed in 18 districts,” said Rokde. In Rajasthan, bird flu reached Jaipur zoo, causing the death of three ducks and a black stork, forcing the authorities to close the bird section. Fowl deaths had earlier been reported from Kanpur zoo in Uttar Pradesh. The total bird deaths because of bird flu in a week doubled to 3,321 on Monday with the spread of aviation influenza to 15 of 33 districts of Rajasthan. Most of the birds that perished were crows.Apart from Sanjay Lake in Delhi, bird flu was confirmed in wild birds, mostly crows, in Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. An outbreak of avian influenza was reported among poultry in Parbhani district of Maharashtra while bird flu in crows was confirmed in Mumbai, Thane, Dapoli and Beed, officials said. In Uttarkhand, bird flu in crows has been confirmed from Pauri Gharwal district. In Gujarat, bird flu cases have been confirmed in crows in Surat and Vadodara districts, officials said.Rahmani said the only way to control bird flu infection from migratory birds was through satellite-based monitoring of major bird species and rapid information sharing between 30 countries on the Central Asian Flyway. Kumar said nine flagship migratory species including the Amur Falcon, Common Crane and Black Kite are monitored under an environment ministry’s programme.

11-01-2021||India||Bird flu: Delhi HC to hear PIL for ban on slaughtering chicken at Ghazipur mandi||The Delhi High Court will hear a plea on Tuesday seeking immediate ban on “illegal slaughter of birds” in Ghazipur Murga Mandi or Ghazipur chicken market in east Delhi.The petition claimed that the market is a hub of illegal slaughter after an alert was sounded for bird flu in the city.The plea, which has been filed in a pending Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by animal right activist Gauri Mauleki, has contended that the Ghazipur Murga Mandi near the border with Uttar Pradesh has been an epicenter of avian flu in the past due to the unchecked transportation and slaughter of lakhs of birds coming from various states.The plea filed through advocate Priyanka Bangari has said that the action plan for Prevention, Control & Containment of Avian Influenza (Revised 2015) provides that the live bird markets including wet markets particularly at the border areas is at high risk for Avian Influenza.It said that the Ghazipur Murga Mandi, is the “biggest illegal chicken slaughter hub of Delhi which functions in complete disregard to law and follows no veterinary health check protocols”.“More than 2 lakh birds that are brought into this market daily are not screened for any disease. No ante mortem or post mortem is performed nor are any health records of the birds maintained. No backward or forward linkage of the birds and their carcass is maintained,” the plea read.The petition has also claimed that birds are slaughtered in the livestock market which is meant for trade of live birds, in an unhygienic and appalling manner.“This place is not only an illegal slaughter area but also a breeding ground for pathogens and diseases. That unhygienic conditions in which the Ghazipur Murga Mandi operate in absence of any health check of birds, Avian Influenza can easily spread in this market and could impose severe danger to public health and safety,” it said.The plea has sought implementation of the suggestions of a sub-committee which had inspected the Ghazipur market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-delhi-hc-to-hear-pil-for-ban-on-slaughtering-chicken-at-ghazipur-mandi-101610387620944.html
11-01-2021||India||'I was on top of the world' says Captain Zoya Aggarwal on landing Air India flight with first all-woman crew||"I was on top of the world" said an elated Captain Zoya Aggarwal, who headed the four-member all-woman cockpit crew that flew into Indian aviation history on Monday, landing the San Francisco-Bengaluru AI direct flight after going over the North Pole. As AI-176 landed at the Kempegowda International Airport here and the crew members walked to the lounge, a huge crowd of people gave a rousing reception for scripting history with the about 17-hour journey, the longest flight by the national carrier or any other airline in the country. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said the four-member cockpit crew created history while Governors of various states, leaders, including Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, and social media users lavishly praised the women pilots. Captain Aggarwal, the first pilot, said she felt as if she was on top of the world flying over the North pole, surrounded by Arctic ocean and the northernmost point on earth. "I was on the top of the world. I would rather call it, top of the North Pole because the North Pole was the world for me when I was commanding that Boeing-777 200 LR above 34,000 feet," she told PTI here. The other three women pilots were Captain Papagari Thanmai, Captain Akansha Sonaware and Captain Shivani Manhas and the flight that departed from San Francisco in the USA at around 8.30 pm (local time) on Saturday landed here at around 3.45 am on Monday. The direct distance between the two cities at opposite ends of the world is 13,993 km with a time zone change of around 13.5 hours. Asked if there was any fear flying over the Polar region, Aggarwal said she only felt excitement and her instructors had all along inculcated complete confidence in pilots like her. "I am very motivated...I don't think the word fear exists in Air India. No, not at all," she said. Thanking the ministry of civil aviation and the Air India for reposing faith on her and other crew members, Aggarwal said she was grateful, felt happy and humbled. She also gave credit to the 'weather God' as the weather across the polar region was "immaculate and suitable in order to make a polar flight happen". "In a moment to cherish & celebrate, women professionals of Indian civil aviation create history. Heartiest congratulations to Capt Zoya Aggarwal, Capt Papagari Thanmai, Capt Akansha Sonaware & Capt Shivani for flying over North Pole to land in Bengaluru from San Francisco," Puri tweeted. He hailed it as an embodiment of 'Nari Shakti'. Gandhi said: "Congratulations to the all-women cockpit crew for completing Air India's longest flight from San Francisco to Bengaluru over the North Pole. You have made the country proud," he said in a tweet. Aggarwal, hailing from a conservative family and the only child of her parents, broke the glass ceiling to become an AI pilot and carved a niche for herself by steering the inaugural flight from America. "I am the only child of my parents. So, I grew up in a world where I was taught to walk behind the men and their shadows and to grow up and get married and look after my kids," she recalled. She said when she told her parents her wish to become a pilot, her mother cried out of fear but today her mother's tears were out of joy. The AI flight, after getting airborne from San Francisco under the command of Captain Aggarwal left the polar region at a speed of 940 kmph as Captain Thanmai, the second pilot, steered the aircraft. "...Kudos for making Air India proud. We also congratulate passengers of AI176 for being part of this historic moment," the airline said, describing it as a landmark journey. The flight was operated with a Boeing 777-200LR aircraft with a seating capacity of 238 seats, including eight First Class, 35 Business Class,195 Economy class configuration besides four cockpit and 12 cabin crew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-top-of-the-world-captain-aggarwal-on-landing-ai-flight-with-all-woman-crew-101610386191587.html
11-01-2021||India||A new 'dawn': Serum Covid-19 vaccine shipment to start on Tuesday||Stocks of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, are likely to start moving out of Serum Institute of India's facility here on early Tuesday morning, days ahead of the nationwide inoculation drive, marking India's entry into a decisive phase against the anti-coronavirus fight.A source closely involved in logistical arrangements said the movement of vaccine doses is likely to start from early Tuesday morning through road and air routes amid elaborate police security."Some consignments will go by roadways and some will go by air," said the source.Trucks belonging to Kool-ex Cold Chain Ltd, which will be ferrying vaccine stocks, reached Serum Institute of India's (SII) Manjari facility on Monday evening, where loading of doses will take place, he said.Covishield is co-developed by the University of Oxford and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca in collaboration with the Pune-based SII.Among the first batch, one consignment is scheduled to be shipped by an Air India cargo flight to Ahmedabad."In the consignment there are 23 pieces weighing 736 kg which will be sent by air cargo," said a source from the airline.On Monday, Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitin Patel tweeted that his state will receive the first consignment of coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday at 10.45 am at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport in Ahmedabad.Earlier in the day, the Union government placed a purchase order with Serum Institute of India (SII) for 11 million doses of Covishield, each costing ₹210, including GST, official sources said in New Delhi.Covishield vaccine doses would be initially shipped to 60 consignee points from where those would be distributed to various vaccination centres across India, the sources said.The Maharashtra government has already decided to provide police security to trucks carrying vaccine doses up to airports and the state's borders."Kool-ex Cold Chain is the lead vendor for the movement of the vaccine from the SII factory to over 50 primary government locations (depots) in the first leg," the company's co-founder, Rahul Agarwal, had said on Sunday.He had said about 300 GPS-fitted trucks will be used for shipping consignments and if needed 500 more will be roped in for the task.The country will launch its Covid-19 vaccination drive from January 16 in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world's largest inoculation programme with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.India had recently approved two vaccines, SII's Covishield and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, for restricted emergency use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-new-dawn-serum-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-to-start-on-tuesday-101610386184591.html

After maintaining that the National Democratic Alliance leadership would announce the Chief Ministerial candidate, following poll notification, the Saffron party appeared to have made a climbdown. "They are the major partners. In Tamil Nadu state, AIADMK is the major partner. They will decide who their next Chief Ministerial candidate is. They will decide," BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Tamil Nadu C T Ravi said here. Though the BJP had maintained that the CM candidate, would be from the largest constituent (AIADMK), it had said a formal decision and its announcement shall be made by the NDA Coordination Committee. The Tamil Nadu unit chief of the BJP, L Murugan had all along said an announcement on CM candidate would be made by the party top leadership and did not come forward to explicitly endorse the candidture of incumbent Chief Minister and AIADMK CM nominee, K Palaniswami. During the intervening period, when the BJP stuck to its stand, the AIADMK twice (on December 27 at its first poll rally and at its general council meet on January 9) made it clear that Palaniswami was the CM candidate. At its poll rally, the AIADMK said its partners had to accept its choice of CM candidate so as to be part of the alliance led by it in Tamil Nadu. Senior ruling party leader K P Munusamy also had spoken repeatedly that national parties had no sway in state politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-says-admk-will-pick-nda-s-chief-ministerial-candidate-for-tn-assembly-polls-101610385201532.html
11-01-2021||India||At meeting with PM, Mamata Banerjee asks about efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday asked about the efficacy of the two Covid-19 vaccines which the Centre has decided to use during the nationwide inoculation drive and enquired why states were not given any option to choose between the two.During a virtual meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers of various states on the vaccination process starting January 16, Banerjee enquired whether or not the states have to purchase the vaccines for people other than those in the priority category such as health and other frontline workers.According to an official statement, she also asked if "adequate scientific confirmation was available in support of both the vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) that are now being offered by the government of India". Banerjee said that "states have been left with no option to choose or procure between the two vaccines and the Government of India has made a specific decision in favour of both the vaccines". She said that adequate scientific opinions should be obtained before confirming the efficacy of both the vaccines and sought a clarification on whether there was any side effect of the vaccines.Later, she was assured by Niti Aayog member Prof (Dr) Vinod K Paul that both the vaccines are "completely safe based on the scientific evidence" and there is no report of serious side effects.The chief minister also sought "frontline worker" status for transport workers and said that the authorities should provide them with the Covid-19 vaccine.At the meeting, she assured the Prime Minister that the state government is fully prepared for the vaccination exercise and various committees have been formed to handle the process, the statement said.She also informed the Prime Minister that the state has prepared adequate storage capacity for the storage of the vaccine, and all 941 cold chain points have been thoroughly inspected.The chief minister said that the state has identified 44,000 vaccinators and more than 4,000 vaccination sites across West Bengal for the first phase of the exercise.At least 5.8 lakh government and private healthcare workers have been enrolled for the first phase and all the data have been uploaded on Co-WIN portal, an online platform for monitoring Covid-19 vaccine delivery, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-meeting-with-pm-mamata-banerjee-asks-about-efficacy-of-covid-19-vaccines-101610384672718.html
11-01-2021||India||Don't want to appear before any SC-appointed committee: Farmer leaders||New Delhi, Jan 11 (PTI) A joint front of 40 agitating farmer unions on Monday welcomed the suggestion of the Supreme Court for a stay on the agri laws implementation but said they are not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by it.Pulling up the Centre for its handling of the farmers' protest, the apex court on Monday said it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going and will constitute a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India to resolve the impasse.“While all organisations welcome the suggestions of the Supreme Court to stay the implementation of the farm laws, they are collectively and individually not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee that may be appointed by it,” a statement issued by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said.“We met our lawyers this evening and after deliberation on the pros and cons of the suggestions, we informed them that we are unanimously not agreeable to go before any committee that may be appointed by the Supreme Court today due to the stubborn attitude of the government,” it read.The umbrella body said the apex court was requested by their lawyers and by other counsel, including Harish Salve, to fix the next hearing on Tuesday to enable them to consult the farmer unions and seek their consent to the suggestion of the SC.“We have been told that no such hearing has been fixed for tomorrow as per the cause list already published for tomorrow till 9 PM and that only the matters are listed for pronouncements for order by the court. These events have deeply disappointed us, our lawyers and also farmers at large,” the Morcha said.Earlier in the day, farmer leaders said they would continue their agitation even if the government or the Supreme Court stays the implementation of the new agri laws.The farmer leaders, who said they were sharing their "personal opinion", were also of the view that a stay is "not a solution" as it is only for a fixed period of time.They were reacting after the Supreme Court indicated that it may stay the implementation of the contentious farm laws and refused to grant more time to the Centre to explore the possibility of an amicable solution saying it has already granted the government a “long rope”."We welcome the Supreme Court observation, but ending the protest is not an option. Any stay is only for a fixed period of time... till the issue is taken up by the court again," Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union President Gurnam Singh Chaduni said.The farmers want the laws to be repealed completely. The protest will continue even if the government or the Supreme Court stays their implementation, he said.National spokesperson of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rakesh Tikait said the Supreme Court's observations were "a slap on the face of the central government" and demanded the resignation of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.He was addressing the national executive committee of BKU at UP-gate -Ghazipur border.Bhog Singh Mansa, president of Indian Farmers Union (Mansa), said a stay on the laws is "no big deal"'."A stay on the laws is not a solution. We are here to get these laws scrapped completely... the government has in a way already agreed to scrap the laws when it said it is willing to incorporate as many amendments as farmers want," he said."We appeal to the Supreme Court to terminate these laws as these are not valid constitutionally," Mansa said, adding the protest will continue till 'the laws are not repealed or the BJP government completes its tenure'.Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa echoed similar sentiments, saying the agitation started with the demand of scrapping the agri laws and "it will end only when we win this fight".Eight rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions have failed to end the deadlock as the Centre ruled out repealing the contentious laws while the farmer leaders said their 'ghar waapsi will happen only after law waapsi'.The apex court had earlier sought the Centre's response on a batch of pleas against the three contentious farm laws -- the Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Hundreds of agitating farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping on Delhi's borders since November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-want-to-appear-before-any-sc-appointed-committee-farmer-leaders-101610384825050.html
11-01-2021||India||Uttarakhand HC stays DNA test of BJP MLA accused of rape till Jan 13||The Uttarakhand high court on Monday stayed the order of a lower court for a DNA test of BJP MLA Mahesh Singh Negi who has been accused of rape and fathering an illegitimate child, the lawmaker’s counsel said.The high court’s order came on a petition filed by the MLA challenging the order of a lower court in Dehradun last month ordering him to appear for DNA test.While granting a stay on DNA testing for three days, the high court also decided to hear the matter on January 13, the MLA’s lawyer VBS Negi said.A woman had accused Mahesh Negi of raping her for several years and fathering her daughter after which Negi and his wife were then booked for rape and criminal intimidation.VBS Negi said the court has directed the state government and the complainant should get ready for their depositions and the matter would be heard on January 13.Last month, the BJP MLA from Dwarahat constituency failed to appear before the Dehradun district and sessions court for DNA test sampling in the case citing ill health.He had to appear before the court as per its order passed on December 18, 2020 in which it had pronounced that Negi and the complainant woman with his daughter should appear before it to provide their samples for DNA test to medical staff from Government Doon Hospital.The complainant who is married had accused Negi of raping her for two years and fathering her child.The Dehradun police had earlier submitted a charge sheet against the 30-year-old woman in an extortion and blackmailing case in which she was accused by Negi's wife of trying to extort ₹5 cr from him by threatening to frame the MLA in a rape case.But after the woman’s accusations, Negi and his wife were then booked for rape and criminal intimidation.The woman had demanded a DNA test of her child and Negi to prove her claims.A case was registered on the same on September 5 on the directions of a local court in Dehradun where she had filed a petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-hc-stays-dna-test-of-bjp-mla-accused-of-rape-till-jan-13-101610384799405.html

11-01-2021||India||China pulls back 10,000 troops from Ladakh theatre||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has pulled back at least 10,000 soldiers from depth areas in the Ladakh theatre to rear positions in the midst of the ongoing border standoff between India and China, officials familiar with the development said on Monday.ALSO WATCH | Indian Army detains Chinese soldier after he crosses LAC in LadakhBut despite withdrawing around 10,000 troops, the PLA’s frontline deployments remain unchanged, said one of the officials cited above. The withdrawal of troops appears to be linked to extreme weather conditions in the sector, said a second official.The Chinese troop withdrawal, experts said, has to be seen against the backdrop of the overall Indian and Chinese military deployments in the theatre --- both armies have deployed a total of 100,000 soldiers and weaponry in their forward and depth areas.“In winters, large-scale or even limited military operations are ruled out. That’s possibly the reason why the PLA has withdrawn troops from depth areas,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General (retd) DS Hooda.The reduction of 10,000 troops has happened over the last week to 10 days, said a third official. The Indian army is closely monitoring the developments in the Ladakh theatre as a re-induction of troops by the PLA in the sector cannot be ruled out, said a fourth official.The Ladakh standoff is in its ninth month, with soldiers holding forward positions at friction points in extreme weather conditions. The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-level officers.Even as the ground situation remains unchanged in the Ladakh sector, chief of defence (CDS) staff General Bipin Rawat on Monday reached Leh for a security review of the sensitive area. Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria also visited forward areas in eastern Ladakh on Monday.General Rawat’s two-day tour will also see him visit forward locations in Kashmir.During the Ladakh leg of the tour, the CDS will be briefed by the local military leadership on the prevailing security situation, officials said. He will also visit forward areas in the sector and interact with troops deployed there.The air chief on Monday visited air force stations and advanced landing grounds (ALGs) in the Ladakh sector, the IAF said in a statement.The air chief was briefed on the air force's operational readiness to deal with any contingency in the Ladakh theatre, amid the ongoing border row with China. He also interacted with IAF personnel deployed at forward locations."During his visit to Thoise, he reviewed the ongoing logistics operations for support and sustenance of troops in the winter season. He also visited DBO and Nyoma ALGs where he was given a security overview in the respective sub-sectors," the statement said.The air chief also joined the CDS for a comprehensive discussion on operational matters with senior IAF and Indian Army commanders at the Leh airbase, it added.In a year-end review of major developments published on January 1, the defence ministry said the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) escalated the situation in the sensitive theatre by using unorthodox weapons against Indian soldiers and amassing a large number of troops during the ongoing border standoff along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).The ministry said the PLA attempted to alter the status quo in the sector by force but the Indian Army was well-entrenched to counter any misadventure by the adversary.In his first official engagement outside the Capital in the New Year, General Rawat visited India’s forward air bases in the eastern sector on January 2-3 and interacted with frontline soldiers in Arunachal Pradesh.“Nothing can deter the Indian armed forces from remaining steadfast in their call of duty,” he said during that visit. While the current border row is confined to the Ladakh theatre, the Indian military is on high alert to deal with any misadventure by the Chinese forces all along the border --- stretching from Ladakh in the north to Arunachal Pradesh in the east.While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed on strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The Indian Army swiftly moved and occupied a series of key heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank in a stealthy midnight move on August 29.The Indian Army now controls ridgeline positions on the southern bank of Pangong Tso that allow it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The Indian Army has also taken control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank of Pangong Tso where rival soldiers are deployed barely a few hundred metres from each other. The developments on both banks of Pangong Tso have increased India’s bargaining power during talks with the Chinese side, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pulls-back-10-000-troops-from-ladakh-theatre-101610382216148.html

Today under the protection of police a BJP goon was allowed to splash me with black ink. I want Yogi to come forward & talk to me. Not exhibit 'gunda raj’,” Bharti told ANI.Bharti tweeted that his bail application has been kept pending till January 13 and he has been sent to judicial custody for 14 days. He was arrested for criminal intimidation and promoting enmity between groups, police told news agency PTI, following remarks two days ago allegedly referring to Adityanath and the state's hospitals.The MLA from Delhi's Malviya Nagar also retweeted a video clip in which he can be heard calling Adityanath a “gunda”, while talking about "atrocities on women" in the state.The ink throwing incident and Bharti’s arrest drew a sharp reaction from Delhi chief minister and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal. "Yogiji, our MLA Somnath Bharti ji was going to see your government school. Ink was thrown at him? Are your schools so bad? If someone goes to see your school then why do you get so scared? Fix the school,” he tweeted, asking him to consult Delhi’s deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia on how to go about it.“Yogi ji, you are ruining the future of crores of children of Uttar Pradesh," he wrote in another post.On the other hand, Shalabh Mani Tripathi, information advisor to the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, slammed Bharti for allegedly using “indecent language” for a chief minister and abusing policemen discharging their duties. “This is the language of goons,” he was quoted as saying by PTI."Arvind Kejriwal is himself a chief minister. If he has the slightest idea about the post of a chief minister, then he should tender an apology to the entire country for the statement made by Bharti for UP's popular chief minister," he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aaps-somnath-bharti-wants-yogi-to-come-forward-talk-after-ink-hurled-at-him-in-up-101610379580100.html

11-01-2021||India||What PM Modi, chief ministers discussed at Covid vaccine roll-out meet: 5 points||Prime minister Narendra Modi on Monday held a virtual meeting with the chief ministers of states to review the status and preparedness for the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive that begins on January 16. Modi lauded the constant coordination and communication between the Centre and the states, and timely decision making, which he said, played a big role in the fight against the virus. He also appreciated the state governments for working zealously in the battle against the coronavirus disease.Meanwhile, the government has sent a purchase order of 11 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to Serum Institute of India. The cost of the vaccine to the government is Rs200 per vaccine dose for the first 100 million doses.At the meeting, the Prime Minister also discussed the bird flu that has spread to at least 10 states across the nation.Here are the most important points from the meetingWorld’s biggest vaccination campaign: Modi said that the country is in a decisive phase of the Covid-19 fight and is set to kickstart the world’s biggest vaccination campaign from January 16. He underlined that it's a matter of pride that both the vaccines—Serum Institute of India’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin—for which emergency use authorisation have been given are made in India.He highlighted that both the approved vaccines are highly cost effective in comparison to other vaccines from across the world, adding that India would have faced great difficulty if it would have had to depend on foreign vaccines.Frontline workers to be vaccinated first: In his address, Modi said the priority of vaccination has been decided as per advice of the experts and scientific community after consultation with the states. Health workers, from both government and private sector, will be the first ones to receive the vaccine. Along with them, cleaners and other frontline workers, police and paramilitary forces, home guards, disaster management volunteers and other jawans in civil defence, and revenue officials associated with containment and surveillance, will also receive the vaccine in the first phase.The total number of such personnel is around three crore. Modi announced that state governments will not have to bear any cost towards vaccinating in the first stage and that the Centre will bear the cost. In the second stage, those above 50 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with comorbidities or with high risk of infection, will be vaccinated.Co-Win software: The most important factor in the vaccination drive is the identification and monitoring of those who need to be vaccinated, the PM said, adding, for this Co-Win digital platform has been created. With the help of Aadhaar, beneficiaries will be identified and even the timely second dosage will be ensured. He emphasised on the significance of ensuring that real time data related to vaccination is uploaded on Co-Win.After a person receives the first dose of vaccination, Co-Win will immediately generate a digital vaccination certificate. This certificate will also act as a reminder for the second dose, after which, a final certificate will be given.Target of 30 crore in next few months: The Prime Minister said that the vaccination drive in the country is also significant since several other nations are going to follow India. He said that vaccination for Covid-19 has been going on in about 50 countries since past 3-4 weeks, and till now, only about 2.5 crore people have received vaccination. India aims to achieve vaccination for 30 crore people in the next few months, he said.Bird flu challenge: The avian influenza has so far spread in Kerala, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Maharashtra. Modi said that the ministry of fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying has put in place a plan to tackle the problem, in which district magistrates will have a key role. He asked chief ministers of the affected states to guide their DMs for the same. He told other states to make sure they are on constant vigil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-pm-modi-chief-ministers-discussed-at-covid-vaccine-roll-out-meet-5-points-101610375741255.html
11-01-2021||India||After 9 months, CM Naveen Patnaik to address his first political rally||By Debabrata MohantyIn a bid to take the sting out of opposition's criticism that chief minister Naveen Patnaik has kept himself indoors in last nine months, the Biju Janata Dal chief is set to make a major public appearance by inaugurating a mega lift irrigation project in Kalahandi district on January 14.Patnaik, who has been homebound except for a couple of public appearances at Puri and Bhubaneswar, is scheduled to inaugurate the Indravati mega lift irrigation project that would help irrigate at least 26,000 hectares of farmland in Dharmagarh block, Koksara block and Jaipatna block. The 33 kilometre-long irrigation canal would irrigate 90 villages of 33 gram panchayats benefitting over 50,000 people.After the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Patnaik has hardly stepped outside and attends routine Cabinet meetings at State Secretariat through video conferencing from his residence Naveen Niwas. He did not even campaign for the Assembly bypolls in November last year, preferring to address the voters of Tirtol and Balasore through virtual mode.Also read: 'Centre to bear expenses for phase 1 of Covid vaccination' - PM Modi"I am aware of your immense love and affection towards me. If I visit, you (people) will come in large numbers which may not be good for the public health during this pandemic situation. Therefore, I preferred to reach you through digital mode," Patnaik had told the voters even as opposition Congress and BJD routinely slammed him for staying indoors.But with Covid-19 numbers on a wane, the public meeting in Kalahandi is being seen as setting the stage for the BJD's launch of the campaign for the forthcoming urban body polls scheduled to be held sometime this year. The party, which celebrated its 23rd-anniversary last month, has made elaborate arrangements for Patnaik's meeting. BJD sources said 65 MLAs and ministers have been asked to put out LED screens in 38 gram panchayats so that people can listen to his address.BJD spokesman Pratap Deb said the Kalahandi meeting was more of an opportunity to break the political lull that has dominated the state's landscape since the beginning of the pandemic. "Not many CMs are going out in public due to the pandemic. So the CM too was indoors. Now Covid numbers are coming down and that's why he decided to come out in the public. The party recently saw a major organisational reshuffle and this would be first public meeting in its aftermath," said Deb.Leader of opposition and BJP leader from Kalahandi, Pradipta Naik said the public meeting may signal break of political lull for the chief minister, but for people of Kalahandi it does not mean anything.

The government is ready to discuss it. We want to make the IIT there. We do not want to cause them (the villagers) any trouble. I do not want to cause anybody any trouble or inconvenience but they should support us in the development,” Sawant said.When asked if he would visit the protesting villagers to discuss the issue, Sawant replied in the negative.“They should come and meet me. I have already visited the village once,” he said adding that first, the unrest needs to settle down.Sawant’s statements come even as the villagers protesting against the IIT project have hardened their stance and demanded the release of all those arrested in connection with the clashes. They also seek the withdrawal of cases filed against the villagers for rioting and the suspension of the police inspector Sagar Ekoskar, who they say is responsible for provoking the violence on January 6. Ekoskar is accused of stomping over the protesting villagers who had set up a blockade by sleeping across the entrance of the site in a bid to stop government surveyors.“We are giving the government 10 days to withdraw the decision to build the IIT in our village. We are firm that we do not want the IIT to come up here. Today, people from many villages and the rest of Goa have come to support us,” Shubham Shivolkar, co-convener of the organisation set up to oppose the IIT project, said.Also read: 'No difference!' Mamata Banerjee compares BJP with Donald Trump’s followers“PI Ekoskar should be booked, he should be terminated and legal action should be initiated against him,” Shivolkar said.The villagers have received support from the neighbouring villages of Mauxi, Damashe from where villagers marched in support of their neighbours. Despite the efforts of the police to curtail the procession of villagers from neighbouring villages to the protest site, agitation swelled on Monday.Sawant said that the demarcation work would resume after the issue had settled down.What began as murmurs of discontent against the proposed IIT, the agitation gathered pace after the government decided to fast track the project.In May last year, the Goa government had formally transferred around 10 lakh sq. metres of land in Melaulim village in North Goa for setting up of IIT-Goa. Functional since 2014, IIT Goa has been functioning from a temporary campus at the Goa Engineering College.Two sites previously identified by the state government, in Canacona and Sanguem sub-districts, for setting up of a permanent campus for IIT were scrapped in face of protests from residents.Two people arrested by the police for their alleged role in the violence of last week were granted bail by a local court on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-protest-against-iit-garners-support-goa-cm-offers-parley-but-with-condition-101610373946655.html
11-01-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh high court suspends election schedule for local body polls||The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday suspended the schedule announced by state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar for the conduct of the gram panchayat elections in the state in February.Justice M Ganga Rao, who took up a lunch motion petition filed by the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government challenging the election schedule announced by the SEC on Friday evening, observed that the commission had not taken an objective decision in announcing the schedule and did not take into consideration the objections of the government.“The SEC decision was in violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India,” Justice Rao observed.The judge expressed the view that the election process for gram panchayats would hamper the vaccination programme. “The SEC has not objectively considered the view of the government and had approached the subject matter in its own domain,” he said.In the interests of public health, the impugned orders are suspended, Justice Rao ordered.An official in the SEC said the commission would file a review petition before the division bench of the high court on Tuesday.On Friday night, Ramesh Kumar announced the election schedule for gram panchayats. As per the schedule, the first phase of elections for gram panchayats would be held on February 5, second phase on February 9, third phase on February 13 and fourth phase on February 17.The notifications for these four phases of elections would be issued on January 23, January 27, January 31 and February 4 respectively. He also announced enforcement of model code of conduct with effect from Saturday.The Jagan government, which has been at loggerheads n with Ramesh Kumar ever since the latter kept the local body elections in abeyance in March owing to Coronavirus pandemic, strongly objected to the unilateral announcement of the schedule for the conduct of local body elections by the SEC.“This is nothing but defying the directions of the Supreme Court, which said the state election commission should decide the schedule only after consulting with the state government on its preparedness,” state principal secretary, panchayat raj, Gopala Krishna Dwivedi said in a statement.He said the three-member committee of senior officials headed by chief secretary Adityanath Das, which met Ramesh Kumar, categorically told him that the elections to local bodies could not be conducted due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation and vaccination programme being rolled out by the Government of India from January 16.“The commissioner did not heed to the suggestions given by the state government, which said the conduct of elections was not possible as the entire government machinery would be busy with the vaccination programme. He has announced the schedule with caring for the public health and sought to play with the lives of the people,” Dwivedi said.On Sunday, state government employees’ unions, police officers’ association and representatives of the health department employees’ union issued separate statements announcing that they would not take part in the electioneering, as they could not take risk during the pandemic season.Ramesh Kumar defended his decision to hold the elections in February as the state government’s excuses were untenable. He said near normalcy had returned with the opening up of commercial and educational spheres of activity and political mobilization too was going on at a large scale without visible observance of social distancing.“Now, the government wants deferment of elections on the pretext of vaccination, which is a continuous process. In fact, the phase-III of the vaccination programme will extend up to 2022. Hence, elections cannot be postponed till then,” Ramesh Kumar argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-high-court-suspends-election-schedule-for-local-body-polls-101610373401946.html

Sea Vigil and Tropex together will cover the entire spectrum of maritime security challenges, including transition from peace to conflict,” Commander Madhwal said.While exercises at a smaller scale are conducted in coastal states regularly, Sea Vigil stands out because of its sheer scale and complexity. India revamped its coastal security architecture after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and security drills have been conducted regularly over the years to test the preparedness of security agencies to ward off maritime threats.Sea Vigil-21 will provide an opportunity to assess the country’s preparedness in the maritime security and coastal defence domains, Commander Madhwal said.“It will provide a realistic assessment of our strengths and weaknesses and thus will help in further strengthening maritime and national security,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-kick-off-major-coastal-security-exercise-on-tuesday-101610370907404.html

He was later arrested by the Uttar Pradesh Police in connection with a case of objectionable remarks he made against the state government, reported news agency PTI.A video posted on Twitter by news agency ANI showed Bharti talking to police officials outside the guest house of the Irrigation Department. As the conversation proceeded, a youth standing near Bharti took out a small bottle and smeared ink on the AAP leader's face.The policemen on the spot and Bharti are seen running after the youth in the ANI video, who was later apprehended by the cops. The police officials then escorted the MLA from the guest house."Ink was thrown on the AAP MLA, and the matter is being probed," Rae Bareli Superintendent of Police Shlok Kumar was quoted as saying by PTI.Meanwhile, the police said that the AAP leader was arrested on the grounds of criminal intimidation and promoting enmity between the groups, according to PTI.At a party workers' meeting last week, Bharti had made controversial comments on the condition of hospitals in Uttar Pradesh.The arrest and the attack on the AAP leader was highly criticised by the party and its chief Arvind Kejriwal. Kejriwal attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath by questioning the conditions of government schools in his state. He also said that if the chief minister doesn't know how to fix the schools he should ask Manish Sisodia, who is the education minister of Delhi under the AAP rule in the capital."Yogiji, our MLA Somnath Bharti ji was going to see your government school. Ink was thrown on him? And then arrested them? Are your schools so bad? If someone goes to see your school, why are you so scared? Fix the school.

Art lovers say tourists line up before the helicopter to take selfies and group photos these days ignoring the sculpture and it was a deliberate move to outshine the art.The octogenarian artist, who was the disciple of legendary artist K C S Paniker, was equally upset and threatened not to attend any government function till the ‘machine’ was removed.“I was really shocked to see the insensitive attitude of the government. The space was my canvass and everything in the background was part of it. I made ‘Jalakanyaka’ (Mermaid) as a tribute to the sea. I don’t know how they placed a machine beside my work of art,” said the angry artist who sculpted many statues, busts and art forms in Kerala, Chennai and the National Gallery of Modern Arts in New Delhi.He said he was not against tourism but it should not be at the cost of an art form and claimed that he was not consulted before the helicopter was placed beside his ‘progeny.’“I really toiled to sculpt ‘Jalakanyaka’ and spent more than a month with fishermen 30 years ago to conceive the idea. Many foreign countries invited me to settle there but I made Kerala my home. Is this reward you give the artist in his twilight years,” he said.Writer and columnist Paul Zacharia was the first to air his concern and many writers and artists soon rallied around him saying it was as good as killing the 30-year-old sculpture. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and BJP leader and former Governor of Mizoram Kummanam Rajasekharan also deplored the move.“It is a painful thing. Travellers and tourists will bemoan such an inhuman act,” said famous travel writer and blogger Santosh George Kulangara. He said the Air Force helicopter should have been kept in a children’s park or museum. Art connoisseurs allege the helicopter was installed near the statue during the early stages of lockdown last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic when visitors were not allowed in tourist destinations.But a senior official of the tourism department said the Air Force had chosen the spot after a request for space to place the helicopter to attract youth to join the force. The official said they never thought it would trigger such a protest. He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was aware of the controversy and would take a final decision on the issue soon.Kerala’s tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran was also in a fire-fighting mode.“I will talk to the artist soon,” said state tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran.Art lovers have threatened a sit-in before the ‘Mermaid’ if ‘justice’ was not done in a couple of days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-art-lovers-fume-after-chopper-installation-near-iconic-mermaid-sculpture-101610368777945.html

Fixed electricity charges reduced by 50% for the 10 months during when theatres were closed. Validity of various licenses extended. Our creative industries will play a crucial part in the recovery,” he wrote on the microblogging site.The announcement comes days after theatres in the state reopened on Tuesday with strict Covid-19 restrictions in place. However, not all movie theatres resumed operations as they were waiting for the government’s response on their demands to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the tickets, and exemption from entertainment tax to allow recovery. They had also asked for a waiver on the monthly fixed electricity charge below ₹50,000, allowing cinemas to make up for the losses they have incurred in the past nine months.While other demands have been accepted, as indicated in the chief minister’s tweet, there is no clarity yet on whether the GST on tickets has been reduced or if it will be done in the coming days.Currently, theatres have only been allowed to run on 50% occupancy which has created contention amongst theatre owners who have asked the government to increase seating capacity to 80%. Theatre goers also need to wear masks at all times and follow proper social distancing norms.As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the government, theatres need to be cleaned and sanitised at regular intervals and show timings of the screenings also need to be staggered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cinema-theatres-exempted-from-entertainment-tax-in-kerala-till-march-tweets-chief-minister-pinarayi-vijayan-101610367291518.html

However, the court granted only two-day police custody of the accused till Wednesday though the police asked for a week’s custody.Akhila Priya was arrested on January 6 for her alleged involvement in the kidnap of three persons – K Praveen Rao, K Sunil Rao and K Navin Rao from their Hyderabad residence the previous night, in connection with a dispute over 50 acres of land at Hafeezpet.After taking their signature on some documents pertaining to the land, the three men who are brothers were let off in the early hours of the following day, they told the police.The police, who initially named Akhila Priya as the accused no. 2 (A-2) in the abduction case, later changed the FIR and named her as the prime accused (A-1). Her political rival in Allagadda in Kurnool, A V Subba Reddy, also a TDP leader who was initially named the main accused was arrested and then was let off after questioning. He is now accused number 2.The police, who had registered cases against her under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 341 and 342 (wrongful restraint and confinement), 452 (trespassing), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 365 (abduction) of Indian Penal Code, filed two more cases under Section 147 (rioting) and 385 (extortion) against her.Akhila Priya’s husband Bhargav Ram, who is the third accused, is still absconding.

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on the petition by a woman who has also sought to nullify her marriage which was allegedly performed when she was a minor.The woman has also sought a declaration from the court that every child marriage performed in the state should be null and void right from its onset.The court issued notice to the woman’s father, brother and the man she was allegedly married to, seeking their response to the plea before February 12, the next date of hearing.According to the woman, represented by advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, when her marriage was performed in April 2010, she was in class 10 and could not go against her parents.The woman, who claims to be born on December 10, 1993, said she was residing with her parents till November 19, 2020, when the person to whom she was married, came with his parents to take her to Gujarat with them.When she objected, she was allegedly beaten up by her brother in front of everyone at the behest of the man she was married to.

Earlier this month, the mother had alleged that the government was forced to go slow in the case as some of the accused were connected with the ruling CPI(M). Last week, a division bench of Kerala high court had set aside the verdict of Palakkad special court for Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act (POCSO) acquitting all the accused and ordered a re-trial in the case. The mother’s petition seeking a central agency probe was also pending before the high court. Two Dalit sisters had died by suicide after alleged repeated sexual harassment by the accused in 2017. The 9-year-old and 13 -year-old allegedly hanged themselves in their house when their parents were away at work. But their parents alleged that both were murdered fearing they will disclose the harassment. In October 2019, the POCSO court acquitted all the four accused due to lack of evidence and after several witnesses turned hostile. After setting aside the POCSO court judgment, the high court also rapped the investigating team and prosecution for serious lapses in the probe and the subsequent trial. Fearing further criticism from the court, the government was forced to hand over the case to the CBI as a face-saver, said legal experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walayar-siblings-death-kerala-to-hand-over-case-to-cbi-101610365405189.html

Nadda was addressing a Vijay Sankalpa (Victory Pledge) rally at police parade ground in Barak Valley’s Silchar ahead of the next assembly polls in the state likely to be held in April-May. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass, senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and senior party leaders like general secretary (organisation) BL Santosh and state in-charge Baijayant Jay Panda were present at the rally. “The task of protecting Assam’s culture, language and identity has been done well by the BJP governments at the Centre and the state and we will continue that. We have been sensitive about the rights of Assamese people,” said Nadda. Also read | ‘Centre earmarked Rs59,000cr for scholarships to backward classes in Assam’The BJP president’s assurance comes amid launch of several new regional parties in the state which have accused the saffron party of not being sincere in safeguarding Assam’s ‘jaati’ (community), ‘maati’ (land) and ‘bheti’ (base) as promised earlier. Nadda mentioned the initiatives taken by Centre and the state governments towards developing Assam and empowering communities. He cited examples of grant of scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities, signing of the third Bodo peace accord and smart fencing of border areas with Bangladesh. “During 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in Centre, Assam received Rs50,000 crore in assistance. But since 2014 when National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by BJP came to power, the state has got Rs300,000 crore,” he said. Nadda targeted the Congress and said that Assam didn’t do well on any front in the 15 years of rule of the party between 2001 and 2016. “During those 15 years, the state saw killings of 2,155 civilians and 284 security personnel and over 12,000 people were kidnapped. Over 51% area of the state was not covered by electrification and 56% homes didn’t have toilets. All that has changed in the recent years,” he said. Nadda said voters were eager to bring back BJP to power and the party, along with its allies, will win over 100 of the 126 total seats in the assembly. From Silchar, Nadda will visit Guwahati and take part in a meeting with party office bearers apart from a few other organisational meetings.

This platform will further our efforts by bringing huge investment and creating employment," he said.The home minister said the single-window clearance system will ensure the process of obtaining clearances smooth for operationalisation of coal mines.Shah said this was yet another manifestation of the prime minister's commitment towards bringing the transparency and transformation in India's coal sector.He also congratulated Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi for his efforts to boost the sector. Shah said that the country has reached a position where the coal sector can be the biggest contributor towards the target of India becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.He said despite having the world's fourth-largest coal reserves, India is importing coal and this is not right for the country.Presently, about 19 major approval or clearances are required before starting a coal mine in the country.In the absence of a unified platform for grant of clearances, the companies were required to approach different departments leading to delay in operationalisation of coal mines, Joshi said.Now, the complete process will be facilitated through the single-window clearance portal in a phased way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boost-in-coal-sector-to-give-fillip-to-india-s-economy-amit-shah-101610363542526.html

The civil court had granted Sood three weeks to approach high court and had restrained the civic body from taking any action of demolition till then.Sood had filed the application in his pending suit before the civil court, challenging two notices issued by BMC -- one for demolition of the additions and alterations made in Shakti Sagar Building, a ground-plus-six storeyed structure at Juhu and the other concerning unauthorised change of use of the building from residential to commercial.The actor moved the high court on January 5 after the civil court rejected his plea for interim relief. His counsel, advocate Amogh Singh, on Monday urged the HC to continue the restraining order passed by the civil court, contending that otherwise the appeal would become infructuous.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare and advocate Joel Karlos, who represented BMC, pointed out that the actor has put up unauthorised partitions across all floors in the building and also converted the residential building into a hotel without taking requisite permissions from the civic authorities for the change of user.Sakhare also pointed out that the illegal additions and alterations were twice demolished earlier by the civic body, once in 2018 and later, on February 14, 2020.Singh, however, maintained that the building was not being used as a hotel, but a residential hotel. He said there is a difference between a hotel and a residential hotel, where flats are rented out to guests for relatively longer period of time.Singh submitted that Sood had in, 2018 itself, filed an application for regularisation of the alterations but the civic body had yet not taken a decision on it. He contended that it was impermissible for BMC to take any action as regards the building when the application was pending.The matter will now come up for further hearing on January 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-construction-case-relief-for-sonu-sood-as-hc-extends-order-against-bmc-action-till-january-13-101610362164452.html

As his replies were not satisfactory, the police detained him under section 41 (d) of Criminal Procedure Code ( CrPC) and took him to the police station.“During sustained questioning, he admitted that he had stolen gold ornaments from Pune’s Akhil Mandai Ganapati temple under Vishrambaug police station,” said an officer from the LT Marg police station.On contacting their counterpart in Pune, the Mumbai Police learnt that Bhuktar had stolen 224 grams of gold ornaments. The city police have recovered ornaments worth 142 grams, the police said.Senior inspector of LT Marg police station Deepak Nikam said that the accused is being handed over to the Vishrambaug police station for further investigation.The Akhil Mandai Mandal and its Sharada-Ganesh idol is one of the main attractions of Pune’s Ganesh festival. The incident had taken place on the night of January 7. The matter came to light the next day when the priest visited the temple at 6am. The incident also got caught on the CCTV camera installed in the temple premises. The thief had also broken into the donation box and stolen the cash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-who-stole-gold-ornaments-from-pune-s-ganesh-temple-nabbed-from-mumbai-s-zaveri-bazaarpolice-101610360759686.html

He also said that the BJP will return to power in Assam in Assembly elections, scheduled in April-May."It is the responsibility of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to safeguard the culture and language of Assam and the party has always given importance to these things," Nadda said while addressing a rally in Silchar in Barak Valley."BJP is working peacefully for the development of Assam, after taking into consideration interests of all communities," he added.He also highlighted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah solved 50-year-old Bodo issue by signing peace accord and bringing militants to mainstream.Nadda is on a two-day visit to Assam to kick start the ruling party’s campaign for the Assembly polls. He will attend a number of party programmes during his visit.The BJP, which had stormed to power in the state for the first time in 2016, is confident of keeping the throne after putting up an impressive show in recent local polls.The Barak Valley, which comprises three districts, has been a traditional stronghold of the BJP for over three decades. In 2016, the BJP had won eight of the 15 seats here while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) had won five and Congress two. The BJP is hoping to better its tally this time. Last month, Lakhipur Congress MLA Rajdeep Goala resigned from the Assembly and joined the saffron party.The main opposition party Congress received a setback after the death of its heavyweight and three-term chief minister Tarun Gogoi. Opposition parties, however, hope to put the BJP on the defensive over a host of issues, including the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Congress' in-charge for Assam, Jitendra Singh, is in Guwahati since January 8 as part of a five-day visit.The BJP, which has 60 seats in the 126-member assembly, is aiming to win over 100 seats this time, along with its pre-poll partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-given-due-recognition-to-assam-s-culture-nadda-in-silchar-101610361404653.html

Police suspect that the woman was strangled to death. The police said Vidya Devi, the sister of RAS officer Yugantar Sharma, lived alone. “Devi was a widow and used to live alone. Around 7am, her neighbours saw her collecting milk at her doorstep . An hour later, when her colleagues called her, she didn’t respond, after which they informed her brother Sharma. When he reached the spot, the police was informed too,” said Anand Shrivastava, commissioner of police (CP), Jaipur city. Also Read: Youth suspected of killing mother, her live-in partner in JaipurThe CP added that when police entered the house around 10.15 am, they found the woman dead with her hands and legs tied with a shawl around a railing in the house. “It appears that the woman was strangulated. However, the medical report will reveal the exact cause of death. But there were no visible signs of resistance and nothing was stolen from the house which indicates that Devi was killed by someone she knew,” Shrivastava said. A team of 50 policemen, including DCP Crime Digant Anand, DCP South Harendra Mahawar, additional DCPs Suilesh Chaudhary, Avnish Kumar, district special team, special team of commissionerate, four assistant commissioners of police, and six circle inspectors are involved in the investigation. The police teams are interrogating the entire colony.

11-01-2021||India||Holding your breath may increase risk of getting Covid-19, say IIT Madras researchers||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras researchers have found that holding your breath or breathing slowly may increase your risk of getting coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as the process of virus-laden droplets being transported into deep lung increases with decreasing breathing frequency. The research team modelled the breathing frequency in a laboratory and found that low breathing frequency increases the time of residence of the virus and, therefore, it increases chances of deposition and consequently, the infection.Also, the multi-scale lung structure has a significant effect on a person’s susceptibility to Covid-19. The research was led by Prof. Mahesh Panchagnula, department of applied mechanics, IIT Madras, with his research scholars Arnab Kumar Mallik and Soumalya Mukherjee.The findings of this study were published in the international journal ‘Physics of Fluids’.“Covid-19 has opened a gap in our understanding of deep pulmonological systemic diseases. Our study unravels the mystery behind how particles are transported and deposited in the deep lung. The study demonstrates the physical process by which aerosol particles are transported into the deep generations of the lung,” said Panchagnula, while elaborating on the need for such research. In their research, the team reported that holding the breath and having low breathing rate can increase chances of virus deposition in the lungs.Also read | India clocks 16,311 new Covid-19 cases, 161 deaths“The study was conducted to pave the way for developing better therapies and drugs for respiratory infections. Previous work from the group has also highlighted the significant variability in aerosol uptake from individual to individual, suggesting a reason why some people are more susceptible to airborne diseases than others,” the institute said in a statement. Airborne infections such as Covid-19 spread immensely through sneezing and coughing as it instantly releases a large volume of tiny droplets.The team imitated the droplet dynamics in the lung by studying the movement of droplets in the small capillaries which were of similar diameter to bronchioles. They took water mixed with fluorescent particles and generated aerosols from this liquid using a nebulizer. These fluorescent aerosols were used to track the movement and deposition of particles in the capillaries. The researchers studied the movement of the fluorescent aerosol particles in capillaries of size ranging from 0.3 to 2 millimetres which covers the range of bronchiole diameters. They found that the deposition is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of capillaries, which suggests that the droplets are likely to deposit in longer bronchioles. The scientists also studied how the ‘Reynolds Number,’ a parameter that quantifies the nature of flow - steady or turbulent, determines the deposition in the capillaries. They found that when the flow of aerosol movement is steady then the particles deposit via the process of diffusion, however, if the flow is turbulent then the particles deposit via the process of impaction. “In future, the team intends to continue this work to understand how the virus-laden droplets are transported into lungs as the process by which the virus is transported from the nasal cavity to the deep lung is still unknown. An understanding of the physics of this phenomenon could be crucial in mitigating the progression of the disease,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/holding-your-breath-may-increase-risk-of-getting-covid-19-say-iit-madras-researchers-101610361024579.html

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said that the board had written to all the concerned departments to take prompt action to check release of pollutants in the air. “Enforcement of the plan lies in the hands of various government departments,” Ghosh said.The BSPCB has also recently tied up with the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP) to launch a crackdown on brick-kilns not following the newer zigzag technique to reduce emission. “The UNDP would provide real time data on stubble burning also,” said Ghosh.Air quality analyst of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED), citing AQI data of the past three years of Patna, claimed that people of the state capital were forced to breathe the worst quality of air in the month of January. “AQI of Patna on January 1 at 4pm was found to be in the severe category, which is considered the worst,” said the CEED official.The CEED analyst said that lack of coordination among rule enforcing departments, burning of solid fuel, unrestrained plying of polluting vehicles, open burning of wastes and poor management of dust at the contraction sites were the major factors responsible for ‘low hanging fruits’ that led to severe degradation of air quality. “Low hanging fruits can be managed with serious intervention of the law enforcing machineries,” he said. Another environmental activist said that dust particles, which is a bane for Gangetic plains, could be managed by regular spraying of water on under construction roads and roads with heavy traffic. “Water shall be sprayed on trees along the road to improve the AQI,” he said. Ghosh said that the board had allotted funds to the Patna municipal corporation (PMC) to purchase water sprinklers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patna-grapples-with-severe-air-pollution-after-2-years-of-clean-action-plan-101610359045951.html
11-01-2021||India||Police complaint lodged against TMC MP for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments||A police complaint was lodged against Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee on Sunday for allegedly making a controversial statement linking Goddess Sita and Hathras rape victim. While addressing a gathering at Barrackpore in North 24 Parganas district, Banerjee reportedly said past Saturday, “Sita went up to Ram and said, ‘I am fortunate that I was abducted by Ravan. Had it been your chelas (followers), who wear saffron head bands, my fate would have been the same as that of the rape victim in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh’.” The BJP alleged that the MP’s speech had hurt Hindu sentiments and called it the TMC’s appeasement politics. The party’s IT cell chief, Amit Malviya, tweeted, “TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee used derogatory language against Sita mata. Claims that she told Bhagwaan Ram she was glad , “Thank God, I was abducted by Ravan and not by your chelas or else my fate would have been same as Hathras victim!” Is trampling on Hindu sentiment Pishi’s idea of appeasement?” The complaint against Banerjee was lodged with Golabari police station in Howrah by Bharatiya Janata Youth Morcha leader Ashish Jaiswal. “The language used by MP Kalyan Banerjee has insulted and humiliated religious sentiments of crores of Hindus not only in West Bengal but also in India. World over Hindus worship Goddess Sita,” Jaiswal wrote in his complaint. HT has a copy of Jaiswal’s complaint. Top police officials of Howrah refused to comment. Senior TMC leaders also refused to comment, saying that only Banerjee could comment on the issue as he was the one who made those statements. Banerjee, however, refused to take calls and didn’t respond to messages. Meanwhile, the TMC has accused the BJP of insulting Bengali sentiments over Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s recent statement. Speaking to media persons, the Union minister, who is the state as a part of the BJP’s poll campaign, said, “Whenever there was any injustice or atrocity in the world, the first voice was raised from Bengal. Rallies were brought out when the US attacked Vietnam. There were protests in Kolkata if there was any incident in Delhi. But now, when anyone says Jai Shri Ram in Kolkata and his house is set on fire and innocent workers (BJP workers) are sent to jail, then the neighbour [also] doesn’t say a word. The DNA has changed.” The TMC hit back, saying that those who think Bengali’s DNA has weakened are living in fool’s paradise. “This is highly insulting. Those who think that Bengalis have forgotten to protest and their DNA has weakened are living in fool’s paradise. The people of Bengal are against communalism and hence hate BJP,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister and senior TMC leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-complaint-lodged-against-tmc-mp-for-allegedly-hurting-hindu-sentiments-101610359166683.html

Winds are blowing at 20-25kmph so the perception of cold is stronger. They are chilly winds. We are expecting cold day conditions over Delhi for the next few days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.According to IMD a “cold day” or “severe cold day” is considered based on two parameters—a minimum temperature of under 10 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or 6.4 degrees below normal respectively. A cold wave occurs in plains when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and/or is 4.5 notches lesser than the season’s normal for two consecutive days. Cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius in the plains. Witnessing a cold day and cold wave together means the gap between day and night temperatures is lower than normal.Despite very strong winds Delhi recorded “poor” category air quality with an air quality index of 245 on Sunday. Strong winds and better ventilation conditions are likely to prevail from January 10 to 13. The air quality is likely to remain in “poor” to “moderate” category on January 11 and 12 according to the air quality early warning system for Delhi under ministry of earth sciences.“Air quality was in ‘very poor’ category. It has improved to ‘poor’ category and is improving further. We are likely to see ‘moderate’ air quality for two or three days due to strong winds,” said VK Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division.Under the influence of a cyclonic circulation over equatorial Indian ocean and adjoining central parts of South Bay of Bengal up to mid tropospheric levels, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with moderate thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Lakshadweep during the next three days. Heavy to very heavy rainfall also likely over south Tamil Nadu during January 11 and 12 and over Kerala and Mahe on January 12.Due to a trough (area of low pressure) in low-level easterlies from southeast Arabian Sea to northwest Madhya Pradesh, scattered rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning is very likely over Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat and west Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/better-air-quality-drop-in-minimum-temp-likely-over-parts-of-northwest-india-101610356228415.html
11-01-2021||India||Bombay HC extends relief to Sonu Sood in 'illegal' construction case||The Bombay High Court on Monday extended till January 13 a civil court order granting interim protection to actor Sonu Sood from coercive action by the BMC against the alleged illegal structural changes made by him in a residential building in suburban Juhu without permission.Sood last week approached the HC, challenging a notice issued against him by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in October last year and an order passed by a civil court in December dismissing his suit against the BMC's action.The civil court, while dismissing the suit, had granted three weeks time to Sood to file an appeal and stayed its order, thus granting relief to the actor.On Monday, BMC's counsel Anik Sakhare sought time to respond to the actor's petition.Sood's advocate Amogh Singh then sought interim protection and a direction to the civic body to not take any coercive action.Justice Prithviraj Chavan, while adjourning the petition till January 13, said, "The order passed by the lower court shall continue till then."Sood's advocate Singh told the HC that the actor has not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building."The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrant permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Singh said.BMC's counsel Sakhare, however, argued that the petitioner was illegally converting the residential building into a hotel without procuring license."A hotel with 24 rooms is being run in the six-storey residential building. The BMC has taken demolition action on the property twice...once in 2018 and then in February 2020. But, still the illegal construction is on," Sakhare said.A police complaint has now been filed by the corporation, he added.Justice Chavan then asked Sood's lawyer if the actor was operating a hotel in the building without license."Are you conducting hotel business without license? You should come to the court with clean hands. If not, then you will have to face consequences," Justice Chavan said.To this, Singh said Sood is not conducting a hotel business, but is running "a residential hotel in which flats are rented out to people".Sood's petition has sought the court to quash and set aside the notice issued by the BMC and an interim relief of no coercive action to be initiated against him.Sood, who is known for his roles in films like "Dabangg", "Jodha Akbar" and "Simmba", came into spotlight last year for his philanthropy work in helping migrants reach their homes during the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-extends-relief-to-sonu-sood-in-illegal-construction-case-101610355845523.html

The comment by Dave, who is representing the farmers, came as the Supreme Court was hearing a clutch of pleas challenging the farm laws as well as the pleas to remove the protesters.Also Read | If Centre doesn't want to stay farm laws' implementation, we will: SCAttorney General KK Venugopal, who is representing the government in the top court, had brought up the issue of protesting farmers vandalising the venue of a pro-farm laws’ rally in Haryana’s Karnal on Sunday. The rally was to be addressed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The ruckus led to Khattar cancelling it. “Yesterday, there was an unsavoury incident of violence at a protest site near Karnal. Now they (farmers) want to march their tractors to Rajpath on January 26,” Venugopal said.“We don’t intend to protect the lawbreakers,” the top court bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde responded, asking Dave why will the farmers take their tractors to Rajpath in the national capital.“We will not do that,” Dave replied for farmers' unions. “The farmers have their family members in the security forces. They will not do that. I will not make a statement. There are 400 unions at the protest site. There are 150,000 farmers there.”The Supreme Court had said earlier during the hearing that it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations are being held between the Centre and the farmers on the three farm laws. "What is going on? States are rebelling against your laws," the bench told the Centre. "We are extremely disappointed at the way the government is handling the talks. What consultative process was followed by you before passing the laws? All are up in rebellion against the laws," it added.With multiple rounds of talks with the Centre not yielding any result, the farmers' unions had announced a series of programmes earlier this month to build pressure on the government to repeal the laws. One of the steps announced by them was the said tractor march, which, they said, would see thousands of tractors enter Delhi on January 26 on Republic Day and “march” in the national capital parallel to the official celebrations. As a “trailer,” a tractor march was organised on January 7 on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway.Monday marks Day 47 of the anti-farm law protests. Eight rounds of talks have taken place between the government and farmers' unions so far. The next round of talks will next take place on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-do-that-farmers-unions-to-supreme-court-on-jan-26-tractor-march-101610355272965.html

Cultivation of millets requires less water than rice and wheat, which makes them suitable for small growers.In December 2020, the Chhattisgarh government had decided to procure seven more forest produce from the tribals of the state.The seven new minor forest produce that were added to the list of forest produce procured at minimum support price by the state government includes Kusmi seed, Reetha fruit (dry), Shikakai, Satavar roots, Kaju Guthli, Malkangani seeds, and Mahul leaves.As per the officials, total 52 forest produce are being procured in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-announce-minimum-support-prices-for-kodo-kutki-millets-101610355182155.html

There are many other cases for you to investigate... Utilise this time for investigating those cases,” said the division bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale.The comments came after public prosecutor Dipak Thakare sought a direction to the actor and her sister to appear before the investigating officer (IO) again for further investigation of the case.Also Read: Kangana Ranaut meets MP CM Shivraj Chouhan; backs anti-conversion lawThakare pointed out the sisters appeared before the IO on January 8, 2021, as ordered by the court earlier, but the actor’s interrogation was not complete yet. He said more than 100 tweets are required to be investigated, and it could be completed if Ranaut and Rangel appear before the IO for three consecutive days.The bench refused to consider the request, reiterating that it had serious doubt about the applicability of Section124-A of the Indian Penal Code (sedition) against the actor and her sister. The bench then placed the petition jointly filed by Ranaut and Chandel for further hearing on January 25, clarifying that it will consider the request on that day.The actor and her sister have moved the high court challenging the October 16, 2020 order of a magistrate court at Bandra on the basis of which an FIR has been registered against them at the Bandra police station for allegedly “creating hatred between Hindus and Muslims, especially those engaged in Bollywood.”The Bandra Police on October 17, 2020, booked the sisters under sections 124(A) (sedition - to bring or attempt to bring into hatred or contempt, or excite or attempt to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise), 153(A) (promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, race, place of birth, language etc. and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting it’s religion or religious beliefs) along with section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.The magisterial order came on a complaint lodged by casting director Munawarali aka Sahil Sayyed. The magistrate directed the Bandra Police to take action under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as he felt that a thorough investigation and search and seizure was necessary to be conducted in the matter.Sayyed, in his complaint to the magistrate court, had alleged that Ranaut has, through her tweets and television interviews, continuously defamed the Hindi film industry by portraying Bollywood as a hub of nepotism, favouritism, drug addicts, communally biased persons and murderers, etc.Sayyed has alleged that this has “even created bad image of Bollywood in the minds of people and created a communal divide and rift between people of two communities.” His complaint added that Ranaut has been “maliciously bringing religion in all her tweets.”The casting director further alleged that Chandel, who also works as Ranaut’s manager, has also tweeted highly objectionable messages, intended to create communal rift.The high court has, however, expressed serious doubts about the applicability of Section 124-A, the charge of sedition, against the actor and her sister, and restrained the police from taking any coercive action against them in connection with the case.The judges said they did understand the application of other section, but felt that it was too harsh.Advocate Rizwan Merchant, who represented the complainant Sahil Sayyed, has, however, maintained that Section 124-A of IPC was relevant to the facts of the case. He submitted that earlier the serious charge was rarely applied, but now whenever there is an attempt to create disaffection or disapprobation about the government, the charge of sedition is applied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-restrains-police-from-issuing-fresh-summons-to-kangana-ranaut-sister-101610349993380.html

Haryana police used tear gas shells and water cannons to disperse the protesting farmers.Bharatiya Kisan Union's (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni on Monday acknowledged members of his organisation vandalised the venue of the Kisan Mahapanchayat called by Harayana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Karnal district on Sunday. He also asserted that they will continue to hold protests against the rallies by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)."Yes, we didn't allow Khattar sahab to hold the rally in Kaimal. The BJP said that they will hold 700 rallies to break our movement and we will protest against such rallies," news agency ANI quoted Chaduni as saying.On Sunday, agitating farmers vandalised the venue of Kisan Mahapanchayat called by Khattar in Karnal. During the agitation, farmers who are protesting against the three farm legislation passed by the Centre, damaged the helipad where Khattar was scheduled to land. They also vandalised the stage and the rally was called off. The incident resulted in a clash between the farmers and police during which the former used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd.Later, the Haryana chief minister accused the farmers' union of attempting to instigate the people. "Today's incident gave a message to people, bigger than what I had intended to give. These people have defamed the farmers because a farmer doesn't have such nature. A farmer can be less educated or simple but he is sensible," he said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at the borders of Delhi since November 26 last year against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.They have been demanding a complete withdrawal of the laws which has been refused by the government. Instead, it has offered to make amendments. The government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers to resolve the deadlock, without any positive result. The next round of talks will be held on January 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yes-we-didn-t-allow-haryana-cm-to-hold-rally-farmers-union-chief-101610349776471.html
11-01-2021||India||From Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan to White Revolution: Remembering Lal Bahadur Shastri on his death anniversary||January 11 marks the death anniversary of Lal Bahadur Shastri, one of the greatest Indian statesmen and second prime minister of the country. Shastri was elected to the legislature from the United Provinces, erstwhile Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states, and held key cabinet positions of transport and home ministry. Shastri took over as the second prime minister of the country after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru in May 1964.Here is remembering Lal Bahadur Shastri and the inspiration he was:1. Shastri joined Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement against the British when he was 16. He joined the fight against colonial rule immediately after Gandhi called upon the countrymen to unite and fight for independence.2. As the prime minister, he stopped drawing his salary during the war between India and Pakistan in 1965, when the country was facing a food shortage.3. He played a key role in the White Revolution to make India self-reliant in milk production. Lal Bahadur Shastri created the National Dairy Development Board and backed the Amul milk co-operative in Gujarat's Anand.4.Shastri gave the famous slogan 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' during the 1965 India-Pakistan war to boost the morale of soldiers and the farmers in the backdrop of the crucial war and food paucity.Also Read | India returns Chinese soldier who strayed into Pangong Tso area5. Shastri was deeply concerned for the agriculture of India and was critical of the lack of contact between the peasants and the elites, as per Gilbert Etienne's book Indian Villages. He also promoted the Green Revolution with the aim of farmers' prosperity and to make India self-reliant in foodgrain production. Green Revolution remains the model operation in India that benefited states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.6. Shastri's tenure was the prime minister was only for 19 months as he died in Tashkent on January 11, 1966. He was succeeded by Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi.7. "India will have to hang down her head in shame if even one person is left who is said in any way to be untouchable," was one among many inspirational quotes given by him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-jai-jawan-jai-kisan-to-white-revolution-remembering-lal-bahadur-shastri-on-his-death-anniversary-101610348992598.html
11-01-2021||India||India returns Chinese soldier who strayed into Pangong Tso area||A Chinese soldier, who was apprehended by the Indian Army on January 8 after he strayed across the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), was on Monday returned to the Chinese authorities, army officials familiar with the development said.The soldier was apprehended near the southern bank of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh last week, amid the ongoing border standoff between the two sides. He was returned to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point at 10.10am, the officials said.China had, on Saturday, demanded that soldier be returned immediately. The Chinese authorities said the soldier “went astray” along the India-China border due to “darkness and complicated geography.”Also Read: ‘16 Bihar’ heroes of Galwan skirmish to be honoured at Republic Day paradeThis is the second time a Chinese soldier has been held by the Indian Army after crossing into Indian territory since the border row erupted last May.Heights on both banks of the lake have been at the centre of the border row between the two countries.The PLA soldier was dealt with according to procedures, and circumstances under which he crossed the LAC were investigated.In October 2020, the Indian Army had apprehended a Chinese soldier in the Demchok sector after he strayed across the LAC. The army identified the soldier as Corporal Wang Ya Long. It then said it had received a request from the PLA about the whereabouts of the missing soldier.Corporal Wang was provided medical assistance including oxygen, food and warm clothes. The soldier was returned to the Chinese side after the investigations and formalities were completed.While India has consistently pushed for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and the restoration of status quo ante of early April during the ongoing military talks, the Chinese side wants the Indian Army to first pull back troops deployed at strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso.The two armies have held eight rounds of military talks so far, with dates yet to be announced for the delayed ninth round of dialogue between corps commander-ranked officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-returns-chinese-soldier-who-strayed-into-pangong-tso-area-101610347419440.html
11-01-2021||India||A decade after defeating polio, India is set to begin its battle against Covid-19||This is a week of beginnings and ends. January 16 marks the beginning of India’s vaccination drive to end coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and January 13 marks one decade of the country being free of polio, which paralysed around 200,000 children in the country each year till the mid-1980s.Multiple nationwide vaccination drives to inoculate every child under the age of five years against polio led to cases declining within a year from 741 in the end of 2009, to one on January 13, 2011, which was the last recorded case in India.The World Health Organization (WHO) certified India polio-free in 2014 after extensive testing for the wild polio virus through lab analysis of all acute flaccid paralysis cases reported from any cause, and environmental sewage sampling found no new case for three consecutive years.In the final years leading to polio eradication, around 2.3 million vaccinators under the direction of 155,000 supervisors visited 209 million houses to give polio drops to 172 million children on each national immunization day.With two approved vaccines – Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin -- India is kickstarting the world’s biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive with an aim to inoculate 300 million people at most risk of infection and death by August. To do so, it has strengthened and expanded its polio and routine immunization delivery and surveillance network to both vaccinate and track potential side effects.“We began preparations for the Covid-19 vaccine drive in early August last year when the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEG-VAC) was set up to identify financing resources for its procurement and to strengthen delivery platforms, cold chain and associated infrastructure for safe, equitable and transparent delivery of the vaccine,” said Union health and science minister Dr Harsh Vardhan.NEG-VAC first met on August 12 to iron out the creases in the storage, distribution, tracking, administration and monitoring for side-effects of vaccine doses. The first shipments of Covishield have begun, with vaccines ready for distribution from vaccine storage depots across states. Of the 300 million on priority list, around 10 million are health workers in the private and government sectors, including integrated child development services workers. Another 20 million are frontline workers.The ground has been meticulously prepared to scale up delivery, said public health experts. “India has identified priority groups by both occupation and age, which will make it easy to assemble and administer the vaccine. It’s efficient election commission machinery for assembling and verifying people has also been deployed successfully,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.“What also works in favour of India is its strong network of central services, especially the Indian administrative service, which can coordinate well between centre and states and between vaccination centres,” said Dr Reddy.Add to that an extensive primary health care network that is already delivering the Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP), which reaches around 26.7 million newborns and 29 million pregnant women each year.“Mass vaccination led to polio and smallpox eradication in India. We already have a robust UIP programme with district hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres and sub-centres are equipped to deliver 12 vaccines, of which nine are given nationally and three sub-nationally. Our healthworkers are experienced in vaccine management and delivery. It’s time-tested, it works. Plus, the gaps identified by NEG-VAC since August have been addressed, and now we have increased the number of vaccine storage depots from 41 to 60, added refrigerated vans, trained vaccinators, and conducted dry runs in every district,” said Dr Harsh Vardhan.As with polio, the last-mile access challenges remain, especially in difficult geographies. Then there is the obviously challenge of the massive scale of the operation, which will need a committed health force to administer two doses by intramuscular injection for several months till enough people are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity.Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness will need to be addressed on priority to prevent vaccine hesitancy among the general population with limited access to correct information. “Inadequate vaccine literacy because of limited communication can affect reach, so community networks must be engaged on priority to ensure Covid-19 vaccine uptake remains high,” said Dr Reddy.As I said before, this is a week of beginnings and ends. My column HealthWise, which has appeared every week in Hindustan Times without a break since the summer of 2007, ends today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-decade-after-defeating-polio-india-is-set-to-begin-its-battle-against-covid-101610345733369.html

11-01-2021||India||‘16 Bihar’ heroes of Galwan skirmish to be honoured at Republic Day parade||At least five Indian Army soldiers including Colonel B Santosh Babu of 16 Bihar battalion who blocked Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA) aggression to capture territory in East Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 last year will be posthumously honoured with gallantry medals on Republic Day, people familiar with the matter said.ALSO WATCH | 'World saw soldiers in Ladakh...': PM Modi warns China, PakWhile the Defence Ministry and Indian Army are tight-lipped about the number of medals, Hindustan Times has learnt that at least two officers and three troopers who gallantly fought the Chinese will be honoured.The Indian soldiers had retaliated in full measure when the Chinese troops refused to withdraw from a location near Patrolling Point 14 in line with the agreement reached between the two countries, and triggered the clash. The PLA troops had come prepared with barbed wire sticks and spears. The Indian soldiers were overwhelmed in numbers but managed to evict the Chinese soldiers in the seven-hour conflict along the Line of Actual Control, the first in more than five decades.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who travelled to Ladakh soon after, had paid glowing tributes to the bravery and courage of soldiers in the frontlines of the stand-off. “Bharat Mata’s enemies have seen your fire and fury,” PM Modi said on this visit that saw him delivering a sharp reminder to China that the “era of expansionism” was over.At its peak, the violent clash involved more than 600 rival soldiers with a majority of casualties on both sides due to hypothermia with the soldiers getting pushed out of the cliff into the freezing Galwan river.Twenty Indian soldiers laid down their lives at Galwan Valley but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese troops. Although the PLA has not disclosed the number of its dead, Indian Army estimates based on intelligence and communication intercepts on that day indicate that more than 50 Chinese troops including the Commanding Officer of the battalion involved in skirmish had died.The names of the 20 soldiers led by Colonel B Santosh Babu, 37, commanding officer of the 16 Bihar battalion, have been inscribed on the National War Memorial. The army has also built a memorial at Post 120 in Leh for the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the Galwan Valley conflict, also called “Op Snow Leopard” in army records.China had claimed that it had decided not to publicise the exact casualties because comparisons could trigger antagonism on both sides. But Indian officials underscore that Beijing’s subsequent conduct in the East Ladakh sector does not reflect maintaining peace and tranquillity was a priority for the Chinese side. PLA troops had tried to transgress into Indian territory near the southern bank of Pangong Tso in August but were outflanked by Indian commandos by taking control of a strategic height.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-bihar-heroes-of-galwan-skirmish-to-be-honoured-at-republic-day-parade-101610345018500.html

The former Trinamool Congress (TMC) heavyweight took on the state’s ruling party before making a public appearance after a long time.“The TMC has become like a short blanket. You try to cover your face and your leg shows. If you try to cover your legs, it falls short and your face comes out. TMC was born on January 1, 1998 after getting a green signal from the BJP. But the leaders who were there in its forming years are now with the BJP,” he said.Also Read: BJP-TMC clashes break out in two districts of West BengalThe TMC has hit back saying that till Chatterjee joined the BJP, he was using the same blanket.“Let’s not forget that he was using the same blanket. Actually, TMC leaders who joined the BJP had to sign a deal with the new party. They have to say whatever the party wants them to say,” said Tapas Roy, TMC spokesperson.Last week Chatterjee and his Banerjee had skipped the BJP roadshow at the last minute, leaving the party red-faced. Banerjee later said that she had fallen ill. She had initially told mediapersons that she received a call from the BJP office and the caller told her that it was primarily Chatterjee’s show and she need not come. The roadshow was finally led by senior BJP leaders Kailash Vijayvargiya, Mukul Roy and Arjun Singh.Even though Chatterjee joined the BJP in August 2019, he stayed away from active politics. Even during the fag-end of his tenure in the TMC, he had withdrawn himself from active politics. Monday’s rally is being seen as his comeback after hibernation from active politics of almost three years.The roadshow will be held from Golpark to Selimpur in south Kolkata.“We will all attend the roadshow as party workers,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-former-kolkata-mayor-may-end-political-hibernation-with-bjp-roadshow-today-101610342267062.html
11-01-2021||India||Air pollution raises childhood anaemia risk: Research||Meeting air pollution control goals under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) could go a long way in improving child health in India, a new research paper has concluded, finding a strong correlation between high outdoor pollution and prevalence of anaemia among children under the age of five years.A research led by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi and Harvard University’s TH Chan School of Public Health found that on a district level, for every 10 micrograms per cubic metres increase in outdoor PM2.5 exposure, average anaemia prevalence increased by 1.9% and average haemoglobin level decreased by 0.07 g/dL (grams per decilitre) .At an individual level ,for every 10 micrograms per cubic metre increase in ambient PM2.5 exposure, average haemoglobin decreased by 0.14 g/dL among children under the age of five. PM 2.5 are fine, inhalable particulate matter with diameters that are generally 2.5 microns, or about 30 times smaller than a strand of human hair.Also read | Air pollution raises risk of pregnancy loss in India, south Asia: Lancet studyThe researchers used data from the national family and health survey 2015-16 to examine the association of anaemia with high PM 2.5 levels. “We collected the geo-location of the children covered in the National Family Health Survey data. We derived their exposure to PM 2.5 concentrations based on the year of their birth to the time of the survey. The data was adjusted for diet, maternal anaemia prevalence and body mass index all of which has a bearing on anaemia prevalence,” said Sagnik Dey, coordinator of the Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) and associate faculty at the School of Public Policy, IIT Delhi. The team used satellite data for calculating air pollution concentrations.For the district-level analysis, exposure was derived based on the five-year average ambient PM2.5 exposure per district while individual level analysis was based on the year of birth.“Our analysis reveals that apart from diet and other known causes of anaemia like maternal anaemia, air pollution also plays a significant role in anaemia development and prevalence. We have also discussed the biological mechanism through which air pollution could be a risk factor for anaemia. But that can be only confirmed through a cohort study (studies on groups of people to investigate the causes of a disease),” added Dey.High air pollution levels have been associated with adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and mortality outcomes. For children, it has been associated with low birth weight and stunted growth in past research.As of 2016, nearly 60% of children in India were anaemic. The introduction of the National Iron Plus Initiative in 2011 sought to expand the beneficiaries of the National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme to children aged 6–59 months. “Although anaemia decreased by about 11% between 2006 and 2016, it remains a major issue despite an increase in available food fortified with iron. It is clear that other potential risk factors for childhood anaemia must be identified and understood,” the study observes.The NCAP doesn’t have a legal mandate but aims to achieve a 20% to 30% reduction in PM 2.5 concentrations from the 2017 levels in over 100 cities by 2024.“Chronic inflammation can affect the production of red blood cells. It can also affect the way iron moves inside the body or iron trafficking which is mediated by cytokines. We believe that it is the same mechanism by which air pollution raises the risk of low birthweight and preterm births. Inflammation is the biggest link between air pollution and anaemia. But definitely cohort studies would make this linkage clear,” said Kalpana Balakrishnan, the director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Centre for Advanced Research on Air Quality, Climate and Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-raises-childhood-anaemia-riskresearch-101610340325657.html

The park had been declared an “alert zone” on Sunday after 17 more ducks were found dead in the green area. Culling in more areas will follow soon, one of the officials said.As an immediate precautionary measure, a second senior government official said, more parks are likely to be shut in the national Capital, orders for which will be issued by respective authorities later in the day. On Saturday, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which maintains most of the big parks in the city, had shut at least four major district parks in Hauz Khaz, Dwarka Sector 9, Hastsal and Sanjay Lake as a precautionary measure until further orders.Also Read: Amid surge in bird flu cases, scientists say risk of spread to humans lowThe reports arrived from the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, ICAR, Bhopal, on Monday morning.“Eight of the 109 samples sent to various laboratories tested positive for avian influenza on Monday morning. We do not have to wait for more confirmed reports as the protocol comes into force the moment a single case is reported in the city,” said Dr Rakesh Singh of the animal husbandry department.Singh said the eight sample reports which tested positive for bird flu were the ones of dead crows and ducks picked up from Sanjay Lake park in Mayur Vihar Phase 2, Dwarka Sector 9 and Mayur Vihar Phase 3.More than 140 birds, mostly crows, have been found dead across locations in Delhi over the past four days, even as district officials were directed to ensure that unauthorised wholesale poultry markets were closed for 10 days amid concerns of the spread of avian influenza.The move came a day after the Delhi government announced the closure of the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market for 10 days and banned the import of live birds in the Capital as a preventive measure to stop the potential spread of bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-hits-delhi-culling-begins-at-sanjay-lake-park-more-to-be-shut-101610340759524.html

Hence, we have decided to cull all the birds in one-km radius of the place where these deaths took place," the collector said."We have created a prohibitory zone in 10 km radius of the area where the birds died. No birds will be transported from there to any other place. Our medical team is stationed there and it is examining all people of the village," he said.There is no need to be panic and the district administration is taking all precautions.The bird flu outbreak has already been confirmed in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.The central government on Sunday said it has directed zoo managements to submit daily reports to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) till their area is declared free from the disease.The CZA, under the environment ministry, issued an office memorandum saying avian influenza is a scheduled disease under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, and reporting such a disease is obligatory for taking appropriate preventive measures against its spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-bird-flu-confirmed-after-900-hens-die-in-parbhani-101610340134480.html
11-01-2021||India||Amid farmers’ protests, govt plans to scale up Kisan e-mart||The Central government is planning to scale up the digital online platform, Kisan e-mart, that allows farmers to directly sell their produce to private buyers, even as the impasse over the three new agricultural laws continues.According to people familiar with the matter, the pilot, which is currently active in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Haryana, will now be extended to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tripura, Gujarat and Telangana.The Kisan e-mart is a partnership between Agri10x and the Common Services Centre (CSC) scheme, which operates under the Digital India project of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Nearly 375,000 CSCs are functional at the panchayat-level across India. Farmers are allowed to register at the CSC and after their KYC is completed, they can sell produce online without the hassle of having to transport it.Also Read: SC to hear pleas on farm laws, Delhi protests todayAccording to Pankaj Ghode, CEO of Agri10x, nearly 500,000 farmers are registered on the portal, which provides them access to 5,000 buyers. The buyers include major grocery retailers such as Big Basket, Reliance Fresh, Ninja Kart, Venky’s and Haldiram’s.The online platform provides direct access to buyers, doing away with mandis. This has been a major point of contention for the farmers under the new farm laws. Farmers have been demanding a repeal of the laws as they say the legislations will hurt their livelihoods. While the government has agreed to set up a committee to look into the law, it has stayed firm on not repealing them despite several rounds of talks with the farmers.“The buyers offer the farmers their prices and they can choose who to sell the produce to,” said an official on the condition of anonymity. “The farmer gets a chance to assess which is a better and fairer price.”The ambit of the platform, which has been functional for over six months now, was slated to be expanded earlier but was delayed due to the new farm legislations, the official added.Ghode said that the aim is to make Kisan e-mart functional across 28 states over the next three years, but for now expansion would take place in the states mentioned. “It is a simple concept. The farmer can avoid the cost of transportation, effectively allowing him/her to make more money by using the platform,” he said. “The scheme has been a major success.”According to the government official mentioned above, feedback about the functioning of the e-mart has also been reviewed by the government. Among the areas identified for improvement is the need to generate a greater level of trust with the farmers.“The farmers feel that if they use the online platform, there is no guarantee that the buyer will purchase from them again,” the official said on the condition of anonymity. “We are trying to spread more awareness to address this concern.”Another issue is regarding the quality of the produce. While at present, the quality is determined digital using a software to analyse the photographs, a system of physical inspection may be in the offing.“There is a need to put in place a mechanism for sorting and grading the produce,” the official said. “All concerns will be evaluated and addressed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-farmers-protests-govt-plans-to-scale-up-kisan-emart-101610337443079.html

11-01-2021||India||Amid surge in bird flu cases, scientists say risk of spread to humans low||There has been a surge in avian influenza or bird flu cases in the country as authorities fear the disease may be spreading rapidly beyond the seven states confirmed to have been afflicted so far, after reports of “unusual bird mortality” from new areas.Regions where H1N8 cases have been confirmed are spread out across the country, forming a south-to-north arc, which raises the threat for other central and eastern states, an official said.Scientists have confirmed the current H1 strain is transmissible from birds to humans, although such a risk is currently low.Bird flu epidemics have been confirmed so far by the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD) in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.Avian flu has significant economic impact. Poultry farmers in these states said they were counting losses from decimated farms.The flu has a domino effect in related supply chains. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes, said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities firm. Maize is a major feed used for poultry.Test results are awaited for Delhi and Maharashtra, where “unusual mortality of birds” has been witnessed, according to an official statement.While some samples from Balod in Chhattisgarh tested negative, the state still faces a higher threat level because of more death of birds reported in the past 24 hours, an official of the animal husbandry department said.“The virus involved is zoonotic,” said C. Tosh, a senior scientist from NIHSAD. The term zoonotic refers to any pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans.India has one of the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it lies underneath three transnational flight paths of migratory birds, showing how difficult it is to prevent poultry diseases in the country.Bird flu epidemics have occurred 24 times in the country since the first outbreak 2004. The last outbreak happened in 2016, when the flu tore through poultry in Delhi, Kerala, Punjab and MP.Kerala and Haryana have completed several rounds of culling in accordance with national animal-disease guidelines.Avian flu mostly comes from infected wild birds, which shed the virus in their faeces. In India, the disease mostly is spread by migratory birds, such as geese, ducks and shorebirds.“I have lost about Rs40,000 worth of new chicks,” said Rohit Mann Singh, the proprietor of Mann Poultry in Rajasthan’s Kota.Since 2004, compensation worth ₹400 crore from federal funds was given to poultry farmers who faced the epidemic, aside from financial aid from states.Fresh positive samples were found from two poultry farms in Panchkula district of Haryana. The state has deployed nine rapid response teams. “Control and containment operation is under way in both the epicentres,” the statement cited above said.Fresh samples of crow and wild birds have been confirmed for bird flu from Surat in Gujarat and Sirohi of Rajasthan. “Further, reports of unusual deaths of 86 crows and two egrets were received from Kangra district (Himachal Pradesh),” the statement said.Besides, reports of unusual mortality of wild birds have also been received from Nahan, Bilaspur and Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and samples have been sent to the designated laboratories for testing.Bird flu is thought to have arrived through the western coast in the first week of January. On January 5, there were 12 confirmed epicentres in Rajasthan (Baran, Kota, Jhalawar), Madhya Pradesh (Mandsaur, Indore, Malwa), Himachal Pradesh (Kangra) and Kerala (Kottayam, Allapuzha). Allapuzha itself had four epicentres.A department of dairy and animal husbandry official said control and containment had been completed in both the affected districts of Kerala.The Centre has deployed several teams, which are currently touring hot spots to oversee management operations, which includes culling, prevention and surveillance.One Central team is in Kerala since January 9, monitoring the epicentre sites and carrying out epidemiological investigation. Another Central team reached Himachal Pradesh on January 10, and is undertaking surveys in affected zones.Special drives were being undertaken in lakes and water bodies as they are known to destination sites for wild birds.States have been asked to increase surveillance around water bodies, live-bird markets, zoos and poultry farms. Federal teams are assisting local authorities for proper disposal of carcass and strengthening of bio-security in poultry farms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-surge-in-bird-flu-cases-scientists-say-risk-of-spread-to-humans-low-101610337384387.html

11-01-2021||India||Bird flu cases spread, more states||At least seven states have so far confirmed cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, and close to a dozen more are confronting the spectre of the disease that has led to thousands of wild and poultry birds perishing since the last week of December, when it spread to India after wreaking havoc in Europe, China and Japan, officials said on Sunday.While the outbreak seems to be under control in Himachal Pradesh, where close to 4,000 migratory birds have died, and in Kerala, where 20,000 ducks have perished, its spread appears to be widening in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, where bird flu has been confined mainly to the common crow.In Haryana, where close to 437,000 poultry birds have died, hundreds of thousands birds have been culled and there were no reports of spread to new areas other than Barwala, Asia’s biggest poultry belt, with over 100 big farms where they are reared.“It is easier to control bird flu in poultry than in the wild,” said an official in the animal husbandry department of the central government, requesting anonymity. The official also blamed the states for responding late to bring the outbreak under control.He cited the example of Haryana, where the state government was not able to confirm bird flu in poultry for as long as 26 days. It was finally at the Centre’s intervention that samples were sent to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, which confirmed bird flu.Uttar Pradesh was on high alert on Sunday as the first instances of bird flu were reported from a zoo.Two samples of fowls in Kanpur zoo tested positive for the disease, after which the Central Zoo Authority issued an alert to all zoos in the country to be watchful.Ten jungle fowls were found dead in the zoo and a decision has been taken to cull all fowls in the zoo, said a zoo official who requested anonymity, adding that the fowls had most likely been infected by migratory birds.The Bareilly-based Central Avian Research Institute (CARI) has formed a rapid response team and issued guidelines for controlling the spread of the bird flu.In UP’s Sonbhadra district, the administration has banned the entry of poultry from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. In MP, bird flu has been reported from 27 of the 52 districts.About 1,100 crows and wild birds have died, said an official in the state’s animal husbandry department.Madhya Pradesh’s additional chief secretary, home, Rajesh Rajora said: “District collectors and superintendents of police have been asked to prepare an action plan to control and contain the spread of bird flu.”Bird flu spread to MP from Rajasthan, where the death toll of crows and wild birds has risen to 2,950 with the disease spreading to 30 of 33 districts in the state. Chicken have been spared from infection in Rajasthan.On Sunday, the death of 121 crows in Dehradun created a scare, three days after three crows were found dead in Uttarkhand’s capital city||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-cases-spread-more-states-101610332054858.html

11-01-2021||India||Army officer staged Shopian encounter for ₹20L, say police||The army captain charged with killing three youths in the July 18 fake encounter in Shopian did it for ₹20 lakh in reward money, according to the case charge sheet filed by police.“By staging the encounter, Capt Bhoopendra Singh of 62 RR and two other civilians also purposefully destroyed evidence of the real crime that they have committed and also have been purposefully projecting false information as part of a criminal conspiracy hatched between them with motive to grab prize money of ₹20 lakh,” news agency PTI quoted from the police charge sheet.HT could not independently access a copy of the charge sheet and when asked for confirmation, SP Shopian, Amritpal Singh, said: “The charge sheet is court property now. It is up to them whether they want to share it or not”.Police named three people — Capt Bhoopendra Singh, Tabish Nazir , a resident of Chowgam, and Bilal Ahmed Lone, a resident of Arabal Nikas, Pulwama — in the 1,400-page charge sheet filed before the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Shopian, on December 26 into the killings of Rajouri residents Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohd Abrar.The charge sheet, according to the news agency, has statements of four army personnel — Subedar Garu Ram, Lance Naik Ravi Kumar, Sepoys Ashwini Kumar and Yougesh — who were part of Capt Singh’s team at the time of the incident and were asked to cordon off the area from different directions.“…as they were approaching the spot on foot after disembarking from the vehicle they heard a few bursts of live ammunition even before they had laid the cordon,” said the charge sheet.Later Capt Singh told them that he had to fire as the hiding militants were trying to escape. It said the accused captain of 62 Rashtriya Rifles “furnished false information to mislead the senior officer and for getting” an FIR lodged to “tailor fit his motive of grabbing prize money in furtherance of criminal conspiracy”.A police statement on December 27 after the filing of the charge sheet said the investigation revealed the conspiracy was hatched to abduct the victims and stage the encounter.The charge sheet was filed after the army said it had completed its summary of evidence against its men.The three Rajouri residents were killed in an encounter on July 18. While the army initially said that the three were terrorists, later it admitted that the powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded by its men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-officer-staged-shopian-encounter-for-20l-say-police-101610329667615.html
11-01-2021||India||US welcomes Lakhvi conviction, seeks action for 26/11||The US has welcomed the conviction of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi on charges of terror financing but called on Pakistan to prosecute him for his alleged role in masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks.A Pakistani anti-terrorism court convicted and sentenced Lakhvi on Friday, though India dismissed the development as a “farcical” action made with an eye on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).“We are encouraged by the recent conviction of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi. However, his crimes go far beyond financing terrorism,” the US state department’s bureau of South and Central Asian affairs said on Twitter.“Pakistan should further hold him accountable for his involvement in terrorist attacks, including Mumbai attacks,” it added.Lakhvi was arrested soon after the carnage in Mumbai in November 2008 on charges of planning, supporting and financing the attacks in India’s financial hub that killed 166 people, including six American nationals. There has been little progress in Pakistan’s efforts to prosecute Lakhvi and six other accused in the case despite evidence provided by witnesses.The LeT commander was freed on bail in the Mumbai attacks case in 2015 and reports had suggested that he had been playing an active role in guiding the UN-designated terror group’s operations even from jail.The Pakistani anti-terrorism court found Lakhvi guilty under three sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act for running a dispensary to raise funds for terror financing. This was the first time Lakhvi has been convicted of a terrorism-related offense. However, a spokesman for the Counter-Terrorism Department of Pakistan’s Punjab province told media he was arrested for terror financing and not for any “specific militant attack”.The external affairs ministry called for “credible action” by Pakistan against terror groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-welcomes-lakhvi-conviction-seeks-action-for-2611-101610327972921.html
11-01-2021||India||Union Budget may give fiscal breather to states||The Budget may provide some additional fiscal space to states if they implement certain citizen-centric reforms as a special dispensation in line with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) stimulus package that raised their borrowing limit by 2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) in 2020-21, amounting to over ₹4.27 lakh crore, people familiar with the development said.The role of states is crucial in a rapid recovery of the economy ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic. States will require additional resources in achieving faster economic growth, which would mean borrowing beyond the limit of 3% of GSDP, two persons said, requesting anonymity.The Union government is scheduled to present the Budget for fiscal year 2021-22 on February 1, which is expected to focus on reviving economic growth, which was battered by the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. As a result, the Indian economy contracted by 23.9% and 7.5% in the quarters ending June and September, and according to the first advanced estimate by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the country’s GDP is expected to contract by 7.7% in fiscal 2020-21.“One of the options is to allow a special borrowing dispensation beyond the available space for fiscal deficit, which could be conditional and linked with specific reforms that will help to boost growth,” one of the two persons cited above said. Under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, states are allowed to keep their fiscal deficit at 3% of GSDP.On May 17, 2020, the government raised the borrowing limit by an additional 2% of GSDP in 2020-21, worth over ₹427,300 crore.While the first 0.5% or ₹106,830 crore was unconditional, another 1% was on condition that the states implement four citizen-centric reforms with a 0.25% value each -- put in place a one nation, one ration card system, improve ease of doing business, reform urban local bodies and the power sector. The remaining 0.5% was conditional on states implementing three out of the four reforms. Later, this was relaxed for states if they opted for the first borrowing option of plugging their shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue of ₹1.10 lakh crore.The Union finance ministry on Thursday said 10 states have so far implemented the one nation, one ration card system, seven of them have undertaken measures for ease of doing business and three states have implemented reforms in urban local bodies. They have been permitted additional borrowings of ₹54,190 crore.Experts said that for a rapid economic recovery, states must be allowed to borrow more than usual and money must be spent judiciously. DK Srivastava, chief policy adviser at consulting firm EY India, said, the financial year 2021-22 would be critical for providing a significant growth push to GDP through the central and state budgets.“As such, both central and state governments may have to rely on fiscal deficits that are well above their respective FRBM norms. A continued relaxation of states’ fiscal deficit by a margin of 2% points of GDP in FY22 should be considered a welcome step,” he said.Commenting on the ongoing additional borrowing dispensation in 2020-21, he said states could not avail of the entire fiscal space that had been given to them because of excessive conditionalities attached to the scheme. “The only relevant condition that should be imposed with respect to additional borrowing should relate to ensuring that the additional borrowing is spent fully on additional capital expenditure.This would be prudent in the long run because additional liabilities due to borrowing would be matched by additional assets through infrastructure spending,” he said.“The citizen-centric reforms linked to additional borrowing are not relevant in the context of borrowing.Those incentives should be separately designed and linked to the centrally sponsored schemes. In any case, these reforms are better implemented in a normal year rather than in a Covid affected abnormal year,” he added.Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said that although performance-based incentives for state governments “is a tricky issue, going forward, this could become the norm”.He said states are “more inclined towards adhering to the Finance Commission recommended performance parameters since the commission is a constitutional body, independent of the central government”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-budget-may-give-fiscal-breather-to-states-101610327215515.html
11-01-2021||India||SC to hear pleas on farm laws, Delhi protests today||As the impasse continues between the government and farm unions on resolving differences over three contentious agricultural laws, all eyes on Monday will be trained on the Supreme Court, which is to take up separate petitions challenging the farms laws and those filed by lawyers and law students to end a protest by farmers who have encircled Delhi since November 26.On January 6, during a hearing in the SC, the Centre said that an “understanding” could be in sight with the farmers’ unions over the contentious agricultural laws, even as the Chief Justice of India lamented that there was “no improvement in the situation”. A three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde will take up four petitions filed by four different sets of petitioners who are seeking an end to the protest while some are demanding the provision of facilities farmers who have massed at the protest sites in the chill of winter. The petitions have been filed by advocates Reepak Kansal, GS Mani, law student Rishabh Sharma and a person identified as Janeshwar.The court will also take up a separate set of seven writ petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September. Farmers say the laws will hurt their livelihoods, reduce their bargaining power and put them at the mercy of powerful agribusinesses.Among those who have challenged the farm laws in the top court include members of Parliament Tiruchi Siva from Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Manoj Kumar Jha from Bihar’s Rashtriya Janata Dal, lawyer Manohar Lal Sharma, the Bhartiya Kisan Party, Madhya Pradesh farmer DP Dhakad, Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress vice president Rakesh Vaishnav and P Ayyakannu, state president of the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam.On four of these petitions, the SC had issued notice on October 12 and directed the Centre to file its response. On January 6, when the court issued notice on a fresh petition by lawyer ML Sharma, attorney general KK Venugopal informed the Court that since talks between farmers and the government were “healthy”, the government had shelved its plans to file a response on the validity of farm laws. The unions have sought a repeal of the laws. The Centre is open to incorporating modifications, but has ruled out their repeal. The stalemate continues after the eighth round of talks. The next round of talks is slated for January 15.No role of SC in resolving ‘deadlock’: UnionThe government should resolve the “political deadlock” over new farm laws without the involvement of the Supreme Court, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said on Sunday and warned that the protesting farmers “will soon close down all borders” of Delhi if their demand for repeal of the legislations is not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-pleas-on-farm-laws-delhi-protests-today-101610326079924.html
11-01-2021||India||Vaccines to arrive in Capital by Thursday||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday the government has finalised 89 sites for the vaccination drive against the coronavirus, with stocks of the jabs expected to arrive in the Capital between January 12 and January 14, a remark that came a day ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interaction with chief ministers to take stock of the immunisation exercise that begins on January 16.India’s vaccination drive, the world’s largest such exercise against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), will kick off on January 16 with priority to about 30 million health care and frontline workers, the government has said. India plans to vaccinate 270 million others in six to eight months.“Each centre will be managed by 8-10 staff. Cold storage facilities are ready and security arrangements are in place. The vaccines should arrive in the city between January 12 and 14,” Jain said.The Prime Minister, meanwhile, will interact with CMs to review the arrangements for the drive. This will be Modi’s first interaction with chief ministers since the Drug Controller General of India on January 3 offered emergency use approval to a pair of Covid-19 vaccines – Pune-based Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International’s indigenous candidate Covaxin, which is still in Phase 3 trials.Three dry runs have so far been conducted across the country for the vaccination campaign. The vaccine roll-out will initially target 10 million health care workers and 20 million other front line workers, and will later cover high-risk population such as senior citizens and those with comorbidities numbering about 270 million.Covid-19, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world, has claimed 151,215 lives in India and affected 10,467,429, making it the country worst hit by the viral disease after the United States.On the eve of the meeting with the Prime Minister, the Delhi health minister said that the city-state’s administration had shortlisted 89 vaccination centres. Forty will be in public hospitals and 49 in private hospitals, he said.In the first phase, the vaccine will be administered to health care workers. While the Delhi government had estimated their number at 300,000, around 225,000 of them have registered to receive the vaccine, said a senior government official. Health care workers will be followed by an estimated 600,000 front line workers – employees across government departments, agencies and civic bodies – engaged in Covid-19 management.Next in line would be people aged above 50 years and individuals with comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.Their number has been currently pegged at 4.2 million but it is bound to increase as the Delhi government is still updating its database for these groups and creating mechanisms for self-registration to ensure nobody misses the shot, said a government official who requested anonymity. HT had reported on January 5 that the government is working on a plan to grade the last group on the basis of age, number of comorbidities and the type of comorbidities.Delhi’s main vaccine storage centre has been set up at the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Speciality Hospital. There is another centre in Civil Lines as a back-up. The government has also drafted a plan to set up a third centre for bulk storage at the directorate of health services in Karkardooma. Other than that, there are 609 cold chain points and a plan for 1,000 vaccine administration centres for later stages.Jain said at a media briefing earlier on Sunday: “We have urged the central government to make Covid-19 vaccines free for all residents of India. I highlighted the issue in a recent meeting with the Union health minister and yesterday chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to the central government.”On Saturday, Kejriwal posted a tweet urging the central government to consider making Covid-19 vaccines free for all Indians.On the day of the first vaccine dry run on January 2, Jain had said that the Covid-19 vaccine would be free for all residents of Delhi. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan assured free vaccines for health care and frontline workers in the first phase.Asked if the Delhi government would administer the vaccine free to all the residents of the city, Jain said: “We have requested the Union health minister. He has said that he will consider the proposal. We should wait.”Dr Suneela Garg, a professor at the Maulana Azad Medical College in Delhi and an adviser to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Now that the city has witnessed successful dry runs, the next few days should be spent on revisiting the exercise, especially areas such as crowd management and monitoring of patients after vaccination. Delhi is prepared for the vaccination drive.”A Pune-based executive with a logistics firm that has been hired to transport the vaccine vials said, meanwhile, that it had deployed a fleet of 300 refrigerated trucks at various locations in the country to transport the vaccine. The transport of the vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India will be initially by air and then through road, for which the Pune Police have arranged for two-tier security.Executives from Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions held a meeting with Pune Police chief Amitabh Gupta on Saturday, according to a report in HT’s Sunday edition.“We have a fleet of 300 refrigerated trucks which was upgraded from 200 in the last six months. All are indigenous trucks with refrigeration infrastructure installed locally as well. We carry extra fuel for the road as well. Even we are not sure about the routes and destinations yet but we have 30 branches of our own and our nodal point will be at the cold storage in Bhiwandi, Thane. Our vehicles, however, are on standby,” said Rahul Agarwal, founder of Koolex Integrated Cold Chain Solutions. A logistics official will be appointed by the Serum Institute of India who will assign the number of vials to be carried by each commercial airline. The Indian Air Force will also be in the mix for the transport of the vaccine in remote areas, according to an earlier report published by HT.The Serum Institute of India, which had stockpiled 50 million doses by the first week of January, said that the vials need to be maintained at a temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The refrigerated trucks are equipped to maintain the required temperature and live-track the location as well, according to Agarwal.The federal ministry of health and family welfare announced on Saturday that the nationwide vaccination drive will commence on January 16.Prime Minister Modi chaired a meeting on Saturday to review the status of the pandemic in the country along with the preparedness of the states and Union territories to begin the vaccination drive. The meeting was attended by the cabinet secretary, principal secretary to the PM, health secretary, and other senior officials.Modi reiterated that India has a global role in the vaccination drive against Covid-19. “Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world’s biggest vaccination programme,” he said at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-to-arrive-in-capital-by-thursday-101610324434580.html

India will launch its Covid-19 vaccination drive from January 16 in what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called the world’s largest inoculation programme with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.As part of preparations for the nationwide rollout of Covid-19 vaccine, the health ministry on Sunday held a video conference with officials from states and Union Territories to discuss feedback on the Co-WIN software and its operational use gathered from the vaccination dry runs.Giving an overall view of the CoWIN software and the principles that shall underpin the technology backup for the vaccination exercise, he said robust, dependable and agile technology shall form both the foundation and the back-up for the country’s Covid-19 vaccination drive. “The process should be citizen-centric and built on an approach that the vaccine shall be available anytime and anywhere,” Sharma was quoted as saying in a statement.About the use of the Aadhaar platform, Sharma advised the states to urge the beneficiaries to seed their current mobile number with Aadhaar for registration and consequent communication through SMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-shall-form-foundation-of-covid-19-inoculation-drive-centre-to-states-uts-101610317435296.html
11-01-2021||India||Two House panels to review vaccination||New DIndia’s Covid vaccine management will come under added scrutiny as two parliamentary panels have decided to review it.Days after the panel on chemical and fertilizers announced it will review the production, the health panel has listed “Vaccine Development, Distribution Management and Mitigation of Pandemic Covid-19” for detailed examination.The chemical and fertilizer ministry is responsible for development and regulation of chemicals including those used for making drugs.The new rounds of parliamentary review into the all-important executive action that is of vital importance are well-justified, according to MPs, as parliamentary committees—an extension of Parliament itself—have supervisory authority over all public activities.India is scheduled to kick-start Covid vaccination on the 16th of this month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet all chief ministers on Monday for what is seen as the final round of preparatory meetings before the vaccination starts nationwide.Covishield, developed by Oxford University and British drugmaker AstraZeneca, will be the lead vaccine in India’s immunisation programme with Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin as a back-up.Experts have raised questions over what they termed as a hasty approval process by India’s drug regulators for approving Covaxin. A political storm also brewed over the vaccine with Congress leader Manish Tewari last week alleging that the government had “politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety” as he questioned the hasty approval for vaccines.“The BJP government has politically misused the Covid-19 pandemic in its entirety. The controversy over the vaccine is its latest manifestation. Who is going to get himself vaccinated with a vaccine that has question marks on its reliability,” Tewari was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.The House panels, however, are expected to take a larger view of vaccine management including India’s capacity and also look into the government’s entire plan for administration.The panels will meet the vaccine makers, health ministry officials and other health experts before finalising their reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-house-panels-to-review-vaccination-101610308785323.html
11-01-2021||India||BJP planning to hold awareness campaign to dispel fears on Covid-19 vaccine||New Delhi: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will undertake a countrywide campaign to create awareness about the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines that have received regulatory approval and make a concerted effort to clear “misconceptions and fears” about their efficacy, people aware of the plan said.The party will decide whether to enlist senior BJP leaders, including ministers, in the campaign to build confidence among the people in the two vaccines, a party functionary said on condition of anonymity. A nationwide Covid-19 vaccination drive will begin on January 16, the Union ministry of health said on Sunday.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has issued emergency use authorization to Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Pl.c., and Bharat Biotech International Ltd’s indigenous Covaxin.A second senior BJP leader said the vaccine awareness campaign will be similar to the public outreach initiatives the party organises on the central government’s policies and social welfare programmes.“There will be groups of party workers who will make contact with people across the country and dispel concerns such as worries about possible side effects...The opposition parties have already politicised the issue and raised doubts...We will see to it that these doubts are cleared,” the second leader added, also requesting anonymityDetails of the outreach programme will be drawn up soon.“So far the details of whether senior leaders including ministers will take the shot have not been firmed up. The protocol for administering the vaccine (for those in the high-risk category) will be followed. Some leaders such as (spokesperson) RP Singh have volunteered to be part of the third phase trials of Covaxin,” said the second functionary..Critics have expressed concern at Covaxin receiving the regulatory nod despite the relatively less amount of data on the efficacy and safety on the vaccine candidate of Bharat Biotech.On Friday, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and former Bihar minister Tej Pratap Yadav said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should take the lead and get the first shot of a coronavirus vaccine. Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav stoked a controversy with comments that he would not take a “BJP vaccine.” Some Congress leaders have also raised questions over approval for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine candidate, alleging that due process hadn’t been followed.Responding to these allegations by the opposition, BJP chief J P Nadda tweeted that these were “wild theories” to ridicule national achievements.“Time and again we have seen whenever India achieves something commendable - that will further public good - the Congress comes up with wild theories to oppose and ridicule the accomplishments. The more they oppose, the more they are exposed. Latest example is the Covid vaccines,” Nadda tweeted last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-planning-to-hold-awareness-campaign-to-dispel-fears-on-covid-19-vaccine-101610308022611.html
11-01-2021||India||PM Modi to meet chief ministers today over Covid-19 vaccine rollout||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Monday chair a meeting of the chief ministers of states and union territories ahead of the rollout of nationwide Covid-19 vaccination. The Prime Minister will review the Covid-19 situation in states.The meeting is expected to take place at 4 pm on Monday. This will be PM Modi's first interaction with chief ministers following the recent approval of two coronavirus vaccines for restricted emergency use by India's drug regulator.The decision to start the vaccination programme from January 16 was take at a high-level meeting chaired by PM Modi on Saturday. The date was decided keeping in view a number of festivals like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu etc.The government has said that two crore healthcare workers and about one crore frontline workers, engaged in the fight against the pandemic, will be the first to be inoculated.After vaccinating healthcare and frontline workers, priority will be given to those above 50 years of age and the under-50 population groups with co-morbidities, together numbering around 27 crore, according to a government statement.PM Modi has called it the world's largest inoculation programme. He had earlier said that India is among the nations with the lowest fatality rate and the highest recovery rate."Being the pharmacy of the world, India has supplied important medicines to all those in need in the world in the past and is also doing so now. The world is not only waiting for Indian vaccines but is also watching how India runs the world biggest vaccination programme," he said while addressing the 16th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention on Saturday.The Centre has undertaken three rounds of nationwide dry runs to prepare for vaccination. The Union health ministry organised these dry runs in coordination with state health departments and ministries to prepare authorities for vaccination and find out loopholes before the inoculation begins officially.A vital part of the dry run was the Co-WIN application, an online platform for monitoring COVID-19 vaccine delivery. Lakhs of healthcare officials have uploaded their details on the software, which has not been officially launched yet.The Centre said on Sunday that Co-WIN shall form the foundation for the anti-coronavirus inoculation drive which shall be citizen-centric so that the vaccine is available anytime and anywhere.The health ministry identified the weak areas and asked the state authorities to work on them so that the vaccination can be conducted smoothly. In a virtual meeting on Sunday, the health ministry discussed feedback on the Co-WIN software and its operational use gathered from the vaccination dry runs with state health authorities.India had recently granted emergency use authorisation to two vaccines - Oxford's Covishield being manufactured by Serum Institute in India (SII) and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. Both vaccines, the statement from the health ministry said, have established safety and immunogenicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-meet-chief-ministers-on-monday-over-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101610294811047.html

The comments are unlikely to go down well with the Indian government, which has put considerable effort into improving relations in the past few months.“Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, which are located east of the Mahakali river belong to Nepal as per the Sugauli Treaty. We will get them back through diplomatic talks with India,” Oli told the National Assembly session, according to Republica news website.Nepal’s rulers never made efforts to reclaim Nepalese territories after Indian military forces were stationed in the region after the India-China war of 1962, he said.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Oli’s comments.Oli triggered a border row last year after his government issued a new political map that showed Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh – all controlled by India – as part of Nepalese territory. The map was issued after India built a new road to the strategic region on the border with China.“Some people are restless because my government issued the new political map incorporating the encroached Nepali territories. In fact, our rulers hesitated to speak against the Indian encroachment. Now, we are working to get back these territories,” Oli told the National Assembly.Over the past few weeks, Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Goel, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla visited Kathmandu to help put the bilateral relationship back on an even keel. Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali is scheduled to visit India on January 14 for a meeting of the bilateral joint commission with his counterpart.Oli, however, said his government has made sincere efforts to strengthen relations with both India and China, and these ties had reached “new heights”. He also described the recent visits by Indian and Chinese officials as goodwill visits.“We are working to deepen ties with India based on sovereign equality. In fact, we want to deepen the relationship with India in [the] true sense and we should not hesitate to raise our issues of genuine concerns with India,” he said.Referring to the visits of Indian and Chinese officials, Oli said: “They came here to convey their good wishes. There is nothing to worry much about that.”A high-level Chinese delegation led by Guo Yezhou, vice minister of the international department of the Communist Party of China, had recently travelled to Nepal to try to broker a truce between Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, his main rival in the ruling Nepal Communist Party. The growing differences between the two leaders had prompted Oli to dissolve Parliament and call fresh elections in April-May.Oli described his act of dissolving Parliament as constitutional. “I was forced to dissolve the House of the Representatives as some people in my party did not allow the government to perform well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-pledges-to-retrieve-kalapani-region-from-india-through-talks-report-101610273428483.html
11-01-2021||Today's||In India’s lower judiciary, the absence of in-group bias||Much of the debate around judicial fairness in Indian courts has focused on Supreme Court or high court judges. The expansive lower judiciary, comprising more than 7,000 district, sessions, and subordinate courts, has largely been missing from this ongoing debate.To fill this gap, we examined data on over six million court cases filed under India’s criminal codes between 2010–2018 across the country. Women represent 48% of the population, but only 28% of lower court judges. Similarly, India’s 200 million Muslims represent 14% of the population, but only 7% of lower court judges. We wanted to test whether these disparities lead to worse judicial outcomes for women and for Muslims. Measuring bias in criminal proceedings is not straightforward. It is not sufficient to look at conviction rates for different social groups, because other inequalities may result in differential outcomes. For example, it is hardly surprising, and not evidence of bias against men, that only 23% of individuals charged under the penal code are women.Instead, we applied a statistical test that has uncovered judicial bias in courts in several other countries. We asked whether women or Muslim defendants on average get different decisions on their cases, depending on whether their assigned judge is a man or a non-Muslim. This test is credible, because neither defendants nor prosecutors in the judicial system have much control over the demography of the judge who hears a case. In fact, the legal system explicitly prohibits the practice of shopping for judges, noting that it “must be crushed with a heavy hand”.This allowed us to compare two defendants who are alike in every way — of the same gender and religion, charged under the same section of the penal code, in the same month, with cases heard in the same district court — whose only difference is that one had her case heard by a female judge and the other by a male judge.There is evidence from around the world that judges discriminate in favour of litigants who share their identity. For example, in Israeli courts, Arabs whose cases are heard in front of Arab judges get more favourable decisions than Arabs whose cases come before Jewish judges. In the United States, women are more likely to win sexual discrimination lawsuits when their cases are heard by female judges.We expected to find the same kind of bias in India’s district courts. Our own prior research shows that Muslim men are worse off than Dalits and Adivasis in terms of upward economic mobility. The 2006 Sachar committee reported that Indian Muslims fare worse on every human development indicator, are over-policed, and are often killed in botched police encounters. Given a climate of prejudice, we had reason to suspect bias in judicial decisions.To our surprise, across six million criminal cases, we found virtually no evidence of in-group bias among judges on either gender or religion. Male defendants did not get better outcomes when they were assigned to male judges, nor did female judges favour women. Equally, the judicial outcomes of Muslims were virtually identical whether their cases were assigned to Muslim or to non-Muslim judges. We found similar results whether we looked at case outcomes (such as acquittal or conviction), or at case processes, like delay.We did find some evidence that male judges are more lenient overall than their female colleagues. But this is not evidence of bias, because male and female defendants get equally lenient treatment from male judges.Our study is just one step toward building a body of evidence on the performance of the Indian judicial system. We found an absence of in-group bias in one context, but it does not rule out other forms of bias in the legal system as a whole. We did not have data to study in-group bias along caste or socio-economic lines. We also cannot rule out unequal treatment of Muslims or women in the system as a whole. Our study does not provide any reason to doubt the existence of widespread unfair treatment in other domains.However, our research is optimistic about lower court judges, at least with regard to this important form of bias. If district and lower court judges display impartiality toward defendant identity in their rulings, they should be celebrated for it, even as other problems are rightly condemned.Similar studies need to be done on police and prosecutor behaviour, and on outcomes in other courts. Our research was only possible because of the laudable efforts of the courts to make data on cases publicly available. The government should make available detailed microdata on all the other stages of the criminal justice process, such as police stops and arrests. If justice is served fairly, there should be nothing to fear from transparency.

11-01-2021||Today's||Listen to the voice of protesting farmers||The protesting farmers want to be heard. For years, governments have neglected the agricultural sector, failing to recognise the abysmal conditions under which a majority of our farmers work. The ongoing protests must be understood in the backdrop of the levels of poverty they face.Approximately 55% of the total workforce in India was employed in agriculture and allied sectors (2011 Census). This has declined to 42.5%, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018-19. The Economic Survey 2019-20 states that the share of agriculture and allied sectors in national income has also declined to 16.5%. Though the average size of an agricultural holding was around one hectare in 2015-16, small and marginal farmers who hold less than two hectares of land constitute 86% of the total holdings. Only 1% of farmers hold more than 10 hectares of land. The average monthly income of an agricultural household in India is estimated at about ₹6,500. It varies from approximately ₹18,000 in Punjab to ₹3,500 in Bihar. Small and marginal farming households earned less than ₹2,500 from agriculture. It is little wonder that 52% of all agricultural households in India are indebted — 64% of marginal farmers, with holdings of less than one hectare, and 18%, who hold between one to two hectares, are in debt. What this data suggests is that agriculture is not only unremunerative, but is deeply linked to levels of poverty in rural India. A National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) survey also found that families of small and marginal farmers spent ₹6,750 per month on daily expenses while their incomes may have been much less.Since farming has become unremunerative, farmers have little surplus to deal with contingencies, even in a relatively good year. In most other years, they are forced to borrow from local moneylenders to meet major expenses such as a family marriage, a medical emergency or education. This is above the regular loans they take to buy fertilisers, seeds and other inputs.Let us look at another data point. The average outstanding loan of a farming household is just over ₹1,00,000. Most loans, which account for this debt, are from non-institutional sources at exorbitant interest rates ranging from 24% to 36%. Since the sanctioning of loans by institutions is a lengthy process, involving demand for collateral security, farmers are driven to non-institutional sources resulting in extreme indebtedness. This also explains the number of suicides by farmers — in 2019 alone, the number was 10,281.Unlike the corporate sector, the farming community doesn’t have the clout to influence government. Industry and other sectors of the economy seek exemptions, waivers and incentives while farmers are only seeking Minimum Support Prices (MSP). Even that price doesn’t cater to their sustenance as 94% of the farmers are deprived of the benefits of MSPs. Of over 140 million farmers, only 8.7 million benefit from it. In states such as Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka, none of the farmers knew about MSPs before the sowing season, according to a NITI Aayog report. Punjab and Haryana, however, are the biggest beneficiaries. In fact, 85% of the wheat procured in India in 2019-20 came from the three states — Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, which is why Punjab’s farmers are so concerned about their livelihood. The protesting farmers are seeking an assurance on MSPs for all crops until markets become sufficiently competitive. The government must continue with the policy of declaring MSPs of various crops well before the sowing season. Further, MSPs should be linked to inflation so that farmers know much revision will take place going forward.While our government is keen on liberalising the agricultural sector, most governments around the world have subsidised it. The reason why previous governments have encouraged the continuation of MSPs is because procurement by Food Corporation of India (FCI) at MSPs, mostly wheat and paddy, was for distribution at subsidised prices for food security. Though farmers are given a declared price for their output, their input costs of water, power, fertiliser and seeds are subsidised. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and European Union countries, plus 12 key emerging economies, provide over $700 billion a year to support the agricultural sector. The Indian government is trying to do the reverse by not providing for a security net for the largest workforce in the country unlike the developed countries where 2% of the population or less is involved in agriculture. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of an MSP by providing the farmers the entire cost of the production plus 50% of the profit based on MS Swaminathan’s recommendations has, to date, not been honoured. The irrigation projects promised by the Bharatiya Janata Party in its 2014 manifesto have not been realised. The crop insurance scheme has turned out to be a flop and the Operation Greens project to create better storage facilities has stalled. While farmers from Punjab and Haryana along with others are protesting, sugarcane farmers from UP too have not been paid their dues. They are also ready to take this protest further.The State needs to take notice of the disquiet within the largest workforce in this country. The Supreme Court’s advice that the laws be put on hold should be welcomed by the government. If the government chooses not to listen, this may cost it the 2024 election.Kapil Sibal is a former Union minister, senior advocate and a senior Congress leader The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/listen-to-the-voice-of-protesting-farmers-101610375726357.html
11-01-2021||Today's||Tracing the roots of an American brand of extremism||In September 2020, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher A Wray, warned that the most pressing threat facing the United States (US) was from anti-government and far-Right groups. The security breach on Capitol Hill in Washington DC last week revealed the dangers of these movements to America’s democratic traditions. There are many far-Right ecosystems in the US, but recently the likes of QAnon, Boogaloo Boys and Proud Boys, among others, have become the driving examples of quasi-cult like movements developed on conspiracy theories and ideologies, often beginning their lives online.QAnon is an internet conspiracy theory that has its cult-like followers believe that Donald Trump is leading a war against a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in government, business and media. Q, the anonymous leader of the movement, claims to be a top-level military official who is intimately familiar with the deviousness of this “deep state”. No matter how bizarre QAnon beliefs may sound, reportedly at least 24 US congressional candidates had pledged allegiance to Q and Trump even deemed these followers to be people “who love our country”. Such words of encouragement from the president allowed these fringe ideologies to gain mainstream appeal.Unlike QAnon, the Boogaloo Boys have an alternative take on an alternative reality. The origin of this movement is murky, further complicated by the fact that it has both white supremacist and libertarian factions. Named after a breakdancing movie from the 1980s, it’s a loosely organised Right-leaning movement with members that favour gun rights, oppose police brutality and fantasise about a second Civil War in America. This movement left online chat rooms and caused real world damage after police officers in California and guards at the Oakland courthouse were killed, compelling people to consider the group recognised by their Hawaiian floral shirts to be a legitimate terror threat.Despite ideological differences, both movements have commonalities. They prey on white male grievances and the dissatisfaction with the so-called elite. Moreover, both groups gained a following on 4Chan, an online image board which equips users with anonymity and freedom to operate without checks and balances. So, for QAnon, it meant an avenue to spread fake news on the lines that 9/11 was a hoax or that Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981 on the deep state’s orders. Similarly, the Boogaloo Boys were able to freely discuss their desire for more guns, civil unrest and undermining the US government’s authority. While online platforms such as 4Chan do not cause these movements, they have enabled and sustained them.These movements also rely on mobilising support against a common enemy, using fake news and unsubstantiated rumours to widen divides between “Us” and “Them”. QAnon manages spreading such misinformation through “Q drops” — the name given to the cryptic messages posted by Q. For example, last year, Q posted a picture of an unnamed island chain and soon after, QAnon followers took this post as proof that the picture was taken on Air Force One and went on to claim that Q must be travelling with Trump.To the outside world, “Q drops” may seem bizarre and illogical but, to QAnon adherents, these cryptic and misleading messages are like sermons. Q’s followers have acted on this by inciting offline violence. Instances such as an armed standoff at Hoover Dam, breaking into the Canadian prime minister’s residence and an infamous shoot-out at a pizza parlour are all products of followers believing or misinterpreting the fictional narrative put out in QAnon chat rooms.With the attack on Capitol Hill by Trump supporters, some of whom wore QAnon shirts and brandished confederate flags, the far-Right’s threat to American liberal democracy is more visible than ever. Trump’s ambivalence towards such groups have emboldened them and with these groups now being increasingly cornered as social media platforms banned Trump and his ecosystem, the threat of Right-wing extremism may assume a different form but will persist.Kabir Taneja is fellow and Prithvi Iyer is research assistant, Strategic Studies Programme, Observer Research Foundation The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/tracing-the-roots-of-an-american-brand-of-extremism-101610375125564.html
11-01-2021||Today's||It is time for some prose||On Monday, a Supreme Court bench, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, reprimanded the executive for failing to manage the farm protests, and suggested it would stay the implementation of the laws. During the proceedings, Justice Bobde emphasised that he was worried about the possibility of an incident leading to a breach of peace, the presence of the elderly and women at the site of the protests in times of the pandemic and in winter, and told the law officers representing the government that the executive got enough time but had been unable to resolve the strike. In an ideal setting, law-making is entirely within the purview of the legislature and managing the law and order consequences of legislations falls within the domain of the executive. Unless the constitutionality of the law is being determined — and the court did not get into the merits of the law at this stage — the judiciary should, once again, in an ideal setting, not concern itself with the protests against legislation. But the farm protests have presented an unusual, even extraordinary situation, where political negotiations haven’t delivered an outcome and the possibility of a breach in peace is indeed real. The court’s suggestion of a committee to examine the laws and listen to all stakeholders, in this backdrop, offers all sides a mechanism to step back from their stated positions — and renegotiate. This should not be seen either as a victory or a loss by any side. For the government, this provides much-needed breathing space and allows it to remedy the error of not engaging in adequate consultation before the passage of the law. It is also a lesson that when laws go through legislative scrutiny, even if there are disagreements about it, the legitimacy of the new framework is more widely accepted. The farm unions must recognise that the protests have helped establish their concerns on the national stage and a new mechanism is being created to address their concerns. They should call off the current form of protests, and engage constructively with the new committee. While it is said that you campaign in poetry and govern in prose, movements too happen in poetry, but negotiations happen in prose. It is time for both sides to negotiate now with an open spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/it-is-time-for-some-prose-101610373757544.html
11-01-2021||Today's||In Sydney, when a draw was a win||There’s that old joke about Test cricket. “How can two teams play a game over five days and still not have a winner?” A common rejoinder: “Because sometimes a draw is better than a win.” At the Sydney Cricket Ground on January 11, India made that pithy saying come alive in its full, combative, turbulent and beguiling glory. Everything was stacked against Ajinkya Rahane’s team at the beginning of this match — Australia’s facility with their home conditions; the absence of regular captain and the team’s most explosive batsman, Virat Kohli; and not one, not two, but three frontline bowlers absent with injuries and replaced by a debutant, and another who made his debut in the previous match of the tour. There was more agony through the match — a dislocated thumb for Ravindra Jadeja after being hit by a Mitchell Starc delivery and India’s most successful bowler in the first innings could not bowl at all in the second; Rishabh Pant, hit on the elbow by a Pat Cummins delivery, could not take the field for Australia’s second innings; Hanuma Vihari had pulled a hamstring and was barely able to run. So, when Australia set a bruised and battered India a target of 407, the hosts may have expected a thumping win. Instead they got a fiery, belligerent innings from Pant who shrugged off his injury; Cheteshwar Pujara’s absolute calm and class; and a nail-biting lesson in survival from Ravichander Ashwin and a limping Hanuma Vihari. Ashwin and Vihari faced 258 balls from one of the finest bowling attacks in recent memory. Jadeja sat padded up for hours, his hand strapped, needing help even to peel a banana, but ready to join the battle. There was grit and fight in spades. A match was saved. It was a draw that was better than many wins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-sydney-when-a-draw-was-a-win-101610368825135.html
