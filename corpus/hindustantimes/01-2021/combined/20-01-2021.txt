20-01-2021||News||Courage, calibre, character: India’s greatest series win||India’s 2-1 Test series triumph over Australia is straight out of Ripley’s Believe It or Not! It is the greatest series win ever in Indian cricket, and also among the finest comeback stories in the history of sport.The first Test match I saw was India versus Australia at the Brabourne Stadium in 1964. Tiger Pataudi’s team made 254 in the fourth innings to win by two wickets in an edge-of-the-seat finish. This got me hooked to cricket for life.In recent times, India beat England in Chennai in 2008, scoring a whopping 387 in the fourth innings. The biggest run chase, of course, was Bishan Bedi’s team overhauling 403 set by Clive Lloyd’s mighty West Indies in 1975-76. Only Don Bradman’s Invincibles had scored 400-plus runs in the fourth innings before that.These are some memorable run chases, and then there are the come-from-behind series wins that always hold a special place in cricket. Two top of my mind are versus Australia in 2000-2001, inspired by the fantastic VVS Laxman-Rahul Dravid partnership in Kolkata, and against Sri Lanka in 2015.But to understand the magnitude of India’s achievement on the recent tour, consider the trajectory of the series.Blown away for 36 in the second innings of the first Test, the team regroups swiftly to win the next, manages to save the third in a gritty, back-to-the-wall fightback, then turns the tables on the home team with a spectacular run chase in the fourth.The hardship quotient in doing this was extraordinarily high: Historically poor overseas record, playing the world’s no.1 team thirsting for revenge, pressures of living in a bio-secure bubble, playing only two first-class matches this season leading into the Tests, and several key players lost to injury.After the collapse in the first Test for 36 — the seventh lowest score in cricket annals — it was all gloom and doom. Majority opinion, including of former greats such as Allan Border and Ricky Ponting, suggested a clean sweep for Australia. Kinder voices said inclement weather might help India perhaps save one Test.But nobody gave India a hope in hell of saving the series, leave aside winning it. And understandably so, for how does any team recover from such a debacle? More so, with skipper and batting mainstay Virat Kohli not available, (paternity leave), and Mohammed Shami returning with a fractured hand?The situation got worse as the tour progressed. In the third, Jadeja suffered a fracture and Vihari a hamstring pull. By the time the fourth Test began, Bumrah and Ashwin — both enjoying huge success — were also injured. In the last Test, six of the playing XI — Pant, Siraj, Saini, Natrajan, Washington, Gill — were not in the team that played in the first!The starting point of India’s incredible revival in this tense, and at times acrimonious, see-saw contest is pivotal to any analysis and is located in the immediate aftermath of the second-innings collapse at Adelaide. The rest of the tour could have gone the way England, circa 1974, went. What prevented this I believe was sagacious intervention by the team management.In 1974, India was bowled out for 42 in the second Test at Lord’s. The team went on to lose the third too, giving England a 3-0 whitewash. Such a debacle can scar players for life. Some from that group never recovered; captain Ajit Wadekar lost his captaincy; and the ignominy of the performance got implanted on the psyche of every Indian fan forever.Weak body language and blame-games could have precipitated a bigger crisis after Adelaide. Players, especially those not doing well, and youngsters, are more vulnerable in such situations. Captain Ajinkya Rahane and coach Ravi Shastri handled the delicate situation astutely. The collapse was signed off as a freak event, but one from which lessons had to be learnt.The effort going ahead was to ensure that such lapses in concentration would not happen again — put personal and team pride in the forefront, and most importantly, not back off. Combativeness, aggression and confrontation have been built up over the past few years as part of team culture. Derided as ugly showmanship when the results have not been favourable, they paid wonderful dividends this time.In fact, in the final Test, the injury-hit team had two debutants, and three players in their first Test series, but not one of them played like a rookie. Some of these players — such as Mohammed Siraj, T Natarajan, Navdeep Saini — also make for fascinating stories of how cricket has transformed lives, especially in hinterland and mofussil areas.Their success highlights the depth and strength of talent in the country. It’s also easily overlooked that India’s domestic structure is robust, arguably the best in the world. The India A and under-25 tours have been invaluable for young talent. After Adelaide, India’s response was stupendous, and based on three Cs so vital in sport but often glossed over — courage, calibre and character. Taking responsibility and teamwork are usually puerile clichés in sport. In this series, their role was exemplary.The experienced pros and newcomers combined to prove a point to themselves, the opponents and the world. And created history.Ayaz Memon is a veteran sports journalist and writerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/courage-calibre-character-india-s-greatest-series-win-101611153442998.html
20-01-2021||News||Managing drug security effectively in times of a pandemic||One of the most critical pillars of Covid-19 management has been ensuring the availability and accessibility of essential medicines at affordable prices. The challenge of establishing a nationwide logistics management and supplies system during complete and partial lockdowns was Herculean, but was successfully overcome. The Centre’s strategy to ensure sufficient access, monitor stocks and distribution, issue approvals, maintain seamless supply chain of drugs, effectively communicate with stakeholders, and evolve a dynamic Clinical Management Protocol (CMP) has contributed significantly to India’s Covid-19 management success.The Centre ensured the supply of drugs with equitable and integrated access. It ensured a robust regulatory mechanism and expedited approvals and stocks. The supply chain was efficiently managed, with close monitoring of the distribution of medicines to states, Union Territories and central institutions. In the early days, there were no Covid-19 treatment guidelines. Experts drafted clinical management guidelines, which were updated when new scientific information was available. Efforts were made to reduce the severity, duration and impact of Covid-19 by identifying and approving early interventions.The first guidelines, issued on March 22, by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxes for asymptomatic health workers and the household contacts of confirmed cases. Subsequently, other frontline workers were also included. The first comprehensive CMP issued by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) on March 31 recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe disease. The Centre placed orders for procurement on the same day. The drug supplies commenced within a week of placing the orders and were supplied within six weeks. The drugs were first delivered to the central depot in Delhi and then sent to various states by the respective resident commissioners. Subsequent revisions in the CMP led to the inclusion of other drugs like dexamethasone, methylprednisolone and low-molecular-weight-heparin while doing away with azithromycin. Some new and re-purposed drugs and therapies such as convalescent plasma, remdesivir and tocilizumab were introduced as investigational therapies. The CMP evolved over time, with modifications based on scientific evidence for optimal management. This reflects in the national recovery rate of close to 97%, one of the highest in the world. This evolution of CMP has been one of the main weapons in the fight against the pandemic. DGHS additionally identified 54 ICU and 98 other essential drugs to manage complications and co-morbidities. The central and state governments, the pharma industry and the distribution network all strived to ensure total availability, both in the public health and in retail sectors.A monitoring system with real-time data was used to monitor drug production and supply in the domestic market, availability and distribution. Regular reviews, quick decisions and follow-up by the group of ministers, the Cabinet secretary and the empowered groups ensured that all procurements, supplies, logistics and distribution were on track and issues were resolved expeditiously. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has been conducting random weekly surveys at chemists and medicine outlets to confirm the availability of drugs for Covid-19 treatment. To facilitate the launch of new and repurposed drugs for treatment, DCGI has been processing Covid-19 related applications for new drugs, vaccines, biologicals and clinical trials on a fast-track mode, having disposed of 330 of the 352 applications to date. This proactive and coordinated strategy has helped India ensure drug security for all of its 1.35 billion citizens through the pandemic. India has gone much beyond fulfilling the domestic demands but, as the “pharmacy of the world”, has also catered to the global demand for drugs, earning the goodwill and admiration of the international community.

20-01-2021||News||Is ‘Global Britain’ inimical to India?||As the United Kingdom (UK) charts its global path in the post-Brexit era, signals about India emanating from there have been overshadowed by news about the havoc that the new strain of Covid-19 is causing. Yet, the signs are unmistakable. One day, a group of members of the UK Parliament lobbies the government on the farmers’ agitation in India; the next day, a discussion is held in the House of Commons on the situation of minorities in India; then there is a debate among parliamentarians on the “political situation in Kashmir”.In India, not many have connected the dots, dismissing them as trivial pursuits of distant politicians, primarily from the Opposition Labour Party, pandering to their constituents. Can there be more to this?Enter Chatham House. The century-old institution is formally known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs. An independent policy institute, it draws the name from its location — an 18th-century building, which was occupied in the past by several British prime ministers. One of its three current Presidents is a former Prime Minister — John Major. Chatham House reports are a vital resource for leaders and influence policymakers in the UK government, the private sector and civil society. A recent offering, Global Britain, Global Broker, authored by long-time director and chief executive, Robin Niblett, offers a plethora of recommendations about the UK’s future global role.Primarily, the report advises that the UK, instead of trying to reincarnate as a “miniature great power”, should style itself as a “broker of solutions to global challenges”. It lists six such global issues to focus on — “protecting liberal democracy; promoting international peace and security; tackling climate change; enabling greater global health resilience; championing global tax transparency and equitable economic growth; and defending cyberspace”. It suggests more investments in diplomacy, leveraging of soft power, financial strength and membership of the world’s multilateral organisations to make this transition by 2030. However, from an Indian perspective, of considerably more interest is what the report suggests the UK should do and not do as it strives towards change. India, which describes ties with the UK as a “strategic partnership”, is portrayed as a “rival” or “at best, an awkward counterpart” on par with Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. While the UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has invited India to the G7 Summit in June, the report weighs in against Johnson’s idea of enlarging the G7 into a “Democratic 10” or D10 comprising the G7 nations plus Australia, India and South Korea. Even as recently declassified documents reveal US keenness to support India’s rise, the Chatham House report argues that “including India in a D10 at this time could make building any meaningful consensus on policy or joint actions that much harder.” Going further, the report projects that the D10 can end up “functioning as a D9, at some point in the future,” alluding that India may suffer the same fate as Russia when G8 reverted to being G7.The report lists “two recent UK humiliations at the UN – its failure to win a seat on the International Court of Justice in the election of judges in 2017, and defeat in a vote over the fate of the Chagos Islands in May 2019 ” as warnings of a future where Britain could find itself squeezed to the margins of international negotiations or picked on by groups of states as a way of sending messages to others. Left unsaid is that India played a role in both cases.Rarely has a report from an “establishment” institution in the UK portrayed India in such inimical terms, viewing it primarily as a market. Of the six global goals that the report lists, the UK and India are projected as partners only in peace and security. That too is a surprise, given that the report places India among countries that “readily participate in or attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a grouping of states led by Beijing and Moscow designed to resist the penetration of Western interests” and lists factors that limit India’s capacity “to undertake a proactive foreign policy on the global issues that matter most to the UK”. The report also charts India’s approach to issues such as the climate crisis, global health and cybersecurity as not in congruence with “Global Britain’s” interests.Will what the Chatham House report portends be reflected in policy? Or is it a case of civil society and the UK government not being in tune with each other? What about the blind eye the British establishment turns to the activities of the Khalistanis and the interminable delay in the extradition of Vijay Mallya? Johnson’s inability to participate as the chief guest at our Republic Day also means we will be denied clarity on what accounts for the discordant signalling about India from so many sections of British society. However, we need not wait for long.Now that we are forewarned, we can look towards both the G7 Summit and the key climate meeting of Conference of the Parties 26 that the UK hosts in 2021. Besides, Johnson intends to visit India before that. These engagements will provide ample opportunities for India to assess how honest a broker “Global Britain” will be.Syed Akbaruddin is a retired diplomat who served as India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New YorkThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/is-global-britain-inimical-to-india-101611150625192.html
20-01-2021||News||Imran Khan gets squeezed between shrinking economy and proactive opposition||Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been facing sharp attacks from a combined opposition alliance for months, is facing trouble convincing China for concessional funding of the grand project to upgrade a little less than one-fifth of Pakistan’s railway tracks at a cost of $6.8 billion. The Main Line 1 project, the costliest projects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, had been reckoned by its proponents to boost Pakistan’s economy and reduce unemployment.But there are serious disagreements between China and Pakistan on its funding that have led the two countries to repeatedly put off the annual meeting of CPEC’s Joint Cooperation Committee, its key decision-making body. The committee is jointly chaired by Pakistan's minister for planning, development and special initiatives and the vice-chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission.According to a Nikkei Asia report, Pakistan wants to borrow at a concessional interest rate of less than 3% - some reports in Pakistani media say 1 % - but China has offered a mix of concessionary and commercial loans for the project. Pakistan’s Express Tribune in November said China also wanted additional guarantees before sanctioning the $6-billion loan due to the country's weakening financial position.Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said the two countries would eventually resolve their differences over the funding closer to China’s position. But they said the episode spotlights the growing pressures on PM Imran Khan on the economy front that would continue to weaken his grip on the country.A security assessment by the UN’s department of safety counts the economic slowdown as PM Khan’s biggest domestic challenge.“As economic hardships deepen, the PDM movement is likely to gain broad public support. If the economic situation is not properly controlled, Pakistan will face political instability with growing risks of government collapse,” the UN department’s report said, referring to the campaign against PM Khan launched by Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of opposition parties formed in September 2020.The state of the economy and an increase in unemployment have been key points in the narrative put out by the joint opposition that has announced the third round of protests across Pakistan.The seizure of a Pakistan Airlines aircraft owing to a dispute over non-payment of aircraft lease dues feeds into this narrative over the economy.“Today Malaysia has stopped our aircraft in lieu of loan repayment. Tomorrow if any airport detains the Prime Minister over non-payment of loans…what will happen?” Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party said in a recent video clip.That the authorities in Malaysia decided to seize the aircraft is a significant development and signals the state of play in bilateral relations between Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur, which was considered to be part of the Pakistan-Turkey-Malaysia axis before ex-PM Mahathir Mohamad’s exit.Pakistan’s relations with countries in the Middle East have also deteriorated as Imran Khan lay his bets on Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, rather than Pakistan’s traditional mentor, Saudi Arabia. PM Khan upset Riyadh by his attempt to form an alternative Muslim coalition with Turkey and Malaysia to an extent that the Saudis, in an unprecedented move, demanded that Pakistan cancelled its arrangement for deferred payments for oil purchases and asked Pakistan last year to repay the loan. Local media reports in Pakistan indicate that there is a possibility that the UAE too could seek the early repayment of a $3 billion financial support package announced in December 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/paks-imran-khan-gets-squeezed-by-shrinking-economy-and-proactive-opposition-101611143607130.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Comprehensive one-stop dashboard launched for nationwide air quality monitoring||With an aim to monitor pollution levels and provide readily available air quality data of different cities across the country, a Mumbai-based environment start-up on Wednesday launched a new dashboard to access continuous ambient air quality monitoring standards (CAAQMS). Mumbai firm Carbon Copy and Respirer Living Sciences released the new dashboard at a webinar organised by a Delhi-based climate communications initiative, Climate Trends. The new dashboard presents a comprehensive one-stop platform to access on CAAQMS and is a part of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s nationwide real-time monitoring network. “The dashboard is designed to not only list the data but also to allow users to draw comparisons between the air quality over seasons, calculate monthly and annual averages and even examine hyper local monitoring by zooming into specific cities and neighbourhoods to identify polluted pockets,” said Ronak Sutaria, CEO, Respirer Living Sciences. He further said, “The dashboard has allowed transparency on not just PM2.5 and PM 10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres and 10 micrometres) data, but also on data regarding harmful gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO).” While discussing the need for increased air quality monitoring and increased accountability of government agencies and state pollution control boards, SN Tripathi, head of department (civil engineering) at IIT-Kanpur, said, “Since the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) started in 2019, we are now on a five-year plan with a target to reduce 20%-30% PM2.5 and PM10 by 2024. The measures being taken now are aimed at increasing accountability.” Tripathi is also the nodal officer of the national knowledge network (NKN), which was set up as an advisory board to guide the state and central pollution control boards in implementing the NCAP. Environment experts pointed out that even during the stringent Covid-19 lockdown last year, studies have showed that of the eight major polluting sources, only four -- vehicles, industrial activity, brick kilns and construction activity -- had been shut. Meanwhile, power plants were still operational although at a reduced capacity. Household cooking, open burning and diesel generators all added to ensure that even in the best-case scenario, India’s background pollution levels ranged from 20-30 ug/m3. “Indians have 35% reduced lung capacity due to air pollution in comparison to Caucasians. Air pollution was the second highest risk factor in India, second only to child and maternal malnutrition,” said Dr DJ Christopher, head of pulmonary medicine at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/comprehensive-one-stop-dashboard-launched-for-nationwide-air-quality-monitoring-101611167299082.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Farmer dies by suicide at Tikri, leaves note behind||A 42-year-old farmer from Rohtak died by suicide at Delhi’s Tikri border on Wednesday. Police said the farmer allegedly consumed poison and was rushed to a hospital in Mangolpuri during the wee hours of Wednesday, but couldn’t be saved. He died at around 3:30 am.The farmer was identified as Jai Baghwan Rana who had been protesting at the Tikri border. “The police were informed that a farmer had consumed poison at the Tikri border at around 2:30am. He was immediately rushed to a hospital in an ambulance that had been deployed at the protest site. He was declared dead at around 3:30 am. The police have initiated a probe,” said a senior police official.According to protesters at the Tikri border, Rana had left behind a note urging the government and the farmers’ union leaders to resolve the ongoing stand-off. The purported suicide note stated, “My name is Jai Bhagwan Rana and I am a small farmer. The government says it is a matter of only two to three states, but farmers from all over the country are protesting against the laws. Sadly, it is not a movement now, but a fight of issues. The talks between the farmers and the Centre also remain deadlocked”“The government should call the farmers from all states and take their opinion in front of the media and decide for itself,” he added. Several farmers have allegedly died by suicide in the last few months at the borders of the national capital, where the ongoing agitation entered day 56 on Wednesday. Last month, a lawyer from Patiala had died by suicide near the Tikri border. A Sikh preacher had also ended his life at the Singhu border over the ongoing agitation in December. The farmer union leaders have been taking several measures to sensitize farmers and keep them motivated. Several posters and banners have also been put up at protest sites requesting agitating farmers to choose life. Earlier on Wednesday, another farmer Dhana Singh (60) also died due to a heart attack at the Tikri border. Singh was a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) (Ugrahan) and belonged to Patiala. Manjeet Singh, district president of Patiala, BKU (Ugrahan), said that the deceased was participating in the protest since November last year. “We have lost so many brothers while protesting on the highways in this bone-chilling weather, but it’s not bothering the government. The government should understand that these sacrifices will further strengthen our movement since now we have to also fight for those who are dying during the protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmer-dies-by-suicide-at-tikri-leaves-note-behind-101611167239549.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi cancer institute holds counselling session to bust myths about Covid-19 vaccine||The Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI) on Wednesday conducted a one-on-one counselling session for its health-care workers to dispel myths about the Covid-19 vaccine and to encourage them to take the shot.HT had on Wednesday reported that several hospitals in the national capital were planning to hold such sessions to do away with the myths and fear surrounding the vaccine and improve the overall coverage. The counselling session at the DSCI was attended by 250 health-care workers. The institute also opened a selfie point at its vaccination centre for the use of those who will get inoculated.During the session, many health-care professionals queried about the possible side effects, efficacy and security of the vaccine. Responding to queries, Dr BL Sherwal, director of the institute, said, “The vaccination drive has begun after completing all formalities and trials. As we health-care workers have been working since the start of the pandemic, we are privileged to get vaccinated before anyone else.”Encouraging them to take the vaccine shot, Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said, “It’s not the time to be afraid of the vaccine, rather it’s time to fight against our fear. Vaccination drive is an opportunity for us. We should take advantage of this drive to protect ourselves from different types of Covid-19 strain.”Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer at the institute, said, “To strengthen the morale of health-care workers, a selfie point was opened so that they can get themselves clicked after getting vaccinated and post the pictures on social networking sites. This will send a message to the common man.”Among those who attended the counselling session was Vipin Kumar, who works at the DSCI’s pharmacy. He said, “I had many doubts about the vaccine safety since there was no data available on it. We have been told that the vaccine being used here in Delhi hospitals is safe and its clinical trials have also been completed. I am satisfied and will take the shot on Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cancer-institute-holds-counselling-session-to-bust-myths-about-covid-19-vaccine-101611167240032.html
20-01-2021||Other||We will not shift the venue of the Republic Day tractor rally, farmers to police||New Delhi: Farmers protesting at Delhi borders on Wednesday reiterated that they will take out a “peaceful” tractor rally on the Outer Ring Road on Republic Day and urged the police not to force them to shift it anywhere else. The Delhi police had urged the farmers to either cancel the rally or shift it to the Kundali-Manesar-Palwal expressway on the periphery of the Capital. With this the second round of talks between the police and the farmers remained inconclusive on Wednesday.The leaders of several farmer unions have announced to conduct a tractor rally on the Outer Ring Road as a part of their ongoing protest against the three new farm laws. Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha in Punjab, said, “The police again asked the farmer unions to shift the proposed tractor march to Western Peripheral Expressway or Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway. But farmers have made it clear that the march will be conducted only on the Outer Ring Road.” “We have assured the police that the march will remain peaceful. We are not going to disrupt peace in the city. We are not marching to the India Gate or the Red Fort. Police should allow us to conduct our peaceful march,” he added.A senior police officer, who was part of the discussion, said, “The talks with farmers are still on. We are yet to reach any consensus.”Earlier on Tuesday, the farmers also shared the route map of their proposed tractor rally and said that the parade will touch all the borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be participating in the tractor rally, they said.Another farmer leader and president of Krantikari Kisan Union, Darshan Pal, said another round of talks with the police will be held on Thursday. “The police have apprehensions that the rally can be infiltrated by some anti-social elements. But we have assured that the protest will remain peaceful. We have been protesting for around two months and no incident of violence has been reported from Delhi borders. We have told police that the crowd might get provoked, if they are not allowed to carry out the march,” he said.Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court said it would be “highly irregular and improper” for it to either stop or allow the protesting farmer unions to hold a Republic Day tractor rally in the Capital, forcing the Central government to withdraw its plea to injunct the farmers. The protesters said when the apex court had not stopped them, the police should also not interfere. “Why is the police worried about the safety and security of the farmers only during the tractor march? They are not even bothered to see hundreds of farmers dying every day during the protest. Hundreds of farmers are travelling to Delhi to participate in this rally. Things might get out of control if police interferes,” said Amandeep Sindhu, a farmer protesting at the Singhu border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-will-not-shift-the-venue-of-the-republic-day-tractor-rally-farmers-to-police-101611167239106.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Five more persons held for Pitampura jewellery heist, another 2.5 kilo of gold recovered||Five more persons, one of them a 30-year-old woman, have been arrested in connection with last week’s dacoity at a jewellery showroom in north-west Delhi’s Pitampura. Nearly seven kilograms of gold jewellery worth over ₹3.5 crore were looted at gunpoint by a group of eight robbers, with the police terming the heist one of the biggest in Delhi in the recent past.More than one kilogram of stolen jewellery was recovered from the bank locker of the arrested woman -- she is the sister of one of the arrested men -- while another 1.5 kilos of gold was recovered from four persons who were arrested between Monday and Wednesday from West Bengal, Bihar and Delhi.Earlier, the police had recovered 3.5 kilos of gold jewellery from the suspects.The total number of arrests in the case is now 12 -- eight men who were involved in the dacoity and four receivers of the stolen jewellery. Nearly six kilos of the stolen jewellery has been recovered so far, the police said.“One or two suspects are still on the run and their arrests may lead to the recovery of the remaining jewellery. It was one of the biggest dacoity in the recent years in Delhi,” said joint commissioner of police (northern range) Surender Singh Yadav.According to Yadav, two of the arrested men, identified as Pitu Sheikh and Suraj, had committed a burglary at the same jewellery showroom in 2019. They were arrested and the stolen jewellery recovered from them at that time. In the latest dacoity, which happened around 4am on January 15, a group of eight robbers arrived outside the jewellery showroom in Pitampura, held the security guard, Chandan Vinay Shukla, hostage at gunpoint and broke into the showroom. They ransacked the shop and fled with nearly seven kilos of gold jewellery.“The entire heist took just three minutes. The guard informed the police about the dacoity only after the dacoits fled,” said special commissioner of police (law and order, west zone) Sanjay Singh, adding that a case was registered and four teams, including the special staff of north-west and Rohini districts, having around two dozen investigators, were tasked to crack the case and nab the suspects.As the guard had told the police that the dacoits had come in a Honda City car, investigators scanned through the footage of 30 CCTV cameras along a 5km route that the suspects had taken to reach Rithala Metro station, where the vehicle was found abandoned at a vacant plot.“We got the car’s registration number from one of the cameras installed near the showroom. We followed the route and recovered the vehicle -- it has been stolen from Rohini Sector 5 on the night of January 11,” said an investigator, requesting anonymity.During the probe, the officer said investigators learnt about the 2019 burglary at the showroom. They learnt that the three men arrested for that burglary lived in the same neighbourhood from where the Honda City was recovered. Further probe led to the identification of the suspects living in the neighbourhood. Police collected information about their whereabouts and nabbed them from Haryana, Delhi, West Bengal and Bihar.Brothers Pitu Sheikh and Mintu Sheikh were caught from Hazaribagh railway station; they were on a Howrah-bound train and were fleeing to their home town in West Bengal with the stolen jewellery. Another robber Reet Mohammad was caught from West Bengal. His interrogation led to the arrest of his brother Sameer Sheikh from Rithala. One Hakim was caught from Patna on Wednesday, the officer said.The other arrested persons were identified as Shankar, Suraj, Saleem alias Monu, Rahul, Sanu Rehman, Sheikh Ripal.“Suraj’s interrogation led to the arrest of his sister to whom he had given his share of the stolen jewellery. We interrogated her and she led us to her bank locker in which around 1,100 grams of gold jewellery was kept,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/five-more-persons-held-for-pitampura-jewellery-heist-another-2-5-kilo-of-gold-recovered-101611167180076.html

While the police said the showroom owner is yet to submit an estimation of the loss, local businessmen said put the figure at several crore. HT called on the landline phone of the showroom, Anjali Jewellers, but the person at the other end refused to speak on the matter. The showroom is located in Block H of Kalkaji and is guarded by armed men even when it is not in operation.According to RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (southeast), a phone call to the station house officer (SHO) was made by the showroom owner around 11am on Wednesday. “He informed that the showroom was burgled, but he hasn’t disclosed the total amount yet,” said Meena. The officer said that the burglars broke into the showroom through its roof.“CCTV footage has captured one of the suspects, but we don’t know yet how many thieves were involved in the crime,” said Meena. The officer said that the footage is likely to help the investigators crack the crime soon. Ravinder Singh, who runs an event management firm located at a walking distance from the showroom, said that he got to know of the theft around 11.30am when he was reaching his office. “The market was covered by police personnel. I got to know that jewellery worth several crores had been stolen from the showroom,” said Singh. Anjali Showroom has its corporate office in Kolkata and several shops on that city, other parts of West Bengal and one in the national capital, its website shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kalkaji-jewellery-showroom-burgled-by-thieves-who-break-in-through-roof-101611167179559.html

The SDMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) denied ordering any hike, saying the local area development fund for councillors has been ₹1 crore for the past several years. Senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said that on Tuesday, the SDMC increased the annual funds for each councillor from ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore. “Employees of the BJP-ruled MCDs are on strike because doctors, nurses, medical professionals teachers, sanitation workers and others have not got their salaries for several months. On one hand, the BJP-ruled MCD claims they do not have money to pay the salaries of their employees and on the other hand, yesterday (Tuesday) they increased funds for the councillors. Earlier, they had increased this fund from Rs.25 lakh to Rs.50 lakh and now it has become Rs1 crores,” he said. The SDMC said that the councillor fund has always been ₹1 crore and there was no change to it.“The AAP is misleading the people of Delhi. Standing committee chairperson, Rajdutt Gahlot, had on Tuesday merely scrapped the budget proposals put up by additional commissioner Ramesh Verma. Each councillor is anyway entitled to ₹1 crore every year. In fact, even that amount is not disbursed in full most of the time, owing to fund crunch,” said Anamika Mithilesh Singh, mayor of SDMC. In its budget for 2021-22, SDMC additional commissioner Ramesh Verma had proposed reducing the councillor’s area development fund from ₹1 crore to ₹50 lakh. But on Tuesday, Gahlot rejected the proposal. AAP’s Bhardwaj said the Arvind Kejriwal-led party believes that the reason behind this “hike” is just to loot the MCD.“We also believe that the BJP councillors are very scared and they feel that in the upcoming election, the BJP will lose, therefore, they want to loot the MCD before leaving. The BJP councillors also know that they will not get any ticket in the upcoming MCD election because of their corruption,” Bhardwaj said. The Delhi BJP said it is “shocking” how the AAP is “cooking up stories” to allege corruption in the MCDs. “The fact is there is no employees strike in SDMC. It seems that the AAP MLAs are pilfering the annual MLA-LAD funds which is why they are assuming that the councillors too might do the same,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-alleges-fund-hike-for-sdmc-councillors-bjp-says-no-change-in-amount-101611167179127.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Complete road redesign project by early 2023, Kejriwal tells PWD||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday issued directions to officials of the public works department (PWD) to stick to deadlines and ensure that the government’s ongoing project, of redesigning several major roads in the city, is completed by early 2023.Kejriwal issued the directions at a review meeting on the status of the project on Wednesday. The project covers 540km of road length on stretches that are more than 100 foot wide.The aim is to redesign the roads on the lines of those in European cities, the government had said in a statement.“The process of redesigning roads and streetscaping should be done in a swift manner to complete the project within the stipulated time frame. There should be no laxity. The deadline is early 2023. The agency entrusted with the task of construction will also be responsible for the maintenance of roads for a period of 15 years,” Kejriwal said in a statement.The statement further said, “Streetscaping is being done to remove bottlenecks for a smooth flow of traffic, encourage the use of non-motorised vehicles, construct disabled-friendly infrastructure, along with ensuring efficient use of space alongside roads.”In December, the government had appointed a consultant for the project. The consultant is supposed to submit a detailed project report in February, based on which tenders will be given and the operations will begin by June 2021, said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/complete-road-redesign-project-by-early-2023-kejriwal-tells-pwd-101611167119521.html
20-01-2021||Other||Delhi govt gets farmers’ consent to set up solar power plant on 225 acres across nine villages||New Delhi: The Delhi government has got consent from farmers across nine villages in the north-western peripheries of the city for setting up solar plants in 225 acres of agricultural land under a long-awaited scheme that aims to enhance the Capital’s power production and contribute to income of farmers.“We have got consent for 225 acres of agriculture land where solar plants can be set up. The lands are located at villages in areas such as Alipur, Lampur and Narela. The project has been given a go ahead and tenders will be issued soon. We aim to launch the project this year,” said a senior government official.In July 2018, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi had announced the Mukhyamantri Kisan Aay Badhotri Yojana – a scheme to increase income of farmers by setting up solar plants in their agriculture land, which would also enhance power production in the Capital.Under the scheme, farmers would be able to continue with agriculture even after the power plants are set up as the solar panels to be installed would be installed at a minimum height of 3.5 metres from the ground, allowing for farming activities, tractors to ply on the fields and other agriculture-related machinery to be used.The farmers would be paid ₹1 lakh per acre a year, and the rent would increase by 6% compounded annually. Once allowed, the plant would exist for 25 years. The farmers would also get 1,000 units of energy produced by the plant each year for every acre they rent out for the project, the official said.However, the scheme is yet to formally kick off.According to the government’s statistical handbook of Delhi, the total area under agriculture in the national capital is 34,750 hectares, which roughly translates to 85,870 acres. “But most of the land is scattered and that turned out to be a big problem for implementing the project,” said the official who did not wish to be identified.According to government estimates, a full six acres will be needed for setting a 1 MW [or, 1000 kW] solar plant, which would be capable of generating over 1.2 million units of electricity annually, under the scheme.On engaging with farmers for more than a year after the scheme was announced, the government also realised that there were concerns. “The most common one being whether the land would lose fertility, or if yield would reduce after the solar panels are installed. This, they assumed, would deprive the land of direct sunlight,” the government official said.In January 2020, the government set up a demo of the project at the campus of an agriculture institute in Kirari, located in the western peripheries of Delhi. Even though the government had got consent for 150 acres of land by then, the project faced delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-gets-farmers-consent-to-set-up-solar-power-plant-on-225-acres-across-nine-villages-101611167120079.html
20-01-2021||Other||With interlinked Metro and RRTS stations, INA Market all set to be major transit hub||New Delhi: The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) will integrate its INA station on the Delhi-Alwar Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor with the Delhi Metro station at the same spot to provide seamless connectivity between two mass transit systems.Last year, the NCRTC had changed location of its station on the RRTS corridor from Jangpura to INA to provide seamless connectivity with two of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) corridors -- Yellow line (Huda City Centre to Samayapur Badli) and Pink line (Majlis Park and Shiv Vihar).An NCRTC spokesperson said, “Station locations have been finalized in such a way that they are seamlessly integrated with other modes of public transport for commuters’ convenience. INA-RRTS station will be integrated with the Delhi Metro’s INA station through subways, thereby providing safe and seamless connectivity (between two rail corridors) to commuters.”With this, INA will become an important transit facility in South Delhi. The station will provide direct high-speed connectivity to residents of NCR suburbs such as Ghaziabad, Modinagar, Meerut, Gurugram, Manesar and Panipat to two major hospitals (AIIMS and Safdarjung), markets and new developments planned in the area such as the commercial complex proposed at Nauroji Nagar.While the Delhi Metro station is located on Aurobindo Marg, INA-RRTS station will be located near DDA’s headquarters on Barapullah road. NCRTC officials said the station will have two entry/exits near DDA headquarters, Vikas Sadan, and Aurobindo Marg.“RRTS stations have been planned and designed to ensure multi-modal integration with other modes of public transport in a way that it will eliminate the need for commuters to step out on roads for switching from one public transport to another. We are closely working with DMRC for an integration of the INA and other stations,” the spokesperson said. DMRC’s INA station on the Yellow Line was opened in 2010 and subsequently was converted into an interchange with the Pink line in 2018. The station caters to a number of important landmarks in the area such as the INA Market and Dilli Haat. At INA, the RRTS corridor, the NCRTC official said, will pass below the two existing DMRC corridors.Anuj Dayal, executive director corporate communication, DMRC said, “NCRTC is going to integrate its upcoming station at INA with the Delhi Metro network’s interchange station there through a subway. This will further boost the connectivity in the area and offer more travelling options to the passengers. The integration of the MRTS and RRTS networks in the NCR will be a major milestone in terms of enhancement of the ease of connectivity in the region.”The 198-km-long Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor is one of the three priority corridors—Delhi-Meerut and Delhi-Panipat being the other two-- approved by the Centre. The work on the Delhi-Alwar RRTS corridor will be carried out in three stages. In the first stage, 107-km-long corridor between Delhi -Gurugram- Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror (SNB) Urban Complex will be developed.Of the 107kms, 22kms will be in Delhi and it will be completely underground starting from Sarai Kale Khan to Aerocity. “The corridor has got the approval from the state governments and is under active consideration of the central government for approval,” said an NCRTC official.Apart from INA, NCRTC is actively working with DMRC to integrate stations at Sarai Kale Khan, Munirka and Aerocity in Delhi.NCRTC officials said, “Pre-construction activities including geo-technical investigations, initial pile load tests, topographical surveys, shifting of electrical utilities, etc. are being carried out at various locations in Gurugram for this corridor. With a view to save time in executing the Delhi-Gurugram-SNB RRTS corridor, we are focusing on completing most of the pre-construction activities for the corridor so that the civil construction of the corridor can start immediately post the project sanction.”Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “The move to integrate RRTS and Metro corridors will provide better connectivity and bring down the use of private vehicles. Efforts should be made to provide for pedestrian movement outside the stations and develop INA as a transit hub.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-interlinked-metro-and-rrts-stations-ina-market-all-set-to-be-major-transit-hub-101611167119087.html

The court was hearing a plea by 121 families who had contended that authorities carried out the demolition from July 6 to July 8, 2020 with absolute disregard to the plight of even around 400 residents who were home quarantined on account of Covid-19. They had alleged that they were treated in an inhumane manner and all their means of existence were destroyed.The east civic body had demolished 56 houses constructed on a service road of the Master Plan Road following a court order on clearing encroachments. On July 17, 2020 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had visited the spot and ordered that the people affected by the drive be immediately shifted to temporary shelters. He had also directed officials to begin an in-depth study of the high court order and whether a court order for demolition can be issued in the times of a pandemic.The residents were rehabilitated temporarily in a Delhi government school. However, according to their counsel, a notice was given in September, 2020 asking them to leave the shelter home in the school as it was in the process of being renovated to resume physical classes, whenever it would be scheduled. While most of them left in September itself, others have vacated the place recently.On Tuesday, senior advocate Salman Khurshid, for the petitioners, told the court that were till now being housed in schools but since the schools now are being reopened, they have been removed. He contended that the authority which claims to be the owner of the land should consider rehabilitating the petitioners and other displaced persons according to their policies.Advocate J Priyadarshini, also counsel for the petitioners, said that her clients are staying in difficult conditions at these alternative accommodations after they were asked to vacate the school.While the counsel for the EDMC said that the land was owned by the PWD, the latter’s counsel denied the claim.The court asked the authorities to file affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing on February 18.Earlier, on July 24, 2020, the high court had said that onus of providing accommodation to displaced families was on the Delhi government, as over the years, officials of the public works department (PWD) or the road owing agency had either not been vigilant or had ignored the extensive encroachments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/whose-road-it-is-asks-hc-after-demolition-drive-leaves-people-displaced-101611167059096.html

The amount disbursed to them is over and above a similar relief granted to 39,600 construction workers in the city, the government said in a statement.The statement further said that at least 2,000 more construction workers will receive 10,00 each in the coming weeks.“When the lockdown was imposed due to the pandemic, the Delhi government was one of the first states to carry out relief disbursement to all 39,600 workers who were registered with the board. In compliance with orders of the Delhi high court, the board decided to disburse the relief amount to those construction workers who were registered with the board as on September 30, 2018,” Sisodia said, before appealing to more construction workers to renew their membership.More than 53,000 construction workers are currently registered with the board but document verification of a large numbers of them is still underway, said a senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-disburses-covid-grant-of-10k-each-to-407-more-construction-workers-101611166999051.html
20-01-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad court awards death to 30-year-old man for rape and murder of two-year-old girl||A Ghaziabad fast-track court on Wednesday awarded death to a 30-year-old man for raping and murdering the two-and-half-year-old daughter of his colleague, on the night on October 19, 2020. The court had fast-tracked the case and held the man guilty on January 18, after a trial that had lasted 29 days. While pronouncing the quantum of punishment on Wednesday, Mahendra Srivastava, special judge (Pocso Act), termed the case “rarest of rare” and went on to award the maximum punishment to the convict. According to the prosecution, the crime took place on the night of October 19, 2020, when the convict , who is a colleague of the girl’s father, went to their house and took away the child from her mother on pretext of taking her to a nearby shop. When he did not return till late night, the family went in search of him and also approached the police. The mutilated body of the girl was found the next afternoon, near a drain in an industrial area. The man was nabbed thereafter. The police filed the charge sheet in the case on December 16, 2020, and charges were framed on December 24, 2020, under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and also under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 302, 201, 376(a), 376(ab). The prosecution said the autopsy report confirmed that child had suffered eight external injuries, including a broken hyoid bone ( U-shaped bone in the front of the neck) pointing to death due to asphyxia from strangling. The court also relied upon the “last seen” theory besides the forensic test reports, which confirmed that the DNA of the man was found on body of the girl. Apart from the death penalty, the man was also awarded life imprisonment for murder (IPC Section 302) and seven years’ imprisonment for destruction of evidence (IPC Section 201). “The man brutally raped the minor girl and murdered her, before hiding her body near a drain at the scene of crime. The prosecution produced 10 witnesses while no one, including the family of the convict, turned up in his defence. We produced witnesses, including the girl’s mother who confirmed that the man took away her daughter despite her trying to stop him. One witness also saw the man carrying the girl on his shoulders near the scene of crime,” said Utkarsh Vats, special public prosecutor (Pocso). The Ghaziabad police also procured CCTV footage from a mobile shop, which confirmed that Pandey between 8.50pm and 8.55pm was seen taking the girl with him. Girl’s father and the man were friends for about 10-12 years and they worked at the same factory. At times, the man would stay with the family and the girl used to call him “Chacha (uncle)”, the police said. “The court relied on several rulings and observed that the act also impacts society at large; besides there is little chance for the convict’s reformation. There was also a high level of brutality perpetrated on the child. Considering all these factors, the court awarded him death penalty,” Vats said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-court-awards-death-to-30-year-old-man-for-rape-and-murder-of-two-year-old-girl-101611166939524.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Front line workers, elderly may have to wait two extra weeks to get Covid jabs||The low turnout of health care workers in the ongoing Covid-19 vaccination drive in Delhi is likely to push the vaccine roll out schedule for front line workers and the elderly by at least two weeks, senior officials in the state government said on Wednesday.Since India launched one of the biggest immunisation campaigns to control the coronavirus disease on Saturday, Delhi has been able to vaccinate 12,853 health care workers so far. But this is just 48.72% against the Delhi government’s target to inoculate 26,378 health care workers in three days. Experts have said that if people remain hesitant in coming forward to taking more shots, the government should consider opening up to allow other priority groups – and maybe even the general public – to take doses.Senior government officials said if current trends continue, then front line workers will not get their turn until March. As a result, immunisation of the general public, starting with people above the age of 50 years, can get pushed back to as late as mid-April.“The issue is being closely monitored by the state health department and the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). As of now, on an average 4,284 people are getting vaccinated for Covid-19 each day in the city. If the turnout does not improve soon and more centres are not added, then it will take the entire month of February and the first week of March to complete just the first dose of vaccination for the 120,000 health care workers,” said a senior government official involved in the immunisation programme.As per the initial plan of the Delhi government, the first batch of 120,000 registered health care workers were to be vaccinated by February 13. There are 81 centres in the city, each of which has a target of vaccinating at least 100 people a day. The vaccination happens four days a week — Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.As of now, the Capital has received 274,500 doses of Covishield (being produced by the Serum Institute of India) vaccine and 20,000 doses of Covaxin (being manufactured by Bharat Biotech), which according to the government is sufficient to inoculate at least 120,000 health care workers. There are 240,000 health care workers registered in the city for taking the vaccine. A Covid-19 vaccination is considered complete if a beneficiary has taken two doses within a gap of 28 days.A government spokesperson said the decision to increase the number of session sites or vaccination centres requires the approval from the Union health ministry. “The session sites are directly regulated by the ministry. So, increasing the number of centres will depend on directions issued by the Centre. The Delhi government is working on extensive IEC campaigns to spread awareness among health care workers regarding the safety of the vaccines. Several districts have started workshops from today (Wednesday) on this,” the spokesperson said.Dr Yogesh Kushwaha, nodal officer for vaccination at Lal Bahadur Shastri (LBS) hospital in east Delhi said at present all the 81 centres, all of which are hospitals, are vaccinating health care workers that belong to their institutions only.“At least 700 health care workers from LBS are to be vaccinated, but in the past three days, less than 150 workers have been immunised. Because of the low turnout, it will now take as much as three weeks to give the first doses of Covid-19 vaccine to all our 700 health workers,” he said.A senior health official said the turnout is likely to improve in the coming days with the government now allowing vaccination on a “walk-in” basis to the registered beneficiaries. “We are hoping to see a turnaround in the next two weeks as now even those registered beneficiaries who are not in the scheduled list for the day can get the jabs if they just walk-in at the session site. Any vaccination campaign always sees a tepid response in the beginning. It will take time. Districts are also carrying out different awareness campaigns and word of mouth plays an important role. As more health care workers take the vaccine shots in the coming days, people will be less scared or apprehensive about the safety of the vaccines,” a health official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/front-line-workers-elderly-may-have-to-wait-two-extra-weeks-to-get-covid-jabs-101611166939047.html

The civic body on Tuesday moved a proposal to carry out development works up to ₹10 lakh in the colony or society where 100% waste segregation is done at source.The proposal was moved during the south corporation’s budget presentation on Tuesday, wherein it suggested that a fund of ₹5 crore be marked for this purpose. Municipal officials said as per Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, waste segregation should be done at the source both in commercial and residential areas. Wet waste or kitchen waste should be deposited in green bins and dry waste, such as plastic bottles, milk pouches, in blue bins. Hazardous waste —such as needles, sanitary napkins, among others — are to go in red bins.Rajdutt Gahlot, chairman SDMC standing committee, said that the aim of the proposal is to ensure maximum compliance of the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 so that no waste is dumped on landfill sites. “In the budget for 2021-22, we have proposed to incentivise RWAs that have 100% compliance of waste separation at source. We will not directly give the RWAs the amount directly, but we will carry out development works of ₹10 lakh in the locality or society on the recommendations of the local RWA, if they achieve the target of 100% segregation of waste. We have earmarked an amount of ₹5 crore for this purpose,” he said.Officials from the department of environment management services of SDMC said that the process of waste segregation in residential areas under SDMC’s jurisdiction has begun more than a year ago, but in June last year, the civic body made the process compulsory for RWAs to provide segregated waste to garbage collectors.“To ensure compliance, we have taken a number of measures which include educating public about the importance of waste segregation and also provided them manure in exchange of kitchen waste. Other than this, we had issued notices to RWAs regarding waste segregation and also imposed fines against repeat offenders. Now we have come up with the idea of incentivising RWAs to ensure 100% separation of waste in colonies,” the official said.The civic body had performed poorly in the Swachh Survekshan 2020, ranking 31 out of 47 cities. After this, the corporation had started taking strict steps for compliance and issued notices to RWAs in this connection. Till November end, SDMC had issued more than 1,400 notices to RWAs and had fined 122 residents for not segregating dry, wet and hazardous household waste at source.Sanjay Rana, president RWA Greater Kailash-2 welcomed the initiative and said that it would encourage them to ensure 100% waste segregation.“Incentivising the RWAs is a good concept. At present nearly 50% households in our locality are providing separated waste to garbage collectors. This move will further encourage RWAs to achieve the target and help us get development works — such as beautification of colony, park and road improvement — done,” Rana said.Atul Goyal, president United Residents Joint Action (URJA), said that the move is good but can succeed only if the civic body shows a holistic approach and improves its waste disposal system.“With such an initiative, more RWAs are likely to come forward and start segregation. But the main cause of concern is that it should not get mixed in the tippers by waste collectors as is often seen. So the SDMC will have to show a holistic approach, build trust among residents and ensure that such gaps are filled,” Goyal said.Swati Sambhyal, a Delhi based waste management expert, said, “It is a commendable move. With this, more RWAs will be encouraged to comply with waste management rules and also motivate those which are already doing waste segregation on their own.”She, however, said that municipalities should also ensure that waste segregation exercise is not seen as an optional practice instead they should make efforts to make it a compulsory exercise. She said that barring a few localities, the percentage of waste segregation in residential areas is very low. She said that this initiative will also bring a healthy competition among resident bodies to rank best in terms of waste segregation and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-corp-to-award-rs-10l-to-rwas-segregating-100-waste-at-source-101611166879127.html

On May 4 last year, the district had 149 active cases. The data also shows that the active cases in GB Nagar are on a receding trend since December last year. It was the first time since June 10 when the district on December 27 had active cases below the 500-mark. On Tuesday, the district had 144 active cases.On the other hand, the number of cured Covid-19 patients also reached 25,054 in the district on Tuesday, with a recovery rate of over 99%. Till Tuesday, the district has reported 25,289 total cases, as per the state data. District magistrate Suhas LY said that timely ‘tracking and testing’ of the infected patients finally brought positive results. “In the beginning, contact tracing was the biggest problem for us as the district is adjacent to the national capital. But, thanks to the efforts taken by the teams of our doctors and health workers, we put all the areas under strict surveillance and started massive testing, particularly in the critical areas. As a result, the recovery and case fatality rates of the district started receding from July. Now, while our recovery rate is over 99%, the fatality rate is less than 0.36%,” he said. Chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that one positive case was reported every seven hours and every 2.5 hours in April and May last year, respectively. “The frequency picked up from June and by October it went worse, when it took only 7.7 minutes for one new case. Till December, it took little less than 20 minutes for detection of one new case in the district. But this year has given us a big relief as the average time for one new positive case has so far been recorded nearly 79 minutes in January so far,” he said. The CMO, however, said that the health officials have been asked to keep strict surveillance in critical areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/after-260-days-active-covid-19-cases-come-below-150-mark-in-gb-nagar-101611166339053.html

The Noida police have registered a kidnapping case.The incident came to fore at 2.30am when the girl’s older sister found her missing, the police said.According to the police, the 16-year-old sister said that she had woken up in the middle of the night and found the her (the missing girl) bed empty. She looked around the hostel and in the washroom and when she could not find the girl, she raised an alarm after which a call was made to the police helpline.Based on the sister’s complaint, a case of kidnapping (section 363 of Indian Penal Code) was registered at the sector 49 police station.Police officials said that a search for the girl is on. “We have checked the CCTV footage which shows the girl leaving the premises alone around 11pm through a portion of the gate which was under renovation. Her family has been contacted and teams have been formed to look for her,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.The girl studies with her sister and four other cousins at the boarding school. Her mother works as a domestic help in Delhi while her father passed away a few years back, the police said.Officials of the school are trying to reach out to her relatives to find her.“We have spoken to her sisters and friends but no one has any information about her whereabouts. We are trying to contact all her relatives as well to locate her. No one has any idea as to why she might have left,” said Seema Chaudhary, manager for the school.The school had come to limelight in July last year when a 14-year-old girl was found hanging in her room. The school had hushed up the alleged suicide without informing local police, but the Haryana-based family had alleged that there was foul play involved in the matter. Based on their allegations, an FIR was registered at the sector 49 police station against the school management but Noida police had concluded it to be a case of suicide. The note written by the girl was verified by forensics and it was found to be her hand writing. The claims were found to be false and the case was later closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/teen-goes-missing-from-noida-boarding-school-101611166219480.html

20-01-2021||Noida||Noida authority offers residents chance to pay for additional area in instalments||In a move that will benefit residents, the Noida authority has allowed them the option of paying for any additional area they get during the allotment of plotted residential areas in instalments. Earlier, plot owners were supposed to pay cost of additional area in 30 days’ time.This facility was already available for the industrial plot owners. Now this change will benefit those, who want to buy a new plot or already has purchased a plot and likely to take possession at the site. The move will particularly benefit those who will be buying plots under an ongoing scheme that offers around 400 residential plots in different sectors. Apart from this, there are thousands of residential plots whose possession the authority is yet to offer.“After allotment, when the authority gives possession to an allottee then there are cases that the plot size is beyond the allotted area,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media.For example, if a perosn was alloted 100 square metre residential plot owner, but got 110 square metre area instead during possession, then they needs to pay 30% of the plot cost immediately and the remaining 70% in instalments.If the additional area is 30% more (130 sqr mtrs) then allottee can pay 50% immediately and remaining 50% cost of this 30 square metres as per the prevailing circle rate in four years’ time.“The board has taken this decision because the allottees had been demanding this for a long time. The authority had in 200th board approved a proposal in this regard to benefit the plot allottees,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.The authority in its 2001th board meeting approved the proposal paving way for the implementation of this new rule, said officials.“The move will benefit many residential plot allottees. Now with this new rule the residential plot allottees, who get bigger area against the allotted plot can pay for additional area in parts,” said Rajiv Gupta, a real estate consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-offers-residents-chance-to-pay-for-additional-area-in-instalments-101611165798932.html

Its quality is, however, likely to deteriorate again due to fluctuations in the weather for the Delhi-NCR cities over next four days, a pollution monitoring agency said. Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad were the worst polluted cities due to almost stagnant winds and poor ventilation conditions on Tuesday, however the wind picked up on Wednesday. The three cities had earlier been that bad on January 1,2 15 and 17. According to the CPCB, Noida’s AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Wednesday was 310 against 432 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 321 against 434 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 336 against 436 a day earlier. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. According to the weather department, the wind directions have already changed to north-westerly and now caught pace, that will remain for another day, leading to better ventilation conditions. “The wind seed have picked up and reached around 18 kmph on Wednesday for most of the day. This lead to better ventilation and dispersion of the particles. The winds are likely to continue for another day, so the ventilation is likely to continue and air quality may further improve,” said Kuldeep Srivstava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Wednesday, the major pollutant or PM2.5 in the region improved to three times of the safety standards against seven times the standards on Tuesday. The average PM2.5 for Noida on Wednesday was 146 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) against 334.71 µg/m3 on Tuesday.

Police, however, verified the video and said it was not related to the incident of a three-year-old boy who was reported missing on January 18.The boy, Mohammad Saad, had gone missing from his relative’s house in Nahal area of Masuri in Ghaziabad and, till press time, was yet to be found. His family said he had gone missing in the afternoon.“The video footages which went viral were of locals and they had nothing to do with the incident. On our part, our teams are searching for the boy in neighbourhood areas. We are yet to search a pond near the house from where the boy went missing. The pond is quite big but is shallow and filled with muck,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural). “We will rope in some trained people to search the pond.”The missing boy, identified as Mohammad Saad, is second of three siblings and his father had an automobile repair shop in Masuri. “We had shared the video thinking he was abducted by some gang.

20-01-2021||Noida||Turban tying camp to laundry services, farmers gear up for ‘tractor parade’ on Republic Day||Arshdeep Singh, 19, was on his way home on January 13in Uttarakhand from Punjab’s Patiala when he happened to stop by UP Gate and decided to check out the farmers’ protest. When he heard of the tractor rally scheduled for January 26, he decided to offer his service as a professional turban coach. The turban holds a sacred position among Sikhs but tying it is a difficult art to master. Singh thought it would be a good idea to add turbans to the mix: 2,000 farmers wearing turbans in the colours of the national flag marching up to Delhi would be a sight.“I am now helping farmers learn the art that I learnt from a training institute in Patiala. Those who find it difficult also come to my camp where we help them tie turbans properly. I have also arranged for about 2000 turbans which the farmers will be wearing on the day they take our tractor parade,” Singh, said, while adding that 30 farmers have already joined him for the free class. The turbans will come in three colours --- saffron, white and green. “The turbans will be coming from different gurudwaras and they were enthusiastic about helping me when I proposed my idea for the tractor parade. So, all of us are eagerly waiting for the tractor parade and I want to play a small role in form of tying turbans in the tricolour.” It’s been 53 days since the farmers began their protest against the central government’s laws on agriculture.They had been battling odds -- extreme cold, rain and Covid-19 -- even as the gathering swelled from a few hundreds to now over 10,000.Protesters at the site use everything from streetlights for their power to roadside tents to spend the night.Two free laundry sites too have come up. “There are many who find little time to wash their clothes. So, we have set up six washing machines to be used for free. We wash around 100-125 lots of clothes a day,” said Ranjeet Singh who set up one such site with others from Pilibhit. “We also offer to iron the clothes,” said Surendra Singh from Shahjahanpur who helped set up the other laundry site. “We will wear clean and ironed kurta pajamas along with a coloured turban on our ride to Delhi. Even the tractors will be washed and decked up. Thousands of tractors are expected to arrive from UP, Uttarakhand and other areas and all of these will be lined up on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway,” said Rajbir Singh, state vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union. Each tractor will also sport the national flag and the rally will be carried out on the outer ring road in Delhi. “Many farmers in villages have not seen Delhi and they are eager to come here on Republic Day. The tractor parade will be peaceful and orderly. We have already done a rehearsal on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on January 7,” said Rajbir Singh Jadaun, state president of the BKU. The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to pass any order on the plea seeking injunction against the tractor rally proposed by agitating farmers on Republic Day. It said that it was a matter for the police to decide. On Wednesday, the next round of talks between the farmers and the government representatives ended without decision once again as the government proposed for amendments while the farmers’ union leaders sticking to their demand for rollback of three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. “We will continue to hold talks with the government till the time our demands are met. It is like we are having ‘bina mukadme ke tareekh pe tareekh” (date after date when there is no case),” Jadaun, added.POLICE QUOTE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/turban-tying-camp-to-laundry-services-farmers-gear-up-for-tractor-parade-on-republic-day-101611165620711.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccination in Mumbai: BMC to allow walk-in entry of healthcare workers||In order to increase its turnout for Covid-19 inoculation, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now allowed walk-in vaccination for health workers registered in its list of 130,000 beneficiaries. This means, if any health worker does not have a slot allotted by the BMC on a particular day, but he reaches the centre for vaccination, the civic body will inoculate him or her based on the fact that he or she is registered in the beneficiary list prepared by the civic body for the first phase.This, BMC officials said, will increase the turnout from the nearly 50% since two days, and will also expedite the process of vaccinating health workers. On Wednesday, the third day of BMC’s drive, 1,728 health workers were vaccinated — 52% of the expected 3,300. A total of 5,251 health workers have been vaccinated so far in Mumbai. Further, on Wednesday, seven cases of minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), involving giddiness ,were reported. All seven were kept under observation for 30 minutes and later discharged.According to the BMC’s data, of the 10 vaccination centres, three vaccinated more than 200 citizens each — KEM Hospital (362), Bhabha Hospital, Bandra (306) and Rajawadi Hospital (262).On Saturday, the first day of the drive in Mumbai, 1,926 health workers were vaccinated.A total of 200 staffers, including 80 vaccinators, were working on Saturday. After this, vaccination was suspended for two days on Sunday and Monday owing to “technical glitches” in the Cowin application.However, starting Tuesday, the BMC restarted its drive. On Tuesday, 1,597 health workers were vaccinated, of the 3,200 shortlisted to turn up after the drive was put on. Three of the 1,597 vaccinated had reported giddiness (AEFI) following their shots, and were kept under observation for 30 minutes. None of these beneficiaries had to be hospitalised, said BMC.According to BMC officials, from Wednesday, they have now started vaccinating health care workers on a walk-in basis. Dr Pratima Patil, chief medical officer at the civic-run Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, said, “We are vaccinating health workers on a walk-in basis. The criterion is that they should be among those who are identified as health workers by the BMC for vaccination in the first phase.”Dr Pradeep Jadhav, medical superintendent, Bandra Bhabha Hospital, said, “We are giving appointments to the identified health workers, but if any health workers whose name reflects in our beneficiary database visits any centre without an appointment, we are vaccinating them. This simply means we are vaccinating even those health workers who are not on the scheduled list, but are present in our database.”There are nine vaccination centres in Mumbai where Covishield vaccine is administered. This includes include four major hospitals — KEM Hospital, BYL Nair Hospital, Cooper Hospital and Sion Hospital followed by four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha Hospital in Bandra, VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivali; and the Covid-19 facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex. Additionally, one more vaccination centre at J J Hospital was added last week where Covaxin is administered.On how the data of those who visit for vaccination without appointment is handled, Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent, Rajawadi Hospital, said, “We upload all the data of vaccine beneficiaries in the Cowin application of the Central government post vaccination. Also, we have not stopped giving appointments for vaccination. We are also sending messages using the Cowin application.”According to BMC officials, the Cowin application used for vaccination was working slowly on Wednesday but was delivering messages on Wednesday, unlike Friday when not all were getting messages. The turnout on Wednesday, which was the third day of vaccination was also better than the first two days due to this, said BMC officials.Meanwhile, the BMC is aiming to vaccinate around 4,000 health workers on four days of a week. This includes Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The BMC has maintained it has the capacity to store vaccines for a population of around 10 million people, and can expand its vaccination capacity to 50,000 daily, and this can go up to 100,000 when private hospitals are involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccination-in-mumbai-bmc-to-allow-walk-in-entry-of-healthcare-workers-101611165619853.html

Located in Ballabgarh, the heritage structure will be the first in Faridabad district to get protection from the state. Other monuments in the region are under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the tourism department of Haryana. The go-ahead for the move was given by the chief minister last week. Dating back to the 19th century, the heritage structure includes a cenotaph (chattri) and a masonry tank. As per the District Gazetteer, the complex was built by the widow of Anirudh Singh, who was the king of Ballabgarh till 1818, in the memory of her deceased husband. “We received permission from the chief minister last week and will be issuing a preliminary notification for the monument by the next week. After the notification is issued, we will wait for two months to see if any objections are raised. Accordingly, we shall issue the final notification,” said Banani Bhattacharyya deputy director, department of archaeology and museums. “This will be the first monument in Faridabad that will be taken up by us for protection. The chattri is in a good form and we will be able to preserve it,” she said. Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) — an organisation dedicated to preserving monuments— has also been involved in efforts aimed at conservation of the structure. Anand Mehta, convener INTACH, Faridabad, said that the organisation signed an agreement with the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad for restoration work in August 2019. “We worked on the site for six months after which it came to a halt. After the pandemic, we started work again in November last year,” said Mehta. Bhattacharyya said that the department would be responsible for the protection and the municipal corporation will have to take permission from the department for carrying out works, if necessary. “Any heritage property can be taken under protection by the department. Our plans will be not affected,” said Bhattacharyya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/heritage-structure-in-faridabad-to-come-under-state-protection-101611164358809.html

A passerby had informed the police regarding a body on a service road near a polytechnic college around 10pm. Singh’s phone was found near the body, while other possessions were found inside the car. “Nothing was missing. So, obviously, it was not a random robbery incident. It was planned murder,” Amit Singh said. Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said that a case has been registered against unidentified persons. “The police are trying to identify and track the accused,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/autopsy-points-to-murder-in-manesar-incident-case-filed-101611164299713.html
20-01-2021||Gurugram||Four key intersections to be made safer||As a part of the ongoing Road Safety Month initiatives, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has decided to redesign four key intersections — Sector 44 intersection, Bristol Chowk, Kanhai Chowk and Ambedkar Chowk — within a month, officials said. While the GMDA will be executing basic infrastructure changes, such as marking pedestrian crossings, installing signage and widening the medians, at Bristol Chowk, Kanhai Chowk, and Ambedkar Chowk, the Sector 44 intersection is set for a complete overhaul. Officials said that these intersections are among the most used, due to traffic from key roads converging at these points. At Bristol Chowk, traffic coming from the Golf Course Road, Gurgaon-Faridabad Road and MG Road converge, while at Kanhai Chowk, traffic coming from Huda City Centre, Golf Course Extension Road and St Thomas Marg converge. Ambedkar Chowk is the first crossing after Hero Honda Chowk for commuters travelling towards Dwarka Expressway, and the Sector 44 intersection is located near Huda City Centre, opposite the GMDA’s office, at the heart of the city. Besides executing the basic infrastructure changes at the Sector 44 intersection, the GMDA plans to compact the intersection and align the stretches with the cycle tracks running parallel to the Netaji Subhash Marg, said officials.“The width of the carriageways varies at each end, hence, the intersection is not aligned. In certain directions, especially for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists, travelling between Kanhai Chowk and Huda City Centre, it takes commuters longer to cross the intersection. Further, the medians on all three sides end abruptly, leaving the central portion of the intersection exposed and vulnerable. Our aim is to extend the medians at all three sides in such a manner that the gap in the middle is reduced and there is an easy, swift and safe passage from all directions,” said a senior GMDA official privy to the matter.The official said that a traffic island would also be incorporated into the design changes. Currently, cyclists and pedestrians cross the intersections located along the 10-kilometre-long cycle track, between Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre, by travelling on the main carriageway, without any safe or dedicated crossings. “Road infrastructure redesigning is a fairly complicated process. We have to account for the flow of traffic along with keeping the safety parameters in place. Our top priority is to account for the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, and subsequently, design road infrastructure for public transport followed by motorists. We will start the redesigning process with the Sector 44 intersection,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA. Kundu said that after the redesign of the junctions, GMDA officials will spend the next few months creating awareness among daily users.“Redesigning is only one aspect of the change. We also want to inculcate the habit of daily users to adhere to the new changes, pedestrian crossings, cycle lanes and road designs. Our role will not come to an end with the Road Safety Month, but will continue for the following months as well in regards with conducting awareness programs,” said Kundu.Sarika Panda Bhatt, road-safety expert, Nagarro, said, “In any urban city, the maximum number of fatal crashes occurs at intersections or junctions. Hence, it is vital to redesign intersections and junctions in such a manner that all road users have the highest possible degree of safety. In this regard, introducing traffic signals, compacting intersections or junctions with proper signage and road markings, and constructing traffic islands is the best approach for safeguarding pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-key-intersections-to-be-made-safer-101611164300263.html
20-01-2021||Gurugram||Farmers’ Tiranga Rally halts traffic on Gurugram roads||Traffic congestion was reported from across the city on Wednesday afternoon as more than 200 farmers took out a Tiranga Rally from Bajghera to Sadar via Palam Vihar and Sector 18, the police said.Hundreds of farmers and political leaders participated in the rally, which was organised on city roads and the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway from noon to 2pm. Traffic movement was affected at Atul Kataria Chowk, MDI Chowk, Sirhaul, Sadar Bazar, Palam Vihar and Sector 5 and normalised by 3pm.Commuters said there was heavy congestion on the stretch between Bijwasan and Sadar Bazar as well as at Pataudi Chowk and the stretch between Rajiv Chowk and the railway station. Suneel Yadav, a resident of Sector 5, said he was stuck in traffic for over 30 minutes near the MDI Chowk. “There was no announcement about the traffic situation and the police did not even divert the routes to ensure smooth traffic,” he said. Another commuter, Devesh Kumar, a resident of Sector 10, said that he was stuck near Sadar Bazar for over 30 minutes due to the rally. “The police personnel were trying to decongest the stretch but the volume of traffic was high and it took time.” Astha Modi, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said, “The rally was taken out on city routes on Wednesday afternoon and the protesters wanted to go to the National Highway-48. They tried to go towards Kherki Daula and Sirhaul borders, but we did not let them reach the expressway. Only the old city area was affected,” she said. According to the farmers, the rally was held as a show of strength over their opposition to the recently passed farm bills.Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said, “As the police are not allowing us to reach Delhi, we are showing our presence and strength wherever we can. We took out rally in old Gurugram where local leaders and farmers supported us.” Meanwhile, farmers on more than 90 tractors were sent back towards the Rewari border as they tried to bypass border checkpoints by going through agricultural fields. The police said they have deployed personnel on internal roads and fields connecting to other districts ahead of Republic Day, to keep a check on their movements. According to the police, the protesters had conducted a reconnaissance of the neighbouring villages last week to map out their route towards Delhi through fields. Farmers with tractors from at least 25 villages are protesting at the Haryana-Rajasthan border and preparing to hold a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26. Kamlesh Devi, a resident of Rewari, who has been protesting at the interstate border since December 16, said that they will reach Delhi on January 23 by their cars and have arranged tractors in Delhi for the rally. “The police are not allowing us to cross the borders on tractors so we are taking alternative measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/farmers-tiranga-rally-halts-traffic-on-gurugram-roads-101611164299210.html
20-01-2021||Gurugram||Two cops suspended for poor performance; five more served notices||The Gurugram Police on Tuesday took action against two station house officers (SHOs) and a head constable, and served show-cause notices to more than five personnel for alleged negligence towards work. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the action was taken during a quarterly review meeting with top police officials. “Neeraj Kumar, SHO of Bilaspur police station, was suspended for harbouring a casual approach towards work and negligence. He was often found missing from duty. Ajay Malik, SHO, DLF Phase-1, was transferred to police lines for poor performance and being unable to handle challenging situations,” he said. Rao has also marked departmental inquiry against them. He also suspended Manoj Kumar, head constable of Cyber Crime police station, for being allegedly extorting money from a job fraud suspect.Show-cause notices were also served to five more personnel from different police stations. Manoj Kumar had allegedly extorted money, mobile phones, laptops and a gold chain from a suspect in October last year, who later complained to police. Following this, action was taken against him, said the police. “People look up to the police for their safety and security and trust them to take action as per the complaint. Some personnel do not perform their duties well, delay in taking action against the suspect and frame the innocent,” he said. Last year too, a crime-unit in-charge was suspended for negligence. In August last year, Badshahpur police station SHO was suspended as he failed to manage the situation, following the brutal assault of a 25-year-old truck driver by a group of men. In Tuesday’s meeting, the commissioner asked the crime unit heads to keep a close watch on criminals out on parole and bails and take preventive action if required. All the police stations and cyber crime police station officials were directed to undergo a cyber safety expert training so that they can investigate and control such crimes. He directed officers to check social media platforms to get more updates related to the city and be active on the WhatsApp groups created by the residents. Rao asked all the SHOs to prepare an action plan to reduce vehicle thefts, chain-snatching, smuggling of drugs and illicit liquor trade and focus on solving cases of crime against women and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-cops-suspended-for-poor-performance-five-more-served-notices-101611164239706.html
20-01-2021||Gurugram||Private hospitals to carry out vaccination drive daily till Jan 25||To expedite the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the district, the health department has decided to carry out vaccination every day till January 25 across 17 private hospitals in the city having a higher proportion of workforce as compared to the government facilities, where vaccination will take place for four days in a week.The authorities had initially decided to vaccinate beneficiaries only thrice a week. The recent decision has been taken to expand the coverage of the Covid-19 vaccination. Along with increasing the number of days for vaccination drives, health workers registered on Co-WIN platform can also walk in on any day to get the Covid jab, confirmed the health officials.In Gurugram, as many as 3,489 healthcare workers have been inoculated so far since the vaccine was launched on January 16. In the last two drives, the target was to cover 5,436 workers, out of which nearly 64% took the vaccine jab. Many of the beneficiaries did not turn up due to apprehensions or dropped out to analyse the initial reaction of others before taking the jab themselves. Even some primary front-line workers did not receive timely confirmation regarding the date and location for vaccination due to technical glitches in the Co-WIN platform, thereby missing their turn.Officials said that the recent to expand the vaccination drive can lead to an increase in the footfall and help cover almost 37,000 registered healthcare workers for the first round of vaccination drive — which includes over 32,000 private healthcare staff members.“In the government facilities, vaccination drive will be conducted on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. In private hospitals, on the other hand, vaccination will be carried out regularly till January 25 as they have higher number of workers. Further decision will be taken once their entire workforce is covered,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Starting Thursday, vaccination will be held at 45 session sites, with 31 booths, across 17 hospitals and 14 government facilities. In all the sites, walk-ins for registered vaccine beneficiaries have also been granted after the modifications were made by the central government on the Co-WIN platform. Earlier, health workers were alloted specific slots for inoculation. Since many workers failed to turn up, their slots were wasted. The Co-WIN platform allows only those who are registered for a particular day to be inoculated. It lacked the function to add additional beneficiaries. “With new modifications, any registered health workers can take the jab in their hospital without waiting for their time slot. Private hospitals will have to verify from their list of workers already registered on Co-WIN before giving the jab. If Co-WIN is operational, the data can be fed into the system directly or the entry can be done later within 24 hours,” said Yadav. Confirming the development, Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Hospital, said, “The hospital has the target to vaccinate 200 of its registered health workers every day. The walk-in is currently restricted for our hospital staff members, who are on the list of registered vaccine beneficiaries.” Notably, health care set-ups like nursing homes or diagnostic centres falling within the vicinity of the big private hospitals are also included in the list of these private hospitals mapped as vaccination sites. “Five big hospitals having maximum beneficiaries have not been clubbed with other small health facilities. Workforce from small set-ups like labs or nursing homes are clubbed with other hospitals, who are scheduled for Friday as new vaccination sites will be mapped out,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/private-hospitals-to-carry-out-vaccination-drive-daily-till-jan-25-101611164238790.html
20-01-2021||Gurugram||Haryana receives additional doses of Covid vaccine||The Haryana health department has received 214,000 additional doses of Covishield — one of the two Covid-19 vaccines — for the second dosage to be administered 28 days after the first inoculation, which is currently underway. Out of the total stock, the allocation for Gurugram is still awaited, according to officials, who stated that the district will get doses sufficient to cover its nearly 40,000 registered vaccine beneficiaries. With the arrival of the vaccine at state vaccine storage in Kurukshetra on Tuesday, the district health department has also geared up to cover private healthcare workers in the next five days. As per norms, the two Covid-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — are administered in two doses with an interval of 28 days in between. “The state has received nearly 214,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine. The stock is sufficient enough to easily conduct the vaccination drive in districts like Gurugram having maximum front-line health care workforce,” said Dr Virender Ahlawat, state immunisation officer.According to Ahlawat, even if the dropping rate is 10% and vaccine wastage is almost 1.1%, the district will get more than 40,000 doses. “The confirmation on the district-wise allocation of the vaccine is still awaited from the ministry of health and family welfare,” he said. Earlier this week, the state got 240,000 doses of Serum Institute’s Covishield, out of which 44,950 doses were allocated for Gurugram. It also received 4,200 doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. According to the government data, at least 1,820 were for central healthcare workers and as many as 43,070 were for workers under Haryana government. At least 60 doses were meant for those under Armed Force Medical Services. As per the state directive, almost 50-60% of the doses have to be reserved in every district. At that time, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary said, the target is that by the time the first round is over, vaccine beneficiaries who got the inoculation in the first week can get the second dose on time until the next batch of vaccine arrives. Considering this, the district health department decided to expand the vaccination drive and cover almost 25,000 health care workers before the allocation of the second dose. Dr Virender Yadav, CMO, said, “With the availability of second dose, we can easily utilise the existing stock to vaccinate almost 37,000 healthcare workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-receives-additional-doses-of-covid-vaccine-101611164239225.html

Identified as Darshan Singh of Dera Bassi, Manish Kumar of Patiala, and Suraj and Bhagat Singh, alias Honey, of Kurali, they work for Sampat Nehra and Deepak Tinu, who are Bishnoi’s close aides, said senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh.The gang has been involved in dacoities, murders and extortion in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Chandigarh. Bishnoi has been running the operations from behind the bars. The accused were arrested in Kurali following of tip-off. Police recovered two 7.65mm pistols, a 12 bore single barrel gun, a .315 bore pistol and 17 live cartridges from them. Police said the accused were involved in a recent firing incident at Malerkotla and had come to Mohali to revive the gang. A case under Sections 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity) and 402 (assembling for purpose of committing dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Arms Act has been registered. The SSP said Darshan and Manish were wanted in separate murder cases. Darshan was absconding in a case registered against him and Deepak Tinu in Bhiwani, Haryana, in November 2017.

20-01-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administrator’s advisory council to meet on Feb 10||The Chandigarh administrator’s advisory council is set to meet on February 10. Progress on the city’s second medical college, controversial Tribune flyover, reduction in collector rates, change of land use policy, new route to the international airport and options for mass rapid transit system (MRTS) will be on top of its agenda.It has been more than a year and a half since the council met after its reconstitution in August 2019. The administration had planned a meeting in April first week last year, but it had to be cancelled due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Several key issues have been hanging fire because of the delay.The council is responsible for advising the administration on development issues and policy matters affecting the city. In addition to all senior UT officials, it includes current and former members of parliament, mayor, resident and business association representatives and other prominent citizens. It also has 10 standing committees, which are subject-matter-related groups headed by a chairman.Confirming the development, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “The council will take up the agenda approved by the UT administrator. Its sub-committees will make presentations on different issues, such as Tribune flyover, new route from Chandigarh to the international airport, change of land use, second medical college, MRTS, and law and order.” Important issuesThe long-standing demand of realtors for a cut in collector rates will be taken up by the council. The cut is intended to rationalise prices, especially of commercial properties. It will also make the administration’s property auctions more attractive. The market price of industrial plots and commercial properties in some areas is less than the collector rates. The much-hyped Tribune flyover is likely to be discussed in the meeting. The UT adviser’s report on the project and its alternative will be part of the agenda, said a senior official. The administration has rejected all alternatives suggested by different experts.The administration has also submitted its proposal for setting up a medical college at Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16. The council will be made abreast about the scope and progress of the project.Reintroduction of the Apartment Act in the city is also likely to be put before council members for discussion. Facing housing shortage and expensive real estate, a section of people has demanded that the Act be reintroduced. It allows bifurcation of big plots, which is in the interest of owners of kanal houses in the city.Another contentious issue – allowing change of land use for opening of nursing homes on residential plots – will be tabled. The sub-committee on urban planning has already rejected the proposal, which was initially pushed by MP Kirron Kher.After the Centre and Punjab government rejected the administration’s proposal for an underpass for giving the city a shorter and direct route to the airport, the proposal is likely to be taken up by the council.It is also likely to brainstorm on the long-pending MRTS project, which has failed to take off because of lack of consensus on different options and lack of funding. After plans for Metro and Skybus were shelved, the UT administration last year pitched for Metrolite to solve traffic congestion and parking problems. No headway could be made due to the pandemic. Metrolite is an urban rail transit system on the pattern of Metro, but much smaller in size and cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-administrator-s-advisory-council-to-meet-on-feb-10-101611162079410.html
20-01-2021||Chandigarh||53,000 poultry birds to be culled after avian flu confirmed at two farms in Mohali||The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, has confirmed avian influenza in samples of birds sent from two poultry farms in Mohali’s Dera Bassi subdivision. Not just poultry birds, but also the sample of a dead crow has tested positive.The development comes a day after the Bhopal lab confirmed flu in a migratory bird found dead at the Siswan reserve in the district.The authorities are now gearing up for culling 53,000 poultry birds at the two farms in Behra village: Alpha and Royal.“We have received the confirmation letter from the Bhopal lab. We have constituted 25 teams to begin culling,” said VK Janjua, additional chief secretary, animal husbandry and dairy department, Punjab. The notification in this regard is awaited from the Centre, he said, adding that according to the head count done by the department, 53,000 birds are to be culled. The operations are expected to begin on Thursday.According to the procedure, the department will be sending the number of birds to the Centre, and the compensation will be paid to the poultry farm owners by both the central and state governments in 50:50 ratio.Confirmation comes after 5 daysThe Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, had confirmed bird flu in the samples from the two farms on January 15, but the final report was awaited from Bhopal.“As per the protocol, all poultry birds within the radius of 1 kilometre of the infected farms are to be culled. However, there is no other farm within the given radius,” said Janjua. The staff culling the birds will be placed in 14-day quarantine and will be given Tamiflu tablets to ensure their safety. The digging of pits has started to bury the birds after culling. The two farms in question are layer farms, which means birds are reared only for laying eggs and not for their meat. Dera Bassi has around 30 poultry farms, of which 20 are layer farms and 10 are broiler farms, said an owner.Meanwhile, on the bird flu case at Siswan, Janjua said: “There is no farm within 1 kilometre of the spot, but we have asked the wildlife department to be on alert. Samples are being collected of birds being reared by the locals as well.” P’kula admn still awaiting reportsIn the neighbouring Panchkula district, which was the first to confirm bird flu at two farms in Barwala on January 8, the administration is still awaiting reports of other samples sent to the Bhopal lab.As many as 81,000 birds were culled at the two farms besides another one in the infected zone.Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said samples have been were sent from around 40 poultry farms, where mortality was high, but reports are still awaited. Some samples have also been sent to a laboratory in Hisar.In Chandigarh, 16 dead crows and an eagle were found in different areas on Wednesday, taking the total to 140 since a migratory bird’s carcass was found floating in Sukhna Lake a couple of weeks back. Debendra Dalai, chief conservator of forest, said that reports of all samples sent for testing till now have been negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/53000-poultry-birds-to-be-culled-after-avian-flu-confirmed-at-two-farms-in-mohali-101611162019545.html
20-01-2021||Pune||60 more gardens to open in Pune from January 25||Pune: Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will reopen 60 more public gardens from January 25, almost three months after it opened the gates of 81 gardens across the city. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar issued the order on Wednesday. The timings for gardens to be operational have also been increased. Gardens will be kept open from 6am-10am and 4pm to 8pm, according to the order issued by Kumar. However, group activities like yoga sessions, laughter clubs, photo shoots, community or cultural events still remain prohibited at garden premises. In his order, Kumar stated that gym equipment in the gardens will not be permitted to be used. “The entry for children’s below 10 years and senior citizens above 65 years is still prohibited,” the order stated. Earlier, PMC had permitted to open 81 gardens in the city from November 1, 2020. However, there was growing demand from various citizens to open more gardens in the city. The closure of gardens had led to crowding on hills such as Taljai at Sahakarnagar and Vetal tekdi at Kothrud in the city. Many residents had voiced their demand citing that all other sectors, including schools and restaurants, had reopened in Pune. The Pune civic body’s elected representatives had also raised the issue, backing the demand from citizens. Aditya Malave, corporator from Shivajinagar area, had written to PMC commissioner to reopen all the gardens in the city. “I am happy that PMC administration has taken the decision to reopen more gardens. It will reduce the burden on existing gardens which have reopened. Timings have also been increased. Citizens will have more options now,” Malave said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/60-more-gardens-to-open-in-pune-from-january-25-101611161418524.html

20-01-2021||Pune||Early Punekars hunt & fish… and settle down!||Dr DD Kosambi was no ordinary man who saw the connections of living communities and long-forgotten cultures in his backyard of his home in Pune. As a polymath well versed in fields of Mathematics, Sciences, Numismatics, and Religion and so on, he is credited with extensive explorations in the vicinity of Pune. As he studied the spaces occupied by humble folk deities in and around Pune, he observed the material aspects of religious worships, their migrations and associated communities.Kosambi is known for his unique Marxist approach to study of Indian history through critical analysis, changing means of production of various societies. It was no wonder that he took great interest when he stumbled upon the stone tools of prehistoric humans of Pune during his explorations. The ubiquitous stone tools and carved remains found in the vicinity of the primitive cult sites convinced him of the vibrant cultural association of certain communities with these prehistoric places. Environment of Pune started to change around 10,000 to 4,000 years ago due to strong monsoon, leading to more water flows in the rivers, more black soil deposition and fertile landscapes. The vegetation around the river banks and valleys flourished, birds and animals bred providing better game, in turn to form the conducive atmosphere for man to not just survive, but also to thrive. This period hence saw significant rise in human and animal populations. This Mesolithic period is generous in terms of availability of food, water and shelter. The tool technology changed from bigger awkward tools to smaller micro stone tools. In absence of metal objects, it was pertinent to use stones to get sharper, effective edges. The smaller parts were scraped from strong material such as flint, quartz, chalcedony, etc. These tools were sharper and are set in wood, horn or bone with gum adhesive to make a blade for cutting or piercing tool. Sickles, harpoons, javelins, arrows, knives, needles and many such tools were made with this technology. It is however not easy to date these tools accurately unless found in stratified context. But, as we see the environment of Pune in context of changing Deccan environment, it provides us with broad trends.The prehistoric man is, thus, cutting the grain stalks, hunting fish, scraping the animal hide to make leather, stitching the leather, etc. The stone tools indirectly indicate the activities of cattle rearing undertaken on hills tracks of Pune and fishing done on banks of rivers. Microlithic tools are reported from both east and west of Pune city, for example, Yavat, Bhosari, Loni, Dapodi, Jejuri, Saswad, Theur, Lohagad, Malavali, etc. In Pune city, Kosambi reports such microlithic tools from Vetal hill, Law college hill, Pashan hill, near National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Vaiduwadi in Pune. The continuous stretch of microliths extends towards east to great distance along hill ranges and river valleys. He has tried classifying these two locations in “high-land” and “low-land” cultures based on the crudeness and finesse of the tools found. However, these two varieties of tools may not necessarily represent two different kinds of groups. As one goes further down the river valleys, the average technique improves; many of the specimens are works of art, some as delicate as fine surgical tools. Excavation and erosion show enough of the underlying soil to prove that there are no occupation layers, nor other artefacts such as pottery. A track normally runs along the bottom of the hill at the margin of the river valley. These concentrations of microliths may indicate the seasonal fishing camps along the river pools. One such camp was seen near Poona Mental hospital. Fishing would certainly provide supplement to the primitive diet, but human groups would have to look at main food source in hills of Pune near streams. Such areas around Vetal hill, Prabhat studio and NCL yield sizable microliths indicating human occupation. It would be temporary or seasonal as we do not find significant deposits of settlements representing more permanent occupation. These moving communities are the proverbial ancestors of nomadic Dhangars we see today, moving along the same tracks. Agriculture is not in picture yet, but one sees a prominent shift towards cattle rearing, harvesting the wild grasses, fishing and hunting. As we move further down the Pune’s timeline, we see human cultures in Deccan finally settling down owing to the best environmental conditions. This period is part of proto-historic period of India. Proto history is sandwiched between pre-history and history where some cultures have developed literacy, but is not known to other cultures. This advent of literacy provides a whole new meaning to existence of humans as a civilised society. Between the evolution of script and first historians writing, proto-historic period marks the further development from Stone Age. In northern India, proto-historic period marked by development of first civilisation, the Harappan civilisation. Through presence of the internationally used Harappan script which is yet convincingly deciphered, we get an idea about zenith of urban development they had achieved. This is also the time when Copper is discovered and harnessed by human cultures, thus, leading to combined use of Copper and stone underlining the Chalcolithic culture (2450 BCE – 900 BCE). Contemporary to and slightly later than Harappan culture, numerous Chalcolithic sites in Deccan practised irrigated agriculture through improved tool technologies. In Pune district alone, archaeologists have extensively studied Chalcolithic sites at Inamgaon, Walki, Chandoli, Theur, Koregaon Bhima, Songaon, through excavations. Padmashri Dr M K Dhavalikar is internationally applauded for his landmark study into the social aspects and early farming cultures of Deccan at the site of Inamgaon in Pune district.However, till recently, Pune city had not reported any significant Chalcolithic remains in or around the city which did raise important questions about continuity of human habitation in Pune. But, to our collective delight, archaeologists Varada Kahaladkar and Manjiri Bhalerao during their yet unpublished survey have documented 3,000-year-old chalcolithic pottery from Sangvi in western Pune. This surely is exciting news and we hope that their work would unravel many more secrets pertaining to Pune’s settlements and chalcolithic culture.Thus, so far from large tools wielding Paleolithic humans wandering around banks of rivers, we come to proto-historic man gaining firm footing on the grounds of Pune, gently spreading the wings to settle down permanently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/early-punekars-hunt-fish-and-settle-down-101611153560444.html

This resort near Tanaji Kada on the fort premises is 20-years old and has remained closed for the last several years. The renovation work of this resort has been completed by the MTDC and it will be ready to host guests in a month, an MTDC official has informed. “There are two dormitories with a capacity of eight beds in each one. There are three rooms and a kitchen in this resort. There is also a snack centre in the premises. The main part of the renovation is completed and now finishing work is going on. The resort could be opened in a month,” said Deepak Harne regional manager, MTDC Pune. Tourists will be able book the resort online on the MTDC website once the resort is functional. The charges are not yet decided. Once the facility is open, details will be available on the website, officials said. In addition to the Sinhagad MTDC, a resort will also be opened in Akkalkot as well. The MTDC has rolled out an elaborate plan to attract tourists and to make their stay enjoyable. “We are going to tie up with various cultural and adventure groups who can perform at the resort centres. We are planning to give special discounts to people who visit destinations for pre wedding shoots, corporate meetings and work from nature. All the precautions related to Covid-19 will be taken,” said Deepak Harne. Sinhagad is a hill fortress located at around 35 kilometres from Pune. It is one of the most famous tourist destinations and also a popular adventure spot amongst trekkers. Sinhagad was originally known as Kondhana and it has been the site of many battles. It was a strategic location in a chain of important forts for the Maratha Empire such as Rajgad, Purandar and Torna. “Trekkers who want to go to Rajgad and Torna will be able to stay at the Sinhagad resort. As there was no place to live on the fort hill, they had to climb down and live in the villages,” Deepak Harne said. The MTDC is optimistic about the good response from tourists as well as cultural groups. To facilitate the tourist movement, a cement road has been constructed to the Sinhagad fort recently. After the Pune district administration gave permission to open all historic and archaeological sites, the Sinhagad fort was opened for tourists. The MTDC resort on the fort also has an open-air amphitheatre which can be used for cultural performances and adventure sports demonstrations. The renovated resort could be used by tourists or members of performing groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mtdc-to-reopen-resort-on-sinhagad-fort-pune-in-a-month-101611153199385.html

Maha Metro issued the press statement on Tuesday and claimed, “The flood levels would increase very normally due to metro work, but to ensure citizens, Mahametro would present and discuss the CWPRS report with an expert committee during the forthcoming meeting under the chairmanship of divisional commissioner.” Some activists including Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan, Anu Aga, Sarang Yadwadkar held a press conference and raised a concern over rising water levels due to ongoing metro work in the Mutha river. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s city unit president Ajay Shinde also demanded a stop work order to the metro in the riverbed area. As activist and political leaders raised concern over the flood level, Maha Metro issued a press statement on Tuesday. Maha Metro said, “The construction work of metro piers along the left bank of the Mutha river is being executed under the supervision of an expert committee appointed by NGT (National Green Tribunal). The matter is sub judice with the NGT. “ Maha Metro said, “The CWPRS report will be presented and discussed with the expert committee during the forthcoming meeting. However, Maha Metro is of the view that the reported values are far from the truth.

The rent income should be shared with PMC or instead of asking for a PMC share in metro development, Maha Metro should minimise it.” The Maha Metro replied to the PMC and said, “Maha Metro is a joint project of the Central, state and local body. All over the world, metro projects do not only sustain on ticket revenue and it needs to add non-ticket revenue to make the transport project sustainable.” Maha Metro said, “As per the detailed project report, the total project cost of the metro is ₹11,420 crore. It is borrowing a ₹5,831 crore loan and the PMC is giving ₹951 crore for the project.” Metro said, “The state government would take decisions about the funds and share as Maha Metro would require the revenue from non-ticket sources. Renting out the property is a way to generate non-ticket resource until the metro project is in progress. Instead of discussing rent sharing and other elements, both the organisations need to work to complete the metro project earlier.” The administration on Tuesday submitted the metro’s letter to the standing committee for information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/maha-metro-hints-at-not-sharing-rent-revenue-with-pune-civic-body-101611152718817.html

20-01-2021||Pune||Talegaon: MIDC to build township in a 6,000 acre industrial facility||The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) is set to build a residential township as part of developing a huge industrial facility spanned over 6,000 acres for hardware production in Talegaon Phase IV. In this project, a 60:40 ratio will be applied to build support facilities for the residence, informed MIDC officials. A total of 2,000 acres will be reserved for residential township and the rest 4,000 acres will be used to develop industrial facilities.This facility, along the backwaters of Andra dam in Maval near Pune, is named Talegaon Electronic and Engineering City (TEEC). It is termed as the first electronic park in the state by MIDC officials. The industrial facility is intended for hardware production industries with zero pollution. The most outstanding feature of this project is that MIDC has differed from its usual 80:20 ratio space for the industrial and residential areas.“Usually in an industrial facility, 80 percent space is given to the industry and 20 percent is kept for supporting facilities including residence and other recreational facilities. In this project, we are going to give 40 percent space for support facilities. So, in this project residential area and support facilities will be on almost 2,000 acres. This step has been taken to reduce the additional burden on Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities. The residential area will also have world-class facilities,” said Avinash Hadgal, regional officer of MIDC. This facility is to be constructed in Ambale, Nigade, Pavlewadi and Kalhat in Maval Taluka. According to an MIDC official, the process of land acquisition has almost been completed. TEEC is going to have convenient access from Pune and from Mumbai as well. It will have a water supply from Andra dam and will be developed into a self-sufficient township. “It will have a world-class support system of schools, grounds, theatres, and an international university. Our goal is that maximum people working in the industries in this phase should live here. Residential priority will be given to what we call suitable personalities. The workers, executives in this industry will be given priority,” said Avinash Hadgal. The e-tender has been floated under the international competitive bidding process for the consultancy companies to prepare a detailed master plan and preliminary design report for roads and services for TEEC. The last date to submit the online tender is January 20, 2021. The consultancies must have minimum experience in planning such projects to apply for this tender. From the industries in TEES, 2,00,000 jobs are expected to be created in the course of time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/talegaon-midc-to-build-township-in-a-6-000-acre-industrial-facility-101611152238287.html
20-01-2021||Pune||Pune’s Mhalunge-Maan town planning scheme gathers dust two years after groundbreaking||The former BJP Devendra Fadnavis led Maharashtra government announced to develop Mhalunge-Maan as a high-tech city in the vicinity of Hinjewadi IT park under Pune’s first town planning scheme in five decades, however more than two years later the work has only remained on cards. The announcement offered hope for planned development of many other areas. The Pune metropolitan region development authority’s (PMRDA), which is to develop the city said it plans to replicate similar town planning schemes at 40 other places. More than two years later, the work on Pune’s first high-tech city is only on cards except the foundation stone laying, which Fadnavis carried out on November 15, 2018. PMRDA had announced that the town planning scheme is being planned on 250 hectares by spending ₹640 crore and will be complete in the next three years. It was also said that the scheme would attract ₹21,300 crore investments. However, the delay in completing the land acquisition has stalled the project. PMRDA chief executive officer and metropolitan commissioner Suhas Divase said, “The land acquisition work for the town planning scheme is in progress. During Covid-19 pandemic, the work slowed down but now we would ensure that it would be sped up. Even the other planned townships are in the pipeline.” As per the plan, PMRDA was to borrow ₹600 crore loan from Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) to develop basic infrastructure like roads and other facilities, before allowing private plot owners to develop their plots. The scheme will be implemented on 700 acres divided into nine sectors with plans for roads, water, drainage, school and garden. Divase said, “The land acquisition work is being carried out by another department and we are hoping that it will get completed early.” Former chief minister Fadnavis took interest in the scheme and ring road project to make Pune city as a growth engine for Maharashtra. Fadnavis had promised that Mhalunge Maan would be a world class city but almost after two-years since the ground breaking ceremony no progress is seen on the project.In this scheme, PMRDA will get 70 acres for free while the approach road to Hinjewadi IT park is getting constructed without carrying out any land acquisition. Planning schemesA total of 46 town planning schemes were planned around the proposed 128 kilometre Ring Road project but all schemes are lying idle. On the lines of Ahmedabad city, the PMRDA planned to develop 46 town planning schemes around the Ring road. The town planning schemes and the Ring road will be developed simultaneously and are part of the same project. The schemes are part of the Ring road project and it will help authorities acquire land for the project at minimal cost.Proposal by PMCAfter PMRDA, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) also proposed to build three town planning schemes at Fursungi and Uruli Devachi but they are gathering dust too and no progress has been made on the town planning schemes||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/punes-mhalunge-maan-town-planning-scheme-gathers-dust-two-years-after-groundbreaking-101611152179028.html

The moment she stepped inside the room, she slipped and fell on the floor. The entire floor was covered in a thick layer of ghee (clarified butter). A report in the Marathi daily “Jnanaprakash” published on page 6 on December 24 states that the confectioner had stored ghee, which he had purchased from Sangli, in several vats. His son was getting married in a few days. He was also looking to make a profit by selling confections as the wedding season in Pune was in full swing. While the family was sleeping, robbers had entered the house and tried to steal the vats. But since the vats were heavy, they threw some ghee away in the kitchen where the vats were stored and took away all the half-empty vats.Tiwari had his shop in front of Dagdusheth Halwai temple. Even though my attempts to locate the shop and the family have been futile, the story of thieves stealing ghee deserves a narration because of what happened after some people (who would remain anonymous because we do not know who they were!) got to know of the theft. They accused Tiwari of adulterating ghee (which was already stolen!) with animal fat. A scandal erupted in the city.Although the most important milk product in India was ghee, it was difficult to obtain pure ghee in markets in Pune, and most of India till the 1950s. The production of milk and its by-products was minimal and not entirely industrialised. Villagers from Maval and Sangli districts would come with butter and ghee to sell in Pune. These products were mostly purchased by confectioners or the rich for weddings and other ceremonies. There were agents in Sangli and Kolhapur who would send butter and ghee to Pune. A couple of letters written by Lokmanya Tilak in 1892 and 1894 are archived at Nehru Memorial Library in New Delhi. In those letters, he requests his friends in Sangli to send some “good quality ghee” in four tins of 5 lbs each.Ghee was a priced commodity, affordable to few. Till the Second World War ended, ghee was rarely purchased for domestic purposes. It was almost always a by-product, along with curd, butter and buttermilk, of the milk purchased for household usage. After the independent semi-feudal economy changed to a subservient colonial economy, affordability was often linked to conventional religious notions of what was “pure” and what was “impure”. Ghee was used in religious rituals and offerings, hence it had to be “pure”. Which meant that the housewife was supposed to be resourceful and had to manage to make enough ghee from whatever little quantity of milk was made available to her. She was judged by the texture, smell and consistency of the ghee she made.Keeping this in mind, Justice Mahadeo Govind Ranade was trying to build a sustainable dairy industry in Bombay Presidency. The first step was to bring a mechanical cream separator to Pune, which would make the manufacturing of buttermilk, khoa, butter and ghee easier.The Industrial Association of Western India, established by Ranade, MB Namjoshi and Vasukaka Joshi in 1891, had actively pursued this cause. Dr Ozanne, commissioner of Settlements and Agriculture in Bombay, employed a European expert in June 1891 who manufactured two cream separators in Bombay. Ranade and Namjoshi invited Dr Ozanne to Pune where the first ever demonstration of the “made in India” cream separator was held. Ranade, in his address on the occasion of the first Industrial Conference held in August 1891, under the auspices of the Industrial Association, praised the efforts of Dr Ozanne and while accepting that lack of demand was a problem, hoped that Pune would become a hub of dairy industry in the near future. He also made an appeal to form a co-operative society so that a milk processing unit could be established in Pune which would cater to the needs of the British and the Indians in and around Pune and Bombay.The British were not much fond of ghee. They found the smell and texture repulsive. They longed for good butter. Although large quantities of butter were made in Bombay, mostly from cream imported by rail from Ahmedabad and Surat districts, this was distributed over India for European use, or else exported to East Africa, Burma and the Strait settlements. Dairies were also established in many cantonments, including Pune, to fulfil the demand for butter.India also imported a fair amount of butter from Denmark, the United Kingdom and France, in the order named. A large proportion of butter thus imported came in tins. There was some demand for butter after 1910 among wealthy Indians not for consumption as such, but to be used for the manufacture of ghee.A delegation led by the Consul of the United States in Bombay, Mr Henry D Baker, visited Pune in 1914 to check whether cream separators manufactured in the US could find a market in Pune. His report shows that although he was hopeful of setting up dairies in Bombay, he was apprehensive about its utility in Pune because of lack of demand.The Government Dairy at Khadkee, established in 1905, supplied milk to the Sassoon Hospital, to infants and invalids, and to a limited number of private consumers, when circumstances permitted. But the dairy’s daily yield of 550 to 700 pounds of milk was too small to be worked economically. When milk was scarce it often happened that the hospital required all of it. The surplus milk, whenever available, had to be converted into butter and eventually disposed of as ghee at a considerable loss, since it was impossible to produce milk in Pune, where the cost of fodder was high and grazing non-existent, in competition with villages outside Pune or in Sangli, by whom the milk for manufacturing ghee was produced under totally different conditions.The agricultural advisers of the Government therefore recommended that the average daily yield of milk should be raised to 1,000 pounds in order to avoid much of the loss occasioned by the disposal of surplus milk in the form of ghee and efforts should be made to sell it in the markets in Pune. The dairy was made an integral part of the Poona Agricultural College. The buildings of the dairy were enlarged and a thoroughly up-to-date dairy and refrigerating plant was installed. In the budget for 1914-15, the Government of the Bombay Presidency appropriated about $32,000 for the improvements and extensions mentioned, and a special unit for manufacture of ghee was built.In 1915, a couple of shops selling milk products started in Pune. One of them was started by Shivalingappa Gatade and was situated near Babu Genu chowk. This was the first shop to sell hung curd in Pune. Long queues were often seen outside his shop. But it took him twenty more years to start selling ghee. By then, there were a few more shops which had started selling milk products, especially ghee.Gandhian philosophy had gained popularity by then. The diet endorsed by Gandhiji comprised ghee. But it had to be made from cow’s milk. So these shops started stocking ghee made from cow’s milk too.But most of the butter to make ghee still came from outside Pune. And the ghee stocked in these shops was often looked with suspicion.So, when Tiwari was accused of adulterating ghee he had purchased from Sangli, he lodged a complaint with the Poona Municipality. A case was registered under the Bombay Prevention of Adulteration Act, 1925. Samples were sent to Bombay for testing and a month later he got a clean chit. He put an advertisement in “Jnanaprakash” to declare this.Fifteen years later, Dalda, the manufacturer of hydrogenated vegetable oil in India, had to get involved in a similar fight. But that’s another story for another time.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

However, all the deaths cannot be attributed to bird flu. Cold stress is another major reason," he said.On Tuesday, authorities restricted the entry of public into the Red Fort till Friday after a sample of a dead crow tested positive for bird flu.Around 15 crows were found dead in the premises of the Red Fort on January 10."Four cranes were found dead in the Delhi zoo a few days ago.

In 2014, the bureau registered a case after a probe found that the three Delhi residents had fraudulently taken over the management of the school, which was given to the trust by the university. The three had been running boarding schools on commercial basis in collusion with university officials. Investigation found that an agreement was executed in 1992 between the university and the trust whereby the three-storeyed school building along with 10 acres on its campus was given to the trust by the university on lease for 99 years for a nominal Re 1 a year but no lease deed was actually executed and registered. The purpose of handing over the school to the trust, which was started by the university in 1984 as a primary school, was to upgrade the school to senior secondary level with better management. The then trust head entered into an agreement with the accused in 2000 as a result of which the management of the school got transferred to that person without the knowledge of the university. The main accused had surreptitiously inducted his own relatives and acquaintances in the society meant to run the school and gradually turned the school into a commercial enterprise by constructing hostel accommodation, whereas the actual purpose of the school was to educate children of the university staff and thus used the assets of the university for his private gain. The university filed a petition before the court against the trust that it had sold the school to a third party without the knowledge and consent of the university in violation of the agreement. Incidentally, the trust had also gone to the court to take the school back from the third party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-delhi-residents-face-charges-for-taking-over-school-fraudulently-on-agriculture-university-campus-in-solan-101611137946302.html
20-01-2021||Patna||Bihar power plant mulls temporary closure after staff held hostage by villagers||The NTPC was mulling temporary closure of its Barauni Thermal Power Station (BTPS), located in Bihar’s Begusarai district, after villagers laid siege to the power plant, demanding compensation for the accidental death of a contractual labourer on national highway (NH) 28, on Tuesday afternoon.Incensed villagers blocked all entry and exit points to the BTPS plant and virtually held around 750 plant officials and CISF security staff hostage. The Begusarai district administration hasn’t yet intervened to deescalate the situation.Earlier on Tuesday, the district administration had removed the blockade from NH-28 but allowed the protesting villagers to squat in front of the BTPS gate on the adjacent road, hampering the functioning of the power plant.“We may have to temporarily shut the plant if the villagers do not lift the blockade, which has continued for 22 hours now. Our personnel are fatigued, as they are continuously working since yesterday,” said NTPC spokesman Vishwanath Chandan.“Essential supplies to our campus like milk and medicines have also been blocked. Many of our personnel are over 50 years of age and need medication. They are unable to go home as protestors have blocked their exit and at the same time are also not allowing workmen of other shifts to enter our premises. The NTPC has absolutely no correlation with the road traffic accident on NH-28,” he added.Ramashish Thakur, 56, a contractual labourer with an outsourced firm, working for the NTPC, was killed after being hit by a speeding vehicle while returning home from work Tuesday afternoon. The villagers are now demanding compensation to the bereaved family.“It’s difficult to understand why the NTPC Barauni employees, deployed on essential services, have been made hostage for the last 22 hours when the contractual worker died in a road accident on NH 28,” said Chandan.Begusarai district magistrate Arvind Kumar Verma, said, “We are going to give an ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh to the next of the kin of the deceased under the disaster management act. The NTPC or its contractor has to fulfil some insurance obligations. Our officers, representatives of the NTPC and the police are presently having talks with the protesting villagers. We will resolve the issue within an hour.”The NTPC, however, did not see any reason for the protesting villagers to hold their staff at ransom.“The contractor, who engaged the said worker, has to fulfil statutory compliances under the labour law, which also includes extending benefits under the Employees’ State Insurance scheme, etc. There is no question of denial of his (worker’s) legitimate dues; so there should not be any reason for protest,” added Chandan.The BTPS, which the state had transferred to the NTPC in December 2018, has an installed capacity of 360 MW presently. Bihar would be deprived of 150 MW power if the NTPC were to shut down its BTPS plant.

The bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli on Tuesday sought response from the state government by April 20. The law was enacted recently by the state government, providing 50% reservation to women in panchayati raj institutions (PRIs). The plea was filed by two women, Kailash Bai and Sneh Lata, who have challenged the Haryana Panchayati Raj (second amendment) Act, particularly relating to the scheme of reservation of seats in gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zila parishad. Now all wards are to be sequentially numbered odd and even for the purpose of reservation of seats. Even numbers are to be reserved for women. The Act provides that “persons other than women” can contest from odd numbered wards. The term “persons other than woman” has not been defined under the amendment and would logically include males and transgenders and exclude women. The amendment thus restricts women candidates from contesting from odd numbered wards, which are otherwise open or general wards, said lawyer Deepkaran Dalal. The amendment discriminates between eligible women and their male counterparts, which violates Articles 14 and 15 of Constitution, he said. The court was also told that Chapter 9 of the Constitution, which deals with panchayati raj institutions, provides for reservation of not less than 1/3rd seats for women and does not prescribe any upper limit on the number of women candidates who may contest elections from open or general category seats but the amendment restricts women candidates from contesting only on 50% of the seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-notice-to-haryana-on-plea-challenging-capping-women-s-quota-in-panchayati-raj-institutions-101611135364867.html
20-01-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow's first jaggery festival likely next month||Famous for its culture, tradition, monuments and delicious food, Lucknow will be holding a jaggery festival or the 'Gur Mahotsav' for the very first time in the month of February. While the exact dates of the event are still not finalised, but, it is expected that the festival could take place on February 13 and 14, said a government press statement."The jaggery festival was scheduled to take place last year but it could not be held due to the pandemic. It will be taking place this year now. The date for the event, however, is still not finalised. The sugar industry and sugarcane development department has started gearing up for this big event," said additional chief secretary, sugarcane development department, Sanjay Bhoosreddy in the statement.Last week, Bhoosreddy held a meeting, where the format and purpose of the Gur Mahotsav was discussed in detail. "The government is sparing no efforts for the publicity of the event so that more and more people can join the festival and become aware of the quality and range of jaggery," read the statement.The festival will be showcasing the branding of jaggery and its related products. Progressive sugarcane farmers from every corner of the state will be invited and it is expected that many specialist producers of the agriculture and food processing sector will also visit the festival and share their knowledge."It will have stalls of jaggery chocolates, sweets, candies, and kheer. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research and the Sugarcane Research Institute have jointly prepared chocolates and other products from jaggery in different flavours," said the statement.According to experts, this natural sweetening food has enormous health benefits. Along with its medicinal properties, 'Gur' is a rich source of energy, and many nutrients including iron, calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin A and B are also found in sufficient amounts in Gur. Malnutrition can also be eliminated by fortifying jaggery with vitamins according to the need, the statement said.Jaggery is the ODOP (one district, one product) product of Muzaffarnagar and Ayodhya and the Gur Mahotsav has already been organised in Muzaffarnagar. Muzaffarnagar has over a hundred jaggery processed products and these products will be displayed in the 'Gur Mahotsav'. Farmers who will visit the event will be made aware of them. Also, interested farmers will be given training in this regard later, said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknows-first-jaggery-festival-likely-next-month-101611134374562.html
20-01-2021||Patna||Without chairperson and members, Bihar women’s commission is failing victims||Without a chairperson and members since November 2020, the Bihar state women commission is failing in its mandate to watch over women’s rights as it is forced to turn away scores of female victims that knock on its doors on a daily basis, according to a staff of the commission.The former team running the office of the state women commission, including its chairperson, completed its full three- year term on October 31, 2020.“In absence of the chairperson and the members, cases cannot be registered in person at the commission. In fact, the complaints have to be entered into the register only in the presence of the officials. This is why complainants are not being allowed access to the complaint register,” said Vinita Kumari, an employee at the state women commission.Staff members like Vinita Kumari have to face the wrath of dozens of complainants, several of whom turn up at the commission’s Patna office from other districts, with hopes of justice, only to be told that their complaints cannot be registered with the rights body.“When refused to be allowed to make an entry, many often lose the patience and temper,” Vinita Kumari said.The current situation only complicates the existing challenges for the commission that is already grappling with cases pending for the last several months due to the restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.“Though the cases sent through the posts were being received, the hearing of cases could not be possible due to the norms of social distancing. The complainants and other parties involved were not given the dates to appear in person at the family court held at the women commission’s office. For months, there has been no hearing,” Vinita said.Since the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, over 3000 complaints have been received by the commission and only 1,618 of these could be disposed of. Even in 2019, only 2,695 cases were sorted out from amongst the 3,344 complaints received.“It’s mainly the victims who are at the receiving end. They turn up with high hopes and here they are not allowed even to make an entry of their grievances since we are not authorised to receive it,” Vinita added.The social welfare minister, Ashok Chaudhary, could not be contacted for his comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/without-chairperson-and-members-bihar-women-s-commission-is-failing-victims-101611129525168.html
20-01-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to get 92k Covid doses this week to cover entire healthcare force||The Uttarakhand state health department will be getting 92,500 more doses of Covishield vaccine from Centre this week for continuation of the vaccination drive against Covid-19 that started on January 16, said Dr Kuldeep Martoliya, nodal officer for state’s extended programme for immunization.“We will be getting another 92,500 doses of Covishield vaccine in another two to three days as the Central government gave its approval for the same on Tuesday. These doses will be sufficient for 46,000 health workers, covering the total health care workers of the state,” said Dr. Martoliya.On Tuesday, Uttarakhand reported 58.2% vaccination by the end of the day. So far 6,119 health workers have been vaccinated in the state. A total of 1,882 health workers were vaccinated on Tuesday in 34 sessions across the state.Since Saturday, the vaccination percentage has been on a decline in the state. On the first day, over 72% health workers were vaccinated.Speaking on the reason for the low turnout, Martoliya said, “There are two main reasons, one is that many health workers from different districts have been sent to the Maha Kumbh fair, but they were registered (for vaccination) in the districts of their original posting. We have requested the Central government to allow us to edit their registrations so that they can be vaccinated in Haridwar.”He further said that the reduction is also because ASHA and ANM workers, associated with the vaccination drive, are not able to reach the vaccination sites due to the distance involved. The health department is looking into the matter to help these vaccinators reach the vaccination sites.Doctors and officials at vaccination booths in Dehradun have started counselling registered candidates to encourage them to get inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-to-get-92k-covid-doses-this-week-to-cover-entire-healthcare-force-101611126961232.html

20-01-2021||Lucknow||BJP, SP candidates step closer to unopposed election to UP legislative council||Independent candidate Mahesh Chandra Sharma’s nomination for the biennial election for 12 legislative council seats in Uttar Pradesh was rejected during the scrutiny of papers on Tuesday in Lucknow. It has bolstered the possibility of unopposed election of all the 10 BJP and the two Samajwadi Party (SP) candidates on Thursday.Soon after BJP’s 10 candidates filed their nomination papers on Monday, Sharma threw his hat in the ring, becoming the 13th candidate in the fray, creating a distinct possibility of forcing a voting on January 28.The returning officer, however, found his papers to be incomplete and rejected his nomination. “Nomination of Mahesh Chandra Sharma was rejected on the ground of several deficiencies. For example, he did not have even a single MLA as a proposer and neither did he submit the security deposit,” said special secretary, UP Assembly, Braj Bhushan Dubey.“Under the current provisions, a candidate for the legislative council needs 10 MLAs as proposers and ₹10,000 as security deposit if he belongs to the general caste category or ₹5,000 in case he belongs to SC or ST category when he files nomination papers,” Dubey added.With this, the unopposed election of all 10 BJP and two SP candidates is being seen as a foregone conclusion, provided none of the remaining candidates withdraw, which will make voting necessary.“Unopposed election of all the 12 candidates is certain after 3pm on Thursday when the time for withdrawing names is over,” people in the know of the developments said.The 10 BJP candidates are deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, state president Swatantra Dev Singh, ex-bureaucrat Arvind Kumar Sharma, Laxman Acharya, Govind Narayan Shukla, Salil Vishnoi, Ashwini Tyagi, Surendra Chaudhary, Dharamvir Prajapati and Kunwar Manvendra Singh.SP has fielded Ahmad Hasan and Rajendra Chaudhary and they are also expected to get elected unopposed on Thursday.“In the event of a voting, it could have been difficult for both the BJP and the SP to get their 10th and the second candidate elected respectively, purely on the basis of their own numerical strength in the legislative assembly,” officials pointed out.Also Read: UP Police team reaches Mumbai, will question 'Tandav' makers: ReportEach candidate needs 32 votes from MLAs to get elected to the upper House.

20-01-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An evening in Babu Lal’s village||It’s freezing at the moment, around 8.30pm. “You should see the roads at midnight, when it’s totally foggy,” mutters auto rickshaw driver Babu Lal, on his way to drop a passenger in Connaught Place. He says he will stay on the road for a few more hours before going back to his rented quarter in Mahipalpur.Responding to a request, Mr Lal, who is in his 40s, agrees to share his impressions about what his family must be doing back home, in his village in Bihar.“Shrimati Sheetal Devi must be having her dinner. She is my wife. In the village, the day ends earlier than in the city—and the night comes earlier too. She starts cooking the meal by 6, with the help of Babita, her younger sister. Babita’s husband passed away two months after her wedding so my wife called her to our home. This way she gets to be with her sister, and Babita also finds a distraction from her loss. About an hour later, at 7pm, both sisters serve food to Amma, my mother. These days it’s very cold and she stays in her room—we have two rooms, our house is of bricks. After Amma is finished with her dinner, Shrimati Sheetal Devi serves food to Siddhartha and Gautam, my two sons. Siddhartha is 14 and Gautam is 10. The kids eat in the other room, where there is TV. And only then do Shrimati Sheetal Devi and Babita sit down in the kitchen for dinner. Earlier we had no kitchen in our home. The food was cooked outside, in a yard. My father was a farmer. I made a good decision to come to Delhi some 20 years ago. I earned enough to convert our kutcha house into a pucca makaan, and later we also built the kitchen. Some years ago, during my annual trip home, I bought a washing machine and now Shrimati Sheetal Devi doesn’t have to wash clothes by hands. Our whole family is asleep by 10pm. If you happened to be in my village right now, you would feel the darkness and silence so complete that you can never experience the same in Delhi.”Mr Lal last saw his family during the Dussehra. His wife and children have never visited him in Delhi. “The travel would be too expensive. Besides, I share my room with another driver,” he says, as the auto nears its destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-evening-in-babu-lal-s-village-101611093539382.html

20-01-2021||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder case: CBI court refuses to exempt Indrani Mukerjea from wearing jail uniform sari||A special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court on Tuesday rejected an application filed by Indrani Mukerjea, seeking exemption from wearing the green saree – a uniform for women prisoners across Maharashtra.Mukerjea has been lodged at Byculla jail since her arrest in August 2015, in the Sheena Bora murder case.On December 22, 2020, Mukerjea’s lawyer Gunjan Mangla had approached the special CBI court with a plea that Mukerjea be permitted to wear regular clothes. Earlier this month, the authorities at Byculla jail submitted a reply to Mukerjea’s plea, stating that as per the rules, undertrial persons booked in a murder case fall under the category of prisoners, and have to wear the jail uniform.Mangla opposed this and argued that there is no specified rule as to what uniform should be worn. “Indrani suffers from mental health issues since her arrest. If she is asked to wear the prison uniform, it would affect her further. Besides, undertrial prisoners are allowed to wear their regular clothes,” she argued.Mangala also questioned why after almost five years, was Mukerjea being forced to wear the prison uniform.The court, however, rejected Mukerjea’s contention and refused to grant her any relief. Sheena Bora, 24, was allegedly strangled in a car by Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and her former husband Sanjeev Khanna, on April 2012. Her body was later burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sheena-bora-murder-case-cbi-court-refuses-to-exempt-indrani-mukerjea-from-wearing-jail-uniform-sari-101611088737421.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Gram panchayats across Maharashtra get a shot of fresh blood as youngsters win elections||When 22-year-old Sandhya Sonawane decided to contest the gram panchayat polls from Naigaon, Ahmednagar, many ridiculed her for the decision. A law graduate, Sonawane works as the Pune region president of a leading student wing. “Many questioned my decision of going back to my village to contest the local body polls, and said that I was leaving behind my prospects in the city, but I knew what I was doing. It was a difficult fight being a woman and a scheduled caste candidate fighting from a constituency with a high non-reserved population. But I am happy I did it. I now wish to work on improving the schools and roads here,” said Sonawane, who won the elections with a lead of 123 votes.This year, a large number of young men and women contested and won the elections to local bodies recently held in more than 14,000 gram panchayats across the state. Like Sonawane, many young men and women, most of whom had no political background, contested the polls from their respective villages and emerged victorious as results were announced on Monday.Possibly the youngest among all the candidates, Ruturaj Deshmukh, a 21-year-old science graduate, won the election from Ghatne village in Mohol, Solapur. Deshmukh, whose parents are farmers, said that the urge to address local issues pushed him to contest the polls. “I want to address the electricity issues in my village. We have frequent load shedding here, and most nights, there is no light. I want to provide an alternative of solar electricity to address this issue,” he added. Having cleared his law entrance, he wishes to pursue his LLB and work for the village at the same time.Kishor More, 28, who runs a small transport business in Koparkhairane, won the election from Chikhlewadi, Kumbhargaon in Satara, with a lead of 115 votes. “I was always interested in social work. Being a member of the local body will allow me to make direct interventions to solve local issues. For years, politicians have used elections only to their advantage. I want to change that and work for people by addressing basic issues,” he added. Sanjay Bhoiwar, a 33-year-old local painting contractor from Antapur, Nanded, also won the election with a lead of 124 votes. “I come from the Matang community and have no political backing; hence this victory is important for me. I want to work for the betterment of my village,” he said.The young class of elected local officials is made up of a mix of those who live in villages and others who especially moved back to their hometowns, setting aside their education and work in cities. Akash Dounde, a postgraduate from Savitribai Phule Pune University, won the elections from his village Somthane Nalawade in Pathardi, Ahmednagar, with a lead of 120 votes. Both his parents worked as cane cutters, and for him, contesting the elections was a big challenge. “I did not have the money, nor the same resources as my opponents from big parties did. I told my voters that all I could promise them was good work if elected, and it worked. Active politics is crucial to bring about a real change and I am hoping to do just that,” he said.Vivek Ghotale, a Pune-based political analyst and researcher, said that multiple factors are responsible for the increasing participation of youngsters in local body polls. “One reason is that gram panchayats get direct funds under provisions of the 14th finance commission which makes elections more competitive. And this time, due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, a large number of youngsters had gone to their villages, which might have led to more participation. Whatever the reason, it is good to see that a young leadership is emerging to challenge the status quo,” he said.While some candidates were backed by political parties, many also took the plunge independently. Ali Malegaonkar, 29, who works as an assistant professor at a college in Pune, had put up an entire panel for the elections in his village Markhel in Nanded. “We were getting a good response as our candidates were chosen by the people themselves. We did not distribute liquor or money and only spoke about addressing issues. Ahead of the polls, however, some of them were poached by leading parties and we had to look for last-minute replacements. Despite that, many of our candidates lost only by a small margin,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gram-panchayats-across-maharashtra-get-a-shot-of-fresh-blood-as-youngsters-win-elections-101611088377371.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Inter-state vehicle racket busted by Mumbai Police: 7 arrested, 19 high-end cars seized||The Mumbai crime branch has busted an inter-state racket by arresting seven people, who allegedly purchase high-end cars after getting them financed by reputed private banks using forged documents. The crime branch has seized a total of 19 cars including two Mercedes Benz, two Audi, one Mini Cooper and some other cars, worth about ₹7 crore from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Indore and other cities. According to police, after the purchase, the accused would then mortgage the cars and borrow money from individuals under the guise of some urgent requirements like sister’s marriage etc. The accused would later stop paying bank instalments and also would not repay their private lenders.The arrested accused are identified as Dharambeer Sharma alias Waseem Nazimuddin Shaikh alias Bhaskar Gauda, 31, Mrigesh Navidhar, 42, Sainath Ganji alias Sandeep Borate alias, 26, Pradeep Maurya, 46, Dilshaad Ansari, 44, Vijay Verma, 39 and Salam Khan, 42. Maurya is suspected to be the mastermind of the racket. He earlier worked in a loan department of HDFC Bank and knew all about the functioning of the department. Few other accused have worked with car dealers. The gang was operating for the last two years, said a crime branch officer. Senior inspector Jagdish Sail of the unit 5 along with his team arrested the accused from Mumbai, Thane and Bhiwandi area.The gang made forged documents like Aadhar Card, PAN card, bank statements and income tax returns required for obtaining a loan. They would then apply for a loan in reputed private and nationalised banks. They would rent a house where few of them would stay two to three months till the loan verification was done by banks, said crime branch officer. “Once the loan verification was completed, the accused bought the cars from dealers after sanctioning of loans. Meanwhile, other members of the gang would identify people in need of cars or could give money by mortgaging cars,” said deputy commissioner Prakash Jadhav of the crime branch.They mortgaged the cars at half the price after making an agreement, claiming that they required money for sister’s marriage or such other purpose.The accused assured the lenders that they would continue to pay the bank EMI, but after paying two to three EMIs, they would simply change their mobile numbers to ensure that neither the bank nor the lenders could trace them.A case has been registered in this regard with Kurla police station on January 13. The accused have been arrested under the charges of cheating, forgery and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code in the case. “There are more accused involved in the case and further investigation is on. It appears that a bank employee could be involved in the racket for clearing car loan and submitting false verification report for a loan” said crime branch officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/interstate-vehicle-racket-busted-by-mumbai-police-7-arrested-19-high-end-cars-seized-101611087717522.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra gram panchayat elections: Shiv Sena, BJP claim they won highest number of victories||Both the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday claimed they had won the highest number of gram panchayats (village council), as results to the elections to 12,711 gram panchayats that went to polls on January 15 were announced. At the time of going to print, the Sena claimed to have won 2,908 gram panchayats, while the BJP claimed to have bagged 5,781. While the Sena said the election results were a mandate for the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government, the BJP said the results showed people support their party. The three allies in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) – Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party – have won close to 80% of the seats. According to a senior Sena functionary, the Sena has bagged close to 3,000 gram panchayats. The BJP claimed to have bagged over 6,000 village panchayats to emerge as the number one, party-wise. Although village panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, parties claim victory on the basis of local panels formed by the candidates affiliated to them. “The MVA has dominated the gram panchayat elections, with the Shiv Sena getting 3,000 village councils. This is the best performance of the Shiv Sena in panchayat elections. We will surely consolidate this going forward with the zilla parishad and municipal body polls,” a senior functionary said. Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye, in a press conference held in Mumbai, said, “We had said that the BJP will win over 6,000 gram panchayats, which has come true.” The Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece, took a dig at BJP saying that it cannot bring in “political revolution” in the state with “workers” like ED, CBI and IT department. The dig was in reference to Enforcement Directorate notice to Sena and NCP legislators. “If this is not a mandate for the state’s Thackeray government then what is,” the editorial asked. “The Sena has prevailed in Konkan region, but there were setbacks at some places,” the editorial said, referring to loss of some gram panchayats in Sena bete-noire Narayan Rane’s village in Sindhudurg district. It added that the BJP leaders faced defeat at their home ground, including Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil who lost Loni Khurd in Ahmednagar after 20 years. BJP MP Raosaheb Danve lost at Bhokardan in Jalna. At Chondi gram panchayat, former BJP minister Ram Shinde suffered a setback as NCP MLA Rohit Pawar’s panel won seven out of nine seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gram-panchayat-elections-shiv-sena-bjp-claim-they-won-highest-number-of-victories-101611087537456.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra government mulls action against Arnab Goswami over leaked chats||Maharashtra has sought legal opinion on taking action against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami for allegedly leaking sensitive information related to the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrike on Pakistan, based on transcripts of the journalist’s WhatsApp conversation released by Mumbai Police last week, state home minister Anil Deshmukh said on Tuesday.Goswami, however, in a statement said that “it is beyond absurd to suggest that expecting India to strike back at Pakistan, after the Pulwama attack, was a crime”.Deshmukh said the state government was taking legal opinion on the possibility of action under the 1923 Official Secrets Act, a colonial-era anti-espionage statute with punishments ranging between three and 14 years, because the WhatsApp conversation related to national security.“We have taken serious note of the 500 pages of leaked WhatsApp messages between Goswami and former Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) chief Partho Dasgupta. In the messages, Arnab speaks about the Balakot airstrike two days before it happened. It is a serious threat to national security if such sensitive information was leaked to the media house,” said Deshmukh, whose Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) asked the Centre to set up a joint parliamentary committee to probe the purported chats.Deshmukh also called on the Centre to initiate strict action in the matter. “On the state level, we are checking if Maharashtra Police can initiate action. I am speaking to senior police officers and have sought legal opinion if action can be initiated under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act, 1923,” said Deshmukh.The chat transcripts were part of a 3,600-page charge sheet filed by Mumbai Police in connection with alleged manipulation of TRP (Television Rating Points) and became public last week.Deshmukh’s comments came after he met a delegation led by Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant, who demanded action against Goswami. Sawant also demanded Goswami’s immediate arrest for what he described as an act of “treason”.According to the purported chat transcripts, Goswami texted Dasgupta three days before the February 26, 2019 Balakot airstrike, saying “something big will happen” and “on Pakistan the government is confident of striking in a way that people will be elated.”Reacting to the above developments, Goswami, in a statement, said: “I am horrified that the Congress party actually thinks that any journalist in India expressing the views publicly stated by the Government is committing a crime.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-mulls-action-against-republic-tv-s-arnab-goswami-in-leaked-chats-case-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-101611087297172.html

Officials said there has been a growing awareness among the general public about the vaccine and the turnout of the beneficiaries will improve gradually. Officials said the number of enquiries on the helpline numbers of the 24 ward offices has increased after January 16, the first day of the vaccination drive, with each office recording around 50 such calls since then. Meanwhile, on Tuesday – Day-2 of the vaccination drive – the turnout of beneficiaries at the 10 vaccine centres stood below 50%. But civic officials said this was expected as there are several speculations over the new vaccines. “There is a growing eagerness among the general public about the vaccine. Most of the callers seek information on when they will be called for the vaccination,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “So we believe that with the growing awareness and trust among citizens, the turnout of the beneficiaries will increase,” she added.Meanwhile, owing to the technical glitch on CoWIN app, BMC has directed its ward offices to call 4,000 beneficiaries who will be vaccinated daily. “The names of the beneficiaries are automatically generated by the app. Then we send the list to the ward offices to call the beneficiaries. So if anyone doesn’t get the message from the app, they are being informed individually through calls,” Dr Gomare added.BMC is also providing its list of potential beneficiaries to the state-run Sir JJ Hospital, which is administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. “Most of the centres, including ours, are getting the list of in-house healthcare workers. We have over 4,000 registered healthcare workers,” said Dr Sanjay Surase, medical superintendent of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-civic-body-ward-offices-abuzz-with-covid-19-vaccine-enquiries-101611086577656.html
20-01-2021||Other||Skipped Covid-19 vaccine day because of fear? Mumbai civic body to counsel you||On Tuesday – Day 2 of the vaccination drive – the city recorded only 50% turnout of registered healthcare workers (HCWs). To encourage those HCWs who skip the vaccination process owing to fears to take the shot, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to counsel them. “Firstly, we will have to record the reason why shortlisted candidates couldn’t take the vaccine on the given date. If they refuse to take it, we will counsel them and try to answer their queries to help them regain trust in the vaccine. Anyway, the vaccination is voluntary and we can’t force anyone to take it,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. Considering the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, are among the first set of Covid-19 vaccines, there is a fear and speculation among many. Several HCWs are opting to wait and watch and then decide whether or not to take the shot, depending on the efficiency of the vaccine. “In the UK (United Kingdom) and the US (United States), the beneficiaries are being provided with many details, such as the efficiency of the vaccines and its possible side effects. But in India, there is limited transparency, especially on Covaxin. So it is expected that the initial turnout will be less,” said Anant Bhan, public health expert. However, senior doctors who had being administered the shots on the first day (January 16), believe that the vaccines are completely safe. Dr Sanjay Surase, medical superintendent of the government-run Sir JJ Hospital, who had taken Covaxin on Saturday, said, “I am a living example that the vaccine is safe. I didn’t have any kind of adverse effect.” Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospital, who took Covishield, said nutritious diet, ample hydration and rest were the key to tackle post-vaccination impact. “Some who received the vaccine, experienced nausea, vomiting, body ache, headache and mild rash. But they didn’t need any active treatment. Regular medicines helped. It’s important to understand that these symptoms are expected, and they make scientific sense. It shows that our body is responding. These symptoms should be looked at positively, and people should go ahead and take the vaccination without hesitation,” said Dr Pandit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/skipped-covid-19-vaccine-day-because-of-fear-mumbai-civic-body-to-counsel-you-101611086399679.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Speculations over Nana Patole as new Maharashtra Congress chief||Speculations were rife in the Delhi about the appointment of the Maharashtra Assembly speaker Nana Patole as new state unit chief of Maharashtra Congress, though party leadership has clarified that no official decision has yet been taken.According to the reports, Patole’s appointment to head Maharashtra Congress had got the party’s top leadership’s nod. Along with Patole, Rajya Sabha’s member of Parliament (MP) Rajiv Satava and state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar are other top contenders for the post.“There is no communication from the party leadership as yet, on this subject. I think there will be a formal discussion by the leadership with me if they decide to appoint me to head the state unit. The reports are baseless,” said Patole.Party leaders in Delhi have said that no such official announcement has been made by the party. “The process of selecting state unit chief is yet to be completed. There would be a round of formal talks between top leaders from state and central leadership, before the decision,” a party leader in Delhi said.The leader said that the Congress leadership will also have to take other two parties into confidence as Patole’s appointment will necessitate the election of a new speaker. He said in such a scenario, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party’s leadership will be formally informed about the decision. He also added that the formal announcement is expected to be done by the party in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/speculations-over-nana-patole-as-new-maharashtra-congress-chief-101611086397063.html
20-01-2021||Other||5% of healthcare staff in Mumbai not eligible for Covid-19 shot?||Day 2 of the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai ended on Tuesday, officials at the vaccine centres, who did not wish to be named, estimate that almost 5% of the healthcare workers (HCWs) are likely to be ineligible for the Covid-19 jab as they do not qualify the parameters required for the inoculation.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, said that it has no cumulative data yet to ascertain the figures. “We have to check all the medical history to ensure an HCW doesn’t develop any severe reaction due to the vaccine. In a very limited number of cases, potential beneficiaries are refused vaccine for their own good. But currently, I don’t have the accumulated data with me,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC.Dr Anilkumar Gondale, a medical officer at Shatabdi hospital, Govandi, has been diagnosed with oesophagus cancer and is undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel. On Day-1 of the vaccination (January 16), Dr Gondale was asked to visit the Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital) for immunisation. However, Dr Gondale was unable to go as he was undergoing chemotherapy at TMH on the day. On Tuesday, he went to the hospital along with his wife Dr Asha Lata to get the Covishield jab, but had to return home without getting the vaccine. “The doctors checked his medicines and his health parameters. But later the hospital asked us to get a medical certificate from TMH to get him vaccinated,” said Dr Lata.Like Dr Gondale, several HCWs have not been able to qualify for the immunisation owing to their medical history. The Union health ministry has issued some vaccine specific contraindications – symptoms or health conditions that make inoculation risky. These contraindications prohibit pregnant women, lactating mothers, patients with a history of allergic reaction to injectable therapies and pharmaceutical products as well as individuals with clotting or coagulation disorders, among others, from getting the shot. “When a beneficiary comes to a vaccination centre, we record their medical history, including all the contraindications specified by the ministry. We also check their health parameters such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation and fever,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, in-charge of the vaccine centre at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre.Doctors said there is a need to sensitise the public and advise citizens to read about the vaccines before the process. “The vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) are made of different components. For example, Covishield has ingredients such as magnesium chloride hexahydrate, ethanol, sucrose, sodium chloride, among others. If anyone has a history of allergic reaction to either of these ingredients, they should inform the health officers stationed at the centres,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital. In case anyone develops any adverse effect after the vaccine, they should call their respective ward offices. The telephone numbers are available on the official website of BMC. “We keep an observation on the beneficiaries for 48 hours. Our health officers follow up with them over the phone to check if they develop any adverse reactions,” said BMC’s immunisation officer Dr Sheela Jagtap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-of-healthcare-staff-in-mumbai-not-eligible-for-covid-19-shot-101611086157893.html
20-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to complete work at 291 flood-prone spots before monsoon||To reduce flood-like situations in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been increasing its efforts to tackle flooding spots in the city. It has completed work at 171 flood-prone areas and has set a target of completing work at 291 flood-prone spots before this monsoon. Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray also directed the civic body to ensure no flooding occurs in the city, by taking up preventive measures such as deepening and widening of existing stormwater drains.On Tuesday, Thackeray reviewed the ongoing development works in the city with senior BMC officials. The move assumes significance considering the elections for the BMC will be held next year. “There should be no flooding during monsoon. The civic body should focus on widening, deepening, as well as desilting and cleaning of the stormwater drains,” the CM said.“We have identified a total of 386 flood-prone spots that lead to waterlogging in the city. Works undertaken at 171 spots have been completed whereas works at 120 spots are in progress. We are expecting to complete work at 291 spots before monsoon,” said BMC commissioner IS Chahal during the meeting.Mumbai has been facing problems of waterlogging in many areas during monsoon. Over the past six years, the flooding spots in the city have increased from 40 in 2014, to 273 in 2019. During the municipal commissioner’s budget speech of 2014-15, the civic body had listed 40 flooding spots. However, in the budget speech of 2017-18, the number increased to 66, and in 2018-19, it was upped to 146. However, before the monsoon of 2018, BMC declared that there were 225 flooding spots, and the number further shot up to 273 after 48 new flooding spots were added to the list during the 2018 monsoon. In February 2020, the BMC budget, presented by the then civic chief Praveen Pardeshi, listed 273 waterlogging spots for the city.BMC has also taken up beautification work of pedestrian walkway, flyovers, transport islanders and bus stops. It has also identified 62 streets which will be converted into street food hubs, informed the commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-complete-work-at-291-flood-prone-spots-before-monsoon-101611086037066.html

Even if each beneficiary takes six minutes for the vaccination process, the eight-hour period is not sufficient for completing the immunisation. We also need to calculate the time taken for lunch breaks or to counsel those who are nervous and had to ensure that none of the registered HCWs are left out. Those who were not immunised on Tuesday, can complete the process the next day,” said Thane district information officer Manisha Pingale. Saturday’s turnout was higher despite technical glitches in the CoWIN app server, forcing health officers to conduct the registrations manually. On Tuesday, none of the centres faced any technical glitches and the complete process was conducted online through the CoWIN portal. Of the 1,434 beneficiaries who were vaccinated on Tuesday, none complained of any Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI), said officials. Across the district, centres under Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) witnessed a 58% turnout, while those under the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) immunised 67% of the registered HCWs. On Day 1 of the drive, KDMC centres had seen a 100% turnout. At Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation centres, 65% of the registered HCWs were vaccinated, while in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, 59% people turned up for the process. Similarly, the Bhiwandi Nizampur Municipal Corporation saw 53% turnout, while the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation had 85% beneficiaries. Thane’s rural areas immunised 65% HCWs on the second day of the vaccination.Tuesday, Day 2 of the immunisation drive, only 63.82 % healthcare workers (HCWs) in Thane district were vaccinated, as compared to around 79% beneficiaries on Day 1 (Saturday).Around 2,247 HCWs had registered for the vaccination drive for Tuesday, of which only 1,434 were immunised against Covid-19 at the 23 vaccination centres across the district. “Each centre has the capacity to vaccinate 100 people and the process is held from 9am to 5pm.

20-01-2021||Other||Day 2 of Covid-19 vaccination process in Mumbai: 800 names repeated on CoWIN||Mumbai, the CoWIN app continued to face glitches on Tuesday too, the second day of the vaccination drive. The app, which generates the time and centre the healthcare workers (HCWs) need to report at for the inoculation process, repeated the names of 800 people who were to take the jab on Day 1 (January 16). Of these 700 had to receive the Covishield shot on January 16, while the remaining names were of all the 100 people registered for Covaxin at Sir JJ Hospital. “The app is still not functioning with 100% efficiency. It has minor glitches. It will take a day or two to solve the problems,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. The civic body is aiming to immunise 4,000 HCWs each day in Mumbai across 10 centres with the two vaccines. On Saturday, 1,926 of the 4,000 HCWs who were to receive the vaccine for the first time were administered Covishield. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) rules, HCWs who did not turn up to receive the vaccine on Saturday will be administered the shot only after the first phase of the process ends. However on Tuesday, the CoWIN app listed the names of 800 HCWs who were on the registration list for the Covishield vaccine on Saturday but had not turned up. The app also failed to generate messages to those HCWs who had been chosen for the vaccine at a stipulated time. On Saturday, of the 100 healthcare workers who were enlisted, 39 were administered Covaxin. “The list we received had the same names as on Saturday. Of the 61 shortlisted people who could not get vaccinated on Saturday, 13 got inoculated today,” Dr Sankhe Lalit, in-charge of the vaccination, at Sir JJ Hospital, said, on Tuesday. The app is supposed to inform a registered HCW if their names were among those enlisted for the vaccination. However, it has not been generating these messages, prompting BMC to opt for a mechanism in which civic officials have to call each HCW and inform them of their chance to get vaccinated. “For Tuesday’s vaccination process, many of the shortlisted HCWs received calls after 11.30 pm on Monday night, while several others got messages after 6am on Tuesday morning,” said an official who is looking after the vaccine drive at BYL Nair Hospital, where 165 beneficiaries were immunised against Covid-19 on Tuesday. The technical glitches in the app led to the vaccination of mere 48% of the shortlisted candidates on day one. Thus, to iron out the loop holes, the drive was kept on hold on Sunday and Monday. A health department senior official, requesting anonymity, said, “We are speculating that the app can’t identify similar names which have been generated already. So it only takes instructions to generate automated names without identifying the old names.” Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said the central government has been informed about the problem. “The app is designed by the central government and we have intimidated them about the issue,” he said. Until the issue gets sorted, BMC has decided to follow dual intimidation methods to avoid relying only on technology. “Along with the CoWIN messages, we will individually call the registered HCWs from the ward offices,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-2-of-covid-19-vaccination-process-in-mumbai-800-names-repeated-on-cowin-101611084836424.html

Three of the 1,597 vaccinated reported giddiness following their shots, termed adverse event following immunization (AEFI), and were kept under observation for 30 minutes. None of these beneficiaries had to be hospitalised, said BMC.Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said, “Vaccination restarted in Mumbai on Tuesday morning at all 10 centres. We saw a 50% turnout of beneficiaries, as was noticed on day one as well. The drive will continue on Wednesday as well, between 9am and 5pm.”After the nation-wide drive was inaugurated on January 16, vaccination was halted on Sunday and Monday, due to technical glitches in the CoWin app — the automated system launched by the Central government to systematically administer vaccine shots across the country.While BMC intended to go ahead with its drive on Sunday, the state government informed the civic body on Saturday night to halt the drive. On day one, BMC vaccinated 1,926 health workers, from among 125,000 workers registered by the civic body for the first phase.The ten vaccination centres in Mumbai are: The four major hospitals — KEM Hospital where 307 people were vaccinated on Tuesday, BYL Nair Hospital where 165 people were vaccinated, Cooper Hospital where 229 people were vaccinated, and Sion Hospital where 110 people were vaccinated; four peripheral hospitals — Bhabha Hospital in Bandra where 90 people were vaccinated, VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz where 59 people were vaccinated, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar where 285 people were vaccinated, and Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli where 236 people were vaccinated on Tuesday; the Covid-19 facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) where 103 people were vaccinated, and the JJ hospital where 13 people were vaccinated.On Wednesday last week, Mumbai received 139,500 vaccine vials from Serum Institute of India (SII). These are being stored at a cold storage facility in Patel’s F-South ward office building, which also has the headquarters of the public health department. From here, BMC transported doses to all centres on Thursday last week, sufficient to last an entire week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-restarts-vaccination-drive-1-597-get-their-shots-101611083583279.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Delhi air ‘severe’ for the sixth time in 19 days||Delhi’s air quality slipped into the “severe” zone on Tuesday, for the sixth time since New Year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show. In comparison, Delhi had only two “ severe” air days for the month of January in 2020.Records on Tuesday showed that the overall air quality index (AQI) of the city was 404, in the ”severe” category. This was a deterioration from Monday’s AQI of 372, in the “very poor” category. On a scale of 0 to 500, a reading between 300 and 400 is considered “very poor”, while a reading between 400 and 500 is considered “severe”.This was the sixth time in the 19 days of January that the AQI has deteriorated to the “severe” level. In 2020, the month of January had only two such days.Scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said this deterioration in air quality was “unforeseen” and was caused mainly by the dense fog that enveloped the city in the early hours of Tuesday.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring and research centre, said after the fog layer lifted, wind speed picked up and dispersion of pollutants started. The impact of this ventilation would be seen on Wednesday, when the average AQI is expected to climb down to the ”very poor” zone.“The dense fog that we saw in the morning was not something that we had anticipated -- it had drifted in from neighbouring states. However, around 10am Tuesday, Delhi started getting winds of considerably high speed from the north-western side. The wind speed during the day was between 12kmph and 15kmph,” Soni said.He said the air quality will improve over the next two days but will remain in the ”very poor” zone. From January 21, a western disturbance passing over the western Himalayas will also speed up winds over Delhi and thereby bring down the pollution levels further.From Wednesday, the IMD has forecasted moderate fog over Delhi. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, was 6.9 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was 20.4 degrees Celsius, one degree above the season’s normal.Meanwhile, as the pollution levels spiked in the national capital, the pollution control boards of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh submitted inspection reports of a drive against construction and demolition (C&D) waste in Delhi-NCR, as directed by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).The CAQM had directed the CPCB, and the state pollution control boards of Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to constitute special teams and inspect construction sites in Delhi-NCR. In their respective reports of inspections, conducted between December 31 and January 15, 1,600 sites were penalised for not abiding by the C&D waste management rules.“Between December 31 and January 15, agencies constituted 174 teams, and an amount of nearly ₹51 lakh was collected as environment compensation charges from defaulting parties, besides issuing orders for stoppage of work at 27 locations,” a statement from the CPCB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-air-severe-for-the-sixth-time-in-19-days-101611081239706.html

Why are they given different time slots?” the judge remarked.During the hearing, accused Khalid Saifi, Shifa Ur-Rehman, and Shadab Ahmed claimed that the charge sheet has been uploaded in the jail computer as per the court’s orders but they have not been given access to it.“Police officials have uploaded the charge sheet in the computer but the jail authorities have not given me access to it,” said Saifi, who was produced from Mandoli jail, said.Rehman, lodged in Tihar jail, said the prison authorities did not inform him till date that the charge sheet has been uploaded and he can get read it. Suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain also claimed he has not been able to read the charge sheet as the computer system was always occupied.Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid submitted he had been given three hours some day while one hour the next day for reading the charge sheet.While JNU student Sharjeel Imam claimed he has been given two hours to read the charge sheet, former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan said she was given one hour and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha said he has been given access to the computer for half an hour only.When the judge asked the Tihar jail authorities, who were present during the virtual hearing, about the concerns raised by the accused, he failed to give any answer.Meanwhile, another city court on Tuesday directed the police to preserve the call detail records (CDRs) of 10 accused from February 20-28 last year in a north-east Delhi riots case.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar said the CDRs of the mobile phone numbers of the accused persons were required to be preserved as it would not be possible in future to call them during evidence. The court directed the investigating officer (IO) to take all the necessary steps within 10 days for CDR preservation and file a compliance report on February 1.It was hearing a plea moved by accused Shadab Alam for directions to the police for preservation of CDRs of all the accused in the case as it was available only for a year with the mobile service providers||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/15-accused-in-delhi-riots-tell-city-court-that-they-haven-t-been-given-copy-of-charge-sheet-101611081475937.html

She had been living with her grandmother and completed her Class 12 while neither her family members nor the police had ever searched her there since she went missing. In 2019, the city police had declared a reward of R50,000 for providing information to find her, said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bhisham Singh.DCP Singh said that the girl’s missing complaint was filed in 2017 at the Shalimar Bagh police station, where a case of kidnapping was registered and an investigation was initiated. “Our team was also working on the case. Investigators contacted and examined the girl’s relatives and friends. Recently, we learnt about her whereabouts in Bihar. We were planning to send a team there when it was leant that she had left for Delhi,” said Singh.On Monday, the DCP said, the team received information that the woman would reach Anand Vihar bus terminal in a bus. Accordingly, a team reached there and found her. She was unaware of her missing case and that the police had been searching her. The woman told the police that her parents died when she was a child. She along with her brother started living with her maternal uncle in Delhi.“When she was in Class 10, her maternal uncle was forcing her to marry a person of his choice. But she did not want to marry as she was interested in further studies. In May 2017, she left her maternal uncle’s house without telling anyone and reached her maternal grandmother’s house in Samastipur district, Bihar,” he said.None of the relatives visited her maternal grandmother’s house and her maternal grandmother also did not inform anyone about her stay and supported her in pursuing her studies. She completed her school education and took admission in a nursing course in Samastipur, the DCP said.The woman was handed over to the Shalimar Bagh police for further legal action.Ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/girl-who-fled-home-to-avoid-marriage-found-at-anand-vihar-isbt-101611081295900.html
20-01-2021||City||Marshals equipped with real-time monitoring software to enforce Covid rules at Delhi airport||If you’re at the Delhi airport and not maintaining social distancing, or sitting on a seat that needs to be left vacant, or not following the floor markings, then a team of marshals, armed with a device monitoring your movement, will reach you within minutes to make sure you follow the Covid norms. As many as 200 marshals have been deployed with hand-held devices and walkie-talkies to keep eye on passengers, airport authorities said.Officials from the Delhi airport said the passenger tracking system, known as XOVIS, buzzes an alarm, directing marshals to the area where social distancing is being violated. The real-time movement of a passenger is tracked with the help of more than 500 sensors that the airport operator DIAL (Delhi International Airport Limited) has got installed across Terminal 3 (T3). The facility currently is only working at T3 and, if deemed successful, will be extended to the other two terminals, officials said.An official in the know of the matter said the device was already being used in T3 to calculate time taken by passengers at check-in queues or for security checks so that such processes can be further streamlined and expedited. Around 516 sensors have been installed in T3 and 16 more are going to be installed at the terminal’s entry gates. Officials said more sensors will be installed outside the terminal, in the parking and forecourt area.CEO, DIAL, Videh Jaipuriar said on Tuesday that keeping in mind the resumption of international flights, which may happen any time now, the passenger tracking system is being used to monitor social distancing since last week.“Based on images, computed directly by the ceiling-mounted sensors, passengers, seen as a dots on the screens, are counted and tracked anonymously. This allows authorities to quickly identify crowded areas and bottlenecks. The system generates auto alerts and prompts airport officials to act swiftly as soon as it identifies a crowd at the terminal. If the situation is not brought under control within a stipulated time, it again issues alerts, this time to higher management,” Jaipuriar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/marshals-equipped-with-real-time-monitoring-software-to-enforce-covid-rules-at-delhi-airport-101611081057799.html

Police said the man, who had been living separately in Madhya Pradesh’s Chitrakoot, was arrested from the spot.According to the police, the man and the woman, who are neighbours in their native village in Chitrakoot, got married to each other six years ago. The couple had then moved to Delhi where the woman delivered a boy, who is four-year-old now.Police said, as per the woman’s complaint, she had started working at a private firm in Delhi and her husband had decided to go back to their village in Madhya Pradesh last year. “When she disapproved of his decision, he took their son and went to his village. She said soon after her husband returned home, the Covid pandemic broke out, following which a nationwide lockdown was imposed because of which she could not travel to her in-law’s house in Chitrakoot. She said after the lockdown, when she visited them, they did not allow her in and asked her to return to Delhi,” said a senior police officer, who wished not to be named.The officer said, after staying at her parent’s house in the same village for a few weeks, the woman returned to her east Delhi house. “On Sunday, her husband called her and told her that he is in Delhi and wants to see her. The woman asked him to come meet him at her home. Around 9pm, the man turned up with some chemical in his hand and as soon as the woman opened the door, he threw the acid-like chemical on her face. The woman immediately cried for help, alerting the neighbours, who rushed to help. The matter was reported to the police and she was taken to a hospital where her condition is said to be stable,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (east) Deepak Yadav said the husband was arrested from the spot and has been booked under IPC section 326A for the acid attack.ends||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-throws-acid-like-substance-at-22-year-old-s-face-arrested-101611081056344.html
20-01-2021||Other||JNU teachers allege varsity passed decisions without consulting them||New DelhiThe Jawaharlal Nehru University teachers association (JNUTA) alleged that the administration on Monday conducted a meeting of the executive council (EC) — the highest decision-making body of the university — and passed several “controversial decisions”, including a reduction in financial assistance to students to attend seminars, without any discussion. In a statement, the teachers’ body said, “JNUTA has learned as to how the vice-chancellor literally rushed through the agendas, which contained important items, without allowing some of the elected representatives a chance to speak...While the autocratic style is unethical by itself, the fact that it is being done by a vice chancellor whose term is officially coming to an end, renders it all the more troubling.”JNU vice chancellor Jagadesh Kumar’s term is ending on January 26 officially. Despite several attempts, Kumar did not respond to calls and texts.The elected teacher representative of the executive council, Atul Sood, also wrote a letter to his colleagues alleging that the microphones of all members were muted by the chat admin. “The only way for any member to speak, or even to communicate his/her desire to speak to the chair, was to raise his/her hand in front of the camera. Our hands were ignored for virtually every agenda item by the chair in both the meetings held so far.”Sood alleged that several decisions were passed without any discussion and debate. “The controversial decisions that impact the future of the students and teachers of the university include approval of utilization of corpus fund, by which the head ‘participation by faculty in seminars’ has been cut back by three-fourths, support to EWS students is reduced by two thirds, and financial assistance to students for participation in conferences is reduced across schools from 50 to 80 per cent. Since no discussion is permitted, we could not even raise the issue of how these funds can be used for providing support to needy students to improve access to online education,” he said.A senior official at the university said, “Some people were trying to disrupt the meeting and were raising topics other than the agenda items. That’s why some people were muted. Besides, all these decisions they are talking about were not on the agenda.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jnu-teachers-allege-varsity-passed-decisions-without-consulting-them-101611081056870.html
20-01-2021||City||North civic body inks MoU with Indian Oil to set up waste to energy plant in outer Delhi||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) to set up integrated waste to energy (WTE) plant in outer Delhi. Municipal officials said the plant will not only help the corporation deal with its daily garbage but also help reduce the civic body’s dependency on the Bhalswa landfill site. The total waste generated in the north corporation area is around 4,500-4,600 metric tonnes a day.Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, the facility is likely to come up at one of the municipal land available in Ranikhera near Mundka or in the Narela-Bawana area.“The MoU was signed through video conferencing in the presence of Union minister of petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. We are hoping that construction of this plant will be completed in a year’s time,” Prakash said.The waste to energy plant will help in the disposal of 2,200 metric tonnes of waste collected from City-Sadar Paharganj, Karol Bagh and Narela zones, which is currently being dumped at the Bhalswa landfill site. The garbage will be segregated as organic waste and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) to produce compressed biogas (CBG) and plastic or syngas. The existing WTE plant at Narela-Bawana disposes of 2,300 metric tonnes of waste daily as per the Solid Waste Management Rules of 2016. The role of IOCL would be to facilitate identification of technology partner, selection and appointment of the concessionaire for setting up the plant and an arrangement to purchase products manufactured at the plant which may include CBG, plastics, ethanol, electricity, synthetic methane, and hydrogen.“The concessionaire selected by IOCL will develop the plant, arrange finance for the implementation of the project, its operation and maintenance. The concessionaire would also pay the north corporation an amount per tonne of of solid waste supplied. However, the north corporation will provide suitable land, municipal solid waste and help in obtaining grants from the Centre under various schemes,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-civic-body-inks-mou-with-indian-oil-to-set-up-waste-to-energy-plant-in-outer-delhi-101611081057312.html
20-01-2021||Other||Centre, Haryana blame Delhi for Yamuna pollution||New Delhi: The Centre and Haryana government on Tuesday blamed Delhi for polluting the Yamuna even as the CPCB called the city state a habitual offender during a hearing by the Supreme Court on the falling quality of river’s water. On January 13, the Supreme Court had initiated suo moto proceedings on the issue, seeking responses from Centre, CPCB, Delhi government and states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. On that day, a petition filed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) pointed out alarming levels of ammonia in Yamuna, way beyond the permissible limits of 0.5 ppm. The DJB requested the court to direct Haryana government not to release pollutants into the water and squarely blamed the non-functional sewage treatment plants in Haryana behind the increased ammonia content in the river. Amicus curiae Meenakshi Arora suggested the court to call for a report from the Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC), which working under the National Green Tribunal (NGT) since 2018, to get a clear picture on the shortfalls in implementing steps to keep the river clean.Senior advocate Shyam Divan who represented Haryana contradicted the allegations in the DJB petition. Divan said, “We supply unpolluted water. This projection about ammonia pollution in water is not at our end. The problem is happening not in Haryana, but in Delhi.”The DJB did not comment on the allegations by Haryana and Centre.The 3-judge bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran allowed two weeks for Haryana to file its response. The statement by Haryana found concurrence from the Centre as well.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati representing the Centre as well as CPCB said, “The affidavit by CPCB is getting ready. The figures give out a stark picture. Delhi is a habitual offender as far as pollution in river Yamuna is concerned.” The court also allowed CPCB two weeks time to prepare its report as per the last order by identifying the municipalities along the stretch of the river which are yet to install sewage treatment plants (STP) or common effluent treatment plants.Amicus curiae Meenakshi Arora informed the court that since 2018, the NGT had entrusted the Yamuna Monitoring Committee to monitor pollution in the river. She requested the court to seek a report on the steps carried out so far by the two-member committee comprising former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra and former expert member of NGT, BS Sajawan.The bench said, “We direct the Yamuna Monitoring Committee to submit its report regarding recommendations made for improvement of water in Yamuna and the extent to which its recommendations were implemented.” Interestingly, this is the second time the apex court is suo moto examining pollution in river Yamuna. In July 1994, the Court took suo moto notice of a HT report “And Quiet Flows the Maili Yamuna”, monitored it for 23 years, and transferred it to NGT on April 24, 2017 to monitor further progress. The Delhi government was also represented by senior advocate Mohan Katarki. He pointed out that in the suo moto proceedings, two other states – Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh also need to be added.Ironically, on a day when the states sparred in the top court over ammonia pollution in Yamuna, Arora pointed out that as on January 18, water quality was “excellent” with ammonia level dropping to as low as 0.3 ppm. She said, “Where there is a will, there is a way. The court may observe that low level of ammonia concentration should be maintained.” On December 25 last year, ammonia concentration peaked to 13 ppm as against the permissible limit of 0.5 ppm. The DJB had stated on the last occasion that due to high ammonia content, its water treatment plants at Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla functioned at nearly 50 per cent capacity. It had even accused Haryana of supplying less water than its promised share of 450 cusecs at Wazirabad. Divan appearing for Haryana denied the charges and said, “This petition is not maintainable. We are supplying far more water than the projected share.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-haryana-blame-delhi-for-yamuna-pollution-101611081055890.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||Nearly 47,000 register to buy flats in DDA housing scheme||Close to 47,000 people have registered with the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) for its new housing scheme, which was launched on January 2, in which 1,354 flats mostly in Dwarka and Jasola have been put on sale. DDA officials say that the draw of lots for the housing scheme will be held in March.Of the 1,354 flats, 1,011 are in the High Income Group (HIG) and Middle Income Group (MIG) categories. The 254 HIG flats are located in Jasola, Vasant Kunj, Rohini and Dwarka. There are 757 two and three-bedroom MIG flats located in Dwarka, Rohini, Vasant Kunj, Jahangirpuri and Madipur.With a majority of flats in the HIG and MIG categories located in areas such as Dwarka and Jasola, which are well-connected with the public transport system, including Delhi Metro, DDA officials are expecting a good response to the scheme.Apart from the location, DDA officials said that the quality of construction, facilities at the housing complex, including two parking spots per HIG flat are some of the reasons why people are keen on applying for these flats.A senior DDA official said, “We have received 46,500 registrations of which close to 9,000 people have already submitted their applications. Till Monday, 2,325 applicants had made the payment. A majority of people make payments in the last few days. Going by the number of people who have registered, the response has been good so far.”Despite the slump in the real estate market, DDA officials are optimistic that 254 HIG flats in Jasola will find many takers. The cost of HIG flats, which are 87.9 sqm to 177.3 sqm in size, varies between ₹69.62 lakh to ₹2.14 crore. “These are spacious flats, located on Delhi-Noida border and well-connected to the rest of the city via Metro and other public transport system. There is a dual piping system as the complex has its own Sewerage Treatment Plant. The most important thing is that each flat has two parking slots. The ₹2.1 crore cost is as per the market rate,” said a senior DDA official.Spread over 64.04 sqm to 129.98 sqm, the cost of MIG flats varies between ₹40.64 lakh to ₹1.24 crore. Of the 757 flats, 711 are located in Dwarka sub-city—one of the planned residential areas developed by the DDA. There are 291 flats for the Economically Weaker Section and 52 in the lower income group category in Dwarka and Rohini. It is after nearly a decade, a senior DDA official said, that MIG flats in such large numbers have been put on sale in Dwarka.The last date to apply is February 16 and senior DDA officials said that the draw of lots for the new scheme will be held at the end of February or first week of March.DDA’s past few housing schemes did not get a good response from the public. While its housing scheme of 2014 in which close to 25,000 flats were put on sale saw close to one million applications, over 50% of the allottees had returned the flats citing small size of the flats, location related issues, etc.In the subsequent housing schemes in 2017 and 2019, the DDA had tried to re-sell these flats, but was unsuccessful.In its 2019 housing scheme, the DDA had put 18,000 flats on sale. But it had to reduce the number of flats in the scheme to 10,294, as it didn’t get the desired response. The land-owning agency had received 45,012 applications for its flats despite extending the last date to apply twice.Of the 10,294 flats, it could sell only 8,438 flats—488 HIG, 1,555 in MIG, 5,172 LIG and 1,223 EWS category flats--- of which close to 6,000 flats have been returned till December end, according to a senior official aware of the development.“This time, a majority of the flats have been put on sale for the first time. Given that these are HIG and MIG category flats, we are hopeful of getting a good response and selling all the flats,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-47-000-register-to-buy-flats-in-dda-housing-scheme-101611080875878.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||40% students attend classes on Day 2 of Delhi govt schools reopening||Around 40% government school students from classes 10 and 12 attended schools on Tuesday – the second day of reopening of capital’s schools for board exam preparations. Officials from Directorate of Education explained that this might be due to the flexibility offered to schools while planning the multiple batches of students to be called on alternate days.“General trends show that around 40% of students from classes 10 and 12 came to school on Tuesday. Schools have been asked to call students in a staggered manner and this is what the data reflects,” a senior official from the education department said.“We did not issue any circular on how many students should be called on each day. So schools have charted the plan depending upon the space they have. So the ones which are spacious could have called 100% students and the ones who did not have space can call even 50%,” the official said.Principals across several government schools in the capital reported varying percentages of attendance. This was due to various factors including cold weather, the upcoming Joint Entrance Examination scheduled in February, and correlation between the number of students in the school and the available space.For instance, Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) in Dwarka Sector 10, which has around 240 class 10 and 12 students, saw 85% of students attending classes on Tuesday.Principal Rajpal Singh explained, “RPVV schools only allow 35 students per section. So we arranged the batches accordingly because we had the space and infrastructure to allow classes while maintaining physical distancing and all Covid-19 protocols. The numbers are likely to go up in the coming days as we have been focusing more on connecting with students coming back to schools instead of just academics. These students are connected to their peers and will motivate them to join schools as well.”At Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, which has around 285 students in class 10 and 273 students in class 12, the attendance has been around 42%. “While class 10 students are still recording an attendance of 50% on both days, fewer class 12 students are coming to school, particularly from the Science stream. For class 12, we had around 43% attendance on Monday and 32% attendance on Tuesday. This is because they want to prepare for their upcoming entrance examinations,” said principal Awadhesh Kumar Jha. “We have been engaging with them and expect numbers to go up soon.”While most private schools in the capital will be reopening gradually this week, the ones which opened noted an average attendance of 50%. For instance, Mount Abu Public School in Rohini saw 65% of its class 12 attending the classes on Monday and the number went down to 55% on Tuesday. The trend was reversed in class 10, where 40% students attended the class on the first day and 55% attended classes on the second day.Principal Jyoti Arora said, “We are establishing a strong communication channel with our parents and students through regular messages, orientations, and social media platforms. They are being updated on safety measures being undertaken by the school. Students attending classes are also being asked to share their experiences with their peers who are apprehensive to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/40-students-attend-classes-on-day-2-of-delhi-govt-schools-reopening-101611080816402.html
20-01-2021||Delhi||South Delhi Municipal Corporation drops plan to hike property tax||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation will not hike property tax and halve the funds granted to the councillors for local area development as proposed in it budget, the chairman of the civic body’s highest decision making panel said on Tuesday.Gahlot also announced that SDMC will install ATMs and kiosks at toilet complexes managed by the civic body and launch yoga classes in its parks for minimal fee. He added that a quarter of the revenue from advertisements on the publicity of works done during the financial year.In the budget proposals for 2021-22, presented by SDMC additional commissioner Ramesh Verma had on December 7, it was proposed to create two categories of property for the levy of tax -- instead of the existing three -- which would have meant more tax for thousands of residential neighbourhoods.The municipal budgets are made by the commissioners and are then tabled before the standing committee for approval and then sent to the House for final nod. This would be at least 10th consecutive year when SDMC has not revised the rates of property tax -- one of the main components of its annual revenue.During a discussion on the budget, Gahlot said increasing tax on properties cannot be the only solution to enhance revenue. “There are other ways to increase revenue, so instead of hiking property tax we have decided to bring more people under the tax net of the SDMC. To boost revenue, fixed compactor transfer stations (FCTS) of SDMC will be used as advertisement sites,” he said.He added that to ensure maximum collection of revenue, SDMC has decided to start doorstep collection of property tax from the 2021-22 financial year.The SDMC also proposed to organise Yoga classes in all its parks on minimal payment. “Yoga teachers will be appointed to teach students and other participants. With the move, the corporation will not only help people to stay fit but also generate revenue,” Gahlot added.Gahlot also said that the proposal to reduce the amount of local area development (LAD) fund, given to councillors, to ₹50 lakh per ward from existing ₹1 crore per ward, will be scrapped.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader further said SDMC will charge a fine, if the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) fails to restore SDMC roads after cutting and digging for sewer and water-related works. “The corporation is also making a provision to collect restoration charges from DJB for carrying out work on municipality roads but not restoring or repairing the same,” he said.The Delhi government or the Aam Aadmi Party did not comment on the issue despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-delhi-municipal-corporation-drops-plan-to-hike-property-tax-101611080755811.html

One AEFI was reported each from East, Northwest and West Delhi districts.Adverse events are observed with most vaccines and can range from pain, mild swelling at injection site and body ache to breathlessness and hospi. Experts said AEFIs needed to be evaluated in the context of risk-and-benefits associated with immunization.In the case of coronavirus vaccines, the government has said that there can be mild AEFIs, such as pain and swelling at the site of injection, mild fever, nausea, giddiness and mild rashes. Serious AEFIs can be a severe allergic reaction, such as an anaphylactic shock, which could potentially require hospitalisation.In comparison, there were 52 adverse events reported on the first day of vaccination when 4,319 people received the jab in Delhi. Of these, one was a severe allergic reaction in a 22-year-old security guard at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He had to be admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit and was discharged a day later. He had received Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.The next day the hospital saw just eight people turning up to get the shot. This increased to 55 persons on Tuesday.Two other severe adverse event – requiring hospitalisation or hospital based observation – after Saturday’s vaccination drive was reported a day later by the hospitals. One from Northern Railway hospital and another in a security guard from Max Hospital Patparganj who fainted after receiving the shot.On Monday, two more severe adverse events reported among the total 26 such reactions after the vaccination.

While updating its internal database for the drive, the Delhi Police headquarters found that at least 26,540 personnel across all ranks, out of a total strength of 80,070, are aged above 50 years.During the process, along with the contact numbers of the personnel, their date of birth and place of posting are also fed into the system, a senior officer said.While all personnel will be covered under the second phase, those above the age of 50 years will be the first ones to get vaccinated, followed by others.Currently, there are 81 private and government hospitals, where the vaccination drive is being held for health personnel such as doctors, nurses, lab technicians, hospital sanitation staff -- identified under the first category. The drive will be expanded to an additional 600 locations across the city in the coming weeks.In the second phase, the drive will be held for the front-line workers such as police, fire safety personnel, teachers and civil defence volunteers.“The candidates for vaccination will be selected at random. The Co-WIN app will choose the police personnel based on their year of birth. These 26,546 personnel will get the vaccines first. We have also given the place of posting of each personnel so that (s)he does not have to travel far on the day of vaccination. The vaccination point nearest to a personnel would be chosen for the exercise,” said the senior police officer quoted above, who did not wish to be named.Rolling out the vaccination plan for the national capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last month that after health-care and front-line workers, the third category of people who would receive the vaccine are those above the age of 50 years as well those who below the age of 50 but with co-morbid conditions.Till date, 7,615 police personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 while 32 succumbed to the disease.“We have conducted two dry runs at different police stations to ensure that there is no hiccup when the time comes. We have noticed that it takes less than two hours for an officer to get vaccinated and return to work. The places allotted will also be the nearest to the place of the officer’s posting. In the coming days, we will keep conducting such dry runs and also raise awareness across police stations and colonies,” said a second officer, who did not wish to be named||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/onethird-of-delhi-police-force-aged-above-50-will-be-vaccinated-first-under-phase-2-101611080637056.html

Later in the afternoon, Shah held a meeting along with home secretary Ajay Bhalla, police commissioner SN Shrivastava, Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar and other police brass.While addressing the 80,000-strong Delhi Police force -- police stations had connected to the event at the police headquarters on Jai Singh Road via video conferencing — Shah said a web of 15,000 more cameras would be installed across the city for crime prevention and detention.He said the cameras would be linked with those installed by the Delhi government and those that are at railway stations. The home minister announced that the government has approved procurement of more than 4,500 new vehicles and over 1,500 motorcycles for the Delhi Police.Shah said the country had faced several challenges last year. “In Delhi, too, there were many tests. Be it the north-east Delhi riots, dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, ensuing lockdown measures, feeding the hungry, dealing with the migrant crisis or the ongoing farmer agitations, the Delhi Police has set an example by handling every situation professionally and in an exemplary manner. I want to thank every person -- from the constable to the commissioner -- from the bottom of my heart,” he said.The home minister also gave a task to every police station ahead of the 75th Independence Day anniversary celebrations that will start on August 15.Shah also felicitated some junior police officers for going beyond the call of duty during the early months of the lockdown. He stressed on more scientific evidence based policing while ensuring transparency.The home minister also said that initiatives such as “e-beat book” has strengthened Delhi Police’s functioning along with other digital platforms such as the Himmat app.The e-beat book is an app that has facial recognition software and dossiers of criminals. The details of the suspects and wanted criminals will be synchronised with the e-book and can be access on a real-time basis. This is currently being used by select police stations in Delhi.

Only 21 health care workers had turned up at the Delhi State Cancer Institutecentre for the jabs on Tuesday. “We thought that it’s very important to conduct counselling sessions to burst the prevailing myths and to provide psychological support to health care workers scheduled to get the vaccine shot in the coming days. We had a meeting with the district administration on Tuesday, where we suggested several other initiatives that can be taken to increase the number of people turning up,” she said.“We had suggested that the district administration install a selfie point at all the vaccination centres, just like voting centres. People who get the jab, can take their pictures and share them on social media. It will help develop confidence among others. We will start the installation process in the next few days at our centres,” she added.Ajeet Jain, the nodal officer at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality (RGSS) hospital, where only nine health care workers turned up for the jab on Tuesday, said, “We are planning to hold sessions where health care workers, who have already been vaccinated, will share their first-hand experiences with others. We had also suggested the district administration to conduct such sessions across hospitals to counter the existing vaccine hesitancy.”“We are also planning to distribute badges among beneficiaries with messages like “I am safe” or “I am vaccinated” so that they get noticed in public and feel proud about it,” he added.The vaccination numbers remained low at other centres with only 28 health care workers taking the shot at GTB hospital.Dr Sweta, the nodal officer at the hospital, said, “We have been conducting online sensitisation meetings regularly for the health care workers. We have also started sharing experience of beneficiaries on our WhatsApp groups so that other health care workers, who are registered, get motivated.”Meanwhile, several health care workers on Tuesday said they felt as if a “human trial” was being conducted on them. “I am not against getting a shot, but I will wait for a while. I am already a Covid-19 survivor and I do not think the vaccine is of any use to me. We can’t be a part of this human trial, without any proper data available on its success rate,” said a doctor at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/counselling-selfie-points-badges-nodal-officers-step-in-to-counter-vaccine-myths-101611080636270.html
20-01-2021||Kolkata||BJP as venomous as cobra, says Banerjee as rhetoric sharpens in Bengal||Sharp rhetoric at back-to-back rallies and sporadic violence marked the rising aggressiveness in Bengal politics on Tuesday, a day after chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced that she will contest the Nandigram seat in the coming assembly elections against her aide-turned adversary Suvendu Adhikari who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December.While addressing a Trinamool Congress (TMC) rally in Purulia district, Banerjee compared the BJP to a cobra and said, “The BJP is so venomous that it can kill you with only one bite. They are more dangerous than the Maoists.”“The BJP fooled you with false promises and won the Purulia Lok Sabha seat in 2019. But it has done nothing for the district. Now its leaders are visiting the homes of Dalits and having food brought from hotels. Have you ever seen a Dalit buying a bottle of mineral water that costs ₹100? People of Purulia will never surrender to outsiders,” said Banerjee and announced a number of welfare schemes.“There will be more hotels and markets in Purulia. Tourism will flourish. There will be so many jobs that people won’t have to leave the district for employment,” said Banerjee before raising slogans against the new citizenship law, National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.BJP was quick to react. "By comparing the BJP with a cobra the chief minister has made it clear that she is extremely worried about her imminent defeat. She is talking metaphorically about perils humans face because she cannot fight her fears," Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told HT.Also read: 9 states, UTs among better performing areas during Covid-19 vaccination driveTo counter Banerjee’s Monday rally in East Midnapore district’s Nandigram, the constituency he represented till his resignation from the assembly last month, Adhikari held a rally in the Khejuri area of Nandigram on Tuesday.Delivering a vitriolic speech, Adhikari said, “Banerjee’s rally on Monday appeared to be one held by the Hyderabad-based All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi. She sounded confused and disappointed.”Without naming any community, Adhikari said, “Can she win the Nandigram seat with those 62,000 votes? I know those villages. We will win with the support of 2,13,000 voters for whom Jai Sri Ram is the clarion call. We will not let Mamata Banerjee contest from Bhawanipore (in Kolkata) as well. She has to contest from Nandigram only and she will lose.”Naming the TMC workers who died in the violent land movement in Nandigram during the Left Front rule, Adhikari said, “Yesterday the chief minister was reading out the names from a piece of paper and still made a mistake. I know all the names by heart. The families of 30 martyrs are present here today. Banerjee talks of Nandigram but she did not include the land movement in the state’s school syllabus although the movement at Singur found its place.”The TMC-led movement against acquisition of farmland for a chemical hub at Nandigram witnessed unprecedented violence in the last years of the Left Front government and helped Banerjee come to power in 2011. A similar role was played by the prolonged agitation she led against the proposed Tata small car plant at Singur in Hooghly district.While Adhikari’s rally was on, there were clashes between TMC and BJP workers at several places in Khejuri where TMC leader and former minister Madan Mitra also held a rally.Rapid Action Force had to be deployed to disperse workers of the two parties. Several people were injured, alleged Adhikari. He said he will start an agitation on Monday if the culprits are not arrested by then. Local TMC leader Ramkrishna Das denied the charge, saying BJP workers attacked supporters of the ruling party.On Tuesday, Adhikari mentioned the chief minister’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee by the latter’s name instead of calling him bhaipo (nephew in Bengali). “The award for being the biggest extortionist will go to Abhishek Banerjee,” said the former transport minister.BJP leaders said their supporters were also attacked at Joynagar in South 24 Parganas and Purbasthali in East Burdwan district on Tuesday night. No death was however reported from anywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-more-venomous-than-cobra-says-banerjee-as-rhetoric-sharpens-in-bengal-101611079726998.html

He said that PMC is still reviewing the number of students that will be allowed in schools and how they can be accommodated. “The number of students for Class 5 to Class 8 is almost four times that for Class 9 to Class 10. And each class has at least three or more divisions. There are strict rules to follow social distancing and maintain sanitisation at school campuses,” he said. The classes for 9 to 12 reopened within PMC limits on January 4. Till date, 414 private schools out of 500 were given permission by the civic administration to reopen after an inspection by officials. A total of 453 schools were inspected by civic staff in the past one and a half weeks. As per PMC officials, with only fifty per cent students allowed in schools, the response from students has been good. The attendance on an average is around 65 per cent, according to civic officials.

When Greta Thunberg's 'How dare you' speech at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 shot her to global fame, then US President Donald Trump had said something very similar. "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" This was exactly what Trump had tweeted after Greta's speech.From then onwards, the two have often been found engaging in passive-aggressive Twitter wars. But interestingly, Greta gave back whatever Trump had told her. And Twitter remained a witness of this amusing back and forth until Donald Trump's account was permanently suspended. For example, Trump's advice to Greta to "chill" found a way to come back to him when Greta advised Trump to chill during the counting of votes of US presidential election 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/so-nice-to-see-how-greta-thunberg-reacted-to-trump-leaving-101611156389506.html

The explosion partially destroyed a building.A nearby nursing home was evacuated although no injuries have been reported among the residents.José Luis Martínez Almeida, who visited the site of the blast, told the local Telemadrid news channel that he couldn’t confirm how many people had been injured.He said that no serious damage had been initially registered in the nearby school.A loud explosion partially destroyed a small building flanked by a school and a nursing home in the center of Spain's capital on Wednesday. It was not clear what caused the blast.Images and footage shared on social media showed a tower of smoke coming out from the six-story building and rubble scattered in Toledo Street, near the city center. Emergency crews could be seen aiding several people on the ground in video aired by Spanish public broadcaster. There were no immediate reports of deaths.The school nearby was empty, according to TVE, because classes had not resumed yet following a record snowfall in the Spanish capital on Jan. 9.In a tweet, the Madrid regional emergency service said that rescue teams, firefighters and police were working in a central area of the Spanish capital following the explosion.Leire Reparaz, an area resident, told The Associated Press that she heard a loud explosion some minutes before 3 p.m. local when she was heading to her home near the Puerta de Toledo, a local landmark.“We didn’t know where the sound came from.

Taking to Twitter, the whistleblower said that he “would rather be without a state than without a voice.”I am not at all disappointed to go unpardoned by a man who has never known a love he had not paid for. But what supporters of his remain must never forgive that this simpering creature failed to pardon truth-tellers in far more desperate circumstances:https://t.co/luyYyBViYEIn August 2020, Trump had said that he was considering a pardon for Snowden, marking a reversal from his earlier stance that the whistleblower was “a spy who should be executed”. He had told a news conference at Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster, that he wasn’t “aware of the Snowden situation”, but assured that he is going to “start looking at it”.“I mean, I’ve seen people that are very conservative and very liberal, and they agree on the same issue; they agree both ways. I’m going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden,” he had said.The American whistleblower is currently at an unknown location in Russia since he was granted the right of asylum after his US passport was revoked. Last year, Snowden, author of the book titled ‘Permanent Record’, had said that the president should end the war on whistleblowers at the stroke of a pen. Speaking at 11th Hour show, Snowden had, however, clarified that he hasn’t asked for pardon for himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-disappointed-us-whistleblower-snowden-after-he-goes-unpardoned-by-trump-101611153427190.html

Recent weeks have seen a new round of saber-rattling, amid fears the Trump administration might attempt to provoke a conflict in its final days.With Biden entering the Oval Office on Thursday, hopes are high for "rapprochement". Rouhani castigated Trump, saying his four years in office "bore no fruit other than injustice and corruption and causing problems for his own people and the world."According to CNN, the Iran Nuclear Deal which was officially titled the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the landmark agreement was intended to limit Iran's civilian nuclear program, thereby preventing the country from ever developing nuclear weapons.The deal was signed by Iran and six other nations in 2015."Under the deal, the Iranian government agreed to three key things: reducing the number of centrifuges in the country by two-thirds, slashing its stockpile of enriched uranium, and capping ongoing enrichment at 3.67 per cent, an amount sufficient for energy provision but not enough to build a nuclear bomb," CNN reported.Trump pulled out from the deal in 2018, though the agreement itself continues to exist, with Iran, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Russia all still party to it.Since the US walked away, however, Iran has increased uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the deal, sparking concern that Iran could in the future pursue a nuclear weapons program.Biden has expressed a desire to return to the 2015 agreement, writing for CNN last year that Trump had "recklessly tossed away a policy that was working to keep America safe and replaced it with one that has worsened the threat.""I will offer Tehran a credible path back to diplomacy... If Iran returns to strict compliance with the nuclear deal, the United States would rejoin the agreement as a starting point for follow-on negotiations," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rouhani-hopes-joe-biden-will-return-to-obama-era-iran-nuclear-deal-101611149654295.html

Mohammed Abdalla al-Douma's residence in the provincial capital of Genena, but it underscored the heightened tensions in the restive region where a bout of tribal violence has killed around 230 people since last week.A statement from the governor said the attempted attack sought to create "instability and chaos” in the province.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, and the statement did not say who the attackers were.A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to reporters, said that the attackers opened fire on the heavily fortified residence, prompting the guards to return fire. The exchange lasted for over an hour.The Darfur 24 news outlet reported heavy gunfire in Genena's neighbourhood of Gamarek where the governor's residence is located.Earlier this week, officials from the Sudanese capital of Khartoum visited Genena to discuss the tribal clashes with the governor.The fighting between members of the Arab Rizeigat tribe and the non-Arab Massalit tribe grew out of a fistfight in Friday in a Genena camp for displaced people. Some 160 people on both sides, including women and children have been killed.The fighting also led to the displacement of at least 90,000 people, who have taken shelter in schools and government buildings and nearby villages, according to the United Nations.Authorities in West Darfur imposed a 24-hour curfew in all of the province and authorised military and police to use “all necessary force” to regain order. The central government in Khartoum also deployed security reinforcements.In South Darfur province, clashes on Monday between the Rizeigat and non-Arab Falata tribe killed around 70 people, according to Gov. Mousa Mahdi.The clashes was sparked by the killing of a shepherd in al-Twaiyel village, 85 kilometers (53 miles) south of Nyala, the provincial capital.Mahdi, who visited the village on Tuesday, vowed to bring to justice those who instigated the violence.The latest bout of Darfur violence poses a challenge to Sudan's transitional government that has been struggling to end civil war in the country's far-flung areas.It is also a major test to the government's ability to protect civilians in the war-torn region following the end of the joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force's mandate in Darfur this month.Sudan is on a fragile path to democracy after a popular uprising led the military to overthrow longtime autocratic Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, after nearly three decades of rule. A military-civilian government is now in power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-men-try-to-storm-governor-s-house-in-sudan-s-darfur-101611149632401.html

Physical distancing can be achieved by limiting class sizes, alternating shifts and limiting mixing of classes.- Stronger prevention measures might be necessary in secondary schools, and adolescents should limit their exposure risk outside school.- Teachers "are more likely to be infected" outside schools than inside.- During school closures, remote learning should be set up, regular schools services such as meals and immunisation should be maintained, while mental health support should be enhanced.- Data and 2020 findings -- Under-18s represent 29 percent of the global population but only eight percent of reported cases last year.- They are more likely to have mild or asymptomatic infection and under-20s accounted for only 0.2 percent of Covid-19 deaths.- Studies suggest that among children, under-10s are less susceptible and less infectious. Adolescents aged 16-18 transmit the virus as often as adults.- "The longer vulnerable children are out of school, the less likely they are to return," said the WHO.- School closures have a negative impact on children besides their education, including their physical and mental health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/school-closures-still-last-resort-despite-variants-who-101611148447339.html

But he wasn't on the list announced Wednesday morning.Joe Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, was sentenced in January 2020 to 22 years in federal prison for violating federal wildlife laws and for his role in a failed murder-for-hire plot targeting his chief rival, Carole Baskin, who runs a rescue sanctuary for big cats in Florida. Baskin was not harmed.Maldonado-Passage, who has maintained his innocence, was also sentenced for killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs and falsifying wildlife records. A jury convicted him in April 2019.Read | Trump pardons former top strategist Steve BannonIn his pardon application filed in September, Maldonado-Passage’s attorneys argued that he was “railroaded and betrayed” by others. Maldonado-Passage, 57, is scheduled to be released from custody in 2037, but his attorneys said in the application that “he will likely die in prison” because of health concerns.Maldonado-Passage's legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday.The blond mullet-wearing zookeeper, known for his expletive-laden rants on YouTube and a failed 2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial campaign, was prominently featured in the popular Netflix documentary “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nogo-for-joe-exotic-trump-pardon-list-omits-tiger-king-101611145336579.html

"I feel like there's too many eyeballs on this for the Chinese to not be relatively sure."Sunwoo is part of China's expanding effort to get its home-grown vaccines to key workers, including restaurant workers like him, and increasingly to the general public.China is stepping up its vaccinations as several countries including Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey begin mass vaccination programmes using its vaccines.Inconsistent data disclosures have raised concern that Chinese vaccines are not subject to the same public scrutiny as U.S. and European ones.China's domestic effort is intensifying amid a spate of new outbreaks and with a goal of vaccinating nine key groups before the travel-heavy Lunar New Year in February.China has approved three vaccines for emergency use but only one for the general public. A fourth is only being used by the military.People aged 60 and over will not get a shot until the safety is confirmed. The same goes for children. In many countries, older people, who are more vulnerable to serious illness from Covid-19, are at the front of the vaccine queue.Chinese authorities said on Wednesday 15 million vaccine doses had been delivered, enough for just over 1% of the population.In particular, the campaign has accelerated in the capital, Beijing, according to guidelines published by various authorities. One of the city's biggest districts said this week it had begun vaccinating the general population.Vaccinated delivery personnel, food workers, educators and medical workers told Reuters of a broad and intensifying effort in what could be the world's largest COVID-19 vaccine campaign."If I didn't get the vaccine, I couldn't work. The reality is simple", said a Beijing food delivery worker who was among thousands of couriers vaccinated early this month."No one will refuse it," said the worker, declining to give his name because he is not authorised by his company to discuss the vaccinations.HOLIDAY RUSHBeijing has not announced phases for the campaign beyond the focus on key workers.Guidelines vary, though most large cities have begun to invite people from specific groups including medical workers, couriers, customs staff and cleaners.The city of Beijing has set the tightest deadlines, with plans to vaccinate all key workers before the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 12.Authorities and those who have received vaccines say cities are not adhering strictly to the designated groups, which allows municipalities and districts to set their own priorities.Beijing's Chaoyang district said this week it had vaccinated about 164,000 people outside the key groups.An official from Shanghai's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday that the city had opened vaccine booking for people beyond key groups, including those who plan to go abroad. Just under 50% of Shanghai's 1.77 million designated key workers had volunteered to get a shot."If the country has rolled out this vaccine for everyone, there must be some degree of safety that's guaranteed," said Yi Hongjun, a software researcher at automaker SAIC, who got an initial dose of a vaccine made by Sinovac on Tuesday.Authorities in several major cities including Beijing and Shanghai say supplies are ample.A Shanghai school administrator, who declined to be identified, said in December staff were given 48 hours to decide if they would take a vaccine made by Sinopharm, which has yet to pass Phase III trials but has been approved in China for emergency use.An SAIC worker surnamed Huang who received the vaccine in Shanghai on Tuesday said the process was smooth."Once we're vaccinated, we can have peace of mind," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-steps-up-covid-19-vaccine-drive-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-101611144350258.html

Harris’ late mother was also born in India, before moving to the US to study at the University of California. She married a Jamaican man, and they named their daughter Kamala, a Sanskrit word for “lotus flower.”Ahead of the inauguration, special prayers for her success were held at the town temple during which the idol of Hindu deity Ayyanar, a form of Lord Shiva, was washed with milk and decked with flowers by the priest.Ahead of the US elections in November, villagers in Thulasendrapuram also pulled together a ceremony at the temple to wish Harris good luck. After her win, they set off firecrackers and distributed sweets and flowers as a religious offering.Posters of Harris from the November celebrations still adorn walls in the village and many hope she ascends to the presidency in 2024. President-elect Joe Biden has skirted questions about whether he will seek reelection or retire.“For the next four years, if she supports India, she will be the president,” said G Manikandan, who has followed Harris politically and whose shop proudly displays a wall calendar with pictures of Biden and Harris.On Tuesday, an organization that promotes vegetarianism sent food packets for the village children as gifts to celebrate Harris’ success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-village-cheers-for-harris-before-swearing-in-as-us-vp-101611137873616.html

20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden to issue executive orders reversing Donald Trump's policies on climate, Covid-19 on first day of presidency||In his first hours as president, Joe Biden will aim to strike at the heart of President Donald Trump’s policy legacy, signing a series of executive actions that reverse his predecessor’s orders on immigration, climate change and handling of the pandemic.Biden on Wednesday will end construction on Trump’s border wall, end the ban on travel from some Muslim-majority countries, rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and the World Health Organization, and revoke the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, aides said Tuesday. The new president will sign the orders almost immediately after taking the oath of office at the Capitol, pivoting quickly from his pared-down inauguration ceremony to enacting his agenda.The 15 executive actions are an attempt to essentially rewind the last four years of federal policies with striking speed. Only two recent presidents signed executive actions on their first day in office — and each signed just one. But Biden, facing the debilitating coronavirus pandemic, is intent on demonstrating a sense of urgency and competence that he argues has been missing under his predecessor.“I think the most important thing to say is that tomorrow starts a new day,” said Jeff Zients, Biden's choice to lead a new White House office that will coordinate the federal government's revamped response to the pandemic.Follow our live updates on the US presidential inaugurationThe orders reach well beyond the pandemic. Biden intends to order a review of all Trump regulations and executive actions that are deemed damaging to the environment or public health. He will order federal agencies to prioritize racial equity and review policies that reenforce systemic racism. He will revoke a Trump order that sought to exclude noncitizens from the census, and will order federal employees to take an ethics pledge that commits them to upholding the independence of the Justice Department.Susan Rice, Biden's incoming domestic policy adviser, said the new president would also revoke the just-issued report of Trump’s “1776 Commission” to promote "patriotic education."These actions will be followed by dozens more in the next 10 days, aides said, as Biden looks to redirect the country without having to go through a Senate that Democrats control by the narrowest margin.Notably, the opening actions did not include immediate steps to rejoin the Iran nuclear accord, which Trump abandoned and Biden has pledged to reimplement. Jen Psaki, the incoming White House press secretary, said that while they were not included in Biden’s Day One orders, the new president will in the coming days revoke the Pentagon’s ban on military service by transgender Americans as well as the so-called Mexico City policy, which bans US funding for international organizations that perform or refer women for abortion services.Also read: 'If she supports India, she will be president'Psaki said the actions to be taken Wednesday were focused on providing “immediate relief” to Americans.In another effort to signal a return to pre-Trump times, Psaki said she would hold a news briefing late Wednesday in a symbol of the administration’s commitment to transparency. Trump's White House had all but abandoned the practice of briefing reporters daily.Biden will sign the actions during his first visit to the Oval Office in four years. Since then, presidential order actions were often marked by clumsy announcements and confusion. In their first days in office, Trump’s team was forced to rewrite executive orders by court order and aides took days to figure out how to use the White House intercom to alert press about events. The repeatedly canceled plans to hype new building programs — dubbed “Infrastructure week” — became a national punchline. Biden aides, by contrast, are aiming to demonstrate they are up for the job right out of the gate.Biden senior aides, led by deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed and campaign policy chief Stef Feldman, began plotting out the executive action plans in November, just days after Biden won the presidency and drafting began in December. The final documents were reviewed by career staff at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in recent weeks before Biden’s swearing-in to ensure they would pass legal muster.Also read: Washington mayor asks for tightened securityBiden’s team was set begin assuming the reins of power even before the Marine Band finished its rendition of “Hail to the Chief” after the new president takes the oath of office.Aides were due to begin entering the White House complex at the stroke of noon — when Biden officially assumes the office — to begin overseeing national security roles. The urgency was hasten by concerns about security around the Inauguration after the US Capitol insurrection.Covid-19 restrictions, along with tight security surrounding the Inauguration were severely curtailing the number of aides in Biden’s West Wing. Aides, one official said, were told to pack snacks to eat in their offices because of pandemic protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-reverse-donald-trump-s-policies-on-climate-covid-19-on-first-day-101611137213623.html

The president also changed his legal residence from Trump Tower in New York City to Mar-a-Lago in September 2019.The 74-year-old longtime New Yorker purchased the mansion in 1985 for USD 10 million and turned it into a private club, which has become his winter home during the last four years.The 20-acre estate inspired by a Moorish-Mediterranean structure, now with 128 rooms, was built in 1927 by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.The massive property features direct views of the Atlantic Ocean and is open to people who purchase a membership at the club. The property includes a 20,000-square-foot ballroom, five clay tennis courts and a waterfront pool.Trump holds private quarters on the property in a separate, closed-off area. It has been labelled the second-largest mansion in the sunshine state of Florida.Forbes estimated the value of the estate at around USD 160 million following extensive renovations and the exclusivity of the location. However, according to US media reports, neighbours are questioning whether it can become his permanent home.Nearby Palm Beach residents recently sent a letter to town leaders, citing a 1993 agreement they say prohibits anyone from living permanently on the property because it is a social club, cbsnews.com reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-make-mar-a-lago-estate-permanent-home-after-leaving-white-house-101611137139863.html

The study was published on preprint server BioRxiv prior to peer review.Unlike the earlier study, which focused on one crucial mutation, the new research tested all 10 mutations located on the virus’s spike protein, which helps it bind to cells in the host.Antibodies in the blood of 16 volunteers in a previous German trial of the vaccine were just as effective against the lab-created mutant strain as they were against the original virus. The result “makes it very unlikely that the U.K. variant viruses will escape” protection from the vaccine, wrote the research team, led by BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin.“Unlike for influenza vaccines, the reduction in neutralization that might indicate the need for a strain change has not been established for Covid-19 vaccines,” the team wrote. Still, they added, it’s “prudent” to be prepared to adapt the vaccine if needed in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-shot-likely-to-defeat-mutant-new-study-shows-101611136778697.html

Anything that’s flagged is brought to the attention of the command,” Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman told reporters at a briefing. “We’re not even asking what the flag was, we’re just removing them.”The two National Guard troops with links to extremism were flagged to the military by law enforcement and an anonymous tip about inappropriate text messages and comments. Hoffman declined to characterize the communications or say if they represented threats against President-elect Joe Biden or other dignitaries.The other 10 were flagged by law enforcement as they underwent background checks and their removal from service doesn’t necessarily mean the troops were suspected of committing a crime or otherwise unfit for future duty, Hoffman said.He declined to specify what caught the attention of law enforcement in those cases.The soldiers were among 25,000 National Guard members sent to secure Wednesday’s inauguration following a Jan. 6 riot at the US Capitol and fears of more violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-people-removed-from-us-capitol-duty-after-background-checks-pentagon-101611133741255.html

"There's no one factor as to why we have such a horrendous and tragic death rate.""I don't think this is the time to talk about mismanagement," Patel said when asked by the BBC if the government had mismanaged the crisis.When pressed on the international comparisons of death tolls, Patel told LBC the data was "not comparable".The British government reported a record rise in deaths on Tuesday with 1,610 people dying within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test.Currently 37,946 people are in hospital with Covid, 3,916 of them on ventilation. Currently the United Kingdom has vaccinated 4.27 million people with a first dose of the vaccine, among the best in the world per head of population.The Covid-19 death toll and the level of hospital admissions means it is far too early to speculate about when the lockdown may be lifted or eased, Patel said."We are still in a perilous situation," Home Secretary Priti Patel told Sky.

20-01-2021||World||Trump visited only one DC restaurant in last 4 years, that too his own||Donald Trump who leaves his presidency has never in his four-year term in office attempted to be part of the local community. A case in point is that unlike his predecessors, Trump has visited only one restaurant - the one in his own Pennsylvania Avenue hotel.While former President Barack Obama was known for hitting all the trendy hotspots for date nights, Trump, who is known for his love of fast food, has never stepped into a DC fast-food joint. He, however, had once sent a former bodyguard to make McDonald's runs and even catered White House events with Burger King and Domino's.According to a report in Washingtonian, Trump is a creature of habit as when he does venture out for a meal at the Trump hotel's steakhouse, BLT Prime, he pretty much always orders the same thing: shrimp cocktail, fries and well-done steak.He did this because here he knows he will get exactly the food he wants in the way that he wants, along with fans cheering him on.In 2016, he had told attorneys that "there aren't that many" great restaurants in Washington as part of a deposition in a lawsuit with celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian. In 2017 he said in an interview on the Larry O'Connor Show, "In Washington, you do have some great restaurants, and I'm going to start going to them," Washingtonian said.He said that he would start visiting other restaurants too."I was accused the other day. Well, when I leave the White House, which is seldom, I always go to my hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, and they say, 'He should go to other places.' And I never thought of it. And I'm going to start doing that. I'm going to go around."In 2019, Trump said that he along with First Lady Melania Trump would stop by at the Michelin-starred Inn at Little Washington while awarding the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal to Chief Patrick O'Connell. However, he is yet to step into the restaurant.The magazine Washingtonian opined that "there aren't a lot of places around DC where he would have been welcomed"."If he wasn't outright asked to leave--like former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at Virginia's Red Hen--he'd likely have been met with booing and cursing from other diners. And any restaurant that hosted him--no matter its bipartisan stance--would have no doubt faced backlash by mere association," the magazine opined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-visited-only-one-dc-restaurant-in-last-4-years-that-too-his-own-101611130898670.html

20-01-2021||World||Roaring stocks, weaker dollar, tons of debt: Trump's parting gift to Joe Biden||When he assumes office on Wednesday, President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a stock market near all-time highs, along with a gaping budget deficit, a weakening dollar, elevated economic uncertainty and a Federal Reserve that may have less ammunition to fight the next crisis.Here is a look at what has changed in markets over the last four years and what investors have to look forward to over Biden’s term.1. MARKETS UNDER TRUMPThe S&P 500 is up about 68% since President Donald Trump took office. Its 73% surge since late March has been aided by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, as well as expectations that a Covid-19 vaccine will spur economic reopening.Ultra-low Treasury yields - which plunged after the Fed cut interest rates to near-zero - have also increased the allure of stocks.2. 100 DAYSIf history is any guide, the stock market should give Biden a warm welcome. The S&P 500 has risen in the first 100 calendar days in eight of the last 10 presidential terms.Still, Biden’s first 100 days may be more fraught than those of his predecessors: while he needs to stimulate the economy quickly, the slender Democratic majority in Congress means the final size and timing of a proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package remain uncertain.3. DOES THE BUCK STOP HERE?Biden is also inheriting a dollar that’s fallen 12% from last year's highs. A weaker dollar aids exporters by boosting the competitiveness of US. products abroad and increases the appeal of US stocks by making them more affordable to foreign buyers.Rallying US yields have recently lifted the dollar off its lows, and a more sustained move in the greenback risks sparking an unwind of the market’s near-record bearish dollar position and sparking more gains in the currency.Regardless of where the dollar goes, the incoming administration has signaled it will be less likely to comment on the currency’s fluctuations than Trump, who periodically railed against a strong dollar.4. MORE DEBTThe national debt ballooned by almost 40% under Trump to nearly $28 trillion, fueled by the passage of tax cuts in 2017 and a flood of spending to counter the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic last year.Some investors worry the country's exceedingly cloudy fiscal picture risks tarnishing the appeal of US government debt over the long term, an outcome that may eventually weigh on the US dollar's attractiveness as a reserve currency.In July, Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on the United States’ triple-A rating to negative from stable, citing eroding credit strength.The US national debt is likely to continue growing under Biden. Janet Yellen, his nominee for Treasury secretary, urged lawmakers on Tuesday to "act big" on the next coronavirus relief package, adding that the benefits outweigh the costs of a higher debt burden.5. BLOATED BALANCE SHEETBiden will inherit a Federal Reserve balance sheet that is bigger than ever, thanks to ramped-up spending in the wake of the pandemic.Some worry that interest rates already at rock-bottom levels and asset purchases currently at $120 billion a month may give the central bank less scope to maneuver if the economy worsens or a fresh crisis hits, putting an additional focus on fiscal policy.The Fed’s balance sheet is expected to grow to $9.1 trillion by the end of 2021, a December Reuters poll showed.6. UNCERTAIN TIMESThe coronavirus pandemic ratcheted up economic concerns during the last year of Trump's term. Earlier years of his presidency were marked by flaring trade frictions between the United States and China that rocked asset prices.Policy-related economic uncertainty as measured by Economic Policy Uncertainty, based on mentions of economic uncertainty in news articles, is currently higher than it was following 9/11 or the Great Financial Crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roaring-stocks-weaker-dollar-tons-of-debt-trump-s-parting-gift-to-joe-biden-101611125423172.html
20-01-2021||World||US-Canada relations on slippery ground over Keystone XL oil pipeline issue||Canada and the United States may be headed for a clash over the contentious Keystone XL pipeline in the early days of the Joe Biden administration.The new administration has already indicated that the project will be cancelled and that announcement could be made soon after Biden assumes charge as US president.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that Ottawa will attempt to persuade Washington, DC to allow the oil pipeline to proceed. Keystone XL was approved by the Donald Trump administration, after it had originally been denied permission by his predecessor Barack Obama on environmental grounds.During a media interaction on the eve of Biden’s swearing-in, Trudeau said, “We’ve had a clear and consistent position supporting this project for years. Our government is making sure that Canada’s views are heard and considered by the incoming administration at the highest levels.” First envisaged in 2008, construction for the project has begun and the proposed 2,700km pipeline is expected to carry nearly 80,000 barrels of oil from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas via multiple midwestern American states.Given how critical the project is to Alberta, the premier of the province, Jason Kenney, has already warned of legal action in case the Biden administration carries out its threat of cancelling the project.Trudeau spoke to Kenney on Tuesday night and a readout issued by the PMO said that “Canada has made the case for the project, including recently to President-elect Biden”, adding that Canada’s ambassador to the US “and others in government have also been speaking with high-level officials in the incoming administration”.According to a statement cited by CBC News, Canada’s natural resources minister Seamus O’Regan came out strongly in favour of the pipeline. He said, “Canadian oil is produced under strong environmental and climate policy frameworks, and this project will not only strengthen the vital Canada-US energy relationship, but create thousands of good jobs for workers on both sides of the border.”In the readout from the Canadian PMO, Trudeau said he “looked forward to working with the incoming administration of president-elect Biden to fight climate change, protect jobs and grow the economy”. Trudeau was the first to congratulate Biden over phone after the results of the US presidential elections became clear. The Canadian PM had raised the Keystone pipeline matter during that conversation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscanada-relations-on-slippery-ground-over-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline-issue-101611126364137.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden calls for national healing at memorial service for Covid-19 victims||US President-elect Joe Biden called for national healing at a solemn memorial service at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool for those who have died from Covid-19.“To heal, we must remember. And it is hard sometimes to remember, but that’s how we heal,” Biden said. “It is important to do that as a nation.”At noon on Wednesday, Biden will be inaugurated at the Capitol, at the other end of the National Mall, as the 46th president of the United States, with Kamala Harris as his vice-president, a historic figure as the first woman, African-American, Indian-American and Asian-American elected to the high office.“Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all who we have lost,” Biden said.The US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic crossed 400,000 on Tuesday, marking yet another grim milestone, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Total number of infections was more than 24 million.The Biden inauguration committee, which organised the memorial, installed 400 lights around the poll, each representing 1,000 Covid-19 deaths. They were lit as Biden and Harris spoke.Iconic buildings across the country, such as the Empire State Building in New York and the Space Needle in Seattle, were illuminated to mark the occasion.At a brief event in Wilmington, Delaware, before heading to Washington, DC, the president-elect got emotional while speaking about his journey so far and his eldest son Beau Biden, who died from brain cancer in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-for-national-healing-at-memorial-service-for-covid-19-victims-101611125523851.html
20-01-2021||World||Outgoing US President Donald Trump pardons 73 people: White House||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday pardoned 73 people, including his former aide Steve Bannon and other allies, just hours before he was due to leave office."President Donald J. Trump granted pardons to 73 individuals and commuted the sentences of an additional 70 individuals," the White House said in a statement.The president and his children were not on the list.Bannon was granted clemency having been charged with defrauding people over funds raised to build the Mexico border wall that was a flagship Trump policy."Mr. Bannon has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen," the statement added.US media earlier reported that the president made his last-minute decision after speaking to Bannon by phone.Former Trump fund-raiser Elliott Broidy was similarly pardoned, after pleading guilty last year to conspiring to violate foreign lobbying laws.Rapper Lil Wayne, who last month pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon and faced 10 years in jail, also made the list.President-elect Joe Biden, who beat Trump in an election last year, was due to be sworn in as his successor later Wednesday.Before that, Trump will fly to his home in Florida, skipping the inauguration ceremony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outgoing-us-president-donald-trump-pardons-73-people-white-house-101611123939536.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden's return to Paris Agreement just a first step on US climate action||As Joe Biden leads the United States back into the Paris Agreement on climate change, after taking office Wednesday, diplomats and green groups will breathe a collective sigh of relief - before urging him to step up cuts to U.S. emissions.Soon after his inauguration, Biden is expected to issue an executive order to begin rejoining the 2015 climate pact, reversing a decision by climate-change skeptic Donald Trump.The process to re-enter the international accord takes a month, meaning the United States will only officially have been out of the deal for a short time, since exiting in November.But Trump's hostility to the U.N. climate process and his support for polluting fossil fuels have left Biden's team a lot of catching up to do at home and abroad, policy analysts said."Rejoining the Paris Agreement is really the floor, not the ceiling, for the Biden administration on climate," said Jennifer Morgan, CEO of Greenpeace International.If the U.S. government then moves to help drum up more global ambition to curb rising temperatures, it must be done in a spirit of "partnership and humility, not coming back in and telling everyone what they should be doing", Morgan said.Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), said there would be a number of opportunities in 2021 for Biden to help advance "a progressive climate agenda" on the world stage.Those include the G7 and G20 leaders' summits, and the U.N. climate talks in November.Biden and his international climate envoy John Kerry should also pursue meetings with other major emitters - as Biden has indicated he will do - "to solidify ways to collectively tackle the climate crisis head-on", she said in a statement.2030 TARGETOne key task for Washington, after re-entering the Paris climate deal, will be to set a U.S. emissions reduction target for 2030 and produce a stronger national climate action plan.Signatories to the Paris accord were meant to submit updated plans to cut emissions and adapt to worsening extreme weather and rising seas by the end of 2020 - but due to delays caused by the pandemic only about 70 have done so.The rest of the plans are expected to be delivered by the time of the postponed COP26 U.N. climate conference, set to be hosted by Britain in November.The good news for Biden is that support for climate action is growing among U.S. voters.A December survey of nearly 950 registered voters across the political spectrum found 75% supported U.S. participation in the Paris accord.As well, 64% said the United States should reduce planet-heating emissions regardless of what others countries do, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found.Last week, the Rhodium Group of researchers and analysts said U.S. greenhouse gas emissions fell 10.3% in 2020, the largest drop in the post-World War II era, as coronavirus crippled the economy.But it warned the dip was not a clear indication that the United States could meet its more ambitious pledge under the Paris Agreement, to cut emissions 28% below 2005 levels by 2025.Biden has said he plans to set the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, something a growing number of major economies are now promising to do.But he will first need to announce an emissions-cutting target for 2030 - one experts say must be in the order of 50% below 2005 levels to give the world a chance of holding global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower Paris goal.Youth activists and some green groups have called for even more ambitious targets, saying the United States should aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 if it is to do its "fair share" to fight climate change."The United States is the second-largest emitter of carbon emissions from fossil fuels annually and the largest source of cumulative emissions to date. Yet for decades it has not done its fair share to rein in emissions," said Cleetus of the UCS.CLIMATE FINANCEDipti Bhatnagar, coordinator of climate justice and energy programs for Friends of the Earth International, said high-carbon lifestyles in the United States had contributed to "untold suffering" for families in the developing world."Droughts are destroying crops, cyclones are leveling homes, and whole nations are literally disappearing," the Mozambican said."The livelihoods and dignity of billions of people who didn't create the climate crisis require the Biden administration to take immediate and far-reaching climate action, driven by justice, equity and science.”Climate finance experts want Biden's government to make good on a promise to the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing nations adopt clean energy and adapt to a warmer world.Trump refused to deliver $2 billion of an earlier pledge to the fund - and campaigners are now hoping to see this money come through, as well as increased finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and build their resilience to climate impacts.Greenpeace's Morgan said the United States should commit in its new climate action plan not to back further development of dirty energy - coal, oil or gas - both on its own territory and overseas."Fossil fuels are like weapons of mass destruction - they need to be kept in the ground," she said.

20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden’s global leadership ambitions 'complicated' by US Capitol riot||When followers of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol two weeks ago, countries with questionable democratic track records seemed to relish the chance to denounce the United States."Yesterday’s events showed that the U.S. has no moral right to punish another nation under the guise of upholding democracy," tweeted Zimbabwe’s president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, calling for Washington to end "painful" economic sanctions it imposed over human rights and rule of law concerns.While unlikely to convince the world, the barbs from Harare - and other capitals antagonistic to Washington - underscore the fragile state of America’s global reputation as Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Wednesday.Trump, who for months made false claims that the Nov. 3 election was stolen from him, encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol while lawmakers were certifying Biden's victory. A riot led to the evacuation of the building and five deaths."Let us not be naive that a lot of damage has been done to the American image for the last four years, and more specifically, what happened," on Jan. 6, said David O’Sullivan, former European Union ambassador to Washington.Biden, vice president under Barack Obama and a former senator with decades of foreign policy experience, has pledged to repair tattered strategic alliances, while also attempting to re-establish U.S leadership on climate change and take a more prominent role on the global response to the coronavirus.But veteran diplomats and foreign policy experts said a sharply divided American society - one at risk of political violence - will make Biden’s job harder and distract from the hard work of restoring U.S. leadership.Biden’s transition team believes the Capitol violence underscores one of his main messages before taking office: that U.S. domestic and foreign policy cannot be fully separated.'DOUBLE STANDARDS'Biden has said he will recommit the United States to NATO and assemble leaders of democracies within his first year to counter rising authoritarianism around the world.But U.S. diplomats are likely to face cries of hypocrisy when they call out governments for failing to uphold democratic norms."It’s going to weaken the American word," said Gerard Araud, a former ambassador for France in Washington. "Every time they will try to lecture the world ... there will be people who are going to try to drag them down to the reality. It will be used by the bad guys."After the scenes at the Capitol, the Chinese Communist Party-run Global Times newspaper lashed out at what it described as “double standards” among U.S. politicians who praised pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.The Biden transition team has stressed that his administration will work with allies to stand up for universal values and principles and democratic rights.Tony Blinken, a Biden confidant whom he nominated to become secretary of state, told Congress on Tuesday the United States needed both “humility and confidence” in dealing with the world.“Humility because we have a great deal of work to do at home to enhance our standing abroad. And humility because most of the world’s problems are not about us, even as they affect us,” Blinken said in prepared testimony. "Not one of the big challenges we face can be met by one country acting alone – even one as powerful as the U.S."'LANDMINES'Biden foreign policy officials will be inheriting several immediate challenges thanks to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who laid "landmines" on his way out that could box Biden in, said Heather Conley, a former State Department official at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.For instance, the Trump administration has been piling on sanctions related to Iran and Pompeo on Jan. 10 designated Yemen’s Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization, moves that seemed designed to make Biden’s goal of reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran more difficult.Similarly on China, Pompeo has unleashed one sanctions package after another and lifted restrictions on U.S. contacts with Taiwan, an apparent attempt to lock in a tough approach to China before Biden's inauguration. On his last full day in office, Pompeo determined that China's repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang amounted to "genocide", delivering a massive parting shot to Beijing.Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that he agreed with Pompeo's assessment.As long as the U.S. domestic political discourse remains bitterly divided, any attempts to reverse Trump administration policies will be viewed with caution.Washington's allies increasingly see U.S. foreign policy coming in two or four-year cycles contingent on domestic politics, said Brian Katulis, who works on national security at the Center for American Progress."That won't be easily fixed as long as Republicans and Democrats continue to tear each other apart over national security questions like China and Iran," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-global-leadership-ambitions-complicated-by-us-capitol-riot-101611123130539.html
20-01-2021||World||'When will I get Covid-19 vaccine? Are there side effects?' Top UNICEF official answers big questions||As several nations across the world have begun the roll-out of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people have various queries regarding the distribution and side effects of the dose, the answers for which they have been looking on the internet.Dr Robin Nandy, the principal advisor and chief of immunisation at UNICEF, has answered the most pressing questions concerning the vaccination programmes. Here are the excerpts from his online session:Who should get the Covid-19 vaccine first and why?The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other technical agencies are recommending prioritisation of the limited Covid-19 vaccine for healthcare workers and the high risk groups, which include the elderly and those with comorbidities, as the primary aim is keep the health workers and the health system functioning and to prevent severe disease and death. As more vaccines become available, we'll follow a tiered system which will extend vaccination to other population subgroups like essential non-health workers and gradually to other members of the community.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereIt's really important that those who need the vaccine get it first and we must wait for our turn, and it will come.Is the Covid-19 vaccine safe?For vaccines, we have robust criteria to determine whether a vaccine is ready for widespread use. There are protocols within the pharmaceutical industry overseen by the WHO and various independent vaccine safety bodies looking at data. These form the opinion of regulatory authorities like the FDA in the cases of the United States, so all sorts of data are considered before making a determination whether a vaccine is safe for use.A post shared by Priyanka (@priyanka_pruthi)For a new vaccine, some of the protocols remain the same. The aim of clinical trials is to look at the efficacy of the vaccine, i.e, whether it works, and the safety of the vaccine to ensure that it doesn’t do any harm to the recipient.Safety monitoring does not end when a vaccine is licensed for emergency use or licensed for use more broadly. Safety surveillance of vaccines continues right through the course of vaccine implementation.Are there side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine?Vaccines, like any other biological product, like drugs and so on, all have potential side effects. However, in the case of Covid-19 vaccines, through the course of clinical trials we have not seen high frequency of any dangerous side effects. We will continue to monitor side effects.Also Read: Scientists debate naming of new Covid-19 variants, want to avoid stigmaThe common side effects are rather temporary. They include swelling at the site of injection, a little bit of pain, things that can be controlled with paracetamol or Tylenol. In some cases, people experience a little bit of fatigue and weakness for a couple of days.Will children be administered the Covid-19 vaccine?In the initial vaccine trials, very few trials included children so we do not have efficacy and safety data on children. That's going to emerge as we roll out the vaccine among the elerderly and health workers. Trials will continue to assess the impact of the vaccine.Can pregnant women, or those who are breastfeeding get the vaccine?At this stage, we don't see any warning signs to prevent vaccine use among women who are breastfeeding because some of the advanced vaccine candidates are not live viral vaccines, they use different platforms. They're the mRNA vaccine, so no live substance. So we don't see too many contraindications to use with breastfeeding women. In terms of pregnancy, we don't expect a negative impact but this is an area we’re still learning. It also depends on the level of risk. If they're a frontline health worker with huge exposure then you've got to trade off and risk the benefit. But if you are not at high risk of infection, it changes your decision making.Dr Robin Nandy concluded by saying that the fact that there is a vaccine must not make people complacent. “We need to continue to do everything we can to prevent Covid-19 transmission. We need to continue to use masks, practise physical distancing, and need to keep washing our hands.The vaccine goes along with all these measures and not at the cost of any of these others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-will-i-get-covid-19-vaccine-are-there-side-effects-top-unicef-official-answers-big-questions-101611119860937.html
20-01-2021||World||UK coronavirus strain detected in at least 60 countries: WHO||The UK coronavirus strain has been detected in at least 60 countries, the World Health Organization said Wednesday, 10 more than a week ago.With the global death toll now well past two million, and new variants of the virus causing deep concern, countries across the world are grappling with how to slow infections until vaccines become widely available.The South African strain, which like the UK one is believed to be more infectious, has now been reported in 23 countries and territories, the WHO also announced in its weekly update.It added that the number of new deaths climbed to a record high of 93,000 over the previous seven days, with 4.7 million new cases reported over the same period.The arrival of mass vaccination campaigns in the US and Europe had brought hope that the end of the pandemic was in sight; the European Union said Tuesday it was aiming to inoculate 70 percent of its adult population before the end of August.But many EU countries -- and other nations including India and Russia -- have struggled to get their inoculation programmes off the ground.The United States remains home to the world's worst outbreak in overall numbers, and US President-elect Joe Biden made clear he would be taking no chances following his inauguration on Wednesday.Recent days have also seen a renewed focus on the initial outbreak a year ago, with China defending its handling of the virus on Tuesday after independent experts criticised the speed of its response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-strain-detected-in-at-least-60-countries-who-101611120060386.html
20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump wishes bitter rival Joe Biden ‘luck’||Outgoing US President Donald Trump on Tuesday wished the incoming administration of Joe Biden “luck” and said he would be praying for its success.But Trump could still not bring himself around to name President Biden and congratulate him directly.Trump and first lady Melania Trump will leave the White House on Wednesday morning for their Florida resort, with a stopover for a farewell at a military base outside Washington, DC. They are not staying to either to attend Biden’s inauguration or receive him and his wife at the White House as has been a transfer-of-power ritual.“This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous,” Trump said in a recorded video farewell address. “We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck - a very important word.”The outgoing president then went on to claim overwhelming success in what he had set out to achieve. “With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close,” he said.A president who divided Americans on numerous issues went on to claim that his “agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation”.Trump may be leaving town, but not politics. The Wall Street Journal has reported he is thinking of floating a new political party, and has discussed it with some associates. He reportedly has a name for it - Patriot Party.It was not immediately clear if it was this new party he had in mind when he said in his farewell address, “I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning.”Trump is still polling well among Republicans and retains his grip on the party’s base, but political pundits wonder if that will last long. He is leaving office as the only American president to be impeached twice.Party seniors have already begun distancing themselves from him and his legacy tainted indelibly by the January 6 riot at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.“The mob was fed lies,” said Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, on the floor of the chamber on Tuesday. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people.”With Trump out of town and their way, Republicans are displaying a new-found desire to work with his successor. McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, will join Biden and top Congressional Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Charles Schumer at a prayer service before the inauguration.Vice-President Mike Pence, a Republican with presidential ambitions of his own, has already signalled estrangement from his boss. He will not attend Trump’s farewell and will be at Biden’s inauguration instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-wishes-bitter-rival-joe-biden-luck-101611120063178.html
20-01-2021||World||As he leaves office, Trump pardons former top strategist Steve Bannon||US President Donald Trump has granted clemency to former White House aide Steve Bannon as part of a wave of pardons and commutations he will issue during his final hours in office, a senior administration official said.Trump was not expected to pardon himself, members of his family or lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was at the forefront of unsuccessful efforts to get the results of the 2020 presidential election overturned, according to sources.Trump leaves office on Wednesday, when Joe Biden is sworn in as the nation's next president.Trump also pardoned rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black who were prosecuted on federal weapons offenses, as well as former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who was serving a 28-year prison term on corruption charges, a senior administration official said.Bannon, who was a key adviser in Trump's 2016 presidential run, was charged last year with swindling Trump supporters over an effort to raise private funds to build the president's wall on the US-Mexico border. He has pleaded not guilty.White House officials had advised Trump against pardoning Bannon. The two men have lately rekindled their relationship as Trump sought support for his unproven claims of voter fraud, an official familiar with the situation said.Bannon, 67, is the latest prominent political ally to receive clemency from Trump, who has often used the powers of the executive branch to reward loyalists and punish his enemies.Trump previously pardoned former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn for lying to the FBI about his conversation with the former Russian ambassador, and he commuted the prison term for Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Bannon can still be charged in state court in New York, where a pardon would not help him, said Daniel R. Alonso, a former prosecutor now at the Buckley law firm. Fraud prosecutions are frequently brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Alonso said.Lil Wayne, 38, whose real name is Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., pleaded guilty in federal court in December to illegally possessing a firearm and faced up to 10 years in prison. He has expressed support for Trump's criminal justice reform efforts.Kodak Black, 23, who was born Bill Kahan Kapri, is in federal prison for making a false statement in order to buy a firearm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pardons-former-white-house-adviser-steve-bannon-101611119602639.html

20-01-2021||World||Trump likely to pardon Steve Bannon, accused of defrauding donors||President Donald Trump is leaning toward granting his former strategist Steve Bannon a pardon, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would end the ex-aide’s federal prosecution for allegedly defrauding donors to a group that sought to build a wall on the Mexico border.Trump could still change his mind, the people cautioned. They asked not to be identified because the White House hasn’t announced any clemency decisions.The president’s term ends Wednesday at noon, and he’s expected to issue a number of pardons before leaving office. A White House spokesman declined to comment.Bannon was among a group of four Trump supporters accused last year of using money donated to the “We Build The Wall” campaign for personal gain.His indictment represented a remarkable fall from grace for the onetime leader of Breitbart News who was a key architect of Trump’s 2016 election victory and an adviser during the president’s first months in office. Bannon has denied the charges.Despite portraying the “We Build the Wall” campaign as a volunteer effort, Bannon received more than $1 million from the group and used some of it to pay personal expenses, prosecutors said. Donations were used to pay a salary to the group’s founder, a disabled Air Force veteran named Brian Kolfage, who’d promised he would “not take a penny,” prosecutors said.“The defendants defrauded hundreds of thousands of donors, capitalizing on their interest in funding a border wall to raise millions of dollars, under the false pretense that all of that money would be spent on construction,” acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement.Bannon pleaded not guilty during an August court hearing and had been free on a $5 million bond while awaiting trial. He faced as many as 20 years in prison on each of the two counts against him, though it’s rare for the maximum sentence to be imposed.Long before the arrests, the wall-building project had drawn criticism, including claims that sections were being constructed in floodplains and creating erosion. The project was backed by high-profile Trump boosters like Blackwater founder Erik Prince and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. Donald Trump Jr. once called it “private enterprise at its finest.”The president had largely avoided commenting publicly on the case, saying only the project “sounded to me like showboating” and that the arrest was a “sad thing for Mr. Bannon.”Trump’s relationship with Bannon turned frosty after his dismissal from the White House amid controversy over Trump’s handling of violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 and accusations that Bannon frequently leaked to the news media. But Bannon had found his way back into Trump’s circle by forcefully advocating against his first impeachment and for his re-election in a podcast, “War Room.”The two men repeatedly discussed the president’s effort to overturn his election defeat in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-likely-to-pardon-steve-bannon-accused-of-defrauding-donors-101611118617130.html
20-01-2021||World||Russia's Putin marks Orthodox Epiphany with icy dip||Russian President Vladimir Putin, dressed in nothing but a pair of blue swimming trunks, immersed himself in the freezing water of a cross-shaped pool near Moscow on Tuesday, observing an Orthodox Christian ritual to mark the feast of Epiphany.Russian state television broadcast footage of Putin, with the air temperature at minus 14 Celsius (6.8 Fahrenheit), removing a sheepskin coat to enter the icy waters and submerging himself three times beneath the surface, in front of an ice-sculpted cross.Putin, 68, grew up under Communist rule where open shows of religion were frowned upon. As president, he has become a frequent attender of Russian Orthodox ceremonies, and has given the church a major voice in society.Each year on Epiphany, Orthodox believers immerse themselves in rivers and lakes to commemorate the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russias-putin-marks-orthodox-epiphany-with-icy-dip-101611117881169.html
20-01-2021||World||Climate crisis can be new area of cooperation for India, US: Antony Blinken||Antony Blinken, the nominee for US secretary of state, on Tuesday said there was a “very strong potential” for the United States and India to deepen ties by cooperating on the climate crisis, and building on the work done by previous administrations in other spheres such as civil nuclear cooperation and defence.“One area I think that has a lot of promise, and maybe even necessity, is actually climate,” Blinken said at his confirmation hearing by the Senate foreign relations committee. “At the current rate things are going, India is poised over the next two or three decades to catch up to China in terms of the emissions that it produces.”“At the same time, as you know, Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has been a very strong advocate for looking at renewable energy and different technologies, I think there’s a very strong potential for our countries to work together in that area,” he said.As president, Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday on his first day in office to return the US to the Paris Agreement on climate change, reversing outgoing President Donald Trump. And that could in itself be an opportunity for the Biden administration to start working with India on the climate crisis right away.Blinken and four other members of Biden’s incoming cabinet appeared before US Senate committees for their confirmation hearings. The others were Lloyd Austin III, nominee for secretary f defence; Janet Yellen, nominee for treasury secretary; Avril Haines, nominee for director of national intelligence; and Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee for secretary of homeland security.Blinken’s remarks on the climate crisis as the new area for cooperation came in response to a question from Mitt Romney, a Republican senator, on the Biden administration’s plans for India in the wake of border clashes with China.The secretary of state-designate described India as a “bipartisan success story” over successive administrations, and went on to recount the upward trajectory in ties starting towards the end of Bill Clinton’s term, when the two countries were able to put behind the tensions following India’s nuclear tests in 1998. Then came the civil nuclear deal under George W Bush, defence procurement and information sharing under Barack Obama, and then the concept of the Indo-Pacific under Trump, along with efforts to ensure no country, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and a shared commitment to combating terrorism.“So, I think there are many ways in which we can deepen that cooperation to pursue the path that successive administrations have put us on,” Blinken said, offering the climate crisis as the new area of cooperation.Blinken, notably, used the phrase “Indo-Pacific” for the region, instead of “Asia-Pacific”, which should reassure Indian commentators who have been alarmed by the use of the latter term by Biden and some members of his team as a concession to the Chinese. Beijing dislikes the phrase “Indo-Pacific” and its official state media has openly called for the incoming US president and his team to use “Asia-Pacific”.Indian foreign policy experts and commentators are closely watching the incoming administration’s remarks on China for clues to future policy.China was a top issue of concern for senators at Blinken’s hearing also, along with Russia and Iran. Biden and his team have characterised China as a competitor, and Blinken and Haines both stated at their hearings that it will be the incoming administration’s goal will be to “outcompete” China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-crisis-can-be-new-area-of-cooperation-for-india-us-antony-blinken-101611117242898.html
20-01-2021||World||Scientists debate naming of new Covid-19 variants, want to avoid stigma||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been rapidly spreading across the world. It has so far killed millions of people and severely affected major economies.There are a few variants of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which are spreading faster and are deadlier. One such variant was identified in the United Kingdom last year.The scientists are now grappling with what to call these variants. A meeting was held at the World Health Organisation (WHO) last week (January 12) where discussion happened at a new naming system but confusion still prevails.According to Nature, the fast-spreading UK variant was initially called Variant Under Investigation or VIU for short. After a risk assessment, it was renamed as Variant of Concern or VOC.The main cause of concern is the stigma for a country or region if a variant is named after it. 'UK variant', 'South African variant' etc are popular in news reports, but scientists say such things should be avoided.“The last thing we want to do is dissuade any particular place from reporting they’ve got a new concerning variant - in fact, we want to do the opposite,” Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, told Nature.It's not necessary that a variant named after a particular country emerged from there, say the scientists. It is spotted in one country or region and quickly spreads across the world, they add.That is why, for now, the naming scheme has been based on the evolutionary precedents, leading to the name B117 for the variant found in the UK and B1351 or 501Y.V2 for the one seen in South Africa.Meanwhile, the global caseload of Covid-19 has crossed 96 million while death toll has breached the 2 million mark, according to the Johns Hopkins University tacker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-debate-naming-of-new-covid-19-variant-want-to-avoid-stigma-101611115630974.html

20-01-2021||World||Trump 'provoked' Capitol siege, says Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell||Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday explicitly blamed President Donald Trump for the deadly riot at the Capitol, saying the mob was “fed lies” and that the president and others “provoked” those intent on overturning Democrat Joe Biden’s election.Ahead of Trump's historic second impeachment trial, McConnell's remarks were his most severe and public rebuke of the outgoing president. The GOP leader is setting a tone as Republicans weigh whether to convict Trump on the impeachment charge that will soon be sent over from the House: “incitement of insurrection.”“The mob was fed lies," McConnell said. “They were provoked by the president and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.”The Republican leader vowed a “safe and successful” inauguration of Biden on Wednesday at the Capitol, where final preparations were underway amid heavy security.Trump's last full day in office Tuesday was also senators’ first day back since the deadly Capitol siege and since the House voted to impeach him for his role in the riots — an unparalleled time of transition as the Senate prepares for the second impeachment trial in two years and presses ahead with the confirmation of Biden's Cabinet.Three new Democratic senators-elect are set to be sworn into office Wednesday shortly after Biden's inauguration, giving the Democrats the barest majority, a 50-50 Senate chamber. The new vice president, Kamala Harris, will swear them in and serve as an eventual tie-breaking vote.The Democrats, led by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, will take charge of the Senate as they launch a trial to hold the defeated president responsible for the siege, while also quickly confirming Biden’s Cabinet and being asked to consider passage of a sweeping new $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.“The inauguration of a new president and the start of a new administration always brings a flurry of activity to our nation’s government,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday morning. “But rarely has so much piled up for the Senate as during this particular transition.”Making the case for Trump's conviction, Schumer said the Senate needs to set a precedent that the “severest offense ever committed by a president would be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution — impeachment,” and disbarment from future office.McConnell and Schumer conferred later Tuesday about how to balance the trial with other business and how to organize the evenly divided chamber, a process that could slow all of the Senate's business and delay the impeachment proceedings.There were signs of an early impasse. McConnell expressed to Schumer “his long-held view that the crucial, longstanding, and bipartisan Senate rules concerning the legislative filibuster remain intact, specifically during the power share for the next two years,” according to spokesman Doug Andres. Eliminating the Senate filibuster, a procedural move that requires a higher bar for legislation to pass, has been a priority for Democrats who will now control the House, Senate and White House.But a spokesman for Schumer, Justin Goodman, said the Democratic leader “expressed that the fairest, most reasonable and easiest path forward” was to adopt an agreement similar to a 2001 consensus between the parties, the last time the Senate was evenly divided, without “extraneous changes from either side.”Five of Biden's nominees had committee hearings Tuesday as the Senate prepared for swift confirmation of some as soon as the president-elect takes office, as is often done particularly for the White House’s national security team. Many noted the harrowing events at the Capitol on Jan. 6.The nominee for Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, testified of her own “eerie” feeling coming to the Capitol complex after “how truly disturbing it was” to see the attack on the building unfold. Biden’s nominee for secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, vowed to get to the bottom of the “horrifying” siege.The start of the new session of Congress was also forcing lawmakers to come to terms with the post-Trump era, a transfer of power that Trump’s mob of supporters tried to prevent after he urged them to storm the Capitol as Congress was tallying the Electoral College vote confirming Biden’s election.Seven Republican senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., tried to overturn Biden’s election during the Electoral College tally. Cruz was presiding over the Senate Tuesday while McConnell delivered his blistering remarks.Hawley continued to embrace his role in the opposition, saying on Tuesday that he will block a quick confirmation of Mayorkas, the Homeland Security nominee, to protest Biden's immigration plan to provide a path to citizenship for 11 million people. Hawley said Mayorkas “has not adequately explained how he will enforce federal law and secure the southern border.”As they begin the year newly in the minority, Republican senators face a daunting choice of whether to convict Trump of inciting the insurrection, the first impeachment trial of a president no longer in office — but one who continues to hold great sway over the party's voters.Some Republicans want to halt the impeachment trial. Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn was among those Republicans casting doubt on the legal ability of the Senate to convict a president no longer in office, though legal scholars differ on the issue.“It’s never happened before and maybe that’s for a good reason,” he said.The House impeached Trump last week on the sole charge, incitement of insurrection, making him the only president to be twice impeached. A protester died during the riot and a police officer died later of injuries; three other people involved died of medical emergencies. He was first impeached in 2019 over relations with Ukraine and was acquitted in 2020 by the Senate.The three new Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California, are to be sworn into office Wednesday, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss planning.Warnock and Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents in this month's runoff elections. Georgia's secretary of state certified the election results Tuesday. Padilla was tapped by California's governor to fill the remainder of Harris' Senate term.___Associated Press writer Eric Tucker contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-provoked-capitol-siege-says-senate-majority-leader-mitch-mcconnell-101611109232493.html
20-01-2021||World||Capitol rioters hold out long-shot hope for a Donald Trump pardon||In what could be the longest of legal long shots, several of those arrested for storming the U.S. Capitol are holding out hope that President Donald Trump will use some of his last hours in office to grant the rioters a full pardon.Longtime advisers to Trump are urging him against such a move but the rioters contend their argument is compelling: They went to the Capitol to support Trump, and now that they are facing charges carrying up to 20 years in prison, it’s time for Trump to support them.“I feel like I was basically following my president. I was following what we were called to do. He asked us to fly there. He asked us to be there. So I was doing what he asked us to do,” said Jenna Ryan, a Dallas-area real-estate agent who took a private jet to the Jan. 6 rally and ensuing riot to disrupt the certification of the election of President-elect Joe Biden.Ryan — who prosecutors say posted a now-deleted video of herself marching to the Capitol with the words, “We are going to f---ing go in here. Life or death” — told Dallas television station KTVT: “I think we all deserve a pardon. I’m facing a prison sentence. I think I do not deserve that.”Perhaps the most high-profile rioter, the so-called “QAnon Shaman” who broke into the Senate chamber and posed at the dais with a spear, wearing a horned fur hat and animal skins, is also pleading for a pardon.Jacob Chansley’s lawyer told The Associated Press that he reached out to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows about a possible pardon on behalf of the Arizona man, acknowledging it might be a reach but that there’s nothing to lose in seeking one.If Chansley is not granted a pardon, attorney Albert Watkins said, it could offer the added benefit of further awakening his client to the fact that his devotion to Trump has not been reciprocated, comparing it to being a jilted lover or even a member of a cult.“The only thing that was missing at the Capitol was the president, our president, stirring up the Kool-Aid with a big spoon,” Watkins said.Dominic Pezzola, a Rochester, New York, man and far-right Proud Boys supporter who was seen in a video using a clear police shield to shatter a Capitol window, also explored seeking a pardon but his attorney said there was not enough time to make it happen.“To believe the president is going to carte blanche issue these pardons is kind of a fantasy,” defense attorney Mike Scibetta told the AP. “I think it would cast a shadow on his own impeachment defense.”Trump, who has long reveled in suspense, was expected to spend his last full day in office issuing a flurry of pardons to as many as 100 people, two people briefed on the plans told the AP.But if Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz has his say, the more than 150 rioters arrested so far and the thousands more suspected should not be among them.Dershowitz, who represented Trump in his first impeachment last year, told the AP he has not been approached by any of the rioters about seeking a pardon but even if he had, “it would be wrong to pardon rioters who committed crimes.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who speaks often with Trump, was among the confidantes urging the president not to go there.“I don’t care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, you breached the security of the Capitol, you interrupted a joint session of Congress, you tried to intimidate us all,” Graham said on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.” “You should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and to seek a pardon of these people would be wrong.He warned that such a move “would destroy President Trump.”Pardons normally go through an extensive vetting process within the Department of Justice. The Office of the Pardon Attorney, which handles these reviews, did not respond to a request for comment, but former federal prosecutors said Trump giving clemency to those at the Capitol would be highly unusual.Such pardons would be “a slap in the face to the law enforcement officers who protected the Capitol and our leaders who were inside,” said Joe Brown, who until last year was a U.S. attorney in Texas.Not all of those charged in the Jan. 6 riot are in the market for a pardon. Victoria Bergeson of Groton, Connecticut, who faces charges of violating curfew and unlawful entry wants her case to “just go away” but sees accepting a pardon “as an admission that she knowingly did something wrong,” said her attorney Samuel Bogash.“She does not want to do that due to a justifiable fear of how the public would perceive it,” he said. “She is already being trolled online.”Noah Bookbinder, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, said Trump’s use of his clemency powers has set up a “spoils system” for his allies and pardoning the insurrectionists would just be a more extreme version.“That this president might be willing, even to pardon those who rose up against the United States," he said, “would be the ultimate statement of his perversion of the purpose behind pardons.”___Bleiberg reported from Dallas, Mustian from New York. AP White House reporter Jill Colvin contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-rioters-hold-out-long-shot-hope-for-a-donald-trump-pardon-101611108962869.html
20-01-2021||World||Italy PM Conte survives close Senate vote, vows to forge ahead||Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte narrowly won a confidence vote in the upper house Senate on Tuesday, allowing him to remain in office after a junior partner quit his coalition last week in the midst of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.However, Conte failed to secure an absolute majority, meaning he now heads a minority government that will struggle to implement its policy programme at a time of severe national emergency.Having overcome a similar confidence motion in the lower house on Monday, Conte won in the 321-seat Senate by 156 to 140, with 16 abstentions.Looking to head off speculation he might resign following the close vote, Conte said he would seek to bolster his support in parliament. In the meantime, he promised to focus on tackling the country's twin health and economic crises."Italy doesn't have a minute to lose," he said on Twitter.The small Italia Viva party, headed by former prime minister Matteo Renzi, abandoned the cabinet in a row over Conte's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent recession. It abstained on Tuesday, leaving the door open for a possible return to the coalition if its policy demands are met.Conte and his main partners, the 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), appeared unwilling to kiss and make up.Addressing the Italia Viva senators, Conte said, "You have chosen the path of aggression and media attacks... this is not the best choice for the interests of the country."Hoping to entice centrist and liberal lawmakers currently outside the coalition, Conte has promised to revamp his policy agenda and shake up his cabinet, saying he wants to modernise Italy and speed up implementation of an economic recovery plan.In the event, only two members of the opposition centre-right Forza Italia party switched sides on Tuesday, while a number of unaligned politicians who had come under heavy pressure to help the government ended up voting against Conte.Italy has had several minority governments in recent times, but history has shown they are highly vulnerable to ambush in parliament and risk collapse at any divisive vote."There will be lots of drama and it will be hard to get anything done," said Giovanni Orsina, head of LUISS university's school of government in Rome.He predicted the government would collapse in the summer, when a six-month moratorium on national elections kicks in ahead of the end of President Sergio Mattarella's seven-year mandate.Analysts say many lawmakers want to avoid an early ballot, fearing they will not be re-elected next time around. As a result, some of them played it safe this week and helped Conte stay in office. But as soon as the moratorium kicks in, removing any threat of a vote, they would move to oust Conte and try to form a new administration, Orsina said.

The existing lockdown runs until Jan. 31."Now is the time to take preventive measures against the threat of this virus," Merkel told reporters after a meeting with the premiers of Germany's 16 federal states.New infections have been decreasing in recent days and pressure on intensive care units has eased slightly, but virologists are worried about the possible spread of more infectious variants of the virus.Merkel said all countries in Europe must make similar efforts to fight the pandemic. Otherwise, Germany may consider restricting border entry to avoid highly transmissible strains being brought in from abroad.She and the state leaders also agreed that companies must allow employees to work from home until March 15 where possible, Merkel said.Aid for hard-hit companies is to be improved, and retailers' writedowns on seasonal goods - which could include winter coats or ski equipment - will be taken into account.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen by 11,369 to 2.05 million, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday.

20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump ends where he began, fighting release of tax returns||President Donald Trump’s lawyers made a preemptive move to stop congressional Democrats from obtaining his tax returns once President-elect Joe Biden takes power, asking a judge for an Inauguration Day hearing in a case that could threaten the secrecy of his closely guarded financial information.The Democrats in the last Congress have run out of time in their demand for Trump’s tax information from the Treasury Department, but the new Congress could re-issue it in the coming days. At the same time, Biden will take power, making it possible that the Justice Department could reverse its position in the case and simply hand over the records.The lawyers requested a hearing on Wednesday before a Washington federal judge to discuss next steps in the litigation. They said they were hoping the judge would guarantee them at least 72 hours’ notice before the new administration hands over any documents to Congress, giving them a window to block the handover in court.If the House got Trump’s tax information, Democrats could vote to release the material or a summary to all 435 members of the House, effectively making the information public.The last-minute legal maneuvering stems from a case that began in 2019, the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Ways and Means sued to enforce its subpoenas for six years’ worth of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, after the Trump administration refused to turn over the information.Trump’s lawyers said they contracted both the House committee and the Justice Department “in an attempt to resolve this issue.” The House declined to say whether it would renew its request for the tax returns, while the Justice Department said it was “not in a position at this time to speak for the incoming administration,” according to the Trump lawyers’ court filing.A lawyer for the House Democrats didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Meanwhile, two other tax cases -- involving the president’s accountants and bankers -- reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that Congress could not compel the release of the financial records, at least for the time being. The cases were sent back to the lower courts to assess whether Congress should narrow the scope of the information it sought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-ends-where-he-began-fighting-release-of-tax-returns-101611107358948.html

"It is hard sometimes to remember, but that is how we heal. It is important to do that as a nation. That is why we are here today. Between sundown and dusk, let us shine the lights in the darkness along this sacred pool of reflection and remember all that we have lost."Biden and Harris held their first inauguration-related event in Washington on Tuesday night (local time). They were accompanied by their spouses, the incoming first lady and gentleman Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff.Speaking at the memorial, Harris said she hopes Americans emerge from the ordeal of the pandemic "with a new wisdom -- to cherish simple moments, to imagine new possibilities and to open our hearts just a little bit more to one another.""We gather tonight, a nation in mourning, to pay tribute to the lives we have lost: a grandmother or grandfather who was our whole world; a parent, partner, sibling or friend who we still cannot accept is no longer here," she said. "And for many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together."There are 400 lights illuminating the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in tribute to the more than 400,000 people who have lost their lives due to Covid-19 in the US, CNN reported.Hundreds of towns, cities and communities across the country plan to join in the solemn tribute with lighting ceremonies of their own at buildings from the Empire State Building in New York to the Space Needle in Seattle, Washington.Washington Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who in November became the first Black American to earn the rank of cardinal, delivered the invocation. Gospel singer Yolanda Adams sang "Hallelujah," and Lori Marie Key, a Covid-19 ward nurse from Michigan, sang "Amazing Grace." Key gained national attention last year when a video of her singing the hymn during a hospital shift change went viral, Washington Post reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tonight-will-begin-healing-together-biden-harris-pay-tribute-to-americans-who-died-of-covid19-101611105291622.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden returns to Washington DC to be sworn in as the 46th US President||Four years after he left the Beltway for his hometown in Delaware, Joe Biden returned to Washington DC a day before his swearing-in as the 46th President of the United States on Wednesday with the message of unity and the enormous task of healing a bitterly divided country.“I am honoured to be your next President and Commander in Chief,” Biden, 78, told his fellow Delawarians before boarding a private plane for Joint Air Force Base Andrews on his way to Washington DC. “I will always be a proud son of the state of Delaware,” he said.In public life for nearly five decades ever since he was elected as the youngest United States Senator from Delaware in 1973, Biden noted that history is in the making as he will be sworn in as the President and Indian-origin Kamala Harris as the Vice President.“My family and I, about to return again to Washington, to meet a Black woman of South Asian descent, to be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States,” Biden said.Harris, 56, will be the first ever woman Vice President and also the first African American and India-origin person to occupy the second most powerful position in the US.During his short speech, Biden became emotional with tears rolling down his face. "This is kind of emotional," Biden said as we wiped a tear from his eye. "It's deeply personal that our journey to Washington starts here," he said, talking about the national guard building named after his son Beau.Biden said that 12 years ago Barack Obama, a Black man, greeted him at the train platform before he became his Vice President, and now he departs to "meet a Black woman of South Asian descent" to become President and Vice President.He was accompanying the incoming First Lady Jill Biden, several grandchildren and family members, as well as son Hunter Biden who was holding his baby Beau. From there he drove down to the National Mall where he visited a memorial to Covid deaths at the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. More than four lakh Americans have lost their lives in one year of the pandemic.At the Covid-19 memorial, he was joined by his wife Jill, Vice President-elect Harris, and the incoming Second Gentlemen Douglas Emhoff. He was also joined by Cardinal Wilton Gregory, Archbishop of Washington, who delivered the Invocation; Yolanda Adams, a nationally-recognized gospel singer who sang Hallelujah; and Lori Marie Key, with Saint Joseph Mercy Health System in Michigan who sang Amazing Grace.Earlier, he thanked the residents of his home state Delaware. “My fellow Delawareans, on behalf of the entire Biden family, we will never be able to fully express what you mean to us. In our family, the values we share, the character we strive for, the way we view the world — it all comes from home, from Delaware,” Biden said before he departed from his hometown for the national capital.“The state that gave my mother and father a home and a livelihood when they needed it the most. The state that made my brothers and sister and I understand that we could do whatever we dreamed. That gave me a chance when I was just a kid, and elected me and believed in me ever since,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-returns-to-washington-dc-to-be-sworn-in-as-the-46th-us-president-101611104427809.html
20-01-2021||World||UK registers largest single-day rise in Covid-19 deaths to 1,610||The United Kingdom's Covid-19 death toll rose by 1,610 on Tuesday, the largest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic, the UK Department for Health and Social Care said.The UK has faced a surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths since the discovery of a new highly infectious variant of the disease in southeast England in December. The latest increase tops the previous record of 1,564 fatalities set on January 13.According to government data, 91,470 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of testing positive for the coronavirus disease, giving the country the world's fifth-highest death toll.Additionally, 33,355 new positive tests for Covid-19 were registered by the department over the past 24 hours, taking the country's case total past 3.46 million.The United Kingdom's four nations are currently under various degrees of lockdown measures as ministers look to curb the rapid spread of the new Covid-19 strain, which is thought to be up to 70 percent more transmissible.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced earlier on Tuesday that he would be self-isolating for the next six days after receiving an alert by the National Health Service's Covid-19 contact tracing application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-registers-largest-single-day-rise-in-covid-19-deaths-to-1610-101611104399054.html
20-01-2021||World||UK's Boris Johnson aiming for close ties with Joe Biden||British Prime Minister said he looked forward to working closely with Joe Biden after his inauguration on Wednesday as U.S. president, highlighting the shared interests of the two close allies.Johnson has never met Biden and was once called "Britain Trump" by outgoing president Donald Trump who lavished praise on him, so commentators have suggested he will have to work hard to foster the so-called special relationship between Britain and the United States."I warmly congratulate Joe Biden on his historic inauguration as 46th President of the United States and look forward to working closely with his new administration as we defeat COVID and build back better from the pandemic," Johnson said in a statement issued late on Tuesday."In our fight against COVID and across climate change, defence, security and in promoting and defending democracy, our goals are the same and our nations will work hand in hand to achieve them."He said he looked forward to Biden visiting Britain this year for a G7 meeting and for the United Nations COP26 summit on climate change, an issue on which he hopes the two will share much common ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-boris-johnson-aiming-for-close-ties-with-joe-biden-101611104186028.html
20-01-2021||World||Bells and candlelight to honor 400,000 Covid-19 dead on eve of Trump's departure||From the Lincoln Memorial to the Empire State building, landmarks across the United States will be illuminated on Tuesday evening as part of a ceremony led by President-elect Joe Biden to honor the nearly 400,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19.The commemoration comes just hours before President Donald Trump leaves the White House and hands over a country in crisis. The ceremony, spearheaded by Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, will be the federal government's first nod to the staggering death toll from the pandemic.Biden and Harris will lead a lighting ceremony at the Reflecting Pool at the Lincoln Memorial at 5:15 p.m. ET (2215 GMT), followed by a moment of silence and 400 bell tolls at the National Cathedral to symbolically honor the Covid-19 dead."Hundreds of towns, cities, tribes, landmarks, and communities all across the country have committed to joining the tribute in a national moment of unity," Biden's inaugural committee said in a statement.The United States surpassed 24 million Covid-19 infections on Tuesday and was on track to pass 400,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. The country has recorded more than 200,000 new cases and 3,220 deaths on average over the last seven days. Among the other landmarks participating in the lighting ceremony were the Empire State building in New York City and the Space Needle in Seattle, according to the statement. The inaugural committee said it was encouraging Americans to light candles in their windows and churches to ring their bells in a show of unity.Local officials from Miami, Florida, to San Diego, California, said buildings in their cities would be lit for the occasion.The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City was inviting the public to light a candle on its front steps on Tuesday evening before a solemn bell toll.NEW CHAPTER IN PANDEMIC RESPONSEThe ceremony marks the beginning of a new era in the country's battle against Covid-19 under Biden, who has pledged to make coronavirus relief a top priority when he takes office on Wednesday under unprecedented security measures in the nation's capital.Biden will inherit a grieving and sickened nation from Trump, who critics say was to blame for a disjointed and ineffectual response to the pandemic, resulting in the United States having the highest Covid-19 death toll in the world.On Tuesday, his last full day as president, Trump had no public events scheduled, although US Vice President Mike Pence was planning to convene the White House Coronavirus Task Force for its last meeting under his watch.Many of Biden's policy plans fly in the face of the Trump administration's approach to combating the pandemic. They include a mask mandate that would apply to federal properties, planes and buses and a recommitment to the World Health Organization after Trump's withdrawal from the agency.Biden will also face the daunting task of overseeing the nation's Covid-19 vaccine distribution and administration. The United States is trailing in its vaccination goal, with only 12.3 million shots administered out of more than 31 million distributed as of Jan. 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.States, tasked with rolling out their own vaccine programs, have lamented a lack of funding and support from the federal government. Some localities say they do not have adequate supply to meet demand.Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday warned New York City will run out of vaccine doses as soon as Thursday and will be forced to cancel many appointments if it does not get resupplied quickly."We will have literally nothing left to give as of Friday," de Blasio told a news conference.Biden has said he will seek a $1.9 trillion spending proposal that includes funding for accelerating the distribution of coronavirus vaccines, and Democrats, who now hold a slight majority in Congress, hope to prioritize state and local aid in the next stimulus deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bells-and-candlelight-to-honor-400-000-covid-19-dead-on-eve-of-trump-s-departure-101611102061089.html

It started towards the end of the Clinton administration... During the Obama administration, we deepened cooperation on defence procurement and information sharing and the Trump administration carried that forward including its concept of Indo-Pacific and to make sure we were working with India so that no country in the region including China could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism. There are many ways we can deepen that cooperation that successive administrations have put us on," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."One area that has a lot of promise and necessity is Climate. Prime Minister Modi has been a very strong advocate of renewable energy and different technologies. I think there is very strong potential for our countries to work together," he added.The hearing comes a day ahead of US President-elect Joe Biden is scheduled to take oath as the 46th president of the United States.In November, US President-elect Biden nominated Antony Blinken, one of his closest and longest-serving foreign policy advisers, as Secretary of State to serve in his administration.Blinken, 58, has been advising Biden on foreign policy for years.As a run-up to the presidential election, Blinken made some statements that give a sense of his approach towards India.On August 15, Blinken participated in a panel discussion on Indo-US ties. Addressing Indian American Democrats on India's Independence Day at the US-India Relations and Indian Americans in Joe Biden's America virtual event, Blinken affirmed how Biden would be a champion of India-US relations.He had said that Joe Biden sees India and the US as natural partners and that the vision, he will help to make real as the president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-india-have-very-strong-potential-to-work-together-says-state-secretary-nominee-blinken-101611103046876.html
20-01-2021||World||Joe Biden intelligence pick favors 'aggressive' stance on China threat||The United States should take an "aggressive stance" toward the threat posed by the aggressive and assertive China that it faces today, Avril Haines, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for the top US intelligence job, said on Tuesday.Biden's nominee for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) also said she thought it would be some time before Tehran returned to strict compliance with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and that the Democratic Biden administration might itself return to the agreement, which outgoing Republican President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018.Haines, a former CIA deputy director, said her priorities include restoring trust and confidence within the US intelligence community, which Trump at times denigrated, as well as among the American people.Pressed by both Republican and Democratic senators on the importance of the Chinese intelligence threat, Haines said she would make it a priority to devote more resources to China."Our approach to China has to evolve and essentially meet the reality of the particularly assertive and aggressive China that we see today," she said. "I do support an aggressive stance, in a sense, to deal with the challenge that we are facing."Haines also told the committee that US agencies have "not solved the issue" of deterring cyber attacks and have not yet figured out how to handle such asymmetric threats.She said President-elect Biden has indicated the United States should find a way to impose costs on attackers for the recent SolarWinds attacks, attributed to Russia, on U.S. government agencies and businesses. Russia has denied responsibility.Speaking to the Senate Intelligence Committee that will vote on her nomination, Haines drew an implicit contrast to the Trump administration, which at times has been accused of politicizing intelligence agency findings."The DNI must never shy away from speaking truth to power — even, especially, when doing so may be inconvenient or difficult," she said. "The DNI must insist that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics — ever."Haines' confirmation was expected to move rapidly, a Democratic congressional official said, though some activists have questioned her role in helping to manage the CIA's response to probes of its past use of harsh interrogation techniques.In a possible effort to neutralize that issue, Haines told the panel she would not permit their use and that she believed "waterboarding in fact constitutes torture under the law."In a written answer to panel questions, she said she believed that post-Sept. 11, 2001, interrogation methods used on suspected extremists "included torture, which violates US commitments and obligations" under US laws and international conventions.Senator Mark Warner, the panel's incoming chairman, praised Haines in a statement. He said the committee would schedule a vote on her nomination as soon as possible, and urged the full Senate to confirm her "without any unnecessary delay."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-intelligence-pick-favors-aggressive-stance-on-china-threat-101611101678177.html
20-01-2021||World||Donald Trump leaves town an outcast, trailed by Covid-19 pandemic, job losses||Donald Trump departs Washington on Wednesday with Americans more politically divided and more likely to be out of work than when he arrived, while awaiting trial for his second impeachment -- an ignominious end to one of the most turbulent presidencies in American history.Trump intends to leave in the morning for his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, arriving before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. There, the ex-president will begin his post-presidency life attended at least temporarily by a handful of former White House staffers.The last president who chose not to attend his successor’s inauguration was Andrew Johnson in 1869, another impeached leader. While Trump’s absence will break more than a century of precedent that has reinforced the peaceful transfer of power in the US, Biden has said it’s a “good thing” Trump won’t observe his swearing-in.Biden arrived in Washington on Tuesday, where Trump isn’t expected to give him a meeting, according to people familiar with the matter, even though the president-elect is staying at Blair House across the street. All of the nation’s other living ex-presidents except Jimmy Carter, who is 96, will join Biden at Arlington National Cemetery after the inauguration to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.The outgoing president has been transformed into a political pariah in Washington among all but his most loyal supporters in the wake of the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, which was inspired by Trump’s refusal to accept defeat and recognize Biden’s victory in the November election.Unemployment is more than a third higher than when he entered office, and more than 400,000 Americans have died of Covid-19.Even with the damage inflicted by the pandemic, US equity markets retained their swagger and posted solid returns during the Trump years. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 66% through Friday; the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 135%.Trump has left the door open for a second act in national politics, buoyed by the 74 million people who voted for his re-election despite his failure to contain the US coronavirus outbreak.Yet his popularity has fallen considerably since the election and the Capitol riot, however. Several polls have shown that as he leaves office, record low numbers of Americans -- less than 40%, according to an average by RealClearPolitics -- approve of his performance as president.The final Gallup poll of Trump’s presidency, released Monday, found him with 34% support on Monday -- tied with Carter and George W. Bush, who left office with the country mired in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and Americans disillusioned with the Iraq War.Trump’s attempts during his final weeks in office to tout his achievements, including his border wall and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East, were drowned out by the fallout from the riot. The violent storming of the Capitol left five people dead and showed the danger of Trump’s weeks-long campaign to whip his supporters into a frenzy over the election outcome.Three quarters of Americans, including more than half of Republicans, say Trump bears some responsibility for the attack, according to a Pew Research Center survey.Military PresenceThe Washington that Trump leaves behind now looks more like a military base than the seat of the world’s longest-standing democracy. Thousands of National Guard troops patrol the streets, while the Capitol, White House and large areas around them are fenced off to protect against another attack by Trump’s supporters.And Trump can’t altogether escape the place himself. Rather than being fully unburdened from the pressures of the presidency upon leaving office, he’ll have to eventually defend himself in his historic second impeachment trial in the Senate over his incitement of the Capitol riot.Barack Obama, by comparison, spent part of his first few weeks as a former president kite surfing in the Caribbean with British business mogul Richard Branson.The tumult is a fitting coda for a presidency that constantly pushed the boundaries of normal and exacerbated the nation’s political and racial divisions. Trump’s ability to instigate an attack on the Capitol by his loyalists with baseless claims about the election illustrated how, wittingly or not, he unleashed dark forces that previously inhabited the fringes of American life.9/11 Every DayThe coronavirus pandemic, which Trump all but ignored as he sought to overturn his election defeat, has grown much worse in the final weeks of his presidency, with the recorded death toll reaching 400,000 on Tuesday.Daily US deaths from Covid-19 have topped 4,000 multiple times since the start of the new year -- more dead Americans, each day, than the number killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. Hospitals across the country are bursting with patients suffering from the disease.Trump claims the development of a coronavirus vaccine as one of his administration’s greatest achievements, but its rollout has been beset by distribution and bureaucratic failures. After top administration officials promised that more than 100 million doses of vaccine would be delivered by the end of the year, only about 15.6 million shots had been administered as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg vaccine tracker.Trump has deflected blame, as he did throughout the crisis, instead faulting governors for not inoculating more people, faster. “They’re calling it a medical miracle,” Trump said of his administration’s vaccine effort in a speech last week near a segment of border wall in Alamo, Texas.It will be the incoming Biden administration’s responsibility to speed up vaccinations and revive an economy still reeling from pandemic-related shutdowns. The president-elect has said 100 million people will receive a shot in the first 100 days of his term, a goal Trump administration officials call a low-ball figure since the nation is up to almost 900,000 doses a day already.Jobless Rate HigherAt its peak, the Trump economy could boast one of the best job markets in decades. The unemployment rate was at a 50-year low, and women, people of color and the disabled all shared in the gains.But as a result of the pandemic, he leaves behind a jobless rate almost double what it was a year ago -- and substantially higher than when he took office -- with more than 10 million Americans unemployed. And as the pandemic rages on, people continue to lose their jobs.In the week ended Jan. 9, nearly 1 million applications for state unemployment insurance were filed -- as well as more than a quarter-million for a federal program covering those not traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits, like gig workers.The Covid-19 crisis has also left a swath of the country struggling to pay bills and put food on the table. Almost 30 million Americans reported sometimes or often not having enough to eat, according to a Census Bureau survey in mid-December, and more than 17 million had little or no confidence in their ability to pay next month’s rent.Taken together, the data show how the pandemic that crushed Trump’s chances of re-election will also serve as Biden’s foremost challenge as president.Garden of HeroesTrump enters his post-White House life with key figures from the world of politics unwilling to associate with him following the Capitol riot. He has been cut off from major social media platforms, including Twitter, which will hurt his ability to grab the spotlight once he is out of office.Before departing, the president issued a handful of last-minute executive actions. They include an order to create a statue garden for people Trump designated as American heroes, ranging from presidents to game show host Alex Trebek, and an order to discourage government agencies from seeking criminal prosecutions of regulatory violations. Both orders could be overruled by Biden.Trump’s White House even released a new history of the country’s founding, written by a commission Trump appointed last year. The report, published on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, defended the nation’s founders’ handling of slavery and argued that modern identity politics “creates new hierarchies as unjust as the old hierarchies of the antebellum South.”He’s expected to issue a number of pardons on Tuesday, though White House Counsel Pat Cipollone has resisted preparing preemptive grants of clemency for the president himself, family members or White House aides, according to people familiar with the matter.Meanwhile, Trump has struggled to find legal representation for the upcoming impeachment trial, with some attorneys who represented him during his first impeachment no longer willing to associate with him.He won’t have much time to cobble together a team. The Senate could begin its trial soon after Biden takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.If convicted, Congress may bar him from running for federal office ever again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-leaves-town-an-outcast-trailed-by-covid-19-pandemic-job-losses-101611101265007.html
20-01-2021||World||As WHO fumes at western drugmakers, China fills void on Covid-19 vaccines||For months, the World Health Organization has called on countries to come together to ensure a fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines among rich and poor nations. Now it’s starting to lose patience.On Monday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said drug manufacturers had prioritized regulatory approval in rich countries, where profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to get the greenlight from the global health body. He said that could delay distribution through Covax, a WHO-backed initiative that aims to supply vaccines to poorer countries.“The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure,” Tedros said. “Even as they speak the language of equitable access, some countries and companies continue to prioritize bilateral deals -- going around Covax, driving up prices and attempting to jump to the front of the queue. This is wrong.”The WHO’s struggles have opened the door for China to start ramping up its vaccine diplomacy, with foreign minister Wang Yi pledging last week to hand out more than a million doses during a swing through Southeast Asia. That amounted to a geopolitical win just before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has vowed to put the US back in the WHO following Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the organization last year.“China’s ‘mask diplomacy’ in 2020 is being followed in 2021 by ‘vaccine diplomacy,’” said Ian Storey, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. “The aims remain the same: to win friends and influence countries in Southeast Asia and bury the memory that the pandemic started in China a year ago.”Antony Blinken, Biden’s pick for secretary of state, told lawmakers on Tuesday the US is preparing to join Covax and look at “how we can help make sure the vaccine is equitably distributed.” Biden officially takes over on Wednesday in the US.China’s vaccines have received some high-profile endorsements, with Indonesian President Joko Widodo receiving the Sinovac Biotech Ltd. shot on live television last week in the world’s fourth-most populous nation despite inconsistent efficacy data. Brazil also began distributing 6 million Sinovac doses on Monday -- an about-face for President Jair Bolsonaro, who had been an outspoken critic of Chinese vaccines last year.‘Can No Longer Wait’Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who last month said his country wouldn’t use any vaccines that weren’t approved by the WHO, last week reversed course and accepted one million vaccine doses from China. He cited widespread use in places like Indonesia, Egypt and China, noting that Wang had received the vaccine and is still “in good health and can travel places.”“For the need to defend our nation and protect our people from this deadly epidemic, we can no longer wait,” Hun Sen said in a message published in a cabinet newsletter on Friday. “We are reversing what I said last time about accepting only vaccines recognized by the World Health Organization.”Because they lack regulatory bodies with the capacity to scrutinize scientific data, many developing countries have traditionally relied on the WHO’s list of approved vaccines to know which shots they can permit for local vaccination drives.At the end of 2020, the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine was the first, and so far only, shot to receive emergency validation from the WHO since the outbreak began a year ago. With no low-income countries producing their own vaccines, richer nations have secured 85% of Pfizer’s vaccine and all of Moderna Inc.’s, according to London-based research firm Airfinity Ltd.While China has pledged to support the WHO’s efforts, its vaccines are not among those procured by Covax. A spokesperson for Sinovac said the company has began submitting data to the WHO for a pre-qualification of its coronavirus vaccine, known as CoronaVac. A group of WHO inspectors has also traveled to China and will inspect its production facilities after completing quarantine, the spokesperson said.Covax still plans to distribute 2 billion doses around the world by the end of this year, with enough to protect 3% of the population in all participating countries by July, according to an emailed response to questions. The facility has said it will consider procuring any candidate vaccine that meets global standards set by the WHO.Among the 11 candidates that it can tap for distribution, two -- Moderna Inc.’s shot and the one developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford -- are ready for rollout and are being administered in countries like the U.S. and U.K. It’s unclear why Covax has not yet started distributing those vaccines as well.Tedros’s statements castigating companies for prioritizing rich countries where they can make the most profit indicates that the global health body sees the delay as stemming from the companies.AstraZeneca said on Dec. 30 that it was seeking the WHO’s greenlight, known as the body’s Emergency Use Listing, “for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low and middle-income countries.” A company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what stage the process is at.Covax’s rollout could begin “as early as February pending favorable regulatory outcomes and the readiness of health systems and national regulatory systems in individual participating economies,” said Iryna Mazur, a spokesperson at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is co-leading Covax.Thailand bought 2 million doses from Sinovac, and China promised to donate a total of 800,000 doses to the Philippines and Myanmar during Wang’s diplomatic push last week.During a visit to Manila, Wang drew praise from Philippine officials after committing to completing China-funded infrastructure projects including a $400 million bridge and a $940 million cargo railway project.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte this week chided a group of senators who scrutinized the government’s plans to buy Sinovac, after previously threatening to terminate a Visiting Forces Agreement with the U.S. if it failed to deliver at least 20 million vaccines immediately. “No vaccine, no stay here,” Duterte said last month of the military deal -- a threat he has made before without following through on.“Coronavirus vaccines have clearly become a political football in the increasing U.S.-China cold war,” said Paul Chambers of Naresuan University’s Center of Asean Community Studies, who has researched geopolitics in Southeast Asia for about two decades. “The daunting delay in the launching of Covax is exactly the opportunity that China is using to initiate and expand its supply of Sinovac to developing countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-who-fumes-at-western-drugmakers-china-fills-void-on-covid-19-vaccines-101611100877542.html
20-01-2021||World||US to join Paris deal, lift Muslim travel ban||On the first day of his presidency, Joe Biden will roll back some of President Donald Trump’s most controversial policies — withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on climate crisis and restrictions on immigration from some Muslim-majority countries — his incoming chief of staff said.Biden will sign executive orders to get the US back to the Paris pact and rescind the travel ban on people from Muslim-majority countries, which will be among roughly a dozen actions the President-elect will take on his first day in the White House, incoming chief of staff Ron Klain said on Saturday in a memo to senior staff, outlining a 10-day plan of action.“We face four overlapping and compounding crises: The Covid-19 crisis, the resulting economic crisis, the climate crisis, and a racial equity crisis,” Klain wrote. “All of these crises demand urgent action. In his first 10 days in office, President-elect Biden will take decisive action to address these four crises, prevent other urgent and irreversible harms, and restore America’s place in the world.”The other orders that Biden is likely to sign include the launch of a “100 masking challenge” that will mandate masks on federal property and interstate travel, and extending the pause on student loan payments and actions meant to prevent evictions and foreclosures — all related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Biden will take oath as the US President on January 20 amid unprecedented security with more than 25,000 National Guard troops deployed in Washington DC in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol on January 6. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has warned of “armed protests” in the days leading up to the inauguration.President Trump announced in June 2017 that the US will exit the Paris Agreement — a legally binding international treaty on climate change — saying it disadvantaged the country, blunted its competitive edge, and favoured India and China.America’s return to the Paris Agreement was one of Biden’s key campaign promises.So was revoking of the Muslim ban.Just a week after his inauguration in 2017, Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning foreign nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries — including Iran, Iraq and Yemen — from entering the US. It was struck down by the courts, but a much-diluted version remains in force.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-join-paris-deal-lift-muslim-travel-ban-101610914114610.html

He had also inaugurated the picture gallery consisting of portraits of freedom fighters, chairpersons of the Council and name plates of the current members.Looking at Savarkar’s portrait, the chief minister said, “He was a great freedom fighter and philosopher whose personality was a source of inspiration for every Indian.”Objecting to Savarkar’s portrait, the Congress lawmaker said, “It was an insult to the freedom fighters, who did not bow to atrocities of the British. They laid down their lives fighting for the freedom of the country.”He said the portrait should be removed and placed in the BJP office.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav said there should be a debate on what Savarkar contributed to the freedom struggle.“All those who contributed to the freedom struggle should be honoured, but there are different kinds of allegations, documents and stories that raise question marks on his role in the freedom struggle,” Yadav said.BJP state unit spokesperson Chandramohan said, “The life and struggle of Savrakar is an inspiration for the people across the country. The Congress and Samajwadi Party leaders are indulging in politics to serve their vested political interests. Both the Congress and Samajwadi Party indulged in dynasty politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/savarkar-portrait-in-up-legislative-council-picture-gallery-sparks-row-101611166391053.html

20-01-2021||India||Ghaziabad court awards death penalty to man for toddler’s rape and murder||A Ghaziabad court on Wednesday awarded death penalty to a 30-year-old man for brutally raping and murdering a two-and-half-year-old daughter of his colleague on the night on October 19 last year, terming the case as “rarest of rare”.The court fast tracked the case and held the accused guilty on January 18 after a trial of about a month and pronounced quantum of punishment on Wednesday.The crime took place on the night of October 19, 2020 when convict Chandan Pandey, who is colleague of deceased girl’s father, went to her house and forcibly took away the child from her mother on the pretext of taking her to a nearby shop.After Pandey did not return till late night, the family began a search for her and also approached the police. Her mutilated body was found from near a drain near the transport department office in an industrial area on the afternoon of October 20, 2020.Pandey was nabbed thereafter.The prosecution said that the autopsy report confirmed eight external injuries on the victim including a broken hyoid bone and concluded rape and death due to asphyxia resulting after antemortem throttling.The court also relied upon the “last seen” theory besides the forensic test reports which confirmed that the DNA of the man was found on body of the victim girl.Mahendra Srivastava, Special Judge (POCSO Act), held Pandey guilty on January 18 and awarded him death penalty under the provisions of the Act on Wednesday. Pandey was also awarded life imprisonment section for murder and seven years imprisonment for destruction of evidence under the Indian Penal Code.“The man brutally raped the minor girl and also murdered her and hid the body near to a drain at scene of crime. The prosecution produced 10 witnesses while no one, including the family of the convict, turned up for his defence. We also produced witnesses including girl’s mother who confirmed that the man took away her daughter. One witness also saw Pandey taking away the girl on his shoulders near the scene of crime,” said Utkarsh Vats, special public prosecutor.The Ghaziabad police also procured a CCTV footage from a mobile shop which confirmed that Pandey between 8.50 pm to 8.55 pm was seen taking away the girl with him.The police filed the charge sheet in the case on December 16, 2020 and charges were framed on December 24, 2020 under sections of the POCSO Act and also under IPC sections 302, 201, 376(a), 376(ab).The girl’s father and Pandey were known to each other for about 10-12 years and worked at a same factory in Ghaziabad. At times, Pandey used to stay with the family and the girl also called him as “chacha” (uncle).“The court relied on several rulings and observed that the act also impacts society besides there is no possibility of revival of the convict. Besides, there was also a high level of brutality done with the deceased girl. Taking these into consideration, the court pronounced death penalty for the man,” Vats, added.Pandey is married and has two minor children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-court-awards-gives-death-penalty-to-man-for-toddler-s-rape-and-murder-101611163383964.html
20-01-2021||India||BJP has set an example of how a party can be a tool for social service: Nadda||As a political party whose “goal is to win elections and work tirelessly for the goodwill and betterment of the common people” the Bharatiya Janata Party has set an example of how a political party can “effectively work as a potent tool of social service and help people in times of need” said party president JP Nadda on Wednesday in a letter to the party cadre.Nadda who completed a year in office on Wednesday said the party cadre worked “tirelessly and with full devotion to work for mankind during the pandemic.” During the lockdown that was imposed to check the spread of the Covid-19, the party chief had set the task for workers to feed five families everyday apart from ensuring that basic necessities of those in need are met.While the opposition has targeted the government on several issues including the Citizenship Amendment Act and the recently passed farm laws, the BJP chief hit back claiming that the concerns raised by the opposition parties are “misleading”.“While on the one hand you work tirelessly and with full devotion to work for mankind during the coronavirus pandemic, on the other hand you effectively counter all the false propaganda and canards of the opposition against the Citizenship Amendment Act, farm sector reform laws. You also exposed before the people the false propaganda and fake campaign of the Congress and its allies on the China issue,” the letter reads.The BJP chief had a word of appreciation for the party workers in West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala where he said they have to work “under very adverse circumstances”.Nadda recounted the attack he faced during a rally in West Bengal when his convoy was pelted with stones and said, “When a person like me who is the national president of India’s largest political party and who is always covered with security personnel, had to face a murderous assault during daylight while on a visit to West Bengal, it can be well imagined how difficult it would be for a common BJP worker to work under such tough and demanding circumstances. In the past few years, more than 300 BJP workers and our supporters have been brutally murdered for being associated with and for working in West Bengal.”He also paid tribute to the party workers who were killed in Jammu and Kashmir. “They laid down their lives to strengthen democracy and to spread the reach of the Bharatiya Janata Party,” he said. The BJP which is working to expand its footprint in the Kashmir Valley faced setbacks when as many as nine workers were killed between July and October last year. Nadda referred to the party’s performance in the district development council elections in the Union Territory where it won 75 seats as something that was made possible by “the sacrifice of party workers.”He also credited PM Modi for “putting the brakes on the coronavirus cases” and said, “...India reported the least death rate while our recovery rate kept on improving. Yet again in response to the call of the honourable Prime Minister our scientists weresuccessful in making two made in India vaccines, a feat which only 4 to 5 nations have been able to achieve.”Referring the party’s performance at various elections during the last year he said, “We have a strong, decisive and committed leader in our honourable Prime Minister. We also have a strong organisation and highly committed party workers whose strength and efficiency in electoral strategy no one can match.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-has-set-an-example-of-how-a-party-can-be-a-tool-for-social-service-nadda-101611162918182.html

20-01-2021||India||Supreme Court refuses to entertain plea against fake godmen||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to act on a petition seeking action against fake babas in the country and said that if such self-styled godmen have already been convicted in criminal cases, that is sufficient reason for people to avoid going to them.The petition styled as a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by a Secunderabad resident Dumpala Ramreddy who was upset over his daughter being kept in an ashram run by a self-styled godman based in Delhi. During efforts to rescue her from the ashram named Adhyatmika Vidyalaya run by one Veerendra Dev Dixit in Rohini, the petitioner stumbled upon a list of fake ashrams released by the apex body of sages – Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad.This list contained names of 17 fake godmen and their institutions which included the likes of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of Dera Sacha Sauda, Radhey Ma, Nirmal Baba, Rampal, Asaram Bapu and his son Narayan Sai. The list also included the name of Dixit, with whom the petitioner was concerned.Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy who represented the petitioner informed the Court that it should direct the Centre to verify the details of the list supplied by Akhada Parishad and order closure of the ashrams run by these fake godmen.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) AS Bobde said, “We are not disrespecting the Akhara Parishad. But how does the Court get to know who is a fake baba. This list is prepared by the Akhada on its own. We don’t know whether they have some animus with these persons.”Guruswamy told the Court to consider the fact that criminal cases have been filed against most of these persons named in the list. In some cases, the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing serious charges of misappropriation of funds, crimes of rape and murder.“This gives all the more reason that people should not go to them. Why do you want the Supreme Court’s imprimatur on them,” observed the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.As a last resort, the Court allowed the petition to be converted into a representation to the authorities in the Central government. “If the Union government thinks your problem is genuine, they will act on your representation,” noted the bench.On July 8 last year, the petition first came up for hearing before the Court when the bench agreed to consider it and allowed a copy of the petition to be supplied to the Solicitor General. On Wednesday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared in the case and opposed the petition. Mehta said, “The petitioner has already filed a petition of habeas corpus to rescue his daughter before the Delhi High Court. Their concern can be addressed there. We are opposing the prayer made in this petition.”Guruswamy requested to withdraw the petition which the bench accepted. In addition to verifying details about fake babas named by Akhada Parishad, the petition made several prayers which included vacating the ashrams run by these self-styled godmen and closing down ashrams other than those in the list where it is found that the people running them have criminal records. The petition also urged the Court to frame guidelines with regard to setting up of Ashrams and spiritual centres across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-fake-godmen-101611158375645.html

Investigation is underway," said circle officer BP Tripathi.In the videos, posted by some people on social media, a group of men are seen demolishing a recently renovated public toilet inside a roadways bus stand. They used iron rods, hammers to demolish the structure and raised religious slogans.Sources said a few activists of the same group had warned the roadways officials two days before to remove the toilet constructed near a temple and had claimed that if it wasn't done, they would do so themselves.Bimla, the caretaker of the toilet complex, claimed that urinals had been there for decades, and nobody objected to it ever. She said that a drain flows between the wall of the temple and toilet complex and it was wrong to say that it was next to the temple wall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-police-file-fir-against-8-for-demolishing-toilet-near-temple-in-saharanpur-101611161104162.html

The saffron party, however, bagged the district’s Hooghly Lok Sabha seat. One EVM can record up to 2,000 votes.“The TMC pressured district officials not to count the votes in 16 machines. Otherwise, the BJP would have won the Arambagh seat. But we are surging ahead in the district. A number of TMC legislators will join us because they cannot work for the people if they stay in the ruling party,” Adhikari said at a rally at Mankundu in Hooghly district.He raised the allegation hours before Chief Election Commissioner of India Sunil Arora arrived in Kolkata with his entire team to review ground situation before the assembly polls due in March-April.Reacting to the allegation, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Adhikari is making random allegations. If such a malpractice took place, why didn’t he speak up one year ago?”The TMC lost a prominent legislator on Wednesday when Arindam Bhattacharya, who represents the Shantipur assembly seat in Nadia district, joined the BJP in Delhi.Bhattacharya, 40, an international trade lawyer and social entrepreneur who studied in foreign universities, won the seat on a Congress ticket in 2016 but joined the TMC a year later. He was earlier a president of the Bengal youth Congress. “I left my career to join politics because I wanted to work for the people. But there has been no progress, no industrialization and no employment generation during the TMC regime,” said Bhattacharya.Ranjan Banerjee, senior vice-president of a nationally known industrial group, also joined the BJP in Kolkata on Wednesday.At the rally, Adhikari brought charges of corruption against the TMC, saying it was running sand and coal smuggling operations. He also accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of telling lies to the people and running the Centre’s welfare schemes by changing their names in Bengal.“It is essential that the same party rules the nation and Bengal. Unless you (voters) drive out the TMC people won’t get jobs. This government has kept appointments by the school service commission on hold for years. There is no industrial growth but you see only hefty expenses being made on annual investment summits,” said Adhikari.He also appealed to Left voters to support the BJP in the interest of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-accuses-tmc-of-malpractice-in-2019-lok-sabha-polls-101611157979316.html

The minister also demanded a regulatory mechanism by the central government for the OTT platforms to avoid any communal tension in the country.“These types of content create communal tension and lead to the division between communities. The central government should take appropriate steps to avoid such tensions,” he said.Deshmukh said that the Uttar Pradesh police had sought permission from them for the investigation in Mumbai in three cases lodged against Tandav.“They had sought our permission for the investigation and it is a routine process to visit other states in relation to the investigation. Even teams of Maharashtra police keep visiting other states for investigation,” he said.Several FIRs have been filed against the web series for allegedly inappropriate depiction of Hindu deities. Many organizations have demanded a ban on the series.Ali Abbas Zafar, the director of the series, has agreed to making changes to the series to appease the protesters.In a statement shared on social media on Tuesday, the filmmaker wrote, "We have utmost respect for the sentiments of the people of our country. We did not intend to hurt or offend the sentiments of any individual, caste, community, race, religion or religious beliefs or insult or outrage any institution, political party or person, living or dead.

We thank the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for the guidance & support in the matter.

20-01-2021||India||BJP a threat to nation’s unity: NCP supremo Sharad Pawar||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party is a serious threat to the unity of the nation, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar who is in Goa as part of a Parliamentary Committee visit, said Wednesday.Addressing a press conference at the state party headquarters in Panaji, Pawar cited the Centre’s “communal politics” as well as the government’s lack of sympathy for the protesting farmers' demands to press his case.“By and large we are seeing throughout India that the BJP is a serious threat to the unity of this nation,” Pawar began.“I'm a member of Parliament. He (pointing to Churchill Alemao, Goa’s lone NCP legislator) is a member of the legislative assembly. We got every right to follow our religion, our thinking. There are no two ways about that. But we also should not forget that we are elected representatives. When we are elected representatives we belong to all sections of voters… we represent each and every individual. But being an elected representative (if) I become head of a religious section or temple or any other thing, I think I'm going away from my commitment to the masses,” Pawar said.He also accused the Central government of ignoring the plight of the farmers who are agitating on the borders of Delhi for the repeal of three controversial farm laws.“India is an agricultural rich nation. Now for more than 50 days the whole country and those outside the country are also watching poor farmers sitting in such a cold atmosphere on the streets of Delhi or somewhat near to Delhi. They have certain issues, but I don't see any sympathy being shown by the government of India. They might have held some discussion but that discussion has no meaning. So where the 65% of the population is dependent on the agriculture sector and that sector is fighting for their genuine demand for the last practically more than 50-55 days that shows the total approach of the BJP,” Pawar said.“We have given our support to the Kisan Andolan some time back. I have said that the Government should hold discussions with them and resolve the issue. They have been sitting there for so many days and for the government to ignore them is wrong,” Pawar said.Pawar was visiting Goa to hold meetings with Defence Establishments located in Goa and Karwar in Karnataka including with the Indian Navy, the Coast Guard and the Goa Shipyard Ltd and said he was initially reluctant to hold party programmes during what was a non-partisan visit but later relented on the request of his party’s local unit.The NCP chief said that his party was looking to form an anti-BJP alliance ahead of the Goa assembly election early next year.“In Goa we have not taken any final decision. But within our party there is definitely a thinking that in the Vidhan Sabha election in Goa we should contest as an alliance of NCP, Congress, Goa Forward and some other like minded parties. We have not yet discussed, but within our party there is a discussion [that]... if possible we will contest the election as a front to provide a viable alternative to BJP and a stable government to Goa,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-a-threat-to-nation-s-unity-ncp-supremo-sharad-pawar-101611156436895.html

In the coming days, we will enlist more eligible youth in the scheme to help them become economically independent,” said chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal during the ceremonial launch of the scheme in Guwahati.To claim benefit of the scheme, the applicants will have to be below 40 years of age, must have passed Class X and should be part of existing self-help groups (SHGs).According to state finance and health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Re-SVAYEM is the biggest self-employment programme launched by any government in Assam since independence.“This scheme is aimed at providing working capital support to enterprising individuals and groups to undertake new activities or expanding existing enterprises,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-launches-self-employment-scheme-of-rs-1000-crore-to-help-2-lakh-youth-101611155008571.html

The farmers, however, want a complete withdrawal of the laws as a mere suspension of the laws for some period of time will not bring about any change, farmer leaders said on Wednesday after the 10th round of talks concluded. The next round of meeting will be held on January 22.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, however, is hopeful of a resolution in the next meeting. "I am happy that farmer unions have taken our proposal seriously and said that they would consider it tomorrow and consider their decision on January 22. I feel that the talks are progressing in the right direction and there is a possibility of finding a resolution soon," he said."Talks were held in a cordial atmosphere despite some 'naram-garam' moments," the minister said adding that it will be a victory for Indian democracy the day the protest ends.Click here for live updates of farmers' protestHere is where the farmers' protest stands now:1. This is for the first time the government has offered keep the farm laws suspended for 1.5 to 2 years. What the Centre conveyed earlier was contrary to this spirit. Union ministers had earlier urged farmers to let the laws be implemented for a few years and then decided.2. The apex court, on the other hand, mentioned staying the implementation of the laws until the stalemate gets resolved several times and in its last verdict it stayed the laws.3. The government on Wednesday once again offered to amend the laws as the 10th round of meeting started. The leaders stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the laws and alleged that the Centre was avoiding discussion on a legal guarantee for MSP.4. In the first two sessions of the day, there was no breakthrough as the discussion went on the beaten track of amending the laws.5. Then the centre proposed to keep the three farm laws suspended for a fixed time period of one year or so and form a committee comprising of farmer union leaders and government representatives.6. The ministers proposed that the laws would remain suspended till the committee gives its report and urged farmer unions to suspend their agitation till that time.7. Farmer leaders, however, did not consider this as any breakthrough. But some unions said a final decision would be taken after their own internal consultations on Thursday.8. The Supreme Court committee, set up to find a solution to the impasse, held its first meeting on Tuesday. It will start meeting various stakeholders from Thursday. It has been given a deadline of two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-major-breakthrough-centre-proposes-to-suspend-laws-for-2-years-next-meeting-on-january-22-101611152130487.html

The company operates oil and gas drilling sites in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.In the video, Kumar and Gogoi stated that they had been abducted by ULFA-I and Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) and appealed to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to get them released.“I have been abducted by NSCN-IM and ULFA-I due to their issues with my company and held hostage for a month. I appeal to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to talk with Assam CM and ensure my release,” Kumar says in the video.“Even after a month of our abduction, our company hasn’t initiated any measures to secure our release. I request the company to talk to both ULFA-I and NSCN-IM for my release. I appeal to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to save the life of a fellow Assamese,” Gogoi said in Assamese.On January 12, ULFA-I commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told local TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a ‘victim’ if the company did not pay the outfit its ‘due share’ for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region.Baruah added that Gogoi who is an Assamese will not be harmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebels-release-video-sos-of-2-oil-firm-workers-kidnapped-in-arunachal-pradesh-101611151644892.html

20-01-2021||India||India, Singapore sign pact on submarine rescue support||India and Singapore on Wednesday signed an implementing agreement on submarine rescue support and cooperation between their navies during the 5th Defence Minister’s Dialogue held over video conference, a joint statement said.The signing of an implementing agreement is very significant between two submarine operating navies, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd).“We have had a growing defence relationship with several ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members and naval cooperation between Singapore and India goes back to the early 1990s. Cooperation in submarine rescue enables sharing of resources and expertise and much faster response should an accident happen. It is cost-effective and, importantly, time-effective when time is the most critical factor,” Shrikhande said.In another move to deepen military cooperation, defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Singaporean counterpart Ng Eng Hen expressed their support to the early conclusion of agreements to facilitate live firing drills and to establish reciprocal arrangements for the cross-attendance of military courses.“Defence and security engagements between India and Singapore have broadened significantly in scale and scope across all three services of the armed forces as well as in the areas of defence technology and industry,” the statement said. The talks covered initiatives to enhance bilateral defence cooperation including the implementing agreement on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) cooperation in August 2020 for the two militaries to have closer operational collaboration in response to disasters.The cyber agencies of the two militaries have also deepened their engagements, officials said.During the virtual interaction, Singh complimented Singapore for the effectiveness of its pandemic mitigation measures and the contribution of that country’s armed forces in restricting the spread of Covid-19. He also highlighted the role of the Indian military in combating the pandemic and missions undertaken to repatriate Indians stranded abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-singapore-sign-pact-on-submarine-rescue-support-101611149679852.html

20-01-2021||India||Central agencies threatening our officials, says Kerala CM, Customs deny charge||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday accused central agencies of threatening and forcing state government officials to toe their line in the gold smuggling case and said that chief secretary Viswas Mehta has written to the Union Government about this.Replying to a question in the state assembly he said the assistant protocol officer who appeared before the Customs in connection with the gold smuggling case had complained that he was threatened to be implicated in the case and “forced to give a statement in a particular fashion.” He said the chief secretary had sent a letter to the Union Government describing “the bitter experience the assistant protocol officer was meted out by the Customs”.“State assistant protocol officer M S Harikrishnan had appeared before the Customs on January 5 following summons issued to him. On January 7 he sent a complaint to the chief secretary saying officials misbehaved with him and threatened to implicate him in the case. We condemn this irresponsible attitude,” said the CM while replying to a question by ruling party legislator V Joy.He said central agencies cannot intimidate government officials and demoralise them. Vijayan said the state was keen to ensure that there is no repeat of such incidents and it was duty-bound to protect its officials. “We can’t tolerate such indecent and immature behaviour” he said.The government had earlier raised a similar allegation against the Enforcement Directorate. Vijayan even wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to rein in central agencies alleging they were tarnishing the image of the government.The Customs denied the CM’s allegations. “We cannot conduct our investigation as per the directive of the state government. We have recorded all questioning sessions. These allegations are aimed at obstructing the ongoing investigation into the gold smuggling case,” said a senior official of the Customs.He said the Customs was yet to give a clean chit to state minister K T Jaleel and it will summon Speaker P Sivaramakrishnan next week.After the gold smuggling case surfaced in July, there were reports linking the main accused Swapna Suresh with the Speaker. He later acknowledged that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) consulate and attended some functions on her invitation. But opposition Congress and BJP leaders alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to West Asian countries.They also alleged the accused smuggled US dollars to the Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. The Speaker had denied these allegations and said he was ready for any probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-agencies-threatening-our-officials-says-kerala-cm-customs-deny-charge-101611148511257.html
20-01-2021||India||V K Sasikala taken to Bengaluru hospital after complaints of fever, breathing difficulty||With a week left for her release from Bengaluru prison, V K Sasikala on Wednesday has been taken to Bengaluru, after she suddenly complained of difficulty in breathing and fever. She has been taken to the Bowring and Lady Curzon government hospital in Bengaluru from the central prison, according to the news agency ANI.Sasikala, a close confidante of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalitha, was arrested in 2017 after the Supreme Court of India pronounced her term in a two-decade-old disproportionate assets case.After serving her term in the prison for more than four years and a fine of ₹10 crore was paid, Sasikala was set for release from the prison on January 27, 2021, according to her lawyer Raja Senthoor Pandian, who confirmed the news on Tuesday. He also said that Bengaluru prison authorities have confirmed the same to him.Also read: Sasikala to be released from jail on January 27“She has been having intermittent fever for the past week. Doctors in the prison have been treating her for the same. Since morning today, her oxygen level has been observed to be low. She will be taken to the hospital and would return back to the prison,” he said while talking with a Tamil TV news station on Wednesday.When asked if fever and drop in oxygen levels are symptoms of the Covid-19 disease, Pandian said doctors haven’t confirmed it, though she might be also tested for coronavirus infection while at the hospital.He also denied possibilities of her medical condition impacting her release from the prison. “On January 27, 2021, at 10am she will be released as I have already said. We have got an official letter regarding the matter and there are no changes in it. Until she is in the prison, her protection and medical complaints would be attended by the prison authorities,” he added.Tamil Nadu assembly elections are only months away and Sasikala’s return at such a time was highly anticipated. However, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami during his visit to Delhi on Tuesday ruled out all chances of her joining or leading the AIADMK party. “There is no chance of her joining. She is not in the AIADMK party,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/v-k-sasikala-taken-to-bengaluru-hospital-after-she-complains-of-fever-101611148047171.html

BJP members of Parliament Arjun Singh and Locket Chatterjee were also present at the rally.A section of TMC workers had raised the slogan at a roadshow in south Kolkata on Tuesday afternoon.“TMC workers should not have uttered it but the BJP has proved once again that it believes in the culture of violence in letter and spirit,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya tried to make a distinction between the slogans chanted by his party and the opposition Trinamool.“Our party does not endorse it at all. People carrying the BJP flag cannot talk like that. However, one must understand that when we talk of traitors of India we mean mercenaries and terrorists who kill innocent citizens and pose a threat to the nation. The intention of the TMC workers was quite different because they talked of traitors of Bengal,” he told the media in Kolkata.The incendiary slogan first made headlines when it was chanted by BJP leaders in rallies in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act amid nationwide protests against it. Union minister Anurag Thakur had raised the slogan last January against CAA protesters in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goli-maaro-slogan-for-2nd-day-in-bengal-this-time-at-bjp-rally-101611148087795.html
20-01-2021||India||Govt offers to amend farm laws; Farmer leaders insist on repeal||The government on Wednesday offered to amend the three contentious farm laws at their 10th round of talks with protesting unions but farmer leaders stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the Acts and alleged that the Centre was avoiding discussion on a legal guarantee for MSP.Farmer leaders said there was no breakthrough in the first two sessions as both sides were stuck on their stated positions vis-a-vis the three farm laws and there was little hope of any outcome other than fixing the date for the 11th round.Sources also said the government proposed to keep the three farm laws suspended for a fixed time period of one year or so and form a committee comprising of farmer union leaders and government representatives.The ministers proposed that the laws would remain suspended till the committee gives its report and urged farmer unions to suspend their agitation till that time, sources added.The proposal, however, did not find any support from the farm leaders.The laws have already been stayed till further orders by the Supreme Court, which has formed a committee to resolve the deadlock. The committee, which had its first meeting on Tuesday, has been asked to give its report in two months.Farmer leaders also raised the issue of NIA notices being served to some farmers, alleging it was being done just to harass those supporting the agitation, to which the government representatives said they will look into the matter.The two sides took a break after around one hour of discussions when farmer leaders had langar food.During the break, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) general secretary Yudhvir Singh told PTI, "The stalemate is continuing over the three laws and I don't think any solution will emerge from today's meeting. Both sides are adamant on their position."He said the government is insisting on first discussing the three laws and wants to take up the MSP (Minimum Support Price) matter later."We will insist on a discussion on MSP after the tea break and also try to seek the next date for meeting before January 26," Singh said.Another farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said, "The government is not ready to repeal the three laws and farmers are not ready for amendments. The government doesn't want to discuss MSP.""No solution will emerge from today's meeting. We will meet again on the next date," he said.Tikait also said the union leaders raised the NIA (National Investigation Agency) issue in the meeting, to which the ministers said they will look into it.The meeting began at around 2.45 pm with the three ministers greeting farmer leaders on the occasion of Gurupurab. The meeting resumed at around 5.15 pm after a lunch break, but the two sides took another break at around 6 pm.During the second break, farmer leader Kavitha Kuruganti said the meeting began with the NIA issue, followed by unions' demand for a repeal of the laws.The farmer leaders presented multiple Parliament replies given by the agriculture minister where he had stated that agriculture is a state subject, while one reply mentioned even agri-marketing as a state subject.She said the discussion did not appear progressing anywhere."The government offered to carry out some amendments, but farmer leaders maintained they do not want anything less than a complete repeal of the laws," Tikait said.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding the talks with the representatives of around 40 farmer unions at the Vigyan Bhawan here.Before the meeting, the three ministers also met senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.The tenth round of talks was initially scheduled on January 19, but later got postponed to Wednesday.In the last round of talks, the government had asked protesting farmers to prepare a concrete proposal about their objections and suggestions on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting to end the long-running protest. But, unions stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws. Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati are the other three members on the panel.On Tuesday, the SC panel held its first meeting in the national capital.Under attack from protesting unions for their "pro-government" public stand on three contentious farm laws, the members of the committee said that they would keep aside their own ideology and views while consulting various stakeholders, even as they indicated a complete repeal won't augur well for much-needed agriculture reforms.Earlier in the day, a group of farm union leaders met top officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police to discuss the route and arrangements for their tractor rally on January 26 to protest against the three farm laws.But the unions rejected a suggestion by police officers to hold their rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway instead of Delhi's Outer Ring Road, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-offers-to-amend-farm-laws-farmer-leaders-insist-on-repeal-101611147502412.html
20-01-2021||India||Kerala, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh add more bird flu deaths amid second wave||There appears to be a second wave of bird flu hitting Indian states with fresh cases of the disease reported from Kerala and suspected cases from Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.The first case of bird flu was reported from Jhalawar in Rajasthan on December 29 and slowly the virus, deadly for birds but not humans, spread to 10 other states, resulting in the deaths of thousands of birds. The animal husbandry departments of state governments have culled lakhs of birds to prevent the spread of the disease.On Wednesday, Kerala was put on high alert after fresh cases of bird flu were reported from Alappuzha, said the state animal husbandry department, following the Bhopal based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases confirming presence of the virus in at least 300 samples.The officials said the culling of birds will begin on Thursday and in the first phase 5000, mostly ducks, will be destroyed. In January first week at least 80,000 ducks and 10,000 chickens were culled in Alappuzha and Kottayam districts and the Centre had rushed a high-level team to the state. The state government had announced ₹100 per bird to compensate poultry farmers.Fresh cases were reported a few days after the state made a claim that the flu was localised and contained effectively. The animal husbandry department has called an emergency meeting in the evening to review the situation. Later experts had identified the latest virus strain H5N8 and said it was less pathogenic when compared to H5N5 detected in the area in 2016.In Chhattisgarh, at least 45 mynas were found dead near a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in Bijapur district of Bastar region, officials said on Wednesday. Samples of five mynas have been sent for avian influenza tests, they said.“There is a CRPF camp in Naimad area where the carcasses of the birds were found on Monday and Tuesday. We rushed to the spot and sent five dead birds for tests on Tuesday evening,” said AP Dohare, Deputy Director of Veterinary Services.He said that no signs of bird flu have been found in the domestic birds of the district but precautions are being taken. Till now, Bijapur has not reported any bird flu cases but transportation of poultry birds and products to the district has been stopped. In Chhattisgarh, the first confirmed bird flu case was reported from poultry in Balod district on January 14. On Monday, bird flu was reported in two more districts, Bastar and Dantewada, which comes under Bastar region which is a thickly forested area of Chhattisgarh.In Jharkhand, around 200 pigeons were found dead in Hazaribagh and authorities have rushed teams there. The local villagers said that they had buried the carcasses of birds themselves as the district animal husbandry department officials did not respond, a charge denied by officials.“We have sent teams to take samples,” a department official said. The department has so far sent 4,300 samples of birds from across the state to a Kolkata lab for bird flu testing but no deaths because of the virus has been confirmed yet.Bird flu, also known as Avian Flu, is a variety of influenza caused by a virus in birds. It can spread to humans and can trigger person to person transmission, experts say. There are many varieties of viruses and H7N9 is considered most dangerous among them, they say. According to the World Health Organization there are many subtypes of avian influenza virus and only some of them will be dangerous to humans. Migratory birds are reported to be the main carriers of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-jharkhand-and-chhattisgarh-add-more-bird-flu-deaths-amid-second-wave-101611145835299.html
20-01-2021||India||Gupkar Alliance puts up brave face after Sajjad Lone’s exit||A day after Peoples’ Conference leader Sajjad Lone pulled his party out of the Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD or Gupkar Alliance), two other leaders of the grouping said it will continue to work for people of Jammu and Kashmir and restoration of the erstwhile state's special status.CPI (M) general secretary Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami who is one of the senior most leaders of the alliance said that while Lone’s exit is unfortunate it is not a setback.Lone, who was also the PAGD spokesperson. had exited over the issue of fielding of proxy candidates by constituent parties against the officially mandated candidates of the alliance during District Development Council (DDC) elections in November-December."The exit of Sajjad Lone is not good for alliance or people. The DDC elections took place soon after the PAGD was formed. No one denies that there could have been shortcomings in the PAGD but they could have been rectified from within and not from the outside," Tarigami said.He also said the PAGD leadership will be meeting soon to discuss pressing matters. "We need to broaden the base of the alliance by including more people and groups as we have not reached a significant section of people in J&K and Ladakh. We alone can’t fight it and need more people and groups as part of the alliance."Awami National Conference vice president, Muzaffar Shah who is also senior member of PAGD said that the alliance came into being for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35A and that Lone was wrong to quit."Elections are a minor thing. If Lone took a decision it was his choice but to me his decision was wrong. PAGD is much stronger even today. All three regions are together for the restoration of Articles 370 and 35 A. The matter is in court. Our case in the court is water tight. Let the court begin its hearing and you will see what PAGD will do. Our job is to get the crown back," said Shah who is a nephew of Farooq Abdullah.He said that it is the Centre’s effort to weaken the PAGD’s fight for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. "Our minor issues will not weaken our major resolve."On Tuesday, Lone wrote to PAGD chairperson and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah saying that the Peoples’ Conference decided to part ways with the PAGD over the issue of fielding of proxy candidates by constituent parties against the officially mandated candidates of the alliance during DDC elections.“No party is willing to cede space; no party is willing to sacrifice. We fought against each other in Kashmir province not against the perpetrators of August 5 (2019). And those who perpetrated August 5 and their minions are now vocally gleeful. It is difficult for us to stay on and pretend as if nothing has happened,” Lone wrote.“Trust between allying partners who have been rivals all along can be very elusive and extremely fragile. Proxies have made it perpetually elusive. This alliance needed sacrifice,” he said.The PAGD was formed on October 20, 2020 after six political parties, some of them rivals, – National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, CPI (M), Awami National Conference, Peoples’ Conference and Peoples’ Movement came together to fight for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution that was revoked by the Centre on August 5, 2019.Sources said Lone's exit from the PAGD could give his party a chance to head the chairmanship of two DDC councils in Kupwara and Baramulla districts. The Peoples’ Conference leadership was already eyeing those two districts in north Kashmir which it considers as its bastion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-alliance-puts-up-brave-face-after-sajjad-lone-s-exit-101611145770151.html
20-01-2021||India||'Obviously': Minister on whether beneficiaries were aware of Covaxin fine print||Defying detractors on social media who are raising questions over the transparency of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin as the company released a fact sheet after the emergency vaccination drive began in the country, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday took to social media and said it was quite obvious that beneficiaries were made aware of all the conditions. Thinking that they were not made aware, on the contrary, is as "naive and presumptuous as boorish", the minister wrote on her Twitter handle answering to a question."It's OBVIOUS, Govt advisory shared on social media is made available at ground level first," the health minister wrote.'Advisable to not take vaccine if...': Bharat Biotech issues Covaxin fact sheetClearly as naive & presumptuous as boorish!It's OBVIOUS, Govt advisory shared on social media is made available at ground level first.It is evident your propensity for unfruitful discourse has no bounds, no point in expecting you to focus your energy on anything constructive. https://t.co/KedVYNJO7dOn January 3, the Drug Control General of India gave emergency-use authorisation to Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. The nod for Covaxin was in clinical mode trial wich specified that beneficiaries will have to sign a consent form before vaccination and they will also be monitored.The Centre sent a detailed fact sheet of both the vaccines to all states. The consent form for Covaxin also became public on January 16, the day the vaccination drive began in India.On January 19, Bharat Biotech on its website uploaded a fact sheet which says if a person has allergies, fever or bleeding disorder or in on a blood thinner, then it is not advisable for him or her to take the vaccine. Pregnant, lactating women, people suffering from immuno-compromised situation are also advised to take the vaccine.This led to another battle of barbs with several opposition leaders questioning whether the beneficiaries were aware of these terms and conditions.Terming this as fear-mongering and spreading misinformation, the health minister had slammed these "over-reactions" and clarified that these facts have been in the public domain. On Wednesday, he reiterated that by public domain, he doesn't mean social media. All information were made available at ground level first, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obviously-minister-harsh-vardhan-on-whether-beneficiaries-were-aware-of-covaxin-fine-print-101611143914571.html
20-01-2021||India||India a ‘bipartisan success story’: Biden’s pick for secretary of state||China presents the “most significant challenge” to the US whereas India has been a “bipartisan success story” with which the incoming Biden administration can deepen cooperation in many ways, Antony Blinken, the nominee for the post of secretary of state, has said. Blinken, a career diplomat who served as deputy national security advisor and deputy secretary of state under former president Barack Obama, made the remarks during a hearing before the US Senate foreign relations committee to confirm him for the position. His remarks signalled that the Biden administration is likely to adopt an approach towards India and China that is largely on the lines of the position assumed by President Donald Trump, though experts have said president-elect Joe Biden is likely to be less confrontational than his predecessor. Also Read: How inauguration day 2021 will be the most unique in American history“As we look at China, there is no doubt that it poses the most significant challenge of any nation state to the US in terms of our interests, the interests of the American people,” Blinken said in response to questions from senators. The US-China relationship includes “rising adversarial aspects”, some competitive aspects and some cooperative aspects when it is in the mutual interest of both countries to work together, he said. On India, Blinken adopted a position that has been trotted out by many senior American leaders in recent years – that the relationship with New Delhi has widespread bipartisan support in Washington, or backing from both the Republican and Democratic parties. “I think India has been very much been a bipartisan success story over successive administrations. It started...toward the end of the Clinton administration, after the nuclear tests when relations were put back on a better footing,” he said. “I think there are many ways in which we can deepen that cooperation to pursue the path that successive administrations have put us on,” he added. Blinken noted that Biden had, as a senator, led the efforts in the foreign relations committee to push through the India-US civil nuclear deal under then president George W Bush. “I think during the Obama administration, we deepened cooperation with India, particularly in the defence procurement area, also on information-sharing,” he said. The Trump administration had carried forward the cooperation, including “with this concept of an Indo-Pacific and to make sure that we were working with India so that no country in the region, including China, could challenge its sovereignty and also working with it on concerns that we share about terrorism”, Blinken said. One area with potential for greater collaboration is climate change, he said. India is poised to catch up to China in terms of the emissions over the next two or three decades, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been a strong advocate of renewable energy and technologies, creating strong potential for jointly working in this area, he said. Blinken endorsed the tough stance taken by Trump towards China but said he differed on the methods adopted by the outgoing president in a number of areas. The US has to start by approaching China “from a position of strength, not weakness” and this has to be done by working with allies, leading international institutions, and standing up for values such as human rights in Xinjiang and the trampling of democracy in Hong Kong, he said. “I also believe President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China. I disagree very much with the way that he went about it in a number of areas but the basic principle was the right one and I think that’s actually helpful to our foreign policy,” he said. For decades, China had a policy of “hiding their hand and biding their time” in terms of asserting its interests beyond the country’s borders, but following the rise of President Xi Jinping, the “hiding and biding has gone away and they are much more assertive in making clear that they seek to become in effect the leading country in the world and sets the norms”, Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-bipartisan-success-story-biden-s-pick-for-secretary-of-state-101611144245730.html

The wood paneled studio was reduced to ashes and took with it several limited edition guitars. Among those was a limited edition diamond studded 60th anniversary Stratocaster guitar made by Fender Music Instruments Corporation, USA. It was one among 1954 guitars that were made worldwide in 2014 to commemorate 60 years of the iconic Stratocaster guitar that first made its debut in 1954.Almeida also lost another limited edition guitar that had its metal parts including keys flats plated with 20 microns gold and which too had been released as part of a commemorative anniversary.Other guitars he lost included a Les Paul 120th anniversary edition as well as guitars autographed by singers like Charley Pride, an American Guitarist and Baseball player, the Bellamy Brothers and Keith Urban, an Australian singer and songwriter.“I had built my collection over three decades with the help of my friend who used to work at a guitar shop in Muscat (Oman) and every time a limited edition guitar was introduced he used to give me a heads up and ask me if I wanted one. It also included the very first guitar that was gifted to me by then girlfriend who is today my wife,” says Almeida who is in his mid-50s.“Each of the guitars would have cost ₹3-4 lakh in today’s market price. Not a trace of the guitars or the diamonds was found,” Almeida told HT.Almeida said he was initially heartbroken and didn’t hope to rebuild his collection.“Only about six guitars which were with me in my practise room did we manage to save and the rest were all destroyed. It was my friends who encouraged me to restart the collections and started keeping an eye out for rare guitars. I have also bought guitars from others who had rare guitars but were willing to sell since they needed the money,” Almeida said.“Some of the guitars in the collection are not replaceable as those musicians who signed them are no longer alive, but I will have others” he said.“If I have bought from a collector who was doing a distress sale especially a musician who was out of work during the pandemic I have told him that he can take it back at any time when things get better,” Almeida said.But for several other guitars he got more than what he bargained for. After hearing of his lost guitar collection, the Bellamy Brothers, a famous country music troupe in America, signed guitars and other paraphernalia to be included as part of his collection.Randy Hiebert, lead guitarist of Bellamy Brothers, posted another message: “Wow!!! I'm so blown away and honored by this my brother!!! Losing your entire collection was a heartbreaker for sure... but this, THIS is the way to heal it my friend! Beautiful display, thanks for the love Sabby!!”Almeida’s tryst with music began during his younger days. Born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, Almeida’s family moved back to Goa as part of the exodus of Goans from East Africa that coincided with the end of the British rule there and he went on to start and be part of several live music bands in Goa as well as in Muscat.The collection now boasts of an oil can guitar from South Africa, guitars signed by friends and well wishers as well as the autographed guitars that he is collecting through visits to live performances wherever he can.The collection now stands at 82 guitars, 20 more than what he last had when he lost it all in the fire. This time he hopes it is here to stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goan-guitarist-rebuilds-collection-of-rare-guitars-he-lost-in-fire-two-years-ago-101611142674887.html

The villagers burst firecrackers and distributed sweets on Wednesday while children held placards of Harris.“We feel proud as though India has won an Olympic gold medal,” said Vinod Pulavendran, a resident of the village and an employee of the Trichy airport. “It is common for Indians to become American citizens, but how often does an Indian become the vice president of the US? She has put us on the map,” he added.Joe Biden will take oath as the 46th President of the United States on January 20 and Harris will be the vice-president, becoming the first woman to hold the position besides being the first African-American woman and first person of Indian-origin to have achieved that.The Dharmasastha Temple in Thulasendhirapuram conducted a special pooja for Harris as her maternal grandfather PV Gopalan was born in this village and her family has been offering donations to the temple. Her late mother Shyamala Gopalan’s younger sister Dr Sarala Gopalan visited the temple last December soon after the results made it clear that Harris will be vice president.A placard in the temple bears the name of Kamala Harris. “We are planning to invite Kamala to the temple through her aunt,” said temple in-charge SV Ramanan.Ever since Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate, the village has been celebrating by conducting special poojas and erecting flex banners praising Harris.When the US presidential elections were held in November, local leaders here offered annadhanam (free food for the poor). They had offered idli-sambhar which Harris revealed is her favorite south Indian dish, relished during her childhood visits to Chennai with her mother who was born in the city and later moved to the US.“Her victory is a motivation for the entire village to dream of achieving something,” said Arulmozhi Sudhakar, a local village head of Thulasendhirapuram. “We hope she visits us as it is her roots.”Harris particularly struck a chord with Tamil people and her heritage when she called out to her ‘chithis’ (referring to a parent’s younger sister in Tamil) during her speech in August at the Democratic National Convention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/like-winning-olympic-gold-kamala-harris-village-gears-up-for-her-oath-taking-101611136405241.html
20-01-2021||India||Farm laws: SC irked over criticism of court-appointed committee members||Faced with criticism over the appointment of a four-member committee to hear farmers’ point of view on the validity of farm laws, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said there was no question of bias as the committee has not been given any adjudicatory powers.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was hearing an application moved by Bhartiya Kisan Party that demanded filling up of a vacancy in the committee due to the resignation of member Bhupinder Singh Mann. Advocate Ajay Chaudhary, representing this farmers’ union, argued that there was apprehension among the farmers based on the other members’ opinions in favour of the laws as reported in newspapers.The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, issued a notice to the Centre on the application and said, “You can’t brand people like this and cast aspersions on Court.. . .We have serious objections on people whom we have appointed being called names and that this Court has interest in selecting them. We will decide on Constitutionality of the laws but we will not expose the members whom we appointed to such maligning based on public opinion decided by majority. “Chaudhary pointed out news clippings where committee members openly expressed their view in favour of the three farm laws—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.“Where is the question of bias when the Committee is not given any power to adjudicate. We have asked them to hear the grievances of farmers and give us a report.”Regarding Mann, the court said he had sought modifications to the farm laws.“You unthinkingly cast aspersions on people because they have expressed some opinion in the past and you think they are disqualified to sit in the Committee. This has become a culture of branding people whom you do not want and criticising them. The reputation of people we appointed has been torn to shreds. Public opinion is important but it is not determinative for the Court to decide.”The CJI said that the only interest of the court was to find a solution to the dispute and that’s why the Supreme Court on January 12 formed a committee of four experts. Mann resigned from the committee, leaving three others— Pramod Kumar Joshi, Ashok Gulati and Anil Ghanwat of Shetkeri Sangathana.“They are the most brilliant minds in the field of agriculture. Do you think they don’t understand the subject. Even the best of judges have given an opinion but have later delivered judgment taking an opposite view,” said the bench.Advocate Prashant Bhushan informed the court that the eight farmer unions he represented did not wish to appear before the committee. “We are convinced that these laws need to be repealed. We don’t want to discuss amendments. The unions are proposing a tractor rally on January 26 to peacefully protest.”The bench asked Bhushan about his absence on January 12 when it constituted the committee after taking consent of the farmers’ unions. It added that it was not its mandate to force the unions to go before the committee but asked Bhushan to counsel his clients to stop agitating and ensure Delhi citizens of complete peace.“In democracy, other than repeal, the power to set aside a law lies with the Court. We are seized of it. But we request you to stop the agitation,” the bench said.Attorney General KK Venugopal informed the court that 5,000 tractors are sought to be brought in that day. In this connection, even an application by Delhi Police was pending before Court seeking an injunction against holding of a tractor rally.The Supreme Court said, “These are matters purely in the domain of the executive. We consider it highly irregular and improper to disallow any rally or procession. It is for police to grant permission. You are the executive of the country. You are free to take any action.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested the court to keep the matter pending till January 25 in view of the situation’s development. The bench refused and asked police to withdraw its application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-sc-irked-over-criticism-of-court-appointed-committee-members-101611135544809.html
20-01-2021||India||TMC MP asks PM Modi to publish controversial book on Netaji, IMA||Trinamool Congress (TMC) member of Parliament Sukhendu Sekhar Roy has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to publish a controversial book on the role played by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA) in India’s freedom struggle between 1942 and 1945.“The history division of MoD [ministry of defence) had prepared a full-fledged book under the leadership of noted historian Pratul Gupta on the role played by Netaji and Azad Hind Fauj [INA] in India’s freedom struggle during the period 1942 – 45. Unfortunately, the book didn’t see the light of the day till date,” he said.Roy claimed to have received an anonymous letter with an official note exchanged between the MoD and the ministry of external affairs (MoEA) a few years back. He said that according to that note, pages 186 -191 of the unpublished book could add to the view that Netaji may have not have died but survived the plane crash in August 1945. Hindustan Times could not verify the authenticity of the note.Also read | Parakram Diwas: All you need to know about Bose anniversary controversy“In the note, the MoD had wanted to know from the MoEA whether publishing the book may in any way harm India’s relations with any countries. The MoEA gave a green signal to publish the book. The MoEA note, however, says that pages 186-191 would likely to be more controversial as those only added to the view that Netaji may have escaped alive from the plane crash,” Roy wrote.He added in 2009, Chandrachur Ghose, a researcher from Haryana, filed a PIL saying that either he should be given a copy of that book or it should be published. In September 2010, the then chief information commissioner directed the Centre to either hand over a draft copy of the book to Ghose or publish that book. The then government moved the Delhi High Court, where the case is still pending.“On June 7, I had sent a letter, urging the Prime Minister that as his government was committed to declassifying all files related to Netaji, the Centre may file an application before the high court saying that it was ready to publish the edited version of the book. The PM acknowledged my letter but thereafter no steps were taken. This is very unfortunate,” said Roy.On January 19, he again wrote a letter to the Prime Minister with a similar content requesting that the Centre should publish the book and all files related to Netaji.He said that in 2015, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee declassified all the files related to Netaji. Since then, they are displayed at the Kolkata Police Museum. A few months later in 2016, with an eye on the West Bengal assembly polls, the Union government declassified around 100 files. Later another 100 files were declassified in two phases.“They [the Centre] however say that around 350 files have been declassified over which I have serious doubts. I have a strong feeling that still the PMO [Prime Minister’s Office], IB [Intelligence Bureau], defence ministry and external affairs ministry are yet to declassify many secret files. I have raised several questions on this in the Rajya Sabha but every time I got half-truth and my questions were evaded,” said Roy.“Yesterday I have sent a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office and it has been received. A copy has also been forwarded to the Union defence minister Rajnath Singh.”The request comes three days ahead of the 125th birth anniversary of Bose, which the Centre is celebrating as Parakram Divas (day of valour). TMC has alleged it was not consulted in the decision-making process for Parakram Diwas and wants the day to be celebrated as Desh Nayak Diwas (the national hero’s day).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-writes-to-pm-modi-to-publish-controversial-book-on-netaji-ima-101611135304888.html

Hence, the number of complaints is higher than that of actual bird deaths.”As of now, Mumbai has reported two confirmed bird flu deaths. In the state, more than 6,000 birds have been culled but none in Mumbai yet.Also read | Bird flu spreads among poultry in 5 of 11 afflicted states despite cullingDeonar abattoir general manager, Dr Yogesh Shetye, said, “We have not undertaken culling of any bird because of bird flu yet. All deaths that are being reported in Mumbai are of crows, pigeons and other birds. However, no death of any chicken has been reported yet.”Since the outbreak of bird flu in the city, Byculla zoo authorities in Mumbai are on high alert as the zoo is home to over 200 exotic and aquatic birds.A zoo official said, “At Byculla zoo, there is no mingling of caged birds with migratory birds, and hence we have not reported any symptom of bird flu or any case.”The BMC’s market department is also conducting visits to retailers and wholesalers dealing in poultry since for two weeks now in order to create awareness about bird flu.Meanwhile, since the outbreak of bird flu, the demand for chicken has gone down by 5-15%, according to poultry sellers’ association in Maharashtra, while that of meat and sea food has risen, leading to price hike in these products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/avian-flu-1-795-complaints-of-bird-deaths-in-mumbai-says-bmc-101611134464801.html

The driver of the car, 25-year-old S Amrut, has been booked under Section 304 (ii) (punishment for an act that is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death), of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), said police.CCTV footage shows that while the policemen, identified as B Raveendran, 32 and V Karthik, 34, were taking a right turn on their bike, the speeding black BMW, hit them, throwing them off the two-wheeler. The accident occurred near a private school in Chennai’s Mogappair East while the policemen were on their way to work in Koyambedu.Raveendran, who was riding the bike, died on the spot while Karthik, the pillion rider, succumbed to his injuries at a government hospital around 11am, police said.“It wasn’t a case of drunk driving,” said inspector Hari, who is attached to the Thirumangalam traffic investigation police station. Amrut and two of his friends, all in their early 20s, were in the BMW.“All of them, including the driver, are students who were returning home early morning from a birthday party. The driver was speeding and couldn’t control the car,” the inspector added.The driver has been remanded to two weeks’ judicial custody at the Saidapet jail. City police commissioner Mahesh Aggarwal tweeted that they ‘lost two brave hearts to reckless driving’ and that Raveendran and Karthik were riding wearing helmets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/speeding-bmw-kills-2-cops-in-chennai-driver-held-101611132445900.html

While innovation has always been pivotal for higher productivity and economic growth, it is also crucial for bolstering a post-crisis economy. In this light, the foresight of the Central government in fostering a culture of innovation through initiatives like the Atal Innovation Mission, Startup India, etc. is laudable,” Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said. “The second edition of the index will allow states to continue to evaluate their innovation environment and assess their progress. The division of innovation into two dimensions, namely innovation capabilities (Enablers) and innovation outcomes (Performance) will give the states a better perspective for identifying the critical focus areas.,” he added.The last edition of the India Innovation Index, released in October 2019, was a first-of-its-kind metric for assessing the innovation capabilities of Indian states and Union Territories.“Since then, India, and the world, have undergone a tectonic shift due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With the pandemic triggering an economic shutdown, the role of innovation to revitalise the economy, has never been more important,” the report said.The 2020 edition builds on the previous year’s methodology by introducing more metrics to provide a more holistic outlook of the Indian economy. The framework is updated to include globally considered parameters for measuring innovation, such as the percentage of GDP spent on research and development, while keeping them specific to the Indian economy, it noted. Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, “I hope that the India Innovation Index 2020 can help the country in recognising the key areas of developmental intervention, with innovation as the central driver for growth. NITI Aayog will continue to take such initiatives that play a significant role in promoting cooperative and competitive federalism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-innovation-index-ranking-out-karnataka-retains-top-spot-101611132725202.html
20-01-2021||India||Pakistan names general envoy to Saudi Arabia as military seeks control of ties||Lt Gen Bilal Akbar has been named Pakistan’s new envoy to Saudi Arabia, with the move signalling the military establishment’s desire take control of bilateral ties that have witnessed turbulence in recent months, according to a media report on Wednesday. Akbar will replace ambassador Raja Ali Ejaz, who is retiring in May. Ejaz, a career diplomat, has been Pakistan’s ambassador in Riyadh since January 2019. Akbar’s appointment on the “recommendation of the General Headquarters indicates military’s desire to take control of the bilateral ties that have lately been hit by turbulence to prevent them from further deterioration”, the influential Dawn newspaper reported. Also Read: Sena questions Centre over reports of China building village in ArunachalPakistan was perturbed by Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane’s recent visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia – the first by an Indian service chief to both West Asian countries. Experts have said the move by both countries was a signal regarding enhancing defence and security ties with India. Saudi Arabia has also sought the early repayment of a $3 billion loan, extended in 2018 to Pakistan to help the country tide over its economic problems, amid the Covid-19 crisis. Observers had pointed to this development as an indicator of the dip in ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The Pakistani ambassador’s position in Riyadh has often been held by retired military officers, reflecting the fact that defence ties form the bedrock of bilateral ties, the Dawn reported. Riyadh has become “closer to New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was invited to the key financial conference and the two countries launched a Strategic Partnership Council to guide their relations”, the report added. Retired Pakistani generals are appointed against a 20% quota for political appointees. Besides the mission in Riyadh, Pakistan’s envoys to Brunei, Jordan, Syria, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, the Maldives, Nigeria and Libya are also retired armed forces officers. Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government has rarely made political appointments to ambassadorial posts, and most of the quota for non-careerists is being taken up by retired military officials, the report said.

In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena said that the country awaits a similar cross-border action against China as was ordered after Uri and Pulwama attacks originated from the Pakistani soil.NDTV has reported that China has built the new village of 101 homes about 4.5 km “within Indian territory of the de facto border” between the two countries, citing satellite imagery from Planet Labs, a private US-based imaging company.Also read | Remember his promise: Rahul Gandhi targets PM over Chinese village in ArunachalThe Sena called the report shocking and concerning. It asked what was the strong government doing when the village was constructed. “What China did in Ladakh, now it is doing in Arunachal Pradesh. China has made a whole village inside Arunachal Pradesh. How did nobody come to know about this? If anyone makes a small house, the neighbours get to know about it. Here, a whole village has been built, with proper structures, and nobody came to know about it? All this did not come up in a night.”The editorial asked if the Centre will demolish the illegal structures inside India’s borders or will suffer silently. “Whenever there is illegal construction, officials of a local municipal corporation visit the site and demolish the structure. India has the right to keep aside international law and exercise this right to demolishing it. The question, however, is whether we will exercise this right or suffer the blow of Chinese shamelessness silently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-questions-centre-over-reports-of-china-building-village-in-arunachal-101611130030024.html

"The government has to make legislation on Minimum Support Price and repeal the three farm laws. Our protest is against the government and the corporate system," said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) which is spearheading the movement.Leaders of all 40 farm unions which are taking part in the protest will meet three cabinet ministers of the government for talks this afternoon in an effort to end the impasse.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar also assured that the government will hear the proposal with an "open mind".Tens of thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are agitating against three farm laws enacted by the government in September last year. The central government has projected the laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these laws will remain and have offered to make amendments into the law.The contentious farm laws are farmers are the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the legislation till further orders.

20-01-2021||India||Maharashtra to launch counselling drive to improve Covid vaccination numbers||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said the state health department has decided to launch a information, education and communication (IEC) drive and go for the counselling of health care workers (HCW) to improve the Covid vaccination percentage among them. The decision has been taken after the second day of the vaccination drive saw a 10 per cent fall, down to 54 from 64 per cent on day one on January 16.The minister said the low turnout was due to the technical glitches witnessed in the Co-WIN app and because of the apprehension among the beneficiaries about the probable side effects of the vaccine.“I would not call the turnout low, as Maharashtra saw among the highest responses in the country on day one. It is true that all the HCWs enrolled are not coming up for the vaccination, but we should not go into the percentage of the turnout. To improve it further, I am releasing a video appealing to our HCWs to come forward and set an example for others about the drive. Ultimately, they are the message givers and idols for many,” he said.Tope said both the vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - are safe for use and there has been no incident of any major reaction after vaccination.“We still are facing technical problems with the Co-WIN app and some beneficiaries find their names cancelled after the initial enrolment. Second, the HCWs are still hesitant over safety and want to first gauge the efficacy for a few days of the drive. Because of these two reasons the turnout is not up to the mark,” Tope said.The minister said that there should not be any apprehension about Bharat Biotech Limited’s Covaxin as it has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India and ratified by the scientists as safe for use.The ministers were not participating in the drive, Tope said, as it’s against the set protocol of the vaccination. “First two phases are meant for HCWs and frontline workers and I would not break the rules set by the Centre. I would be the first person to go for it, when my turn comes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-to-launch-counselling-drive-to-improve-covid-vaccination-numbers-101611128258681.html

We are not going to pass the orders. You are the authority to take action," Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told the Centre.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for eight farm unions seeking to take out the tractor rally, told the court that the farmers have no intention to breach peace. However, Attorney General KK Venugopal argued, “5000 tractors are coming into the city. It certainly can't be maintained on roads. They will go everywhere. Bhushan is well intentioned that peace will be maintained. In Karnal, the farmers destroyed the pandal. There was a law and order situation and CM Haryana could not meet them. The police will take a call.”The court told the farmers to assure the citizens of Delhi of complete peace and told the Centre to ask authorities how the march can be peaceful. “These are matters purely in the domain of the executive,” the top court said.Later in the day, a group of farm union leaders will meet top officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police to discuss the route and arrangements for their tractor rally on January 26 to protest against the three farm laws, a union leader was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Slamming the criticism against the members of the panel it appointed to discuss the matter, the Supreme Court asked, “Where is the question of bias when the committee is not given any power of adjudication?” The top court also issued a notice to the Centre on an application by Bhartiya Kisan Party for filling up vacancy in the four-member Committee after Bhupinder Singh Mann of BKU recused himself from it.The top court had, on January 12, stayed the implementation of the three laws passed by Parliament in September. The farmers who have been protesting for 56 days now want a complete roll-back of the legislation, however, the government has ruled out that possibility and has offered to make amendments. .As nine rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have remained inconclusive, they will meet later this afternoon for the 10th round of talks in an effort to end the impasse over the three contentious agricultural laws enacted during the monsoon session of Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-for-police-to-decide-sc-refuses-to-rule-on-plea-against-farmers-proposed-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-centre-withdraws-plea-101611127531705.html
20-01-2021||India||Bhutan, Maldives first to benefit from India’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’||Bhutan and the Maldives on Wednesday became the first countries in India’s neighbourhood to benefit from the government’s rollout of millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines under a grant assistance programme dubbed “Vaccine Maitri”. Two aircraft took off several hours apart, carrying 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccine for Thimphu and 100,000 doses for Male. The external affairs ministry had announced on Tuesday that India would begin providing doses as grant assistance to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles from Wednesday. India also plans to supply vaccines neighbouring and key partner countries such as Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, from which confirmation of regulatory clearances is awaited. “India fulfils commitment to give vaccines to humanity. Supplies to our neighbours will start on 20th January. The Pharmacy of the World will deliver to overcome the COVID challenge,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted regarding the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative. With the shipping of supplies to Bhutan and the Maldives, India also became the first country to provide South Asian nations with vaccines as aid. This comes against the backdrop of three meetings held by China with Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh since July last year to discuss Covid-19 cooperation. Supplies of two million doses of Covishield to be provided to Bangladesh as aid will begin from Thursday, and a formal announcement about supplies to Nepal is expected on Wednesday. Bhutan Prime Minister Lotay Tshering had earlier congratulate Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the launch of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive and said he hoped it would come as an “answer to pacify all the sufferings we have endured [during] this pandemic”. According to a statement from the Bhutan Prime Minister’s Office, Thimphu plans to stockpile vaccines, including the 150,000 doses from India, and carry out the first round of vaccinations for all citizens within a week. Bhutan’s the nationwide vaccination programme will be rolled out “only when we have sufficient doses for all the targeted population”, the statement said. “We are well on track with health facilities and human resource planning. That time, movement of people will be stopped for one week. The second dose of the vaccine will be administered in the same arrangement four weeks after the first dose,” it added. Also Read: India ‘deeply honoured’ to meet the world’s healthcare needs: PM ModiWith a targeted vaccine population of more than 533,000, Bhutan needs around 1.2 million doses. The Prime Minister’s Office also said the vaccination drive will be rolled out after an “inauspicious month” between February 14 and March 13. However, it said this wait will help Bhutan learn from “experiences, possible side effects and lessons” of other countries that have rolled out vaccination programmes. India had earlier provided essential medicines and medical supplies, including paracetamol, hydroxychloroquine and PPEs worth more than ₹2.8 crore to Bhutan. It also expedited the release of ₹501 crore for priority projects to counter challenges brought on by the pandemic. The Maldives’ government has reciprocated India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy with its own “India First” policy. During a visit to Male last November, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had said India will accord priority to the Maldives for providing vaccines. In September 2020, India provided urgent financial aid worth $250 million to the Maldives through investment government bonds by the State Bank of India. This was the first aid package of such magnitude announced by India for any country to deal with the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhutan-maldives-first-to-benefit-from-india-s-vaccine-maitri-101611127804320.html

20-01-2021||India||Bird flu spreads among poultry in 5 of 11 afflicted states despite culling||Avian influenza continues to spread among poultry in five of the 11 afflicted states, where culling and containment measures are on as economic losses have been estimated to be around ₹3,000 crore so far, analysts say. Cases have been recurring in areas from where they were first reported and federal teams are assisting all states in coordinating containment measures, an official of the animal husbandry ministry said. The H5N8 bird flu has spread among poultry in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra despite culling, the mainstay of stopping the spread of the virus, an official of the animal husbandry department said. Avian influenza was confirmed in poultry again on Tuesday in samples from Allapuzha district in Kerala, the official said. In Maharashtra, fresh samples have tested positive in the districts of Nanded (Chikhari and Talahari villages), Satara (Marai Wadi), Latur (Davangaon), Nagpur (Waranga), Gadchiroli (Gadchiroli), Mumbai (Kalyan, Thane) and Beed (Warati). Also Read: Bird flu: Red Fort shut till January 26 after sample of dead crow tests positive“In all other affected epicentres, RRTs have been deployed and culling of poultry birds is underway. Surveillance work continues at the places where positive results have been reported in crows/migratory/wild birds,” an official statement said Wednesday. New cases of bird flu have been confirmed in crows and wild migratory birds in Uttar Pradesh (Aliganj, Kheri), and Punjab (Rupnagar). Culling operations continue in the districts of Harda and Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh and Balod of Chhattisgarh as well as in Panchkula district of Haryana, officials said. “According to unofficial estimates, losses amount to possibly ₹3,000 crore,” Surinder Khanna, a poultry consultant, said. The bird flu epidemic has been confirmed so far by the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD) in Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Avian flu has significant economic impact. When chicken prices crash, they tend to bring down maize prices too, hurting farm incomes. Maize is a major feed used for poultry. The poultry industry consumes about 14 million tonne of corn annually. While some samples from Balod in Chhattisgarh tested negative, the state still faces a higher threat level because of more bird deaths reported in the past 48 hours. India has one of the highest incidences of bird flu outbreaks globally because it is in the path of three transnational flight corridors of migratory birds. “The virus involved is zoonotic,” said C Tosh, a senior scientist from NIHSAD. The term zoonotic refers to any pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans. However, the threat to humans is extremely low at this stage, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bird-flu-spreads-among-poultry-in-5-of-11-afflicted-states-despite-culling-101611124564295.html

Electricwala is being prosecuted in a drug racket busted by the Charlotte unit of the anti-terrorism squad.

Mandvikar and Electricwala became friends while being lodged in adjacent barracks at the jail.On the instruction of Mandvikar, one of his henchmen had approached a witness in the drug case to influence him to depose in favour of Electricwala.The witness later lodged a complaint with ATS, which arrested three members of Mandvikar gang who later revealed the involvement of the jail guard.The court, however, granted bail to the jail guard considering that a role was attributed to him on the basis of statement given by a co-accused and therefore, it was not desirable to continue to keep the jail guard behind bars.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-guard-held-for-passing-info-from-prisoner-to-associates-granted-bail-101611122343744.html

I, therefore, request, with great humility and respect, that you assist us by donating the doses we need to make our population safe (optimally 70,000 first and second doses).”PM Modi has already tweeted that India is committed to meeting the health care needs of the global community. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said India, the pharmacy of the world, will deliver vaccines to overcome the pandemic challenges.In his letter, PM Skerrit said: “I draw your kind attention to the enormous challenge faced by our people in obtaining a vaccine for Covid-19. Notwithstanding the pledge by Oxford-AstraZeneca to provide more than half of its doses to the world’s developing nations, as it currently stands, the large number of Dominicans will not be able to obtain a vaccine for a very long time. We are a small island developing nation, and are unable to compete with larger nations with greater demand for vaccines and more funds with which to pay for it.”He reminded PM Narendra Modi that his country has often been the fortunate recipient of assistance from India. “In 2017, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, the Government of India graciously provided USD 100,000 for immediate relief, as well as a further USD 1 million for the rebuilding of essential infrastructure. In 2016, India also provided medicine for Dominicans as part of a grant in aid scheme. We hope now to again be able to rely on your generosity,” the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-gets-sos-message-from-a-caribbean-nation-that-stood-by-india-needs-vaccine-101611120683069.html

The hurried shifting has raised eyebrows as the initial plan was to do so during the one-month gap between the first and the second part of the Budget Session that begins on January 29.The shifting was planned to make space for the ongoing construction of the new Parliament building.Officials in the Speaker Om Birla office were surprised at the hasty shifting. The space in front of the statue has been a preferred location for the Opposition lawmakers to protest against the government policies and proposed laws. During the last monsoon session, some Opposition lawmakers camped overnight in front of the statue to protest against the hurried passage of the farm bills.Officials said the Public works Department, the government’s construction arm, carefully shifted the statue and placed it in a small lawn near the gate used exclusively by the Speaker to reach his office.Also read | RT-PCR tests for MPs; Zero, Question hours back in Budget sessionOfficials added the Gandhi statue is eventually planned to installed just outside the current Parliament building, where that of late former Union home minister Govind Ballabh Pant currently stands.

So we have given it the name 'Kamalam'," he said.Asked why the name 'Kamalam' has been given to the fruit, Rupani said, "Farmers say it looks like lotus and that is the reason we have named it 'Kamalam'."Notably, 'Kamal', or lotus, is the poll symbol of the BJP and Gujarat party unit headquarters is named Shri Kamalam.There is nothing political behind renaming of the fruit, Rupani said.The fruit is found in arid areas of the state and it is known for its nutritional value, like it also helps in increasing the hemoglobin, Rupani said in reply to question on the need to rename it.The CM also said it is the most expensive fruit available in the market at this time.The change in nomenclature of the fruit is yet to find its way among the masses and farmers.Ahmedabad-based housewife Gayatri Vyas, who regularly eats the fruit for its nutritional value, said she is not aware that its has been changed as it is available as 'dragon fruit' only in markets.The fruit comes from several different cactus species and is recommended to be eaten as it can boost immunity.Lately, cultivators from some of the state's arid regions like Kutch have largely taken up farming of this fruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-government-renames-dragon-fruit-as-kamalam-101611119097769.html
20-01-2021||India||Biden’s pick for Pentagon chief says Pak action against LeT, JeM ‘incomplete’||Gen (retired) Lloyd Austin, president-elect Joe Biden’s pick to head the Pentagon, has described China’s “increasingly aggressive actions” across the Indo-Pacific as key concern for the US and said that Pakistan’s actions against anti-India terror groups such as LeT and JeM are “incomplete”. At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Austin also said that if he is confirmed for the post, he will work to continue elevating the defence partnership with India and work to “further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defense Partner’ status”. Austin, 67, would be the first African American to run the department of defence but needs to be granted a waiver by both the House of Representatives and the Senate because the National Security Act requires the secretary of defence to wait seven years after active duty service before taking up the job. Also Read: 78-yr-old Joe Biden will be oldest US president to take oathHe retired in 2016. The former four-star general has served as head of the US Central Command, which oversees operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. In his testimony to the Senate committee, Austin said on the global stage, Asia must be the focus of the US effort, and that he sees “China, in particular, as the pacing challenge for the Department”. “Globally, I believe the most significant challenge I will face will be to ensure the Department of Defense’s continued efforts to prepare and strengthen the US military for a dynamic, future security landscape driven by accelerating competitions with China and with Russia – with China as our pacing threat in most areas – while still ensuring our ability to deter today’s range of threats,” he said in written replies to advance policy questions from the committee. He said he assessed the “rapid development and operational focus” of China and the modernisation of the People’s Liberation Army, including its ability to conduct information, cyber and space operations, “constitutes a significant and long-term security threat to the United States and to our allies and partners”. China’s “increasingly aggressive actions” in the Indo-Pacific too are concerning and the US needs a “more resilient and distributed force posture in the Indo-Pacific in response to China’s counter-intervention capabilities and approaches”, he said. Asked if there had been any change in Pakistan’s cooperation with the US after American security aid was cut off in 2018, Austin replied: “I understand Pakistan has taken constructive steps to meet US requests in support of the Afghanistan peace process. Pakistan has also taken steps against anti-Indian groups, such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, although this progress is incomplete.” He added, “Many factors in addition to the security assistance suspension may impact Pakistan’s cooperation, including Afghanistan negotiations and the dangerous escalation following the Pulwama terrorist attack.” Austin said Pakistan will continue to play an “important role in any political settlement in Afghanistan” and the US also needs to work with the country to defeat al-Qaeda and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province and enhance regional stability. He added that he intended to “press Pakistan to prevent its territory from being used as a sanctuary for militants and violent extremist organizations”. Continuing to build relationships with Pakistan’s military will “provide openings for the United States and Pakistan to cooperate on key issues”, he said. In response to a question on his priorities for India, Austin said his “overarching objective for our defense relationship with India would be to continue elevating the partnership”. He added, “I would further operationalise India’s ‘Major Defense Partner’ status and continue to build upon existing strong defence cooperation to ensure the US and Indian militaries can collaborate to address shared interests. I would also seek to deepen and broaden our defence cooperation through the Quad security dialogue and other regional multilateral engagements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bidens-pick-for-pentagon-chief-says-pak-action-against-let-jem-incomplete-101611119883610.html

The BJP government has a great opportunity on January 26. The BJP government can show its nationalism, love for the Constitution by accepting their demands. There cannot be anything better than this," he said while addressing a press conference at the party's state headquarters in Lucknow on Tuesday.The press conference was held on the sidelines of an event where several national and state youth award winners joined the party. Some of them are the ones who won the UP youth icon awards last year."BJP people don't know about agriculture. Their people are not farmers. Samajwadi Party people are farmers. We understand them. We are with them and will stand by them. They have our support. BJP does not support farmers, it (BJP) only supports the businesses related to farming," the SP president said.Addressing the youth who joined the party, Akhilesh said the SP was a youth and farmer-oriented party. He recollected that the party on January 12— the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand—had held youth connect interactive programmes across the state."The youth are distressed under this government. Unemployment is rising. The way politicisation of educational institutions has started happening in the country is something that has never happened before. The NSA is being imposed on the youth when they raise their voices of dissent. Quality of education is falling, the fee and the cost of education is rising," he added."Without creating or consolidating online education infrastructure and backup, the government pushed students for online education. Most of the students suffered all the more because of the digital divide," the former UP chief minister said.Also Read: 3.75 lakh youth got jobs in UP since 2017: CM AdityanathAttacking the state government, he said: "UP is number one in poor education quality, poor health index, rape incidents, crime against minors, communal riots and fake encounters. The state is number one even in reprimands from the judiciary. It is such a state where serious crime cases were against those who became chief minister and deputy chief minister."He further alleged that the state government was good at taking credit for previous governments’ work, changing names of projects and places and in political vendetta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-great-opportunity-on-republic-day-to-repeal-farm-laws-akhilesh-yadav-101611118755746.html

20-01-2021||India||Nadda as BJP president: A look at one year in office||After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged victorious in the fiercely contested Bihar assembly election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave credit for the win to party chief JP Nadda. At the BJP headquarters where the Prime Minister addressed a crowd that had gathered to celebrate the party’s success, Modi said the poll results are an outcome of the leadership of the party president and the strategies he made. He then went on to describe how unlike the other parties where only a few can rise to the very top, the BJP is a party with a difference. “This is the party where the country‘s prime minister can chant ‘Nadda ji tum aage badho, hum tumhare saath hain,” he said. The Prime Minister’s rousing reception and acknowledgement of Nadda’s leadership was seen as the final stamp of approval of his presidency. Since electoral wins are considered the hallmark of the party boss’s leadership and a measure of success, Nadda, in the 12 months of being in the hot seat can claim credit for electoral victories in the Bihar assembly elections, bypolls in 11 states; and eight local body elections. “It was under Naddaji’s leadership that Kamal (lotus, also the BJP’s symbol) bloomed in Kashmir and spread to down south and the far northeast,” said former minister and national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain. Also read | JP Nadda to meet with party leaders, discuss preparations for West Bengal pollsTo buttress his claims, he said from Arunachal Pradesh where the BJP established victory in 184 of the 242 zila panchayats, to Gujarat where the party won all eight seats in the bypolls and to by-election in Telangana, the BJP has performed well. “A big victory was in Uttar Pradesh bypoll, where the BJP won six of seven seats and in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation where the party created history by winning 48 seats, up from just four in the previous election,” said Hussain, who was given in-charge of overseeing the DDC election in Jammu and Kashmir. In this election, BJP won 75 seats. It wasn’t however a smooth start for the 60-year-old, who started his political innings with the RSS’s student body, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). Soon after he was appointed as the working president of the BJP in June 2019, with Amit Shah continuing as the party president, the BJP faced elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand. While it could not form the government in Maharashtra after a fallout with its oldest ally, the Shiv Sena, over power-sharing; the party lost power in Jharkhand and cobbled up a government in Haryana with support from the JJP. The party also could not wrest power from the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi in 2020. Coronavirus Winning elections was not the only challenge for the leader who cut his teeth in Bihar politics and moved to Himachal Pradesh. Months into his presidency, a global pandemic led to a grinding halt in every sphere. The BJP, which was known for its ‘boots on the ground’ approach, had to reinvent its political outreach. With party activity on hold and workers unable to congregate, it was a challenge to keep the political machinery rolling. “The victory march that Amit Shah started has been continued by Nadda. But the biggest challenge he faced was the pandemic. Everything was shut. But he found a way. He took up the PM’s directions of ‘seva hi sangathan’ and ‘aapda mein avsar’ and came up with the idea of keeping the party workers connected digitally. Food and necessities were supplied to households across the country, a network was ready through digital connectivity even during the lockdown,” said Sanjay Mayukh, the national media co-head and an MLC from Bihar. Sanjay Jaiswal, president of the Bihar unit, credits Nadda’s “feed the needy” programme, the insistence of reaching out to the people on the ground and the way he used the internet as the reasons that helped the party succeeded in Bihar. “He fought like a karyakarta (worker),” said Jaiswal. Also read | BJP will protect Assam’s culture, language, identity, says Nadda in Silchar rallyComparisons with Shah A delay in announcing the new national team led to murmurs that Nadda would borrow from the Amit Shah playbook. A party colleague speaking on condition of anonymity said, “There has been no major change in the party in last one year. It is a continuation of what Shah started.” This was countered by many others who pointed out that opportunity given to “new faces” is an indication that the Nadda “has stepped out of the shadows of Shah”. “Just as Nitin Gadkari did during his tenure as president, Nadda has a mostly- new team in place. He has shown his political acumen by handling crisis in the party’s unit Rajasthan and Karnataka and the BJP’s fallout with the Shiv Sena and the Shiromani Akali Dal,” said another senior leader requesting anonymity. Political commentator Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) said Nadda‘s presidency has “been fairly decent” as he has performed well in two areas. “An indicator of performance is winning elections; he won the Bihar election, which was not easy because there was the 15 year anti-incumbency factor against Nitish Kumar. And the second achievement is that he has been able to undertake changes in the party structure without facing any criticism or rebellion,” Kumar said. Challenges ahead The challenges ahead for Nadda include the electoral battles in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala and Assam; and continuing to expand the reach of the party by inducting more members, winning more states and establishing its presence in the local bodies. He will also have to find a way to keep the flock of allies together, with SAD and Sena having broken ties, the BJP does not want to be seen as a party that cannot take allies along. “He has already announced that he will be visiting each state for two days and will be leading the charge in WB along with Shah. But these elections will be the litmus test of his leadership,” said one of the functionaries quoted above. National media head Anil Baluni, however, said the upcoming elections will not be the only pulpit to showcase Nadda’s leadership. “The party takes all elections, from the panchayat to Parliament, as a challenge and under his leadership, it will contest the upcoming state elections with its full might,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-as-bjp-president-a-look-at-one-year-in-office-101611116162635.html

Authorities said if the export to Bahrain is successful, more consignments would follow. Talks are also being finalised to export the highly perishable product to Italy and Canada.“This is for the first time Joynagar Moa is being exported since it was introduced in 1904. As of now, we are exporting only 45 kilos of Moa, along with 105 kilos of Patali Gur [date palm jaggery], another winter delicacy,” said Joynagar Moa Nirmankari Society secretary Ashok Kumar Kayal.Also Read: Election Commission to visit West Bengal to review poll preparednessThe delicacy obtained the GI tag in 2014 and only around 25 manufacturers from Joynagar block in South 24 Parganas district, around 50km south of Kolkata, are authorised to prepare the product. GI tag signifies a product has a specific geographical origin and enjoys a reputation because of it.Kanakchur Khoi (fried aromatic paddy), nolen gur (molasses), ghee, khoya kheer, cardamom, raisins, and cashew nuts, among others, are used to prepare the delicacy.“It [export] is a trial run. Normally, the shelf life of moa is five days. But we are sending them in special boxes packed in dry ice. If we find that it can be stored for at least 9-10 days, more consignments would follow to European and American countries later this month and in the coming month,” said Sandeep Saha, regional in-charge of Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).As of now, the manufacturers have tied up with two exporters through APEDA. Talks are being held with more exporters.Even though the markets of Bengal are flooded with Joynagar Moa and almost every neighbourhood shop sells the product around this time of the year, manufacturers said that they have tied up with only a select few outlets of certain sweet shops in Kolkata and elsewhere in the country to sell the product. Only these outlets are authorised to sell the authentic GI-tagged moa.“Each moa would cost you around ₹30. We have come up with packets containing six pieces which are sold at ₹150. A kilo would cost ₹500,” said Kayal.According to the GI Journal of November 2014, Ashutosh Das, a resident of Joynagar, first prepared the moa in 1904.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-s-winter-delicacy-exported-abroad-for-the-first-time-101611115622454.html

Soon, it will also send invitations to the farmers' unions and associations to discuss their views on farm laws.In its meeting on Tuesday, the panel discussed the roadmap of activities for two months to prepare their recommendations after discussion with farmers, their unions and other stakeholders.Other two members of the panel - Dr Ashok Gulati, former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, Dr Pramod Joshi, former director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute - were also part of the meeting.

The farmers are adamant on the demand to repeal the laws which the government has refused and is firm on their offer to amend the legislation.

The government says the laws are meant to benefit the cultivators as they no longer will be required to sell produce at regulated wholesale markets. The farmers maintain that legislation was introduced to benefit big corporations.Also Read: Farmers’ protest: Singhu, Tikri other key Delhi borders remain closedUnion agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said the ninth round of talks with farmers unions were inconclusive but they will hold another round of discussion on Tuesday. The tenth round was later deferred by a day.Tomar expressed confidence on Friday that they will be able to come to an agreement. He added they were concerned about the health of farmers, who have been protesting despite cold weather and heavy rains over the last month.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who attended the meeting on Friday, echoed Tomar, saying they were committed to finding a solution through dialogue and that is why they agreed to meet again.Farm unions again demanded that the government commit to complete rollback of the laws at Friday’s talks. The government reiterated its position and ruled out a repeal. It proposed that the 41-member farmers’ delegation form a “smaller group” with “people who have expertise on the laws”.The Supreme Court last week named a four-member panel to talk to the farmers as it stayed the implementation of the laws. Farmer unions have questioned the panel’s composition and have said they will not appear before it as the panel members have favoured the laws.Bhupinder Singh Mann, who was named as one of its members, has recused himself from the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10th-round-of-talks-between-centre-protesting-farmers-to-be-held-today-101611112443198.html
20-01-2021||India||Covid vaccine drive: Health ministry allows on-spot beneficiary registration||To deal with the issue of low turnout of healthcare workers at the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination sites, the Union ministry of health and family welfare has modified the Co-WIN app to now allow on-spot beneficiary registration, and with the upgrade, the states can accommodate walk-ins.“The average vaccination sessions allowed per site are 100, and we were told in some centres fewer people were turning up. We have made a provision in the app to also accommodate beneficiaries scheduled to take the jab on other dates. Earlier, the software wasn’t designed to accept beneficiaries outside the day’s list but now they can,” said Dr RS Sharma, chairman, empowered group on Covid-19 vaccination.“It made sense to make changes in the software because a lot of resources otherwise could go to waste, such as, manpower that was there at the centre, vaccine supplies etc. So long as the person who has landed at the session site is eligible to receive the vaccine, even if they are registered for any other day, there should be no problem. Why waste resources and time, since we have to vaccinate a particular number of healthcare workers anyway,” said Sharma.Also read | 9 states, UTs among better performing areas during Covid-19 vaccination driveHe, however, refuted allegations that there were major glitches in the Co-WIN app that is the backbone of Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system.“There are minor hiccups, which are normal to have when you put such a large-scale system in production. Dry runs are one part but in real-time, there is always a possibility of encountering issues which may have been missed otherwise. None of what we have seen so far is anything major, in fact, some are even procedural issues that are being rectified,” he said.The officials in the ministry said that there were no issues with the app; in fact, the vaccination process will also be scaled up soon.“It also depends on how tech-savvy are the people handling the software. There is also the option of manually uploading data but that is only in extreme situations and has to be done real-time otherwise the backlog will be huge,” he said.While walk-ins have been allowed, priority will still be given to current day beneficiaries.“Those who are registered for the day will have to be vaccinated first, and others should be accommodated only if registered beneficiaries do not turn up. Certain conditions are non-negotiable such as eligibility, so that those not eligible don’t jump the line; record the vaccination event real-time, and issuing of vaccination certificate. Everyone who gets vaccinated must be accounted for so that tracking is effectively done,” said Sharma.“This software is an empowering tool, not a disabling tool,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-drive-health-ministry-allows-on-spot-beneficiary-registration-101611112322014.html

20-01-2021||India||Farmers want permission for tractor rally on Republic Day, Supreme Court hearing today||The Supreme Court will on Wednesday resume the hearing on the application filed by Delhi Police seeking a direction to put an injunction on the proposed tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day. The farmers, who have been protesting against the three central farm laws, have vowed to take out the rally on January 26.The Delhi Police in its application has said that no tractor rally by farmers should be allowed it will malign the nation globally.The case is being heard by a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde. This bench, which last assembled on January 12, also comprises justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. On that day, the court had stayed the implementation of the three farm laws under challenge and formed a four-member expert committee to study the concerns raised by the farmer unions and submit its recommendations to the court in two months.Bhupinder Mann, one of the members of the committee, had recused himself leaving just three members on the panel. Today, the bench could even decide on filling up the vacancy created by Mann.On Monday, while hearing a case, the bench had said, "Right now, we can't deal with it... the question of entry into Delhi is a law and order situation that is to be determined by the police."Meanwhile, the protesting farmer unions, which plan to hold the rally on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi, have begun preparing for it in villages in Punjab. They are mobilising people for the parade and said more farmers will be heading to the national capital in batches later this week.“There is a great enthusiasm among people in Punjab to become part of the tractor parade. Our batches will start moving towards Delhi from January 23 and 24,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) president Jagjit Singh Dallewal said 20,000-25,000 tractors would come to Delhi from Punjab alone for the planned parade.“We want the government to give us permission for our rally. This is our country and it is our constitutional right to voice our needs and demands," said Amarjeet Singh Rarra, general secretary, Deaba Kisan Committee, said on Delhi's Singhu border.While the final plan for the rally is yet to be formulated, volunteers from among the protesters have been roped in to ensure discipline during the march, farmers said.For nearly two months now, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other states have been protesting against the new farm laws near Delhi. They say the laws will erode the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government, however, has discounted these fears and projected the three laws as major agricultural reforms. The tenth round of talks between the two sided will take place on Wednesday.The three contentious laws are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-want-permission-for-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-sc-hearing-today-101611108850091.html

20-01-2021||India||1,000 vaccine doses wasted in Delhi so far: Health officials||With the Covid-19 vaccination drive completing three days in Delhi, officials involved in the immunisation programme flagged another problem on Tuesday - that of wastage of doses.Teams from a number of vaccination centres and health officials overseeing the city’s inoculation drive said at least 1,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccines have been wasted in Delhi so far. Health officials attributed the wastage mostly to fewer people coming up to get the jab.“As per the guidelines, vials of both Covishield or Covaxin have to be used and discarded within four hours of being opened. Each Covishield vial has 10 doses, and the low turnout is only adding to the wastage. If the hesitancy was not as high as it actually is now, then people would be queueing up and we could have grouped them in slots of 10 to reduce wastage,” said a senior health official.Although Delhi government officials said it has not yet compiled data on the total number of doses discarded so far, health department officials said initial estimates indicate that on an average five doses are being wasted at the 81 vaccination centres each day.At Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital, 9 doses were wasted on Day One, 6 on Day Two and 2 on Day Three. The Delhi State Cancer Institute discarded 14 doses in three days.“Today (Tuesday), we had to open the third vial for just one beneficiary and the rest of the nine doses had to be discarded as no one else came by the end of the day. We have strict instruction from the government that no body can be turned away from the vaccination centres,” said Dr Pragya Shukla, the nodal officer at Delhi State Cancer Institute (DSCI).But, Dr Ravinder Pal Dhingra of Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, another vaccination centre, described it as “a number game”.“Even if the turnout is as high as 91 at a centre, still 9 doses would go waste on that day. It’s mostly a game of numbers. But it is true that if more people were willing then we could have scheduled 9 more people for the day and shifted the remaining ones to the next day. At our hospital, we have vaccinated around 39, 49 and 55 people in the past three days,” said Dhingra.A senior doctor from Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital said the government anyway already considers that 10% of the total stock of doses would go in vain either through wastage or breakage.“However, to ensure that not too many doses go waste, after about mid-day we wait for a few people to come in before opening any new vials,” said the doctor.To ensure fewer doses are wasted each day, many centres started walk-in vaccination from Tuesday. While Ram Manohar Lohia hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical Colleges allowed this from Monday, several others such as DSCI and GTB hospital started it from Tuesday.“Today, 24 healthcare workers got the jabs at our centre as per the list generated by the Co-WIN app. But, by 4pm our district administration allowed us to vaccinate even those healthcare workers who are not in the list but are registered and verified in the Co-WIN app. So, to ensure minimum wastage of doses, I took the shot and so did two additional medical superintendents and one senior doctor of the hospital. So, only one dose was discarded today,” said Dr Sweta, the nodal officer of the vaccination programme in GTB hospital.A senior official from the Ministry of health and family welfare said the shelf life of unopened vials of both Covishield and Covaxin is six months from the date of manufacturing. “Irrespective of which vaccine is being used, every vial, once opened has to be used within four hours at a temperature between 2 and 25 degrees Celsius. Open vial policy has not been allowed in India yet,” said the ministry official on condition of anonymity.With 75 of the 81 centres giving Covishield jabs, Delhi primarily is using these doses over the Covaxin doses which is being used in only six centres. While each vial of Covishield has 5ml of the vaccine with each dose being 0.5 ml, which is equivalent to 10 doses, a Covaxin vial contains 20 doses.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said the government should consider increasing the duration of usage of each opened vial of Covishield vaccine from the existing 4 hours to 6 hours.“Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Covishield vaccine says an opened vial can be used up to a maximum of 6 hours. The government should allow centres which are able to maintain the desired room temperatures to use vials up to 6 hours instead of 4,” he saidJohn suggested that the open vial policy can still be considered for Covaxin, but stated the same can never be possible for Covishield.“Reusing the vial is called open vial policy. Covishield vaccine contains live virus because of which no preservative can be added to it. Therefore, an open vial policy cannot be allowed. But, Covaxin does not contain any live virus and it has a preservative called 2-phenoxyethanol. Therefore, the government should declare an open vial policy for Covaxin at least. This will ensure reduction in wastage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hesitancy-causes-wastage-of-1-000-vaccine-doses-in-delhi-say-health-officials-101611091051711.html
20-01-2021||India||Police urge farmers to shift R-Day tractor rally to KMP e-way||Police officers from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana met farmers at Singhu border on Tuesday, urging them to either cancel the proposed tractor rally on the Republic Day or organised it on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway. The farmers, however, turned down the proposal but assured the police that it would be a peaceful protest and stay confined to only the outer Ring Road in Delhi.While special commissioner (intelligence) Deependra Pathak led the police team from Delhi, seven leaders of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, including Balbir Singh Rajewal and Darshan Pal, represented the farmers.Since no consensus could be reached on issue, another meeting has been scheduled on Wednesday morning, a senior Delhi Police officer who was present in the meeting said, requesting anonymity.“We told the farmers representatives that the tractor rally may lead to law and order issues and traffic and security chaos and asked them to cancel it. Since they refused, we suggested that the rally could be shifted to the KMP expressway. They remained adamant on taking out their rally for 50-60 kilometres on Delhi’s outer ring road,” the officer said.This was the second meeting between the police and leaders of farmer unions since Monday, when the Supreme Court refused to pass any order on the Delhi Police’s plea for stopping the tractor rally. On a plea by Delhi Police, the top court had said that entry of farmers into Delhi is a law and order problem and any decision in this regard should be taken by the Delhi Police.Tuesday’s meeting was held at a farmhouse in Delhi, nearly a kilometre away from the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been agitating against the three contentious farm laws. The farmers’ agitation entered 55th day on Tuesday.“The farmer leaders in fact asked the police officers if they would be granting permission for their Kisan Tractor Parade on Delhi’s Outer Ring Road about which the officers said that they were not the deciding authority. The officers showed their concerns regarding law and order, traffic, and security issues that our tractor rally may cause. However, they were assured that our rally will be peaceful and it will not disrupt the official Republic Day parade,” said Harpreet Singh Kahlon, convener of Krantikari Kisan Union.On Tuesday, the farmers also shared the route map of their proposed tractor rally and said that the parade will touch all the borders connecting Delhi with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh would be participating in the tractor rally, they said.“Our parade will be similar to that of the national parade where tableaux of different states are shown. The farmers of different states would be showcasing their traditional style of farming and agricultural tools they use in agriculture. All tractors will have the national flag and our rally will start after the parade on Rajpath is concluded,” said Parmeet Singh, a farmer from Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-urge-farmers-to-shift-r-day-tractor-rally-to-kmp-eway-101611089573981.html
20-01-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi says India ‘owned’ by a few; Centre hits back||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that a handful of people close to the Prime Minister now “own” the country through “massive monopolies”, demanded a probe into information that has come to light after Arnab Goswami’sWhatsApp conversations went public, and lashed out at the government for not resolving the crisis brought about by the farm laws, triggering a war of words with the BJP that snapped back saying “monopoly of one family during the UPA rule was overthrown by the people.”In a no-holds-barred attack against the ruling dispensation a day before the tent round of talks between farmers and the Centre, Gandhi compared the alleged monopolies that he said were being created with the British Raj and said at a press conference on Tuesday that “there are millions of people who do not accept this nonsense that’s going on in this country”. He refused to answer questions posed by BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda, dubbed protesting farmers as “patriots” and claimed the Congress will provide “the vision for India”.“Across the board , what we are watching is the development of massive monopoly in this country. This country is owned by a small group of three to five people who are close to the PM,” he said, expressing apprehension that the new farm laws are intended to monopolize the agriculture sector.“Farmers won’t get the value they deserve. Mandis will be destroyed. Those three, four people will be able to store millions of kilos of grains. This is an assault on the middle class and youngsters who will not able to get a job,” Gandhi alleged, releasing a party booklet on the farm issues.But ahead of Gandhi’s press conference on Tuesday, Nadda trained his guns at the Congress leader and demanded answers on why “time and again the Congress party surrenders to China” and why it has been “misleading” the farmers about the new farm laws. Nadda also took pot shots at Gandhi and tweeted, “Now that Mr. @RahulGandhi has returned from his monthly vacation, I would like to ask him some questions. I hope he will answer them in today’s press conference.”He went on to say, “When will @RahulGandhi , his dynasty and Congress stop lying on China? Can he deny that thousands of kms, including the one (area) in Arunachal Pradesh he is referring to was gifted by none other than Pandit Nehru to the Chinese? Time and again, why does Congress surrender to China?”When asked, Gandhi refused to reply to Nadda. “Who is he? Why should I answer him? ...Is he my professor? I will answer to the country,” Gandhi said. Within hours, the BJP hit back. Union minister Prakash Javadekar said “A national party president is asking questions, you should reply. He (Gandhi) has run away from giving replies.”Alleging that the Congress is not interested in resolving farmer issues and doesn’t want the talks to be successful, Javadekar said, “He (Gandhi) said there is a monopoly of a few families in the county. Monopoly of one family during the UPA rule was overthrown by the people. They are upset by that...there is a change, now 125 crore people rule the country. During the Congress rule it was only one family that remained in power,”While Gandhi said that China has a “clear strategic vision” but India doesn’t and China has twice tested India in Doklam and Ladakh, Javadekar retorted that the Congress must answer why Aksai Chin was given away by it and land parcels in Arunachal Pradesh.Gandhi demanded that both journalist Arnab Goswami and the person who provided him information about the Balakot airstrike on Pakistan should be booked as such leaks were against national security.His reference is to a transcript of Goswami’s WhatsApp conversation with a rating agency chief going public (it was part of a charge sheet on rigging of rating points). The conversation seems to suggest Goswami had prior knowledge of a coming strike by India against Pakistan. “Sharing official secrets with a journalist is a criminal act. There is nothing patriotic at putting our airforce at risk. I want to know who told Arnab Goswami about the airstrike? Only five people—the PM, the Home Minister, the defence Minister and the NSA must have known about it,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-india-owned-by-a-few-centre-hits-back-101611086435432.html

The deceased included six men, eight women and the baby girl.Expressing grief over the incident, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an ex-gratia of Rs.2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the next of kin of each of the deceased and ₹50,000 for the injured.“The loss of lives due to a truck accident in Surat is tragic. My thoughts are with the bereaved families. Praying that the injured recover at the earliest,” the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) tweeted.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also announced a compensation of Rs.2 lakh to the kin of each deceased.The incident took place near Kosamba village, around 60 km from Surat, when the truck driver apparently lost control over the vehicle after hitting a sugarcane laden tractor.The truck ran over the construction workers on the Kim-Mandvi road shortly after midnight, Surat SP Usha Rada said, news agency PTI reported.“The truck was on its way to Mandvi from Kim. The driver lost control of the vehicle after it hit sugarcane hanging out of the tractor trolley coming from the opposite direction,” she said.“The truck’s front window pane shattered on impact, which blocked the driver’s vision. The truck then veered off the road and crashed into the sleeping labourers,” she added.The driver, who sustained injuries and is undergoing treatment, has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act, police said.Besides the driver, the vehicle’s ‘cleaner’ was also injured in the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-migrant-workers-a-yr-old-infant-crushed-by-truck-in-surat-101611085777243.html
20-01-2021||India||India, France air exercise to kick off in Rajasthan today||The air forces of India and France will kick off a five-day joint exercise in Rajasthan on Wednesday with a raft of aircraft, including Rafale fighters jets, Mirage 2000s, Sukhoi-30s, mid-air refuellers and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) platforms, the Indian Air Force (IAF) said in a statement on Tuesday, announcing the line-up of aircraft taking part in the wargames.The exercise, code-named Desert Knight-21, is being held at the Jodhpur air force station.“As part of Indo-French defence cooperation, the IAF and French Air and Space Force have held six editions of exercises named ‘Garuda’, the latest being in 2019 at Air Force Base Mont-de-Marsan, France,” the IAF said on the eve of the exercise.The French air force has also flown its A-400M military transport aircraft to Jodhpur for the exercise, they added. The French contingent consists of 175 personnel, the IAF said.The IAF said the two sides would “put into practice operational experience gained across terrains and spectrums and endeavour to exchange ideas and best practices to enhance interoperability”. “For sure air crews imbibe information from each other’s operating procedures from military exercises between nations but they are more a demonstration of strategic relations than one of tactical learning,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-air-exercise-to-kick-off-in-rajasthan-today-101611084059582.html
20-01-2021||India||India begins vaccine export from today||Bhutan, the Maldives and Bangladesh will be among the first countries in the neighbourhood to receive Covid-19 vaccines from India as grant assistance, with supplies of millions of doses to six nations set to begin on Wednesday.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccine will reach Bhutan on Wednesday. Another 100,000 doses of Covishield vaccine will be sent to the Maldives later the same day under emergency use approvals to vaccinate frontline and health workers and senior citizens.Bangladesh’s foreign ministry said on its Facebook page the country will receive two million doses of Covishield, the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, from India as a “gift”. It said: “A special flight of India carrying the consignment will land at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka [on January 21].”The external affairs ministry said supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles will begin from Wednesday in line with India’s commitment to use its vaccine production and delivery capacity to help the world fight Covid-19.The ministry said there were also plans to provide vaccines to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, after “confirmation of necessary regulatory clearances”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi branded the move as “VaccineMaitri” and tweeted: “India is deeply honoured to be a long-trusted partner in meeting the healthcare needs of the global community. Supplies of Covid vaccines to several countries will commence tomorrow, and more will follow in the days ahead.”“It will be ensured that domestic manufacturers will have adequate stocks to meet domestic requirements while supplying abroad,” the external affairs ministry said.A training programme covering administrative and operational aspects is also being conducted between January 19 and 20 for immunisation managers, cold chain and communications officers and data managers of recipient countries.The only country in the region unlikely to be an immediate beneficiary of India’s efforts is Pakistan, which has not made any formal request for vaccines.Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League party said on Twitter the two million doses of Covishield would be in addition to the 30 million doses that the government contracted for with the Serum Institute of India (SII) in November.Since Maldives has a population of about 500,000, India’s grant will cover the vaccination of a significant percentage of the population. In addition, the Maldives plans to buy 300,000 doses from SII at commercial rates.India’s grants are part of plans to provide up to 10 million doses of both Covidshield and Covaxin, the vaccine made by Bharat Biotech, to friendly countries, the people cited above said.Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives are among the countries in the region with closest ties with India, and have benefited from projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the past few months.SII has an agreement to supply 200 million doses to Covax, a facility coordinated by Gavi and the World Health Organisation to provide vaccines to lower income countries.“Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout [of the immunisation programme], India will continue to supply Covid-19 vaccines to partner countries over the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” the external affairs ministry said. India will also “continue to supply countries all over the world with vaccines” and this will be “calibrated against domestic requirements and international demand and obligations, including under Gavi’s Covax facility”, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-begins-vaccine-export-from-today-101611082992448.html

The murder took place close to the victim’s home. The assailants came on a motorcycle, eyewitnesses told the police. A grainy video of two men getting on a motorcycle and the bleeding victim lying on the ground was later widely shared.Shortly after the incident, Kalipada Sarkar, the president of the local panchayat samity was admitted at Gangarampur hospital after he was allegedly chased by some TMC workers from a rival group. Sarkar later died of heart attack.Biplab Mitra, a former legislator and newly-appointed chairman of the TMC’s district committee, said, “Sarkar died of a heart attack. His death has nothing to do with the murder. He was ailing for a long time and had been to Chennai for treatment.”Debarshi Dutta, the district superintendent of police, said, “The murder took place during a clash between two small groups. We have arrested six people and investigation is on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-worker-shot-dead-in-north-bengal-another-leader-dies-of-heart-attack-101611081109030.html
20-01-2021||India||Covaxin recipients under stricter watch, says Centre||The central government on Monday spelt out a detailed policy of monitoring Covid-19 vaccine recipients for adverse responses and assured people that the immunisation programme, which has been dogged by fears of side-effects and hesitancy, is safe.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the government had opted for a passive monitoring approach for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by Serum Institute of India and known locally as Covishield. Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin vaccine recipients are being actively followed for any adverse reactions, he added.“In Covishield vaccine, the monitoring is passive monitoring. The recipient is observed for initial 30 minutes; if he is fine, he is sent home. However, if they develop symptoms later, then the onus is on the recipient to report it to the hospital. Whereas in case of Covaxin, it is active followed up, which means a doctor rings you up on a daily basis and you are given a form that you fill for seven days. That’s the difference,” said Bhushan.He also pointed out that the number of mild Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) –pain, nausea, mild fever – were reported in 0.18% of people vaccinated till Monday night. Severe AEFIs, which require hospitalization or high fever, accounted for 0.002% of the shots administered.This was one of the lowest in the world, he added.“And there it is clearly mentioned that if there is a causal relationship between immunisation and the adverse event, whether it is severe or serious, the cost of hospitalisation would be borne by the authorities,” he added.Director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Dr Balram Bhargava, said Covaxin recipients were being closely monitored. “As we cross the half a million number mark in the past three days, it is very clear that both these Covid-19 vaccines are very safe. Also, vaccine does not cause Covid-19; vaccine prevents Covid-19; vaccine prevents Covid-19 deaths. So, the time to take the vaccine is now, and we can break the chain of virus transmission,” he added.The officials also drew a distinction between Covishield, which finished late-stage trials abroad and whose efficacy data is publicly known, and Covaxin, which is currently in phase 3 trials.“There are two vaccines; one has been given emergency use authorisation, and there is another vaccine which has been given emergency use authorisation under clinical trial mode.”He added that the vaccine given emergency approval under clinical trial mode – Covaxin — is accompanied by three documents: a fact-sheet and a consent form that are read out and explained to beneficiaries. “It is in regional languages depending on the state...; and third is the adverse event reporting form where the recipient has to report it for the first seven days.”He said that states were in charge of deciding which vaccine is allotted to a particular immunisation site.“The Union government got the supplies, but which vaccine will go to which vaccination session was a decision which has been a decision left entirely to the states. What vaccine will be used in AIIMS, Delhi, was a decision of the state government, and local government in other states...,” he added.Adverse reactions can be caused by allergies or underlying medical conditions and are not necessarily causally linked to vaccines.But reports of adverse reactions to immunization have fuelled rumours and vaccine hesitancy, forcing authorities to fall short of inoculation targets.“Adverse reactions that have been seen so far are negligible. The side effects are practically nil,” added VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog.The ministry said nine AEFIs have required hospitalization until Tuesday. In Delhi, three cases have been discharged and one case is under observation.An AEFI case in Uttarakhand has been discharged. In Karnataka, one person is discharged and other person is stable. In Chhattisgarh, one person was discharged.In Rajasthan, one case is of suspected anaphylaxis is under observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-recipients-under-stricter-watch-says-centre-101611081235873.html
20-01-2021||India||‘To her, patients always came first’: Cancer care pioneer dies at 93||Dr Viswanathan Shanta, a pioneer of cancer care in the country, passed away in Chennai in the early hours of Tuesday. Chairman of the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, V Shanta was working Monday night when she complained of chest pain and was admitted to Apollo Hospitals. “She called me around 8:30pm complaining of chest pain,” said her younger sister V Susheela, who is a member of the governing board of the institute. V Shanta died of a myocardial infarction and was laid to rest with full state honours later in the evening. She was 93.Born on March 11, 1927 in Chennai, V Shanta belonged to a family of achievers. Her grand-uncle CV Raman and her uncle, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, were both Nobel laureates. After completing her post graduate medical degree in gynaecology from Madras Medical College, she joined the Cancer Institute in 1955 established a year before by one of the country’s first women medical graduates, Dr Muthulakshmi Reddy. Dr S Krishnamurthi, Reddy’s son, was V Shanta’s collaborator and mentor.V Shanta made the hospital her home, living in a room in the institute from her first day till Monday night. She steered it from a 12-bed hospital to a state-of-the-art cancer care centre and research institute that catered to more than 15,000 poor persons annually, and where 40% of the patients received free treatment with residence and those who could not pay were offered subsidised treatment.“For a lot of people who got cancer, she was the person you thought of. I think people felt good going to her,” said Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, whose now deceased mother Sushila Viswanathan was V Shanta’s patient in 2005. “She helped a lot of children,” said Anand, a regular donor to the institute.V Shanta inspired generations of health care providers. “The country’s first paediatric oncology centre was established under her,” said Dr R Swaminathan, a statistician and epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute, who was a colleague. “Nobody valued data more than her. When people ridiculed us that we could never follow-up on patients in India, Dr Shanta showed the way to assess a cancer patient’s survival rate.”“To her, patients always came first. Today, the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar is one of the most premium cancer institutions in India because of her hard work along with her mentor Dr S Krishnamurthi,” said Dr CS Pramesh, director of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.V Shanta was on the WHO Advisory Committee on Cancer till March 2005. She was a recipient of several national and international awards including the Ramon Magsasay award for public service, Padma Shri (1986), Padma Bhushan (2006) and Padma Vibhushan (2016). Prime Minister Narendra Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and other leaders condoled her death. “Dr V Shanta will be remembered for her outstanding efforts to ensure top quality cancer care. The Cancer Institute at Adyar, Chennai, is at the forefront of serving the poor and downtrodden. I recall my visit to the Institute in 2018,” the PM tweeted.With inputs from Rupsa Chakraborty||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-her-patients-always-came-first-cancer-care-pioneer-dies-at-93-101611080884236.html
20-01-2021||India||Senior docs told to get vaccinated to instil confidence||A little less than half the number of people scheduled to get the Covid-19 vaccine jabs on Tuesday turned up at their designated centres, prompting some hospitals to ask the head of departments to take the shot themselves and motivate those working under them.With 4,936 beneficiaries receiving the shot, Delhi saw the highest turnout in terms of absolute numbers on Tuesday.However, the number only accounted for 48.75% of the 10,125 health care workers who were scheduled to get the jabs, with the government having increased the number of beneficiaries each of the 81 sites could vaccinate, data seen by HT suggested.In comparison, 4,319 people had received the jab on Saturday – the day the nation-wide roll-out happened – accounting for 53.3% of the beneficiaries selected to receive the vaccine.On Tuesday, the turnout was much higher for the centres administering Serum Institute’s Covishield – 50.6% — when compared to the centres administering Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin – 27.4%, as per data.With more centres administering Covishield, 15 of the 16 adverse reactions noticed were in those who received the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot on Tuesday. All the adverse events were minor ones such as rashes, headaches, and fever.In the three days since launch, 12,853 health care workers have taken the shots, out of a targeted 26,397, records showed.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said, “The current turnout is not low if one compares it with other states and the overall average in the country. Confidence building will take some time. The Delhi government is leaving no stones unturned in confidence building drives and increasing the turnout ratio in vaccination centres.”On Tuesday, the CoWIN app was tweaked, allowing the ‘add beneficiary’ option to incorporate walk-in immunisation for registered health care worker.Max hospital, Saket, and BL Kapur hospital both saw 100% immunisation on Tuesday. The number of people who received the vaccine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences jumped to 55 on Tuesday from just eight a day ago.Hospitals that have consistently seen low turnout, like Guru Teg Bahadur hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital , asked its senior faculty members to come forward and take the shot.“The hospital has issued a circular asking senior doctors and administrators to take the shot and motivate those working under them also to take it. Four of the senior doctors from the hospital received the shot today. This should instil confidence about the vaccine, among others,” said a senior doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which had seen 24 people being vaccinated on Monday and 28 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-docs-told-to-get-vaccinated-to-instil-confidence-101611079986044.html
20-01-2021||India||First military team heads to Russia to train on S-400 air defence systems||The first group of Indian military specialists is set to travel to Russia for training in operating the S-400 air defence systems, deliveries of which are set to start this year against the backdrop of possible US sanctions.Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev on Tuesday described the upcoming departure of the Indian military team as a “remarkable occasion” that will usher in “a new stage in our strategic partnership”.He defended the $5.4 billion deal with India for five S-400 systems as part of Russia’s “bilateral and multilateral commitments” within the framework of “just and equal relations based on the international law and the UN Charter”.Kudashev was speaking at an event hosted by the Russian embassy in honour of the first team of Indian military specialists heading to Russia for the S-400 training courses.“S-400 supplies initiative is one of the flagship projects in the Russian-Indian military and military-technical cooperation, which historically constitutes the main pillar of the special and privileged strategic partnership between our two friendly countries,” he said.“It is based on mutual trust and reflects the true spirit of our bilateral and multilateral commitments in the framework of our vision towards just and equal relations based on the international law and the UN Charter.”Also Read: UN rights office ‘deeply troubled’ by Russian activist Alexei Navalny’s arrestKudashev had said last month that Russia’s ongoing deals with India for military hardware, including S-400 air defence systems, were “advancing well” despite the threat of potential US sanctions.India and Russia signed the $5.4 billion deal for five S-400 systems in October 2018, and the first batch is expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. All deliveries will be completed in a five-year period, Russia has said.The outgoing Trump administration in the US has reportedly told India it is unlikely to get a waiver under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the acquisition of the S-400, raising the risk of sanctions similar to those imposed on Turkey for buying the same systems.The Indian side is now keeping a close watch on the approach that will be adopted by the incoming Biden administration to arms purchases from Russia.Earlier this month, the external affairs ministry defended the S-400 deal as part of India’s independent foreign policy that guides defence acquisitions in line with national security interests.“India and the US have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests,” he added.Kudashev said Russia was also “successfully moving towards implementation” of several other arms deals, including the production of more than 700,000 AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles by a joint venture in India, the supply of 200 Ka-226 helicopters and production in India, advanced cooperation in combat aviation, main battle tanks, frigates, submarines and missiles, and joint production of the BrahMos cruise missile.The two countries are “deeply involved” in joint development and production of military equipment, components and spare parts, sharing of technologies and improving after-sales service. “We have developed an advanced legal base for this purpose,” he said.The India-Russia partnership is “becoming even stronger” in new areas and forms of mutually beneficial and forward-looking cooperation as the world moves from a bipolar order towards the “establishment of the polycentric order”, and this is “absolutely true for our military and military-technical ties”, Kudashev said.Russia is also looking towards the early implementation of a spare parts joint production agreement, which would fit well with the “Make in India” and “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives, he said. “Work also is going on [on] the mutual logistics support agreement, strengthening maritime cooperation, including in the Indian Ocean,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-military-team-heads-to-russia-to-train-on-s-400-air-defence-systems-101611052111424.html
20-01-2021||India||Government writes to WhatsApp, asks it to withdraw new privacy policy||The government has written to WhatsApp head Will Cathcart asking him to “respect the informational privacy and data security of Indian users” and withdraw the latest terms and privacy policy in India proposed by the messaging service for users. In a letter, it has expressed strong concerns over the policy days after HT on January 11 reported that the government was closely examining the matter.WhatsApp on January 4 updated its privacy policy to allow it to share user data with its parent company Facebook and other group firms . The data includes location and phone number.The move has triggered a backlash across the world and led to a surge in the downloading of alternative messaging apps such as Signal and Telegram. India is WhatsApp’s biggest market with 400 million users.The government has sent a questionnaire to WhatsApp seeking more details about its data-sharing protocols and business practices. It has sought the exact categories of data that the application collects from Indian users, details of the permissions and user consent sought by and utility of each of these with respect to the functioning and specific service provided. The service has been asked whether it profiles users based on their use of the application.The government has also sought details of the difference between WhatsApp’s privacy policies in India and other countries along with details of its data security, information security, cyber-security, privacy, and encryption policies.A WhatsApp spokesperson said, “We wish to reinforce that this update does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook. Our aim is to provide transparency and new options available to engage with businesses so they can serve their customers and grow. WhatsApp will always protect personal messages with end-to-end encryption so that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see them. We are working to address misinformation and remain available to answer any questions.” Also read | The government can, and must, stand for privacyThe government has highlighted the latest policy will lead to the collection of “a vast amount of highly invasive and granular metadata”.“With this, any meaningful distinction between WhatsApp and Facebook companies will cease to exist. Given the huge user base of WhatsApp and Facebook in India, the consolidation of this sensitive information also exposes a very large segment of Indian citizens to greater security risks and vulnerabilities creating a honeypot of information,” a person familiar with the matter said, citing the contents of the letter to the WhatsApp chief.“This all-or-nothing approach takes away any meaningful choice from Indian users. This approach leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain, which may infringe on their interests in relation to informational privacy and information security. It is expected that Facebook will value the principles of privacy and consent as laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment of Justice K S Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017). The PDP [Personal Data Protection] Bill is under consideration, then why these changes.”The letter noted the “integration of data between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies” denies the user the choice to opt out of the policy.Also read | Don’t use WhatsApp if concerned about data: Delhi HCThe government has “raised strong objections against the differential treatment by WhatsApp to its users in India and in the European Union”. It added this has triggered serious criticism and “shows lack of respect for the rights and interests of Indian citizens, who form one of the largest user bases for WhatsApp”.The government underlined such treatment is “prejudicial to the interests of Indian users and is viewed with serious concern. “In this context, it [the letter] reminds WhatsApp that the Government of India owes a sovereign responsibility to its citizens to ensure that their interests are not compromised and therefore it calls upon WhatsApp to respond to concerns raised in this letter,” said the person cited above.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology has summoned Facebook officials on January 21 amid privacy concerns about WhatsApp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-writes-to-whatsapp-asks-it-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-101611046410921.html
20-01-2021||Editorials||The 46th President of the US | HT Editorial||Joe Biden’s elevation as the 46th President of the United States (US) marks a moment of victory for all those who believe in liberal democracy, civilised politics within the rules of the game, responsible leadership, and the inclusion of various social groups, including minorities, in the power structure. Mr Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, stood at the opposite end of all these values — he was illiberal and authoritarian; he was willing to use lies and deceit and undermine all constitutional institutions to win and then remain in power; and he encouraged xenophobic politics based on White supremacism.Mr Biden’s selection of Kamala Harris as Vice-President and appointment of the most racially diverse cabinet in US history shows that he understands the importance of inclusion. His focus on instituting tougher measures to battle Covid-19 and ramp up vaccination shows that he will have a different approach to the pandemic. And with a new economic stimulus — which Mr Biden will have to push through Congress — the task of domestic economic reconstruction will take priority. But his most challenging domestic political task will be to heal a divided nation — the fact that over 71 million people voted for Mr Trump is a grim reminder of the internal faultlines.But along with domestic priorities, the Biden presidency will have to deal with the most important strategic challenge of the times— the belligerence of China. The appointment of an Indo-Pacific coordinator signals the continued commitment of the new administration to managing China’s ambitions and investing in regional partnerships in Asia — including with India. But this will be accompanied by Washington’s need to keep up a working relationship with Beijing. Given the relatively bipartisan support for the relationship with India, New Delhi should not be overly concerned about the tactical ebbs and flows in Washington’s policy — for the strategic convergence between the two is unmistakable. Despite concerns that may be expressed about what has come to be seen as India’s democratic backsliding, Mr Biden is likely to invest in the India partnership across the realm of defence, economy, technology, and climate — and perhaps even make a trip to India in the first half of his term. For now, all democrats should celebrate Mr Biden’s win — and the return of the politics of sanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-46th-president-of-the-us-hteditorial-101611151218299.html
20-01-2021||Editorials||The persistence of the pollution threat | HT Editorial||Delhi’s air quality slipped into the “severe” category on Tuesday, for the sixth time this month. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city was 404, deteriorating from Monday’s AQI of 372 (very poor). Scientists from the India Meteorological Department said this deterioration in air quality was caused by the dense fog that enveloped the city on Tuesday.While meteorological conditions and the geographical location of the city are responsible for the bad air, the inability of the authorities to contain and reduce local pollution sources in Delhi and the adjoining areas (vehicle exhaust, heavy industry such as power generation, illegal and small-scale industries such as brick kilns, suspended dust on the roads due to vehicular movement and construction activities, open waste burning, combustion of fuels for cooking, lighting, and heating) are also equally to blame for the crisis. In addition, state pollution boards and local urban bodies (which get funds from the Centre to fight air pollution) are severely understaffed to take immediate action against local sources of pollution on a real-time basis. This needs to be rectified. It will also be a good idea to work on a hi-resolution emission inventory, a sort of a crowd-sourcing platform, to document local sources of pollution, which often go unaddressed.As Parliament prepares to take up a full-fledged Bill for approval to back the newly formed Commission for Air Quality Management by law, it is time to re-evaluate the non-meteorological reasons that are responsible for bad air in the National Capital Region and the kind of coordinated effort needed by all states to tackle the threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-persistence-of-the-pollution-threat-hteditorial-101611150743132.html
