These agitators breached the Ghazipur border in East Delhi by 9am and moved on NH 24 via Nizamuddin Bridge. Had the New Delhi range police not blocked the Bhairon Marg by bus barriers, the Republic Day Parade would have been disrupted by unruly farmers carrying both National and religious flags.Red Fort breach: Farm leaders' meet to fix responsibility, fingers at Deep SidhuAccording to top police officials, after being blocked from entering the C-hexagon in India at Bhairon Marg, the agitators moved towards the A-point on the ITO intersection and the W point next to Supreme Court by 11.30 am, with the parade just minutes away from being breached. Again, the presence of mind of two DCPs saved the day as bus barriers were deployed, as a result of which the mob moved towards the Red Fort. The New Delhi Range managed to hold the Fort India Gate not only during the parade but also during the at-home at Rashtrapati Bhawan.While the Delhi Police brass is examining how the northern, eastern and western borders were breached despite prior instructions from the Delhi Police Commissioner, S N Shrivastava, the fact is that as many as 394 policemen were injured and the number is going up. Despite all provocations, including religious flags being hoisted by unruly farmers, the Delhi Police exercised total restraint and did not open fire at the mob. “While a number of senior police officers were of the view that firing should have been opened at least at the Tarn Taran youth who hoisted the religious flag atop Red Fort, others said that restraint was the better option. We have registered cases, identified those involved and notices will now be sent under Indian Penal Code (IPC) including the discretion of national monument and disrespect to the National Flag,” said a top police officer on condition of anonymity to Hindustan Times.Delhi Police Commissioner Shrivastava met his Special Commissioners this morning and it was decided to throw the book of law at the unruly and anti-social elements. It was for this very reason the Delhi Police was extremely reluctant in allowing tractors in Delhi and were forewarned by others that the agitating farmers on Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur borders would flout the law. The landlord-farmers, for the past week, had been telling the Delhi Police interlocutor that they want to march on Rajpath, perhaps to vandalise the same area as was done during the protest led by farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait back in 1988.After agreeing to start the tractor parade on designated routes, the unruly farmers started attacking concrete barriers as early as 8am and weaponized the tractor to provoke the Delhi Police.“We have 394 injured policemen. But had Delhi Police given to provocation and opened fire even on that man who hoisted the religious flag, everyone would have blamed us by portraying farmers as innocent victims. It would not have mattered to anyone that these unruly mob was using tractors to run down police officers and personnel,” said a senior special commissioner of Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/objective-of-unruly-farmer-mob-was-to-march-down-rajpath-and-embarrass-india-101611733486257.html

The price of one litre of petrol is now ₹92.86 and one litre of diesel is ₹ 83.30.On Tuesday, one litre of petrol cost ₹92.62, while one litre of diesel cost ₹83.03.Earlier, the highest petrol price was recorded in October 2018 with a litre costing ₹91.34 in the city, while the highest price of diesel was recorded on January 14, costing ₹81.60 for one litre.Citing difficulties in operations with the constant increase in fuel prices, transporters are now contemplating on protests. “The people of the country and road transport sectors are adversely impacted by surging fuel prices. The situation is fomenting the crisis in the road transport sector. We are waiting for the budget as we expect some relief from the government in terms of excise duty. There is acute pressure on us to make a call to strongly to protest against the insensitivity of the government towards the rising fuel cost and making their operations economically unviable.” Bal Malkit Singh, chairman, All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC).Citizens have also expressed their displeasure with the increase in fuel and have asked both the central and the state government to lower the fuel prices.“As local train services are not functional for all passengers, most of the people use two-wheelers and their vehicles for commuting. Fuel prices being on an all-time high in the city adds to the financial burden on most of us. The state and central governmentshould immediately take measures to bring the fuel prices under control. Value-added tax (VAT) should be decreased.” said Aishwarya Patil, a Mulund resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fuel-prices-rise-again-petrol-in-mumbai-now-at-92-86-a-litre-101611772139692.html
27-01-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid-19 Vaccine, lower prices bring back optimism in realty: Survey||The future seems brighter for the real estate sector this year after it faced a battering in 2020 courtesy of the Covid-19 pandemic and resultant lockdown.The reason — introduction of the Covid-19 vaccine, reduction in realty prices, low-interest rates on home loans, improved economic activity as well as proactive steps taken by the government to help the sector.This is according to a survey by Knight Frank, a real estate consultancy firm published on Tuesday. The survey, titled “Real Estate Sentiment Index”, is based on responses from 170 builders and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).“We are seeing a revival in economic activity and hiring taking place. Also, builders have lowered their prices and even interest rates on home loans have hit rock bottom. This will only result in more launches as well as sales in the coming months,” said Rajani Sinha, chief economist and national director-research, Knight Frank. Sinha said that steps taken by the Maharashtra government to reduce stamp duty played a pivotal role in pushing up sales.The real estate sector, which was facing a slowdown, suffered huge crises due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The realty sector came to a complete halt as new launches, sales and construction activity were unable to proceed due to financial issues and shortage of manual labour. However, the last months of 2020 saw improvement in new launches and sales, alongside the revival of construction activity.Commenting on the report, Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director, Hiranandani Group of Companies, called it a resurgence of the realty sector. “We are seeing a renewed interest in home buying, and a large number of transactions have been taking place. This has vastly improved the sentiments which will be sustainable throughout this year. We also expect a positive Union budget which will script a revolution in the real estate sector,” said Hiranandani.With a huge inventory piling up, builders have resorted to offering discounts as well as offers to consumers. Banks and NBFCs have also cut down interest rates significantly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-19-vaccine-lower-prices-bring-back-optimism-in-realty-survey-101611771960451.html
27-01-2021||Noida||Fearing police action, many leave UP Gate protest site after violence in Delhi||Ghaziabad: A day after the incidents of violence in Delhi, the UP Gate protest site was quiet on Wednesday as many of the protesters along with their tractor-trolleys left the site on Tuesday night. According to the local intelligence unit of the Ghaziabad police, many protesters left out of fear of any action by the police after the incidents in Delhi. It is alleged that many of the protesters in their tractors on Tuesday morning had broken the barricades at the UP Gate and entered Delhi where some of them allegedly attacked and even brandished swords at the policemen while others created ruckus at ITO before reaching the Red Fort. “Many of the protesters left in their tractors on Tuesday night fearing a police action. There are about 50% tents at UP Gate which are lying vacant since Tuesday and even the langars are not having much of visitors which otherwise were seen beelined for having food and snacks,” said an officer from the local intelligence wing. The estimated gathering at the UP Gate had swelled to about 15-20 thousand, but the site wore a deserted look on Wednesday with estimated 700-800 people present there. “Many have left due to fear of police action while some have gone back as they had only come to attend the tractor rally. The incident at the Red Fort on the Republic Day was a sorry picture. It was absolutely wrong and unpardonable. I am also planning to leave by Wednesday night,” said Satpal Singh, a protester who had come from Rampur district in UP along with his son. The langars setup by different organisations were also vacant while many camps were getting dismantled by the protesters. Even, below the UP Gate flyover where majority of occupants are from BKU, the area only had a few dozens of tractors/trolleys lined up while others made hasty retreat after incidents in Delhi. Even the UP Gate to Vaishali which was lined up with tractors on Monday and Tuesday was completely cleared of vehicles. The members of the UP Gate site committee, however, said that the gathering will grow in numbers in coming days and the protest will continue with the demand of repeal of three farm laws and a new law on minimum support price. “Some people had gone home since they were staying here for long while some had only come to attend the tractor rally. Many of them are from Uttarakhand and have gone to attend the cremation of the 25-year-old man who died driving tractor in Delhi near ITO on Tuesday. People here are upset about his death. So, there will be more protesters at the site in coming days,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member of UP Gate farmers’ committee and a farmer leader from Uttarakhand. “There was laxity by police at the route of the tractor rally and even the youth were excited, but the route was not conveyed to them properly. When we reached the Red Fort, we called our protesters from there and brought them back,” he added. The committee members on Wednesday also made announcements from the dais and directed that those who have no intention to carry on peaceful protest must leave the site immediately. “We also took a ‘sankalp’ that we will carry our protest peacefully and we will also clear out all rumours. It is a major challenge which has been posed before us. The people who put up the flag at the Red Fort were not our farmers. There seems to be a propaganda and planning against our agitation,” Bajwa added. Some of the protesters who were part of the tractor rally said at the UP Gate on Wednesday that they were not clear about the route and the roads/directions in Delhi. “We went up to the Red Fort in tractors and roads were blocked everywhere. Finally, we had to go to Khajuri Pushta and then went to the Baghpat road. Farmers had absolutely no clues about the roads in Delhi. The first clash was at Vinod Nagar after which tractors went haywire and followed any route available,” said Vishakha Rajput, Hamirpur’s district president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). Many of the tractors which entered the Delhi Meerut Expressway entered the expressway lanes and found no exit point before Akshardham in Delhi. Many of them further went to Delhi. “We were not clear about the route for our tractor rally. Then, we were told to go to ITO where there was stone pelting. Then we moved forward and reached the Red Fort. We saw that people from Singhu Border had already reached there,” said Sanjeev Tomar, a protester from Khair in Aligarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fearing-police-action-many-leave-up-gate-protest-site-after-violence-in-delhi-101611771959042.html
27-01-2021||Noida||Major jolt to farmers’ stir at UP Gate as prominent farmer leader withdraws from ongoing protest||Ghaziabad: A day after the violence in Delhi, the farmers’ agitation at the UP Gate got a major jolt on Wednesday when Sardar VM Singh, a prominent farmer leader who heads the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (RKMS), announced that he was moving out of the protest. Following the Singh’s announcement, the UP Gate protest site committee members quickly reacted by carrying out a march across the entire site to boost the morale of the farmers and urged them to continue their agitation. Singh said that he was upset with the role of Rakesh Tikait, a farmer leader and national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “Rakesh Tikait has attended several meetings with the government, but he did not raise the issues of UP farmers regarding the sugarcane rates and pending payments, among others. These issues were never raised before the government,” Singh said at a press briefing held at UP Gate on Wednesday. The farmers’ tractor rally on the Republic Day had turned violent in Delhi, in which several people, including police personnel, were injured. The Delhi police registered various FIRs against farmers’ leaders and also mentioned name of Sardar VM Singh. Singh also narrated the events which unfolded during meetings before the tractor rally. “A day before the rally, we discussed the route with the local administration. Later, it came to fore that Rakesh Tikait was planning some other route. At UP Gate, I myself went to the camp of Tikait and he agreed that all of us will move together at 11 am on the day of tractor rally. But when we gathered at 10am on January 26, we came to know that Tikait’s group broke the barriers and left,” Singh alleged. When asked if his decision to withdraw from the ongoing agitation was conveyed to the farmers’ core committee at Singhu Border, Singh replied, “I have no reason to convey the decision to anybody. They are carrying on their protest. We were giving them our unconditional support. But our demands were not kept before the government.” “I was with BKU’s Naresh Tikait and boarded different tractors at 11am on January 26 from UP Gate. Everything was going on smoothly. But in the evening we came to know about the incidents in Delhi and also that one protester had died. So, those who instigated people should be punished. I will leave the UP Gate site and have nothing to do with the protest led by Rakesh Tikait,” Singh said. Over the issue of the FIR naming him, he said that there were about 40-50 FIRs which have been lodged against him in his 20 years of agitational politics. BKU’s Rakesh Tikait was not available for his comments over the issues raised by Singh. However, Gaurav Tikait, BKU’s youth wing president and son of BKU president Naresh Tikait, denied all allegations against Rakesh Tikait. “It was the group led by VM Singh which broke the barriers at the UP Gate and the farmers spilled into Delhi. He is just trying to distance himself from the incidents that took place. We will term him as traitor as he is running away from the agitation and leaving the farmers midway,” Gaurav Tikait said. Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday had blamed the Delhi police for putting up barricades on the designated routes and also defended the farmers. On December 16 last year, the rift between factions of farmer groups was out in open at the UP Gate when Singh, along with another farmer leader Balraj Bhati, opted to create a new dais after allegedly being “expelled” by several farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait. However, a consensus was reached by intervention of several religious leaders and Singh later decided to dismantle the new dais. Singh’s decision did not go down well with the UP Gate farmers’ committee members and they, along with the farmers, led a major march across the UP Gate area on Wednesday evening and also addressed the gathering of protesters. “It is his decision, not ours. I do not wish to call names for people who abandon agitations midway. We will continue with our agitation and decision by Singh will have no impact as he was out from the agitation for long. He was expelled by the ‘Samyukt Kisan Morcha’ long back and the farmers at UP Gate still stand collective for their demands,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, a farmer leader from Uttarakhand and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/major-jolt-to-farmers-stir-at-up-gate-as-prominent-farmer-leader-withdraws-from-ongoing-protest-101611771898896.html

27-01-2021||Gurugram||DTCP forbids builders to carry out changes in building plans with buyers’ consent||Builders in Haryana would no longer be allowed to change their building plans without the prior consent of the existing home buyers. The department of town and country planning(DTCP) on Monday issued a directive, asking developers to issue advertisements in newspaper, seek possible objections of buyers, and address them to get their project plans changed. Officials said that the decision has been taken following complaints received from home buyers, alleging that plans were changed arbitrarily without informing them. Sanjiv Mann, senior town planner, said that developers will be required to invite objections from each of the existing buyers regarding the said amendment in the building/layout plan in at least three leading newspapers in the district. “All buyers must also be informed about the proposed changes through a registered postal letter. The objective is to ensure that buyers are not kept in the dark while changes are carried out in a project. The department had received a number of complaints in this matter,” he said. The directions issued by the department has further made it compulsory for the builder to upload the original building plan and the proposed revision on its website. The allottees in a project have been given 30 days to file objections with the senior town planner of the circle, who shall analyse the changes in detail. The objections and suggestions made by buyers would be considered on merit by the director of DTCP before a final decision is taken on the proposed revision of the plan, said officials.Mann added that DTCP will seek clarification and report from the developer, and until a decision is reached, the developer will not be allowed to advertise for further booking or sale of apartments. “Buyers complain many a times that the parking sites, parks, community centres, and suchlike are changed arbitrarily without informing them,” he said.Prashant Solomon, managing director, Chintels, and spokesperson, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), NCR, said that responsible developers are already following such practices to ensure that buyers are made aware of the proposed changes. “This direction is a positive step as it will bring in more transparency and ensure that buyers are fully informed about their projects,” he said. In a related development, the DTCP also issued directions that common areas and facilities in private licensed colonies shall be governed by Haryana Apartment Owners Act of 1983 and the H-Rera Act of 2016 shall not be applicable on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-forbids-builders-to-carry-out-changes-in-building-plans-with-buyers-consent-101611768718419.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||Lack of cremation facilities in newer sectors compounds our grief: Residents||Last month, when Sunil Srivastva, a resident of Sare Homes in Sector 91, lost his mother-in-law, he did not realise that apart from emotional distress, his family would also be facing a logistical nightmare in performing the last rites as it would have to be carried out at a cremation ground located 22 kilometres away, at Madanpuri near Rajiv Chowk.Srivastva, who moved to Gurugram from Varanasi, said that the relatives who had come from his native city and other parts of the country had to be taken to the distant Madanpuri crematorium in two instalments. He says that amid the grief, he would never forget arranging for vehicles, getting stuck in traffic jam at Kherki Daula toll and directing relatives to reach Rajiv Chowk.The problems faced by Srivastav is not unique as many families, who have recently shifted to developing sectors along the Dwarka Expressway and Southern Peripheral Road, have faced the trauma as they are denied access to smaller crematoriums attached to local villages and are forced to travel far to the main city for the final rituals. For this reason, residents of these areas and residents’ welfare associations representing the condominiums gave met the GMDA officials last Saturday, asking for at least three such facilities in sectors 77 to 95. “When someone dies in a family, it is not possible for everyone to arrange multiple vehicles to go to Gurugram for the final rites. The local villages like Mevka, Dhorka and others don’t give access to their facilities. We have become permanent residents of this area and need a share in such amenities, as going to Madanpuri or other such places in city is a distressing experience,” said Srivastva. Deepak Balwada, a resident of a newer sector, who lost a family member last year, said that going to a distant place for the final rites is an emotionally draining experience. “The government should create such a facility for area residents,” he said. The United Association of New Gurugram, an association of RWAs, said that 20,000 families have shifted to this area and the population is increasing rapidly. In such circumstances, they decided to submit a memorandum to GMDA to get this facility. Praveen Malik, president, Sare Homes RWA, and of the United Association, said that the GMDA has land in the newer sectors and could help the residents by setting up at least three crematoriums in sectors 77 to 95. “The population is expanding and presently, around 50,000 residents have started living in this area. When someone dies, they mostly are forced to go to Madanpuri for cremation. Death is a universal truth and every family has to face it and the GMDA must look into our genuine demand for crematoriums,” said Malik. The issue of cremation grounds for migrant residents from outside the state is not only an issue in developing sectors but even in areas along the Golf Course Road, where the lack of such a facility is a major cause for concern. The Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) is now building a large cremation facility in Sector 52, but this is also being opposed by residents of Wazirabad, who allege that this crematorium is too close to the village settlement. Officials of the GMDA, meanwhile, said that they will look into the demands of the residents and consider it. “I have yet to receive any memorandum regarding this matter, but GMDA will certainly consider this demand for setting up such facilities,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer, GMDA. A social activist, Virender Singh, popularly known as Biru Sarpanch, when asked about the matter said that government should set up a large facility that uses gas and electricity. “The crematoriums attached with village settlements are small and can’t cater to large urban population. Sometimes, the villagers object due to traffic jams and pollution. The best way is to create a large modern facility along the Dwarka Expressway,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lack-of-cremation-facilities-in-newer-sectors-compounds-our-grief-residents-101611768717875.html

The incident took place on the night of January 25 when Manoj Kumar, a resident of Palam Vihar extension, had gone to drop his friend Pawan in Kanhai village. “Around 11.30pm on Monday, I was driving towards Kanhai village from Sector 45 along with my friend after dropping some guests. We spotted a Scorpio and i20 parked on the middle of the road and requested the drivers of the vehicles to remove the cars and give us way to cross the stretch. This led to an argument,” said Kumar, the complainant.Kumar said the drivers called their friends and soon, around 12 to 15 persons from adjoining areas assembled at the spot and attacked them with sticks and iron rods.The police said that they had also threatened to kill the victims if they visited the area again. After the attackers left the spot, Manoj and his friend went to a nearby private hospital for treatment, following which the hospital staff informed the police control room and a team from the Sector 40 station visited them and recorded their statements. The police said that both the victims were discharged after being given first aid. On the basis of Kumar’s complaint, a case was registered under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (unlawful assembly), 323 (causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 40 police station, against unidentified persons. “The police are trying to identify the suspects,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/duo-assaulted-by-group-of-12-while-travelling-in-sector-40-101611768662740.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||MCG to turn Sector 46 market into a polythene-free zone||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has started work on converting Sector 46 market into a polythene-free zone. It is the second such market — after Sector 23 market — where the civic body has carried out such an initiative.Sector 46 market, located in close proximity to Bakhtawar Chowk, has a number of prominent eateries, hypermarkets, and shopping stores. As per MCG officials, at least 80 kilograms of polythene is used in the market every day.Dheeraj Kumar, MCG joint commissioner, Swachh Bharat Mission, said that the conversion of markets into a polythene-free area is being carried out under the Swachh Survekshan 2021 initiative.“All shopkeepers have been informed about the side effects of polythene. Further, they have also been informed about the Haryana Non-Biodegradable Garbage Control Act. We are also appealing to customers who come to the market to bring cloth bags, jute bags or any type of compostable bags with them, and to refrain from using polythene,” said Kumar.Kuldeep Singh, MCG brand ambassador for Swachh Bharat Mission, said that there are around 127 shops and 79 street carts in the market, whose owners have cumulatively ordered around 19,000 cloth bags from the MCG’s cloth bag bank.Depending on the size, a cloth bag from the MCG bank can cost anywhere between ₹3 and ₹20.MCG officials said that converting a market into a polythene-free area has three main stages:“In the first stage, we generate awareness among shopkeepers and customers. We visit each shop in a market area and sensitise shopkeepers about the harms of polythene and also erect boards in front of their shops informing customers about the same. Street plays are also performed by locals NGOs to generate awareness,” said Kumar.In the second stage, MCG undertakes formal discussions with the market association and prominent shopkeepers who show an inclination for the change. They are also recognised for their efforts with certificates and mementoes.“In the third stage, we initiate enforcement measures across the market and fine any shopkeeper or customer using polythene bags. The entire process for making a market polythene-free takes a minimum of 2-3 months as the habit of using polythene is deeply embedded in public consciousness,” said Kumar, adding that the Sector 46 market is currently in the second phase.Last month, MCG officials had started work on converting the Sector 23 market, located near Palam Vihar, into a polythene-free area. As per Kumar, enforcement measures will commence in the Sector 46 market from next month onwards.Kuldeep Singh said that after Sector 46 market, the civic body is looking to convert Sector 4 market and Vyapar Kendra market in Sushant Lok-1 into polythene-free areas.“We are extending full-fledged support towards MCG for this cause. Around 30% of the market has become polythene-free. Once MCG initiates enforcement measures, the rest of the market will also quickly adapt to this change,” said Vikram Yadav, president, Sector 46 market association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-to-turn-sector-46-market-into-a-polythene-free-zone-101611768661698.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||Rewari residents tell farmers to vacate, expressway likely to be reopened||A day after protesters carrying out a tractor rally clashed with the police in Delhi on Republic Day, villagers in Rewari asked the protesters in the area to vacate. Many residents said after the incident in Delhi, they are not willing to support the farmers camping on the Delhi-Jaipur highway at Sangwari Chowk in Rewari and Masani village near Dharuhera, and gave them an ultimatum to vacate the sites by Thursday noon. Capt (retd) Lala Ram, sarpanch of Masani village, said that they were supporting the farmers till Tuesday but have been hurt by the violence that unfolded on Republic Day. “The farmers from different states have been camping in our area for over a month now. They have spoiled our fields, broken water pipelines and damaged service lanes. Many local farmers have complained of their misconduct, but we ignored that and helped them with essential services and extended support by providing dry ration and dairy products. On Wednesday, we asked them to vacate the land and told them that our areas should be cleaned and cleared before noon, failing which we will throw their belongings and impound their vehicles,” he said. Satnarayan Nehra, the president of Nehra Khap of Haryana, said they are vacating the two sites in Rewari on Thursday morning. “We have asked the protesters to wind up from Sangwari Chowk and Masani and to proceed to Shahjahanpur. More than 200 protesters called off the protest and left for their respective villages on Wednesday night. We will still protest till our counterparts are camping at Delhi borders. It will be a united decision to leave or to stay,” he said. Ram Kishan Mehlawat, a protester from Bawal, said, “The villagers have requested us and we respect their decision. We are not part of the hooligan groups that created ruckus and violence in Delhi, but we are also labelled in the same category. We are not left with any choice and so, we will join the farmers at Shahjahanpur and shift our base.”Farmers had been camping in Rewari after breaking through the barricades at Shahjahanpur on January 1. The Haryana Police had lathicharged the protesters and used water cannons to stop them, but more than 20 tractors and 100 farmers managed to pass through. Rajesh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Bawal, said, “They are returning to their first base camp now. We will not allow any other tractor and vehicle of these protesters to re-enter the Rewari area once they vacate the sites completely. They have occupied a large portion of main carriageway and had set up tents at two different locations, leading to traffic chaos on the National highway.” The police had been diverting commuters through Alwar and Sohna to move towards Jaipur. Kumar said the expressway will likely be opened for commuters on Thursday after almost a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rewari-residents-tell-farmers-to-vacate-expressway-likely-to-be-reopened-101611768660927.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||GMDA revises EDC payment schedule to help builders tide over post-Covid slump||With real estate industry being in a state of downturn ever since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) collection of external development charges (EDC) has taken a significant hit, show official records. In order to tide over the crisis, the authority has recently restructured its EDC payment schedule, allowing developers to pay their dues in installments and offering discounts to those who clear their outstanding dues in one go.As per the GMDA’s statement of income for the ongoing financial year, the authority has collected only ₹88.5 crore in EDC from developers as of December 2020. In comparison, EDC collection for the financial year ending in March 2020 stood at over ₹20 crore. EDC refers to the money that private developers pay to the government when developing new real estate projects. These funds are utilised by urban local bodies to develop public amenities for the project’s benefit, such as roads, water, power, sewerage and drainage. The quantum of EDC is decided by relevant local authorities, such as the GMDA or the department of town and country planning (DTCP), and then typically passed on to property buyers by the developer. The fall in EDC collection post Covid-19 is likely to compound the GMDA’s financial constraints, at a time when the estimated deficit in EDC in Gurugram runs into thousands of crores. While official figures are not in the public domain, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, speaking at a public event in July last year, estimated that nearly ₹12,000 crore in EDC dues are pending in both Gurugram and Faridabad. A senior official in the GMDA’s urban planning department, seeking anonymity, said, “More than half of this amount is yet to be collected from projects in the city. Builders claim they are unable to pay because inventory just isn’t moving. People aren’t investing in property right now.” The official also added that this will affect the development of future public amenities as well. “Take the Southern Peripheral Road revamp for example. A large part of the project is to be funded from earlier EDC receipts, which have not yet been received. So that area still suffers from bad roads and poor drainage. A lot of developing neighbourhoods, especially in sectors 58 to 115, wouldn’t have be facing constant issues with power water supply if EDC collection was done in a streamlined manner,” the official said.In response, the GMDA has now restructured its EDC payment schedule for projects requiring a change of land use (CLU) licences. The new system, officials said, will help builders tide over the current market slump, while allowing the GMDA to recover a larger portion of EDC dues up front. The GMDA had first restructured it’s EDC payment schedule in August 2019, during the tenure of its former CEO V Umashankar. At the time, from recovering just 10% of the EDC from developers before granting occupancy certificates (OC), the schedule was revised to collect 10% of dues at the time of issuing the change of land use (CLU) permits. Another 40% was collected at the time of approving the developer’s building plan, and 50% at the time of providing the project’s occupancy certificate. However, in its last meeting on December 8, 2020, the GMDA decided to revise this schedule in view of the “post-Covid” situation. Accordingly, the GMDA will now collect 20% of EDC at the time of granting CLU, while another 40% will be collected during the approval of building plans. Of this second tranche, developers will be required to pay only half the amount up front, while the remainder can be paid in equal installments over a period of one year. The third tranche of 40%, payable at the time of applying for OC, can also be paid in similar installments — half at the time of application, with two more equal installments to be paid over one year. This is at the condition of a bank guarantee submitted by the developer.The GMDA’s interest rates for each installment have been decided at 12% per annum, with an additional 3% “penal interest” to be levied on defaulters. In case developers choose to clear their outstanding dues in one go, they will be given an “incentive discount” of 10%. Builders who have already been granted CLU licences (vis-a-viz the previous payment schedule) will be required to clear 20% of their EDC dues in the next 30 days, and will be allowed to pay the remaining 80% in four equal installments over two years.Though he did not comment on the total quantum of EDC dues owed to the GMDA, CEO VS Kundu admitted to a significant shortfall in EDC receipts. “Out of the ₹1,000 crore expenditure to be funded out of EDC in the ongoing financial year, only ₹170 crore was received, of which ₹50 crore was given to the GMDA and ₹120 crore to the National Highways Authority of India. The budget for the next year is yet to be drawn up,” Kundu said. As per the last available data, obtained from the GMDA in 2019 via an RTI request, the total EDC amount yet to be collected by the GMDA stood at ₹7,549 crore in March 2019 — up from ₹3,247 crore in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-revises-edc-payment-schedule-to-help-builders-tide-over-post-covid-slump-101611768659608.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||Repetition of beneficiaries a problem, say Gurugram officials||To estimate the actual vaccination coverage in the district, the health department has sought to revise the beneficiary list, citing duplicity in data. The decision, however, has to be taken by the Central government, said a senior state health department official.“The duplicity issue has been raised with the Union ministry of health and family welfare. Based on their directive, a decision on revising beneficiary list will be taken,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department. “Until a decision is taken, the target is to continue covering the healthcare workers and utilise the existing vaccine supply. Throughout the state, the vaccine coverage has been more than 58%, which has to be increased further,” he said. The district health department, after holding multiple vaccination sessions in almost 21 private hospitals, found names repeating in more than one site.At the vaccination site, the list available with the vaccination officer contains the name of the registered beneficiary along with the identity card number, date of birth and phone number. “Ideally, the Co-WIN platform should not have duplicity issue when unique specific details are linked with every beneficiary,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“It has come to our notice that in some cases, a single doctor has been registered with a couple of health facilities, which unnecessarily increases the count of vaccine beneficiaries,” he said. Yadav said, “Many health staff in private facilities have switched jobs or moved out of the city. Likewise, students in the final year of medical courses could have graduated and moved back to their home towns. These missing healthcare workers have to excluded to estimate the actual vaccination coverage.”Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “We will ask hospitals and medical college to share the list of employees and students who have left. A cumulative list of such beneficiaries can be prepared until further directives from the state health department are received.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/repetition-of-beneficiaries-a-problem-say-gurugram-officials-101611768658756.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||Daily vaccination targets, session sites reduced||After vaccinating almost 55% of the registered front-line healthcare workers since the Covid-19 vaccine launch on January 16, the district health department has planned to reduce the number of vaccination sites and the daily target.Officials cited multiple reasons, ranging from apprehension among the health staff to duplicity in data uploaded on Co-WIN platform, for the change in approach and reducing the daily target.At least 20,380 healthcare workers of the 37,000 registered staff have received the first dose of the vaccines till Wednesday. The health department had carried out vaccinations at 80 to 101 vaccination sites over the last week.On Wednesday, the number of sites was reduced to 21, with a target of inoculating only 1,050 healthcare workers, with as many as 895 taking the jabs. This included 66 beneficiaries of Covaxin, against the target of 100, and 829 of 950 who were allotted Covishield.“Vaccination is a voluntary exercise. People can be motivated to come forward, but they cannot be given a shot forcefully. Therefore, it can be only expected that an additional 10% healthcare workers might turn up in the next few days, and the overall coverage of healthcare workers can go up to 65% or slightly more,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.He said that total targets have been achieved at many of the sites, due to which they are no longer needed, and this would also prevent vaccine wastage. “In some hospitals, only a few people out of the targeted are left, for which multiple sites within the same facility are not required. Other issues, like duplicity in the data of vaccine beneficiaries, absence of staff in some hospitals, as they have switched over to other facilities or left the city before the vaccination started, also have to be counted. All this will also lead to a reduction in overall beneficiary numbers,” said Yadav.Vaccination at limited sites is likely to continue as scheduled until the department gets clarity on initiating inoculation of other prioritised groups like police personnel and urban local body officials.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “On Thursday, vaccination will be held at 23 private hospitals and in at least 10 government facilities. Likewise, on January 29 and 30, there will be only 24 vaccination sites.”He said that there will be no Covid-19 vaccination drive on January 31, February 2 and 3 as the health workers will be deployed for pulse polio drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/daily-vaccination-targets-session-sites-reduced-101611768658029.html
27-01-2021||Gurugram||2,200 booked in Palwal for breaking barricades, trying to move to Delhi through Faridabad||The Palwal Police on Wednesday booked 2,200 people for allegedly trying to break through their barricades on Republic Day, in an attempt to reach Delhi, where the tractor rally had already turned violent. Faridabad district authorities have also imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC, preventing assembly of five or more persons at one place. More than 30 farmers from Faridabad and Palwal who have been identified from video recordings were served notices to join the ongoing investigation, said police.Deepak Gahlawat, superintendent of police, Palwal, said that a route was designated for the protesters to carry out a tractor rally on Tuesday and the same had been conveyed to them. He said that they did not follow the given route and instead took the stretch connecting to Delhi, due to which the police resorted to lathicharge. “Groups of protesters drove their tractors dangerously and tried to break barricades to force their way into Delhi through a non-designated route at Palwal-Faridabad border on the Agra-Mathura-Delhi Highway, endangering the lives of police personnel on duty,” he said. “We had given them an option to use the 60-kilometre stretch of Kundli–Ghaziabad–Palwal Expressway and had directed them to use the route after taking a right turn from Faridabad’s Sector 58. However, they were adamant on using the other route, towards Delhi, for which permission could not be granted,” Gahlawat said. Sub-inspector Hanish Khan, investigating officer of Gadpuri police station in Palwal, where the case was registered, said that protesters on 350 to 400 tractors turned violent. They allegedly broke through barricades and containers, and blocked the national highway between 11.30am and noon, near Softa village in Gadpuri. “The protestors tried to enter Faridabad district and move towards Delhi, but were stopped by the police by using tear gas, water cannons and lathicharge. It took almost an hour to control the situation and we later held a meeting with the protesters, following which they calmed down and agreed to return to Palwal,” he said. The police registered a case against the protesters on Tuesday under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 307 (attempt to murder), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Section 8 of the National Highways Act. A few police personnel and farmers were allegedly injured in the incident, while two senior police officers had a narrow escape. Faridabad and Palwal police have increased deployment at borders connecting to Delhi. The police are also scanning drone recordings, CCTV cameras, videography and pictures to identify the suspects and arrest themYashpal Yadav, Faridabad’s deputy commissioner, said that under Section 144 of the CrPC, gatherings of five or more than five people, carrying sticks, iron rods, axe, swords or any kind of firearms is prohibited. “We are taking precautionary measures after the incident on Tuesday due to the apprehension of tension, damage to public property and loss of life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/2200-booked-in-palwal-for-breaking-barricades-trying-to-move-to-delhi-through-faridabad-101611768597832.html

27-01-2021||Chandigarh||My phone hasn’t stopped ringing, says Rajni Bector after winning Padma Shri||Ever since the news of her being honoured with the Padma Shri broke, Rajni Bector’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. Being a recipient of the fourth highest civilian honour in the country, the 80-year-old founder of Cremica confesses it is a moment of glory for her family and residents of Ludhiana. “I have been flooded with congratulatory calls right since January 25 evening when the list of awardees was released by the government. My phone was buzzing till 1am the day before and yesterday was no different. Everyone is elated and is expressing their joy. It is a great honour,” she says, adding that her phone also got blocked for a moment due to the high number of calls pouring in together. Chairman of Mrs Bectors Food Specialities Limited, the octogenarian says the journey spanning four decades has been extremely fulfilling.Recently, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Mrs Bectors Food Specialties opened to a resounding success, garnering 198 subscriptions to its IPO on the third day of bidding, generating bids worth ₹40,000 crore and a market value of ₹540 crore.Starting out from her own tiny kitchen, Bector forayed into full-time business in 1978, with an investment of ₹20,000. “Everyone used to tell me the ice-creams I make are good and I should expand my work. I came from a service class background and had not thought about making my passion into a commercial venture earlier. I studied bakery at PAU, where my teachers were instrumental in inspiring me. After my sons grew up, they also joined me in the business one by one,” she says. Bector’s biscuits, breads, buns, spreads and sauces gained popularity and her hold over market grew. Today Mrs Bector’s Food Company is valued at ₹800 crore and is exporting sauces to 64 countries. The turning point came in the 1990s when McDonald’s was looking to establish base in the country. “We got to know they were struggling to find makers of quality buns. We met their company officials, all of whom were foreigners, and the deal was soon finalised,” she says. Bector now supplies buns and sauces to major fast-food brands in the country, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Cafe Coffee Day and the like with their manufacturing units spread across the country. Born in Karachi in 1940, Bector and her family later settled in Delhi. She was married into a Ludhiana-based business family, who were initially into fertiliser manufacturing business. When her three sons went to boarding school, Bector enrolled into a bakery course at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU).Reminiscing her initial years in the city, Bector says the city has grown by leaps and bounds. “When I came to Ludhiana in 1957, there used to be just four cars in the entire city. My husband and I used to walk from the Damoria pull to the Fountain Chowk, where people used to sit and chat. Life was much simpler in the absence of internet and social media,” she says. Ask her the secret of success and she has only one word to say: “work”. “We never compromise on quality and keep innovating with the times. Quality is supreme and that is what I always tell all my sons and grandchildren as well,” she says, returning to yet another flurry of calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/my-phone-hasn-t-stopped-ringing-says-rajni-bector-after-winning-padma-shri-101611768178580.html

It is third farm where bird flu has been confirmed in Mohali’s Dera Bassi subdivision and ninth in the region, which also comprises Barwala poultry belt in the neighbouring Panchkula district. The samples had tested posted at the Northern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (NRDDL), Jalandhar, last week, following which they had been forwarded to the Bhopal lab.“We got the report from Bhopal on Wednesday evening,” said VK Janjua, additional chief secretary, animal husbandry, dairy development and fisheries, Punjab. “We have constituted 10 teams to cull 25,000 birds at Evergreen farm. The work will begin on Thursday.” The culling operations at the two other poultry farms in Dera Bassi’s Behra village were completed on Monday. In all, 55,483 birds were culled. “A total of 26,438 birds at Royal and 29,045 birds at Alpha poultry farm have been culled and buried. The exercise was undertaken as per the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009,” said Janjua. In Panchkula, too, 81,000 birds were culled at three farms during nine-day operations that ended more than a week back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bird-flu-confirmed-at-third-poultry-farm-in-dera-bassi-101611768118458.html

Azad group had already declared a list of 30 candidates.“We will have an alliance with AAP for MC elections. Talks are going on,” said Kulwant, who parted ways with Shiromani Akali Dal earlier this month.AAP’s district president Parminder Singh Goldy said the party wants 50-50 seat sharing and talks are going on with Azad group. “The official announcement will be on Friday,” he said. With the latest development, the MC elections are set to witness a four-cornered contest between SAD, Congress, BJP and AAP-Azad group alliance.Alleging the alliance was forged during a dinner meeting between AAP state unit president Bhagwant Mann and Kulwant, who is also a realtor, Charanjeet Singh Brar, political adviser to SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, said: “Mann has sold his party to corporates. Where are the party’s senior leaders now.” Taking a jibe at AAP and Azad group, Congress leader and cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said: “The issue is that both are not getting candidates for the elections, so they are entering an alliance.” Kulwant Singh on January 21 released a list of 30 candidates, with most of the Akali leaders and former councillors who resigned in his support getting the ticket from Azad group. Mohali’s civic body is elected for a period of five years, with the last term ending on April 26, 2020. In the 2015 elections, Kulwant had led the Azad group and won 10 seats. With the support of Congress, he was elected the mayor. Later, in 2017, he joined SAD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-mc-elections-aap-to-have-alliance-with-kulwant-group-101611767998336.html

27-01-2021||Chandigarh||CHB plans to cut property reserve prices by 10%||A 10% price cut is on the cards for Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) properties slated to be auctioned in February.CHB plans to auction residential and commercial properties, both leasehold and freehold, at 10% lower reserve prices than that in its last auction in December 2019.Confirming the development, Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer (CEO), CHB, said: “The reserve price has been decreased keeping in mind the current real estate market and as the response to the 2019 auction was not on expected lines.”Stating that the economic scenario hasn’t changed since the 2019 auction, Garg said the cut was suggested by the CHB committee on reserve price. “The final decision on the reduction will be taken by the UT adviser, who is also the CHB chairman,” he said.In all, there are 119 residential properties on offer, of which 11 are leasehold and 108 are freehold. These properties are mainly located in Sectors 38 West, 39, 51, 61, 63, and Manimajra. All the 150 commercial properties on offer are leasehold, and are mainly in Sectors 51 and 61 besides Manimajra and Maloya.All these are leftover properties, which either couldn’t get buyers in the previous auctions and schemes or have been resumed on account of non-payment of dues.“The condition of such properties, which have remained vacant for a long time, is deteriorating. CHB is losing revenue simultaneously, and has to also spend considerable sums of money on their maintenance,” said a CHB official, wishing to remain anonymous.Encroachment is also a concern, because of which CHB has formed a team dedicated to periodically checking all vacant properties, said the official.Move to attract buyersCHB’s last auction in December 2019 turned out to be a damp squib due to lack of buyer response to its 212 properties, the blame for which was pinned on high reserve prices.The offerings included 64 residential units, of which nine were on leasehold and 55 on freehold. Most of these were located in Sector 63.CHB also faced flak for the high property prices. The highest reserve price of ₹1.07 crore was fixed for a freehold three-bedroom apartment in Sector 63. In the leasehold segment, a high income group apartment in Sector 39 had a reserve price of ₹1.31 crore. The reserve price of an economically weaker section apartment in Sector 51 was ₹30 lakh, and that of a one-bedroom apartment in Sector 63 was ₹54.80 lakh. All the 48 commercial properties offered were on leasehold. Their price ranged from ₹50 lakh to ₹2 crore. “Leasehold properties generally don’t attract buyers. This year, too, CHB doesn’t expect a great response to these. Even in the UT estate office auction in 2019, no commercial property could be sold, while all residential properties (which were on freehold) were auctioned at much higher bids than reserve prices,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chbplans-to-cut-property-reserve-prices-by-10-101611767818350.html

This week, trial runs will take place and immediately after, the service will start. For the last two months, this issue of starting this BRT route has been in the eye of a storm with Pune city’s mayor Murlidhar Mohol announcing that it would start on January 1, 2021. Due to a lack of necessary safety arrangements and infrastructure, PMPML could not start the service. Since then, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been completing all the work at bus stations along the route. “There are four to five points which we had asked for, in terms of passenger safety and without that, we couldn’t start our service. First, was to install automatic doors at the bus stations, then, to install CCTV cameras and have locked premises at each bus station. Also for passengers, when they come out of the bus station, pedestrian signals will be needed. These were the demands and most of the work is now complete,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director. “In next couple of days we are going to have trial runs on this route. Also, a joint inspection and checking of the BRT route will be done by PMPML and PMC officials before starting the service,” added Jagtap. PMPML had also approached the Pune traffic police to get help from traffic police to monitor vehicles coming into the BRTS corridor. So far, as the corridor was not operational, all vehicles used to use it. Earlier, before the Covid-19 pandemic, daily 2,800 trips used to happen only on this stretch between Swargate to Katraj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katrajswargate-brts-route-ready-for-trial-runs-101611765056929.html
27-01-2021||Pune||Parents’ association “unsatisfied” after meeting with Gaikwad on fees’ issue||After discussing the issue of reduction in school fees with Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad, the parents’ association of Pune did not receive a satisfactory response. The parents’ association of Pune in a written application noted that during the pandemic, 16 states across India reduced the fees incurred by schools. “However, such a provision has not been made in Maharashtra. Due to the pandemic, many parents have lost their jobs, and many are getting pay cuts. In such a scenario, the schools are charging normal fees and harassing parents who are not able to pay full fees. Schools are harassing parents who paid one installment or two installments too. But the government is not helping parents in this matter,” said Jayshree Deshpande, president of the parents’ association of Pune. The Deputy Director of Education (DYDE) had issued a notification in which seven city-based schools were asked to submit an order report by January 15. However, two schools have received a stay by the high court. “The rest five reports are ready and will be given to parents in the next few days,” said the education department officials. The association has been lodging complaints against seven schools who allegedly were overcharging fees and denying online education to several students. Gaikwad assured that the department is looking into the matter. The audit reports have not yet been made public yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-association-unsatisfied-after-meeting-with-gaikwad-on-fees-issue-101611764217349.html
27-01-2021||Pune||After opposition to new airport site, Purandar MLA says farmers won’t be forced||Farmers from six villages in Purandar where the administration has identified a new site for the proposed airport have formed a coordination committee to oppose land acquisition, a move likely to delay the project further. The landowners from six villages in Purandar tehsil - Rise, Pise, Naigaon, Rajouri, Pandeshwar, Pimpri - held another meeting on Tuesday in which course to opposition for land acquisition to the proposed airport was discussed. The local legislator Sanjay Jagtap, who was present during the meeting, assured farmers that no land will be acquired unless landowners give their consent for the project. Jagtap had earlier led the protest of farmers from seven villages - Pargaon, Rajewadi, Munjewadi, Vanpuri, Kumbalvalan, Ekhatpur and Udachi Wadi – and forced the government to shift the site. “Nothing will be finalised without talking to people. Once the centre gives a nod to the new site, we will go to people and discuss it with them. If they approve, then the project will continue. If they say no it won’t,” said Jagtap during the meeting. The meeting took place in Naigaon village, where more than 2000 members were present from the affected villages. The farmers alleged that the land to be acquired for the latest site is fertile land, which the owners cannot shed. “We will have to be ready to fight now. We have seen what sort of fight and unity was shown by the villagers of Pargaon and its surroundings. We will have to conduct protests and if required take the matter to the high court. So, we are going to constitute an anti-airport action committee. With representatives from affected villages. Our next moves will be communicated through this channel,” said Kiran Salunkhe, resident of Pimpri village who was present in the meeting. The landowners also alleged they were not consulted before deciding the new site for the international airport and the perception that their land is not fertile is incorrect. “Our area used to be drought-prone before 20-22 years but we have converted it into an irrigated land through artificial ponds. So why should we give our fertile lands to airport?” said Santosh Kolte a resident of Rajori village, who owns 4-acre land on which he grows sugarcane. Amidst this opposition former minister in Maharashtra state government and former Shiv Sena minister Vijay Shivatare said by shifting site, the plan is to take airport terminal close to Baramati, a stronghold of NCP chief Sharad Pawar. “What was the need to shift the project site? Whom did they consult before doing that? At the old site, the opposition from the villagers had softened and they would have agreed after the land acquisition would have started. But this conspiracy of shifting the project site is being done to benefit Baramati. They want to build a terminal near Baramati. The project will be delayed because of this new proposal now,” said Shivatare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-opposition-to-new-airport-site-purandar-mla-says-farmers-won-t-be-forced-101611764217903.html

We have laid out the standard operating procedures, which schools and teachers have to strictly follow,” said Gaikwad. The minister added that schools in Pune and Mumbai will be reopened after the respective permission of the local bodies. “The schools are required to follow all the standard operating procedures to maintain the safety of children and staff,” said Gaikwad. She further highlighted that a few students have faced transportation problems while commuting to schools. “We will take this up with respective ministers and try to make local transportation available for these students. Commuting to school should not be a hurdle in attending offline classes. We will take stock of the situation with the state transport minister,” said Gaikwad. Gaikwad was inspecting schools in Pune City to review the situation. She interacted with class 10 students. She added that the education department will be conducting a survey of school children. “The most important thing is to track students who are not coming to school. There will be a survey done for students, especially girls. In some schools, there are around 10 per cent students who have dropped. But in some areas, the number has increased. We are dedicated to tracking these students and getting them in the mainstream. The department has started a specific strategy into this matter,” said Gaikwad. The fee issue is a matter pending in Supreme Court, so Gaikwad denied commenting on it. Talking about the unfilled posts of teachers, Gaikwad said that important subjects have been identified and teachers for these posts which are around 6,000 will be filled very soon. She added that the department has made a list of 566 teachers who can counsel students for class 10 and Class 12. Box *On Wednesday, school for class 5 to class 8 reopened in Pune rural. *Schools on the PMC limits shall reopen from February 1 for classes 5 to 8 with 50 percent attendance. Schools are directed to reopen as per the standard operating procedures (SOP) issued by the state and central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gaikwad-school-for-class-4-and-below-will-reopen-after-assessing-safety-of-students-101611764216730.html
27-01-2021||Pune||Shiv Shrushti project lying idle after land allotment in 2018||Though the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) celebrated the Shiv Shrushti project after allotting land at Chandani chowk in February 2018, no land has been acquired yet and the project is lying idle. Shiv Shrushti was planned as a permanent exhibition on the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The exhibition is to feature replicas of Maratha forts. Opposition parties have come down heavily on the BJP. Shiv Sena leader Prithviraj Sutar said, “We were opposed to shifting the Shiv Shrushti project from the garbage depot at Kothrud, but then the BJP office bearers promised to erect it at Chandni chowk. Fadnavis promised to erect a world class project. After shifting the project, all the BJP members wore the saffron turban at the general body meeting and celebrated it like a victory. Now no progress has been made.”Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) member Deepak Mankar, said, “The ruling BJP cheated us. The ruling BJP has not conducted a single meeting to take a review of the project. After the announcement, they celebrated it like a big victory and tried to take credit. Now we request guardian Minister Ajit Pawar to sort out this issue.”Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “BJP should clear whether they want to do this project or not. Despite there being budgetary provision for the project, they are not following up on it.”Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “The then chief minister Devendra Fadvnavis played politics with the project. We said it is not possible to erect the Shiv Shrushti at Chandni chowk as no decision had been taken on the bio diversity park (BDP). Now, it is proved that we were right as no progress has been on land acquisition.”BJP committed to projectThe BJP’s Murlidhar Mohol, Pune mayor, said, “We are committed to erecting the Shiv Shrushti project at Chandni chowk. It will definitely come up at the same place, but due to the bio diversity park issue, little progress has been made. Last year we were busy with Covid-19, so we were not able to follow up. Opposition parties should avoid doing politics over this project.”Mohol added that Congress and NCP were ruling before the BJP in the municipal corporation. “Before allegations and politics, opposition parties must introspect,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shiv-shrushti-project-lying-idle-after-land-allotment-in-2018-101611763616676.html

The improved wind speed and ventilation also reduced the pollution level, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). On Wednesday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered to be the marker for the city, was 5.4 degrees Celsius, which was three degrees below the season’s normal. The maximum temperature was 21.5 degrees Celsius, a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year. At the Palam observatory, the minimum temperature was 6.6 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was recorded 19.4 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said in the next few days, too, the minimum temperature is likely to remain in the same range. “Cold-wave conditions will continue over Delhi till January 29. On Thursday, too, the minimum temperature is likely to be around 4 degrees Celsius. In the early morning hours, there is a possibility of moderate fog, which is expected to clear by 9 or 10am,” Srivastava said. IMD scientists said from January 29, with the impact of another western disturbance, Delhi and NCR are likely to experience some relief from the intense cold. The pollution levels also reduced on Wednesday owing to improved wind speed and ventilation. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that the overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Wednesday was 318, in the “very poor” zone. On Tuesday, the AQI was 330, also in the ”very poor” category. Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), forecast shows that the surface winds on Wednesday were south-westerly and moderate, but the wind direction is forecasted to shift to north-westerly soon. The cold dry winds are expected to lower the temperature again over the next two days. “No significant change is ventilation index is forecasted for the next three days. AQI is likely to marginally improve to the lower end of ”very poor” category for the next three days,” the Safar forecast read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mercury-inches-upwards-slight-relief-from-the-biting-cold-in-delhi-101611763556666.html

Hence a few of the alumni approached Maharashtra Educational Society who thought of it to be a good concept,” said Rabde.Maharashtra Education Society has hired a cloud space of 20 GB on an Australian server with an annual fee of ₹15,000. The past students have contributed and also collected funds through corporate social responsibility (CSR), whereupon the past students will be handling the web radio for a year until the teachers are trained and confident of running the radio.Vidnyan Bharati has also tied up with MES for contributing science-related content.“We have been conducting experimental programmes where science concepts are made easy for students, and we approached Maharashtra Educational Society to create content to make science education easy by bringing in scientists, talking about success stories and making experiments fun,” said Prof RV Kulkarni, president, Vidnyan Bharati.Pune city has two community radio stations The city has two community radios making waves, Radio FTII (Film and Television Institute of India) and Savitribai Phule Pune University-run (SPPU-run) “Vidyavani.”“There is a difference between a web-based radio and a community radio. The community radio is sanctioned and part of the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, while a web radio can be hosted by anyone on an app,” said Anand Deshmukh, director, Vidyavani.“We have informative programmes for college students as well as we have tied up with Akansha NGO to produce a special programme called “Pathshala ki Ghanti Bajao” which is aimed at primary school students,” said Deshmukh.Vidyavani, which began on May 5, 2005, broadcasts over 13 hours of programmes from 7 am to 8 pm on frequency 107.4 FM.Radio FTII 90.4, was inaugurated on January 29, 2007, FTII was one of the very first applicants for setting up of a community radio station. Radio FTII’s programmes are contributed or made by the community itself.“We have many programmes planned for grass root level communities, where social activists regularly visit the Radio FTII and contribute to the content bank. Since its part of FTII, we encourage students and citizens to make a variety of programmes based on Film Education and Cinema,” said Bhupendra Kainthola, director FTII.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-maharashtra-education-society-launches-web-radio-101611763496755.html

A total of 3,667 beneficiaries were vaccinated, out of a targeted 5,200 beneficiaries in the district; while in the city, 1403 beneficiaries of the 1,700 targeted got inoculated, which is the highest for the city since the vaccination launch day on January 16The number of vaccination sites also went up from 44 on Monday, to 51 on Wednesday. Dr Ashish Bharati, chief of PMC’s health department, said, “This is the highest percentage recorded by the city since the launch. This was possible because of the daily follow- up which we have been doing through SMS and calls. We allot the beneficiary to the software manually too which was not allowed earlier and has been allowed now.” Earlier, the administration was completely dependent on the central government’s CoWin app, which was leading to the daily target being missed, but since the administration allowed walk-in vaccination of registered beneficiaries and manual checking, the numbers have gone up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/highest-one-day-turnout-as-83-beneficiaries-vaccinated-in-pune-city-101611763437392.html

The RJD leadership was initially sceptical about the idea of contesting the polls due later this year. Many within the party felt the RJD should not put up candidates and rather support secular parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP rules Assam and emerged as the main challenger to ruling TMC in West Bengal after becoming the second-largest party in the state in the 2019 polls.“We want an alliance with TMC as our first choice. Our primary goal is to defeat the BJP...” said an RJD leader on condition of anonymity.Also read | Only Modi-led BJP can rid Assam of terrorism and intruders: Amit ShahThe delegation led by Abdul Bari Siddiqui and Shyam Rajak will meet West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee during their stay in Kolkata from January 30 to February 2.“ We will... talk about seat-sharing. We will also hold talks with RJD’s West Bengal unit and all aspiring candidates,” said Rajak. He said the state unit’s views would be the deciding factor for alliances with like-minded parties.RJD leaders said TMC could benefit from an alliance with their party as there are sizeable Bihari voters from different caste groups in West Bengal. “Both the TMC and the BJP seek votes of people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In this scenario, RJD’s alliance with secular parties could benefit the secular bloc,” said Siddiqui.The RJD has been contesting three to four seats in West Bengal. An RJD candidate was elected from the Bura Bazaar assembly segment in Kolkata in 2006. The RJD has identified seats in Asansol, Kolkata, and Kharagpur to contest in the 2021 elections.The people cited above said in case talks with TMC on seat arrangement do not materialise, the RJD would then approach the Left-Congress alliance.In Assam, the RJD delegation will meet representatives of AIUDF for a possible alliance. “We want to contest 10-12 seats in Assam. It will be a major foray. The party has contested polls in the state earlier but without success,” said another RJD leader.RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav also plans to visit Kolkata based on the response the the delegation gets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/rjdto-contest-assembly-polls-in-west-bengal-assam-101611748115389.html

Ajit Pawar, Deputy CM and guardian minister of Pune, was present at the prison premises on the occasion of the 72nd Republic Day.The launch of the event was done by 10 students from Genba Sopanrao Moze Vidyalay, chaperoned by three teachers, and were among the first few tourists inside the jail premises.“Now one doesn’t need to commit a crime in order to visit the jail. Instead of “jail bharo”, people can now indulge in “jail firo”. This book by Balasaheb Thackeray describes the then jails - a container with phenyl, aluminium cutlery, and a space to sleep. That cutlery served all kinds of purposes,” said Uddhav Thackeray, chief minister of Maharashtra while speaking through video conference.He also reminisced about the historical importance of the jail premises where the revolutionary Chapekar brothers were sent to the gallows for the murder of British official WC Rand and his security escort for their brutalities on citizens of Pune during the plague in Pune in 1890s. The same yard where the Chapekar brothers were hung for their crimes, was also the place where Ajmal Kasab, convicted in the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, was also hanged to death.“Nana Patole and Aditya Thackeray had spoken about expanding tourism in Maharashtra only days before this proposal was put forth. Home minister Anil Deshmukh came up with the unique idea and came to my house one day to put it across. ADG (Prisons) Sunil Ramanand told me about the places where various freedom fighters were imprisoned. 150 years is not a small time period. Even today it is a specimen of architecture. Balasaheb Thackeray had also been in this jail. He had written to Late Meena Tai. I happened to come across that letter recently,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy home minister, Maharashtra.Freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Motilal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu, and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had been imprisoned here during the freedom struggle of India.“We visited the Gandhi yard, Nehru yard, the fashi (hanging) yard, and witnessed history that we teach our children. It was an experience that brought those lessons to life,” said Nathu Jagdale, teacher at Moze school.Local legislator Sunil Tingre, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao; district collector Rajesh Deshmukh; ADGP (prison) Sunil Ramanand, and police commissioner Amitabh Gupta were also present during the inauguration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/jail-tourism-initiative-inaugurated-by-maharashtra-cm-in-pune-101611746315362.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||Plastic burning main cause behind reduced visibility in Delhi: IIT Madras study||Chloride-rich particles resulting from plastic burning may be primarily responsible for haze and fog formation in Northern India, including Delhi, during the winter months, according to an international study led by researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, may help develop better policies to improve the air quality and visibility in North India.Many studies in the past have identified particulate matter or aerosol particles with diameter less than 2.5 micrometre (PM2.5) as a major pollutant, responsible for haze and fog formation over Indo-Gangetic plain, including Delhi.However, the role of PM2.5 and detailed chemistry of haze and fog formation over national capital was poorly understood.The new study found that chloride-rich particles were the highest inorganic fraction in particulate matter, primarily responsible for haze and fog formation in the region."We realised that despite absolute PM2.5 mass burden over Delhi being much less than other polluted megacities around the world, including Beijing, the pollution and atmospheric chemistry of Delhi is much more complex to understand," said Sachin S Gunthe, Associate Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras, who led the study."This work put forward importance of measurements and modelling approaches to scientifically conclude that half of the water uptake and visibility reduction by aerosol particles around Delhi is caused by the hydrochloric acid (HCl) emissions, which is locally emitted in Delhi potentially due to plastic contained waste burning and other industrial processes," Gunthe said.The latest study greatly enhances our understanding about the precise role of PM2.5 in chemistry of fog formation, which will help policy makers to frame the better policies for improving the air quality and visibility over the national capital.The researchers noted that during winter season, most of the Indo Gangetic Plain invariably is engulfed in a dense fog and haze, particularly during the months of December and January.Over the national capital, dense fog negatively impacts the air and surface transport resulting in huge financial losses and jeopardise human lives, they said.The study explained that complex chemical reactions involving HCl, which is directly emitted in the atmosphere from plastic contained waste burning and few industrial processes, is primarily responsible for high PM2.5 chloride and subsequent haze and fog formation over Delhi during chilly winter nights.The team, including researchers from the Harvard University, US, and Manchester University in the UK, deployed state-of-the-art instruments to measure the chemical composition and other important properties of PM2.5, and the relative humidity and temperature in Delhi.Professor R Ravikrishna, from Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras, noted that with the results from first couple of days, it was very clear to us that Delhi is different."Generally for a polluted urban region like Delhi, one would expect sulfate to be highest inorganic fraction of particulate matter, however, we found chloride to be the highest inorganic fraction of particulate matter," Ravikrishna, who was also part of the study, said.The researchers explained that HCl from various sources combines with ammonia, which is emitted in great amounts over this region.The resulting ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) condenses to aerosol and exponentially increase the water uptake ability of aerosol particles resulting in the increase in size, eventually leading to dense fog formation, they said.In the absence of the excess chloride, the fog formation otherwise would be suppressed significantly, according to the researchers.The study emphasised that plastic burning emits toxic substances in the atmosphere impacting human health, and these emissions are for the first time linked to visibility and climate.Plastic-contained waste burning can emit highly toxic chemicals called 'dioxins', which can accumulate in food chain causing severe problems with reproduction and immune system, the researchers said. "Given that we find plastic burning as a potential cause of the reduced visibility, we hope these findings will help policy makers to efficiently enforce and implement policies that are already in place towards regulating open burning of plastic contained-waste and other potential chlorine sources," Gunthe added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plastic-burning-main-cause-behind-reduced-visibility-in-delhi-iit-madras-study-101611742033226.html

Hearing the matter on January 22, the NGT directed Punjab that the ₹50 crore needs to be forthwith deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for eco-restoration of the Sutlej and Beas rivers. The Punjab government had filed two review petitions with the NGT on January 19 and said that the state has taken several measures, including in-situ remediation of the drains connected to the rivers. “The state is willing to spend ₹50 crore on landscaping Buddha Nullah in Ludhiana,” the application said. STATE HAS TO BE MODEL OF COMPLIANCE: TRIBUNAL The NGT said that Punjab’s appeal had already been dismissed by the Supreme Court and the tribunal’s directive was merged in the apex court’s order, so no review was permitted. “Even after the dismissal of the state’s appeal a year ago, the order of 2018 has not been complied with for which we do not find any justification. Taking future steps is not a ground for not paying compensation for the damage already caused,” the NGT order said. The tribunal said that the state has to be model of compliance of binding orders but “it is acting at its sweet will with no respect for the rule of law”. The NGT directed the amount needs to be forthwith deposited with the CPCB, as already directed for being spent on restoration in terms of a plan, approved by the CPCB. “The draft plan may be prepared by Punjab for consideration by the CPCB chairman. It should primarily cover eco-restoration of the rivers,” the NGT order concluded. FINED IN 2018 FOR INDUSTRIAL DISCHARGE IN RIVERS On November 14, 2018, the NGT fined the Punjab government ₹50 crore for polluting the Sutlej and Beas due to uncontrolled industrial discharge. It directed that the amount deposited with the CPCB would be used for the restoration of the environment and relief to victims with the liberty to recover the amount from erring industries, local bodies, individuals and lax officers. The NGT had clubbed cases of river pollution in Punjab in 2018, one based on a 2014 petition from Rajasthan-based activists Shabnam Godara and Sobha Singh of Hanumangarh district in Rajasthan, which claimed that polluted water from the Sutlej and Beas, entering the state through the Indira Gandhi Canal, was affecting eight districts there. The Indira Gandhi Canal the longest canal of India. It starts from the Harike barrage, a few kilometres below the confluence of the Sutlej and Beas in Punjab and terminates in irrigation facilities in the Thar Desert in northwest Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-directs-punjab-to-deposit-50-cr-with-cpcb-immediately-101611741515043.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||Tractor rally chaos: FIRs filed under attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy||A day after protesting farmers clashed with police and indulged in violence across the city, Delhi Police have filed at least 25 FIRs in cases related to it. While a majority of the cases are registered under sections of rioting, causing hurt by dangerous weapons, obstructing police from doing their duty, police have also filed some cases under heinous sections of attempt to murder and attempt to culpable homicide in clashes reported from the Red Fort, ITO and Ghazipur. In one FIR, police are also probing protesters for destroying CCTV cameras on the road.Delhi Police officers, who did not wish to be named, said the FIRs have the names of many farmer leaders who have been caught on tape instigating people to break barricades and force their way into the national Capital on Tuesday. Police said that some of the FIRs registered in connection with the violence at Red Fort and ITO would be transferred to the Crime Branch -- a specialised unit in the Delhi police.“We have enough evidence in the form of videos which shows unruly protesters grouping together to throw police personnel off the ramparts of the Red Fort. We have a strong legal case of attempt to murder. We will identify those people and take suitable action,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named.In the Red Fort violence case, police have also added sections of criminal conspiracy. This means that police have, prima facie, found that the violence during the rally was not spontaneous but was designed and planned as a conspiracy by the accused persons.Also read | Violence at farmers’ tractor rally: What went wrong in the police plan?A second police officer said that they have also registered FIRs under sections of destruction of evidence. In connection with the vandalism at ITO in central Delhi, police investigation has revealed that some unruly farmers destroyed CCTV cameras installed on the road. Police have registered the FIR under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code.At least 86 police personnel and ten farmers were injured when the tractor rally -- supposed to be peaceful and only in places pre-decided by the police and farmers in their meeting-- resulted in violence and hundreds of farmers laid siege of the Red Fort in the national Capital. Police have claimed that the protesters violated all conditions on the basis of which they were given permission to hold the tractor rally on Republic Day.Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella collective of over 40 farmer groups, had on Tuesday night, following the violence, said that the protest was hijacked by people not connected with them. They also dissociated themselves from the protesters who had attacked the police and indulged in violence during the day.The second police officer cited above said that the many leaders, including those from the SKM, would be probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tractor-rally-chaos-firs-filed-for-attempt-to-murder-destroying-evidence-101611739955413.html
27-01-2021||Mumbai||At 15.3 degrees, Mumbai records lowest temperature of the season||Mumbai woke up to its coldest winter morning on Wednesday as temperatures dropped to 15.3 degree Celsius, the lowest so far this winter season.The Santacruz station of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a minimum temperature of 15.3 degree Celsius, which was 2 degree below normal. Earlier, on January 16, a minimum temperature of 16.6 degree C was recorded at Santacruz. Before that, the lowest minimum temperature of the ongoing winter season was 16 degree Celsius on December 22 last year.Colaba recorded a minimum temperature of 18 degree Celsius, which was 1 degree below the normal temperature.The drop in temperatures was in line with the forecast by IMD. “The IMD had forecast that minimum temperatures in and around Mumbai would drop owing to cold winds from the north. This trend is likely to continue for the next two-three days,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general of western region, IMD.Meanwhile, air quality deteriorated on Wednesday after improving slightly at the beginning of this week. An overall air quality index (AQI)—a pollutant measuring indicator-- of 306 (very poor), was recorded on Wednesday morning. Over the past weekend, air quality had plummeted to the very poor category with AQI measuring 320 on Saturday and 310 on Sunday but improved to 283 (poor) on Monday.The AQI was calculated by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) as the average of indices recorded at 10 locations in the city and suburbs. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.The deteriorated air quality is likely because of the cold conditions as pollutants in the air could not be dispersed, said a spokesperson from SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-15-3-degrees-mumbai-records-lowest-temperature-of-the-season-101611737874048.html
27-01-2021||Jaipur||Petrol costs ₹101.80 per litre in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar||With a hike of 38 paise and 26 paise on Wednesday and Tuesday respectively, the price of petrol in Sri Ganganagar of Rajathan has reached ₹98.40 per litre and premium petrol has reached ₹101.80 per litre. In capital Jaipur, the petrol price has increased to reach ₹93.86 per litre and diesel price to ₹85.94 per litre.The price of petrol is ₹93 upwards across the state, while the rate of diesel is more than ₹85 per litre.Prices of petrol and diesel across the country are market-determined and attract uniform central excise duty, but their prices differ from state to state because of the wide variations in the local levies or value-added tax (VAT).According to an official notification released by the Rajasthan government in May last year, the VAT on diesel prices is 28% whereas VAT on petrol was in access of 38 %.In the neighbouring states, VAT ranges from 20 to 33% on petrol and 16 to 23% on diesel. Due to this, petrol in Rajasthan is costlier by 8 to 10 rupees and diesel by 4 to 11 rupees than other states.In Punjab, the VAT on petrol is 25% and on Diesel it is 15.94%; in Haryana 25% and 16.40%; Gujarat- 20.20 and 20.20% and in UP, it stood at 26.80 and 17.48% for petrol and diesel respectively.A truck driver from Jaipur said that because of the high prices, they avoid fuelling their trucks in the state.“The reason is that if a truck fills 500 liters of diesel, then it saves between 400 and 500 rupees. For example, on Wednesday, diesel is ₹90.11 in Sri Ganganagar, but in neighboring Punjab, it is cheaper by ₹11.22 per litre. Similarly, petrol in Dungarpur is ₹95.93, while in neighboring Gujarat, it is cheaper by ₹11.85 per litre,” the truck driver said.Also Read: India’s economy to shrink by 8% in FY’21, says IMFRajasthan Petroleum Dealers Association (RPDA) President Sunit Bagai said that the body has already given a memorandum to the state government protesting against the highest VAT in the country on automobile fuels.“Last year, VAT was hiked to increase the revenue. Even if the government reduces VAT by more than 5%, its revenue will not decrease,” he said.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had held the Centre responsible for the hike in petrol prices in state. “Blaming state government for hike in fuel prices is completely rubbish. When price of crude petroleum had reached 140 dollars per barrel in the international market, the retail prices of petrol in the UPA government were between ₹60 and ₹65 per litres. Now, price of crude petroleum is 40 dollars for a barrel, then why are petrol prices being continuously increased,” he had said while talking to the media on the Republic Day at the secretariat in Jaipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/petrol-costs-rs-101-80-per-litre-in-rajasthan-s-sri-ganganagar-101611736005707.html

They demanded to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee and sat on the road, blocking gate 6 of the assembly, usually used by the MLAs.“We have been demanding (this) over the past four years. We only got assurances. The chief minister is meeting every organization and their demands. But our demand of equal pay and pension, among others, has not been met so far. We urge the CM to meet the demands ahead of the assembly polls,” said one of the para-teachers.A senior police officer said that they had no prior information about the attempted invasion and hence there were hardly any women police deployed near the gate. Later, female police constables were deployed to disperse the protestors.Senior police officers rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control. Lady police constables could be seen dragging the protesting para teachers towards the police van.

Farmer leaders blamed the government, Opposition parties, and the police alleging that they sent hooligans impersonating farmers.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said the chaos started because the administration barricaded the approved route going towards the Ghazipur roundabout.“Farmers were mostly from outside Delhi and they were not well aware of the roads in Delhi, especially NH-24, NH-9, and the Delhi-Meerut expressway, which has multiple carriageways and are very confusing. As the police had barricaded the road on which they had asked us to take our tractor rally, it confused some of the farmers and they entered the carriageways going towards Sarai Kale Khan. Other farmers followed them and that is how the confusion started,” said Tikait.Also read | Tourism minister Prahlad Patel visits Red Fort, condemns action of farmersOn Wednesday, the number of farmers at the protest site was much lesser than what it was over the last three-four days.

Now, the new government has got four constituents and the equations have changed.According to a JD-U leader, since the council vacancies were created long before the 2020 Assembly elections, it should be filled on the basis of the numerical strength in the last assembly; otherwise, it should be divided equally.A senior BJP leader, however, said that the matter would be amicably resolved soon, as it was in the interest of all. “May be, by the month-end, cabinet expansion will happen. The council nominations will also take place soon,” said a senior leader.“Everything will happen at an appropriate time. There is no confusion,” said Bihar BJP president, Dr Sanjay Jaiswal.Bihar deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad Singh was in Delhi last week, but he said he was there due to some personal matters. “Regarding the cabinet expansion and council nominations, senior leaders are looking into it.

Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar in November said Shiv Sena founder late Balasaheb Thackeray struggled his entire life for the state’s overall development and to unite Maharashtra by merging Belgaum, Karwar and Nipani with the state. “Let us be determined to fulfil this dream.”Thackeray spoke about the issue on January 17 at an event organised by Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti, which has been fighting for the inclusion of Marathi-speaking areas in Maharashtra. “Including Karnataka-occupied Marathi speaking and cultural areas in Maharashtra will be the true tribute to those who were martyred in the boundary dispute. We are united and committed towards it,” Thackeray tweeted from his official handle.An NCP leader said Bal Thackeray and other senior leaders were jailed in 1969 over the border dispute and the agitation by Shiv Sena over it shut Mumbai for over a week. “Though many believe it is an unresolvable issue, the parties see political gain in keeping the issue sentimentally alive. For the ruling parties in Maharashtra, the issue is convenient to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules Karnataka and to revive Marathi pride ahead of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-release-book-on-karnataka-maharashtra-border-dispute-101611729994295.html

He was referred to a medical college hospital in Sambalpur the same day, where his condition deteriorated.“Nanikaram said that he was not feeling well after receiving the vaccine.

She will not be travelling back to Tamil Nadu today,” Sasikala’s advocate N Raja Senthoor Pandian said.Her advocates and supporters were gathered inside and around Victoria Hospital since 7am, waiting to catch a glimpse of Sasikala who still commands a sizeable following.Sasikala, a close aide of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, was convicted by the Supreme Court in a 21-year old disproportionate assets (DA) case along with four others and handed a four-year prison sentence.The SC judgement also barred her from holding any public office or contesting elections for a period of 10 years. Jayalalithaa was also named in the DA case and was forced to step down from chief minister’s post in September 2014 after a special court delivered the guilty verdict.Sasikala, Ilvarasi and VN Sudhakaran were also found guilty and they all surrendered before the authorities on February 15, 2017.Sasikala has been lodged in a hospital ward since January 20 after she first complained of breathlessness that was later diagnosed as Covid-19.Sasikala’s release comes months before assembly elections in Tamil Nadu which is likely to see a bitter battle between the ruling AIADMK and its rival Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/after-four-years-ex-aiadmk-leader-sasikala-freed-from-jail-101611728674890.html

Deol referred to Sidhu saying “he was with me during my campaign but is now being driven by his own agenda. I have nothing to do with his activities.”Deol’s fresh comments came as a photo purportedly showing Sidhu with him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was posted on social media.Also read | Chaos in Delhi as protesting farmers stormed Red Fort: Here’s what happenedA video from Sidhu’s Facebook account went viral on Tuesday in which he could purportedly be seen along with his supporters at the Red Fort. Many of them held the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs. A man could be seen climbing the monument with the flag in his hand.Sidhu justified the flag hoisting saying when genuine rights and issues are not solved, anger is bound to flare up in any protest. He said they went to the Red Fort to “symbolically register” their protest, and to exercise their “democratic rights”.The National Investigation Agency last month issued a summon to Sidhu to appear before it in a case registered against Sikhs for Justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tractor-rally-sunny-deol-distances-himself-from-deep-sidhu-101611727534139.html

While the TMC alleged that BJP workers were behind the crime, the opposition has refuted the charges claiming that it was the result of TMC’s infighting. The victim has been identified as Sanjit Ghosh, a booth leader at Nigan in Mangalkot of East Burdwan, around 130km north of Kolkata. Also Read: Eye on polls, TMC forms separate cells for SC, ST and OBCs“BJP workers have killed him. Before he died, he told me that he was ambushed near a canal. The accused were hiding on the bank of a canal. He was attacked with lathis and bamboo sticks,” said Ashalata Ghosh, the victim’s wife. Sagar Ghosh, the victim’s father lodged a complaint on Wednesday naming a few local BJP leaders. Police refused to divulge any details but said that five persons have been detained for interrogation. “He was an anti-social person and had criminal antecedents. BJP is in no way associated with this. It was a result of the TMC’s factional fights. They are just trying to frame BJP leaders,” said Krishna Ghosh, a local leader of BJP. “Two to three day ago a BJP leader had addressed a rally in the locality and had given some inciting speeches. If BJP wants to play this dangerous game, then I want to tell them that I can be even more dangerous,” said Anubrata Mondol, TMC leader. There was palpable tension in the village and a large contingent of police was deployed after the incident to maintain law and order. “My son was murdered so that the BJP can make inroads here. He was popular in the village. The accused are all on the run now,” said the victim’s father. Meanwhile clashes were triggered between the TMC and BJP at Bhagapanpur in East Midnapore district and bombs were hurled after BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s rally took place on Tuesday.

The decision comes two days after the meeting to consider resumption of local train services for all commuters was held on Monday under Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership.Local train services in the metropolis are currently available for the essential services staff, the specially-abled and cancer patients. Women passengers and lawyers are also allowed to commute during a stipulated time period.Both the zonal railways announced on Tuesday late night, the decision to operate additional local train services.From Friday, the Central Railway will operate 1685 local train services daily as opposed to 1580 train services running currently and the Western Railway will operate 1300 local train services as opposed to 1201 train services, running currently.Earlier, Western Railway had announced the resumption of all local train services from Friday. However, the decision was rescinded later.Before the coronavirus induced lockdown was imposed, resulting in suspension of routine railway services in March last year, the Central Railway operated 1774 train services and the Western Railway operated 1367 train services.“Additional 204 local train services will be added on the Central and Western Railway from January 29. Passengers as permitted by the ministry of railways and the government of Maharashtra are only allowed to travel by the suburban trains,” said Sumit Thakur, chief public relation officer, Western Railway.Passenger associations have stated that the late night move by the railways has created confusion among the general public. “The meeting with the chief minister is a positive sign that the train services will resume for all soon.

Government hospitals such as Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Tahirpur, Lok Nayak Hospital, GB Pant, ILBS and Dr Hegdewar Arogya Sansthan, all reported a 100% turnout or more.With the number of people turning up for vaccination at each site increasing, the government is likely to take a decision on increasing the number of session sites within the 81 hospitals currently running the vaccination drive or holding the drives in other hospitals as well.Big hospitals such as Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Hospitals have planned for three or four session sites as they have over 8,000 employees across the hospitals and the medical college.“The data of vaccination rates will be looked at in the state-level meeting and a decision will be taken to open more session sites or sites at more hospitals wherever the coverage is more than 90%.

27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: Rampage at Red Fort’s ramparts||From dancing to loud music outside the monument, to storming it and attacking the policemen who attempted to evict them, scenes at the Red Fort changed dramatically within 150 minutes of farmers converging at one of the capital city’s most iconic monuments on Tuesday afternoon.In those 150 minutes, hundreds of farmers climbed the ramparts of Red Fort and hoisted several religious flags (the Nishan Sahib of Sikhs), vandalised almost anything they could lay their hands on, fought a pitched battle with the police, throwing some of them into trenches, and seeking to ram tractors into others.“The farmers were happy to reach Red Fort after camping at one place for two months. The drama you witnessed is nothing in comparison to the large number of farmers who have converged here. These are minor skirmishes,” said Ajay Pal Singh Brar, a farmer leader from Mohali who was among the crowd gathered at Red Fort, seeking to downplay the incident.Police had a different view. At least 22 police personnel have been identified to have been injured at the Red Fort clashes alone. The police haven’t been able to pin point the location in the cases of each of the 85 police personnel officially identified as injured in the clashes. But a senior police officer who didn’t want to be identified said that the count of personnel injured at Red Fort is only climbing by the hour. “It could run into several dozens,” said the officerOf course, the farmers were not supposed to be at Red Fort at all. The monument did not fall along the pre-decided routes the three rallies were to take. However, the buzz among farmers when they set off on Tuesday morning from Singhu was that they would try and reach the monument.The rally from Singhu Border arrived at Red Fort at 1.30pm, around the same time that some tractors from the Ghazipur rally also reached there. While most tractors stayed on the main road near the monument, others rolled over the trench separating the monument from the two parks right outside it.Initially, the farmers danced to loud music blaring from their tractors. Other clicked selfies in front of Red Fort, watched over by the police.But soon, some farmers walked over to the entrance gate of Red Fort in a bid to enter the monument. While a few simply scaled the iron gates, others tied ropes around the gate to open it.In a matter of minutes, hundreds stormed the monument. Some climbed a dome and hoisted the Nishan Sahib. Another did the same with a flag post that did not have a flag. Some of the protestors were also carrying national flags.The police swung into action around then. One policeman tried to climb the pole to bring down the flags, but he couldn’t make it to the top and was booed by the farmers as he slipped.But the worst was yet to come.The police decided to evict the protestors from the monument. But they faced resistance from the farmers. A pitched battle ensued. Some policemen were thrown into a trench, beaten and bloody.Then, some farmers chose to drive their tractors into the fighting policemen, injuring several. Others scrambled to escape. Around 20 policemen even jumped into a trench to save themselves.The protesters were not done, though. They repeatedly rammed a police vehicle which had already been overturned. Others went about trashing other police vehicles, the windows of offices on the premises of Red Fort.Shortly after, more armers began entering the Red Fort complex, along with horse-mounted Nihang Sikhs.It was only around 4pm.Around that time, a larger group of policemen decked in anti-riot gear returned , and had better luck in clearing the complex of farmers. They had to use a bit of force, but most of the farmers by then seemed to be ready to be persuaded. The police were assisted by some farmers who helped clear the monument of protestors.“At Lal Quila, the farmers broke the gates and entered the wells of Red Fort. A section of the crowd also managed to climb atop the ramparts of the Red Fort where they hoisted their organization’s flag. With great efforts, the Delhi Police managed to remove the crowd from the rampart and the vicinity,” said an official statement released by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-rampage-at-red-fort-s-ramparts-101611703770585.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||Security to stay tight, no plans to shut down borders, Delhi metro today||Entry into several parts of New Delhi and Central Delhi areas will be limited on Wednesday with police deciding to maintain tight security across the Capital and monitor for any more gathering of farmers with tractors, according to officials who said they were holding talks to ensure protesters retreat to sites at the borders.A senior police official, who asked not to be named, said vigil will also be tightened at the city’s borders, although there are no plans to close them or the sensitive areas in the Capital as of now.Following the violence at Central Delhi’s ITO, East Delhi and several other parts, Delhi’s borders in East Delhi as well as the DND was briefly blocked.“Depending on the situation on Wednesday, we will take a call. The protesters are retreating to the borders. If miscreants try to gather at any vital installation on Wednesday, we will take the call accordingly,” the officer said.The official added that police personnel and reinforcements from paramilitary units will continue to patrol the city, especially places in the New Delhi district. On Tuesday, 150 companies of paramilitary forces — about 20,000 personnel — was brought in from outside to secure the national Capital.Following directions from the Delhi Police, the DMRC on Tuesday closed its Green Line (Inderlok to Mundka) as tension escalated on Tikri border and later shut operations on its Grey Line (Dwarka to Najafgarh). While the services on Grey line, which was closed for commuters around 3.20pm, resumed after two hours, DMRC decided to keep all the stations closed on the Green Line for the entire day.DMRC officials said that as of Tuesday night, they have no plans to shut any metro station on Wednesday.Officials said that they shut operations or gates after police’s instructions whenever there is an apprehension of law and order problems at the metro lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/security-to-stay-tight-no-plans-to-shut-down-borders-delhi-metro-today-101611703477334.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||Violence at farmers' tractor rally: What went wrong in the police plan?||The tractor rally by farmers protesting three farm laws passed in September was to start at 11am on Tuesday. The tractors were to move along a pre-decided route near the three border points where the farmers have been protesting – Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri — spread across the north, eastern, and the western part of the Delhi and return to the border.None of that happened.Instead, on Tuesday, hundreds of farmers laid siege to Red Fort; others clashed with police in ITO and other parts of the city; and the administration had to take the unprecedented step of suspending mobile Internet services in at least four parts of the National Capital Region.By the end of the day, by the time, the farmers started returning to the border, 86 policemen and at least 10 farmers were injured, and one farmer was dead -- after the tractor he was driving overturned when he crashed into a barricade.So, what went wrong?“Nobody followed the terms of the agreement. They (the farmers) took advantage of their large numbers and stormed into the city. At Ghazipur, they started driving before the agreed-upon time and broke barricades while it was decided in the meeting that police would escort them. At Singhu, the protesters started a little before 11 and were peaceful initially. They had to turn back at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, about 15km from Singhu but refused and insisted on marching. Later they took over both carriageways,” said a senior police officer.Police officers estimate that the city was overrun by around 200,000-250,000 protesters. The police were outnumbered. They were ready with 150 companies of paramilitary forces — about 20,000 personnel – and around 30,000 from their own force.“At Ghazipur, the protesters just refused to listen and started clashing with the police right from the first hour. By 10.30am, when protesters removed police barricades and pelted stones, we had to fire tear gas shells,” a second police officer said .The second officer said that most farmers refused to listen to their leaders. “Within the farmers’ group, we were in touch with 10-12 leaders at each border. They said they could not control their people and expressed helplessness. Even among the protesters, there were multiple groups. At ITO, some of wanted to go to India Gate, some others wanted to go to Red Fort.”Senior Bharatiya Kisan Union(BKU) leader Naresh Tikait said that some young farmers among the protesters had got excited and started the march on the opposite carriageway. “They are youngsters and got carried away. But many farmers including the leaders stayed here and followed the route decided.”Dharmender Malik , spokesperson of BKU, however said that they had already asked police to allow them to march to Akshardham but it was rejected. “Many anti social elements and others from political parties also entered our rally. They were the ones who were violent,” he said.The officer added after groups split and chose to go in different directions, an alert was also sent to all police stations to increase security outside the residences of President, Prime Minister, home minister and L-G. The officer said around 2,000 farmer volunteers who had signed up to help police ensure the protest passed peacefully did not respond to calls for assistance.The Delhi police on Tuesday released a statement that farmers did not adhere to the terms on which they were allowed to hold the rally. “They vandalized property and attacked police personnel. At many places, some protesters used their tractors to run over the police. We used minimum force. Not a single shot was fired by police. We still appeal to the protesters to maintain peace and return to where they were protesting,” a Delhi police spokesperson said.Senior officer, Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of Delhi police told a news agency that police would take action against those who assaulted police personnel and damaged property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/violence-at-farmers-tractor-rally-what-went-wrong-in-the-police-plan-101611703308541.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||AAP, BJP, Congress train guns at each other for protest violence||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been supporting the agitation against the farm laws, condemned the violence during the tractor parade on Tuesday, saying it has “weakened” the protests.Thousands of protesters who had been camping on Delhi’s borders with Hayana and Uttar Pradesh, stormed into the city, riding tractors, breaking through barriers and clashing with the police.Even as the AAP blamed the Centre for “allowing” Delhi’s law and order situation to deteriorate from “bad to worse”, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the AAP and the Congress of allegedly sending members of their Punjab cadre to join the rally.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal did not comment on the matter on Tuesday.The AAP in a statement said, “We strongly condemn the violence seen in today [Tuesday]’s protest. It is regrettable that the Central government allowed the situation to deteriorate to such an extent. The movement has been peaceful for the last two months.”“Farmer leaders have said those who indulged in violence today were not part of the movement and were external elements. Whoever they were, the violence has certainly weakened the movement which was going on peacefully and in a disciplined manner,” the AAP said.Delhi BJP President Adesh Gupta said the “kisan Andolan” is no longer under the control of the farmer’s bodies.“In fact, all along, the farmers protests have been supplemented by elements from the Congress and the AAP cadres from Punjab,” he said.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary also condemned the violence and said that the BJP-led government at the centre was “instigating the farmers”. “On Republic Day, farmers were lathi charged and tear gas shells were lobbed at them. The BJP government wanted the farmers to be forced to resort to violence, so that they could be portrayed as unruly,” alleged Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-bjp-congress-train-guns-at-each-other-for-protest-violence-101611703019768.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||Police, farmers fought pitched battle at Nangloi||Nangloi chowk in west Delhi turned into a site of violent clashes between the Delhi police and a group of farmers from Tikri border participating in the tractor parade organised as part of an ongoing agitation against three farm laws passed by the Centre in September 2020.At around 11.45am, the police resorted to lathi charge and fired tear gas after a group of protesters broke barricades to move towards Peeragarhi flyover even though that was not part of the route decided between farmers’ groups and the police earlier in the week.As per the agreement reached on January 24, protestors from Tikri border were required to turn off at Nangloi towards Najafgarh and ride down Baprola village towards the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal Expressway. However, a section of farmers insisted on riding towards Red Fort.The agitators tied the barricades to their tractors using ropes and began to move them. Many removed stones set up as blocks with their bare hands to make way for tractors. The protesters vandalised a temporary police post and smashed a police van parked under the flyover.Several DTC buses that had been set up as barricades were also smashed.“When farmers protesting at different borders also reached the Red Fort why is the police not allowing us to take out the march towards it?” said Sukhbeer Singh, a protester from Haryana’s Bhiwani , who managed to cross the barricades and reach Madipur Metro station. By 2pm, the entry and exit to all the Metro stations on the Green Line were closed.Sporadic clashes continued between till late in the evening, even as the vast majority of the protestors continued their parade without incidence, many of them even returning to their camping site at Tikri Kalan. The tear gas shelling continued intermittently for four hours.“Despite repeated requests, farmers did not listen to the police and vandalised the barricades and public property to move ahead on a route that was against our agreement . The police had to resort to tear gas shelling and lathi charge only after farmers turned violent. They also pelted stones and bricks on police officials,” police official deployed at the site said. A little after 4pm, the police intensified the tear gas shelling.Protesters in turn alleged that it was the police action that forced them to break the barricades. “The farmers have been sitting at the borders and no one is listening to our demands. Today, when the police resorted to lathi charge and fired tear gas at them, they turned violent,” said Balbir Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Sangrur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-farmers-fought-pitched-battle-at-nangloi-101611701392192.html
27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers voice disappointment, anger in Punjab and Haryana||Anger and disappointment coursed through the hinterlands of Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday as farmers criticised the violence unleashed by their counterparts in the Capital, saying the clashes tarnished the peaceful image of the two-month-old protests and hurt the stir aimed at the repeal of three farm laws.Even farmers, who were earlier excited about the tractor rally and spent the day glued to their phones and television sets, said the violence on the streets of Delhi and outside the Red Fort weakened the movement.Harminder Singh, a 45-year- old farmer of Jalaldiwal village in Ludhiana, said the clashes will have far-reaching repercussions for the agitation that was hailed for the peaceful manner in which it was held.“These youngsters may be rejoicing after entering Red Fort but they have actually failed this agitation…It has dented the image of farmer protest,” said the man who owns 12 acres of land.Satnam Singh, a 43-year-old farmer of Bhoian village in Amritsar, said the tractor march should have been carried out as planned and that the violent scenes will damage the agitation backed by hundreds of thousands of farmers. “... There is no room for any kind of violence. Peace and unity are the most powerful weapons to win any battle,” said the farmer.These feelings were echoed by cultivators in Haryana.Balbir Singh, an elderly farmer from Kurukshetra, said ensuring peace was the responsibility of union leaders.”The government was testing their patience and they have failed badly,” he added.Ratan Mann , state president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Mann) condemned the incident. “Such people cannot be farmers and the government should investigate to find out forces behind this shameful act.”Some people said they initially wanted to join the rally but desisted after seeing scenes of violence play out on the roads. “We decided to return from Delhi soon after we came to know that some farmer leaders were planning to reach the Red Fort,” said Sandeep Kumar, a farmer from Gharaunda in Haryana’s Karnal district.Particularly harsh criticism was directed at the decision by some farmers to storm the Red Fort, where a protestor climbed an empty flag post and hoisted the Nishhan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, next to the Tricolour.Gurmeet Dhaliwal of Bathinda said the incident at the Red Fort was highly unfortunate and Malak Singh, a Karnal-based farmer, said nothing could replace the Indian national flag.Following the violence in Delhi, authorities in Punjab and Haryana sounded a high alert and said anyone taking law into one’s hands will be dealt with strictly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-voice-disappointment-anger-in-punjab-and-haryana-101611700580395.html

27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: Tractors as weapons in the fiercest of face-offs||25-year-old farmer died on Tuesday and several farmers and policemen were injured following violent clashes between hundreds of protesting farmers and police in central Delhi’s ITO area during the tractor parade taken out by farm groups protesting three farm laws. The incident took place after a tractor overturned after being driven at high speed into a barricade near Andhra Education Society at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg crushing Navreet Singh, a farmer from Bilaspur in Uttar Pradesh.While protesters alleged that the deceased lost control of the tractor after a tear gas shell hit him, police said the incident happened when the driver hit the barricade.DCP (central) Jasmeet Singh said in the CCTV footages and videos of the incident it is apparent that the tractor toppled after hitting a barrier which led to the death of a man.A senior officer said police are in process of registering a case to probe the death. “In this case either inquest proceedings will be done or a case of accident will be registered,” the officer said requesting anonymity.The scenes of farmers charging at police with their tractors were caught on camera.Mintu Bajwa, a friend of the deceased, claimed Singh was disoriented after being hit by a tear gas shell.The first standoff in central Delhi began around noon when the tractor parade from Ghazipur border took a left turn from Vikas Minar and reached ITO. Protesters damaged police buses and barricades set up to restrict their movement. Farmers blocked both Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg leading to Red Fort and Indraprastha Marg leading to Vikas Marg .They were not supposed to be at ITO according to an agreement hammered out between farm union leaders and the police.ITO was a war zone for a few hours, with police trying, in vain, to disperse the farmers using tear gas. At around 1pm, a baton charge seemed to give the police the upper hand till the protestors ran amok with their tractors. Road dividers were also dismantled and used as weapons.The sudden attack by farmers took the police by surprise and they retreated.By 1.30pm, protesters managed to break through the barricades and drove towards Red Fort through Delhi Gate-Daryaganj route to land at the monument, where farmers from Singhu had already arrived.Bindar Singh, 25, a farmer from Punjab’s Patiala was among those injured at ITO. Pointing towards an injury near his right eye, he said, “It happened when police lobbed tear gas shells at us while we were marching towards Red Fort. They said we changed routes. But when all citizens can go to the historical monument, why are we the only ones being stopped?”Till Tuesday evening, hundreds of farmers were still camped at the ITO intersection. Around 5.30pm, Bajwa and others approached the police and asked for an ambulance so that they could remove Singh’s body -- this was immediately arranged.By 6.15pm, most protestors had dispersed though some still lingered, and the police took charge. Movement of vehicles was soon restored on the arterial Vikas Marg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-tractors-as-weapons-in-the-fiercest-of-faceoffs-101611695601193.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: As most went off track, some groups stuck to agreed plan||While large groups of farmers deviated from the routes for which they had permission to carry out their protest, several farmer groups — under the banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) — carried out the tractor parade on permissible routes and later in the evening, called off the tractor parade and sent out an appeal to farmers to return to the protest sites to continue with their peaceful agitation.SKM, an umbrella collective of over 40 farmer groups, called off the tractor parade on Tuesday evening. “Samyukt Kisan Morcha has called off the Kisan Republic Day Parade with immediate effect, and has appealed to all participants to immediately return to their protest sites,” the group said in a statement adding that the protest will continue peacefully.Baldev Singh, a member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said they marched on the agreed upon route because they wanted the protests to remain peaceful. “Hundreds of farmers were marching with us on the decided route because we wanted to keep our word and let the protests remain peaceful. We learnt only after some time that protesters had taken other routes. We were walking and tried our best to ensure there was no violence but there were some miscreants who did not listen,” he said.“We thank farmers for the unprecedented participation in today’s Farmers Republic Day Parade. We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts,” they said in a statement in the evening.“Despite all our efforts, some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts. Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength and any violation will hurt the movement,” it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-as-most-went-off-track-some-groups-stuck-to-agreed-plan-101611695088602.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: Within hours, cheers, celebration at Tikri gave way to chaos||The farmers were supposed to leave at 12 noon in their tractors from Tikri border, turn off at Nangloi towards Najafgarh and proceed further to the Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway, finally returning to the site where they have been camping for more than two months. Instead, they left at 8.30 am and within three hours, many of them had broken police barricades to travel on another route. By evening, many tractors had broken away from the convoy to proceed towards Red Fort, where other farmers had also congregated.In the Tikri tractor parade, the atmosphere was convivial: gleaming tractors adorned with tricolour flags blared Punjabi and Haryanvi songs, as thousands of farmers — most of them men — waved at the residents who had gathered on rooftops and balconies to watch what promised to be a spectacle unlike anything else.Even though it was meant to be a tractor parade, many rode bikes, drove jeeps, and walked along, holding the Indian flag as well as those of farmers organisations. Residents of many neighbourhoods showered flower petals over them. Many distributed packets of water along the way; large vessels bearing rice and dal awaited the hungry protesters. At Mundka, a group of local residents organised a dance set to the beat of dhols for their entertainment. Posters with the message, “We support farmers” were spotted at different locations.When the farmers reached Nangloi at 11 am, the cheer and celebration turned into clashes within 45 minutes, as some farmer groups breached their route agreement and tried to move on roads they did not have permission for. The protestors removed the police barricades — including the concrete ones — and made their way towards Peeragarhi at around 11.50am. The police responded by using tear gas to disperse the crowd, and some even used their cane sticks on protestors. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation closed down stations that lay along this route, and later shut down the entire Green Line that ends at Tikri Kalan.By 5pm, several tractors had made their way towards Red Fort, even as a majority of them had turned back towards their Tikri campsite. “We had requested the police to peacefully allow us to take out the march till the Red Fort. They denied and started firing tear gas shells. Farmers got provoked and removed the barricades,” said Amandeep Singh, a farmer from Rohtak.Among the protesters was 70-year-old Roshini Kaur who rode on a tractor driven by her daughter-in-law Harpreet Kaur (28). A resident of Haryana’s Jind district, Kaur said that she has been staying at the Tikri border for the last one month. “We are poor farmers and we will lose everything if we won’t fight against these three farm laws now. We are already indebted. We are not left with much to lose now,” she said.Farm union leaders at Tikri border maintained that those who indulged in violence and vandalism were not part of any union or organisation. “Majority of the protesters took the approved route and peacefully took out the parade. We reached back at our protest site by 7.15 pm. Those who created ruckus were not the members of any farm organisation,” said Baldev Singh, district president of BKU (Dkunda) in Bhatinda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-within-hours-cheers-celebration-at-tikri-gave-way-to-chaos-101611694335835.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: March to ITO began at Ghazipur||In Ghazipur, the friction started to build up around 8.30am when the farmers decided to start the march, defying an agreement with the police that they would do so only after 11am to avoid any possible disruption of the Republic Day parade in the morning.By 9.30am, a group of farmers started the march; they also used trolleys attached to the tractors, despite agreeing not to use them in their previous discussions with the police.Each tractor seated around four; each trolley, around 10. They were decorated with Indian flags and sported loudspeakers blaring songs.Around 9.40am, the groups broke the first set of police barricades set up near the Ghazipur border and started marching towards the city.Between then and 12 noon, farmer groups and police officials clashed at multiple points that include the toll tax collection centre in the Delhi-Meerut expressway, near Akshardham temple, at Sarai Kale Khan, below the ITO flyover, and later at the ITO intersection from where large number of protesters headed towards the Red Fort in North Delhi.The Delhi Police in a statement said that they had made necessary arrangement and deployment of security personnel for the tractor rally as per the agreement they had with the farmers.“Delhi Police personnel showed resistance till the end but the protesting farmers breached the agreement and began their tractor rally much before the scheduled time. Since farmers resorted to violence and vandalism, the police had to take necessary steps to maintain the law and order. The agitation led to damage of public property and many police personnel were also injured. The protesters were asked to stop violence, maintain peace and return,” the police said.A separate group of farmers from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand marched towards the Ghazipur roundabout, by taking a stretch of NH 24, headed towards Apsara border, covered Loni and parts of Ghaziabad and then headed back to Ghazipur, largely without incident.The farmers were carrying supplies, utensils, and also chains, hooks and ropes to dismantle barricades.The number of people or vehicles which started from Ghazipur is yet to be ascertained by the policeThe police had to resort to a baton charge and fired tear gas at multiple points. The farmers broke down not only barricades but also attacked police vehicles and public buses.One farmer died and 10 others were injured while 86 police personnel were hurt in the clashes and violence reported from various locations.As farmer groups from Ghazipur marched towards the heart of the city, throwing traffic out of gear in large parts of east Delhi, south-east Delhi, and central Delhi. Many motorists fled on foot leaving their vehicles behind in order to avoid conflict with the marching groups.The last minute change of plans — initially regarding timings of the protest march and later regarding the routes to be taken — also exposed differences between protesting farmers and leaders of farm groups who had hammered out an agreement with Delhi police on the timing and routes.Bharatiya Kisan Union president Naresh Tikait sought to play down the issue: “It looks like some protesters got carried away. On our part, we are doing our beat to ensure that protesters adhere to the terms and conditions of the police.”However, several participants in the march said they had never agreed to the conditions of the police. “We never agreed to the conditions given by the police. What’s the point of the march if we cannot take it to Ring Road and go into the city?” said Manjeet Singh, a farmer from UP.Several police officials and farmers were injured in East Delhi’s Ghazipur area on Tuesday after farm groups participating in a tractor march to protest three farm laws, broke barricades, clashed with police, and deviated from an agreed-upon route for the rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-march-to-ito-began-at-ghazipur-101611693829415.html
27-01-2021||Delhi||From farm to fist: Violence started at Singhu, one barrier at a time||When the tractor rally left the Singhu Border around 7.30 am on Tuesday, the farmers were breaking the terms of their understanding with the police, that the march wouldn’t begin until 12 noon.Over the next three hours, they stuck to the route they had agreed on with the police, although each tractor was packed with more people than was allowed. But once one tractor dared to remove a heavy concrete barricade, others followed suit. All terms and conditions were forgotten in a display of brute force through the 30 km route to Red Fort instead of the 63 km one they were supposed to take . They used their tractors, cranes, even bare hands to deal with barricades. When the tear gas bothered them, they simply snatched tear gas guns from policemen.Singhu Border has been the most prominent protest site for the farmers at Delhi’s border for the last two months. It has received the most media attention and according to farm union leaders also seen the largest gathering of farmers. According to the farmers’ agreement with the police, they were to take a right turn towards Shahbad Dairy from the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, almost 13km from Singhu Border on the GT Karnal Road.The farmers marched out from Singhu around 7.30 am. Tractors stayed in a single queue on one carriageway, but both the sides of the road were occupied by thousands of farmers marching on foot. “There are just so many farmers that tractors have fallen short,” said Satnam Singh, a farmer from Tarn Taran driving one of the tractors.Police vehicles followed the tractors even as farmer volunteers ensured that tractors breaking the queue were disciplined. Tractors barely ever crossed a speed of 15 km/hr.But when they arrived at the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar from where they were to get off the GT Karnal Road and take a right turn as agreed, the farmers kept marching.Police had set multiple levels of barricades at this point and put up signboards showing directions to the planned route.When farmers said they wanted to march onto the Outer Ring Road, the police made announcements on loudspeakers to persuade them otherwise. “Dilli Police, dil ki police, dil se vinati karti hai ki... (The Delhi Police, the police of hearts, requests with all our heart to...),” an announcement said.AK Singla, additional commissioner of traffic police even walked to the farmers who were sitting on the road in large groups, but it didn’t yield results.But by this time, farmers in one tractor had tied chains to a heavy concrete barricade and pulled it away. The police fired a tear gas shell but it had little impact. Another farmer commandeered a large crane from somewhere and used it to rapidly remove more barricades.The farmers who had come prepared with heavy chains and ropes had no problem taking control of police vehicles, including water cannons.The police fired more tear gas shells. The farmers responded with stones. A Nihang Sikh riding a horse pulled out his sword and waved it at some policemen. Some farmers snatched the tear gas guns from the policemen.Others chose to smash police vehicles and a fleet of buses parked along the route.By 11.10 am, the farmers had breached all the barricades and set out towards the Ring Road.Over the next two hours, they faced some more barricades hurdles near the Burari ground and in Majnu ka Tilla , but they made short work of these.By 1.30pm, they arrived at Red Fort, their destination all along.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-farm-to-fist-violence-started-at-singhu-one-barrier-at-a-time-101611692151812.html

But the 48-year-old Ludhiana resident says 2020 was the worst year for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) like his unit, and that the ripple effect of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for many years to come.At Kular International, workers manufacture bicycle rims and mudguards in a factory located in Phase 8 of Focal Point, the city’s industrial sector. His troubles began shortly after the nationwide lockdown in March last year, when demand plunged and labourers started to flee. “In pre- Covid times, I worked with a full strength of 240 workers on any given day. As many as 140 of these left and still not returned. I am managing work with only 100 workers,” he said.Restrictions on transport, and pile up of trucks at interstate borders – despite repeated interventions by the Centre – further hampered his business. “In Punjab, the market is 7 percent while 93 percent of the consumption is in rest of the country. With shortage of raw material, we are still not able to fully meet the demand,” he added.In August, Kular contracted Covid. “I was fortunate to have come out of it and thankfully did not have many side effects,” he said.Then, in September, protests against three farm laws broke out across Punjab. Agitating farmers blocked roads and railway tracks, and goods trains did not run for around two months. “I could not honour export commitments. I lost the trust of my clients. There were shipments that remained stuck at dry ports for days altogether. This never happened before; the times we saw in 2020 were unprecedented.”At Kular International now, the usual hustle and bustle is missing as many workers have still not returned. Ask him if business has picked and he says both yes and no. “The market has grown but for MSMEs viability is not there, especially with prices of steel rising 40 to 50 percent since August. This sudden spike has made it impossible to meet confirmed orders and exports are in serious danger. The future looks grim.”India has 63.4 million MSMEs that accounts for 45% of manufacturing output, 40% of exports and employs about 120 million people. The central government earmarked ₹7,572.20 crores for MSMEs in the 2020-21 budget. In May, the government announced a slew of measures, including collateral-free loans worth ₹3 lakh crore for the sector. But Kular says that’s not enough. “There is a never-ending struggle and last year got worse with both the state and central government not taking any concrete steps for smooth revival,” he said.In the budget, Kular said the Credit Link Cash Subsidy Scheme, under which industrialists got a capital subsidy of ₹15 lakh for purchasing new machinery, needs to be restarted. He also wanted a technology upgrading fund for the sector and hoped that income tax rates on MSMEs will be reduced.“Rationalisation of steel prices is a must…. MSMEs are on the verge of closure. The government is requested that unless the availability of steel is sufficient, export should be banned.” He added that diesel and other petroleum products should be brought under the Good and Services Tax regime at the earliest, so that the industry can benefit from input tax credit on petroleum products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/budget/centre-should-simplify-taxes-support-msmes-fico-prez-101611690046677.html

27-01-2021||Pune||Here’s how sex and gender are different things||A 15-year-old girl from Satara district of Maharashtra approached a doctor in Pune because she hadn’t started her period yet. Tests revealed that the girl has a condition called Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), that affects only four in 100,000 people.In AIS, androgen, a hormone found in greater quantities in males, is suppressed and the secondary sex characteristics may or may not resemble that of a male’s.In the case of the young girl, she was unable to menstruate because she does not have ovaries.A team of doctors from the hospital is now helping the young girl to continue to live her life in her chosen gender. The condition disallows her from becoming pregnant, though she may still have children through other procedures like surrogacy or adoption if she so chooses.Dr Manish Machave, gynaecologist and endoscopic surgeon from Ruby Hall Clinic, who diagnosed and treated her said that the girl had her gonads (testes) removed through laparoscopy and also had a breast augmentation surgery. She will receive hormone injections that will help sustain her through the rest of her teenage years and early adulthood.“She had gonads (testes) positioned in the abdomen and another in the inguinal canal and because of the position of gonads, she had a risk of developing a form of cancer called gonadoblastoma. Hence, we first performed laparoscopic gonadectomy and removed testes from both the sides, around three months ago. Once she turns 18-year-old, we will perform laparoscopic vaginoplasty,” Machave said.Dr Anupama Mane, breast surgeon from Ruby Hall Clinic, who performed the girl’s breast augmentation surgery said, “She was brought up as a girl and hence she wanted to remain so. We performed breast augmentation surgery for her. Hormonal injections will be required for things like hair growth to stop. We are assisting her to complete her transition as a female. The medical treatment to give her feminine characteristics will go on for years.”Activists say that AIS is often used as a means to stigmatise intersex people by bringing their bodies under intense scrutiny, and which the medical fraternity then attempts to correct through surgery. Activists argue that intersex persons like the 15-year-old girl are subjected to a misplaced understanding of what bodies of men and women should look like.However, as gender and sexuality rights activists point out, all bodies are different and neither gender nor sexuality is derived from a person’s biological sex. As the case of this teenager shows, gender does not lie in the body but in the mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/15yrold-female-finds-she-is-a-male-undergoes-medical-treatment-in-pune-to-remain-woman-101611587234662.html
27-01-2021||World||US leaders dial Indian counterparts; talk cooperation in defence, Indo-Pacific||The new US administration began its formal contact with India’s top leadership on Wednesday, with secretary of defence Lloyd Austin and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan reaching out to their counterparts Rajnath Singh and Ajit Doval to discuss defence cooperation and stability in the Indo-Pacific.In an introductory telephone call from Austin to Singh, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to work together to strengthen bilateral defence cooperation and the strategic partnership. They also discussed bilateral, regional and global issues, according to a readout from the defence ministry.The Pentagon said Austin emphasised the defence department’s commitment to the US-India Major Defence Partnership, which is built on “shared values and common interest in ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains free and open”. Austin also noted the “great strides” in bilateral defence ties and pledged to work collaboratively with Singh.India and the US highlighted the need to collectively address challenges in the post-Covid-19 era and also agreed to work closely on key issues such as counter-terrorism and stability in the Indo-Pacific during the conversation between Doval and Sullivan, the external affairs ministry said.There was no official word from the US on the conversation between the NSAs.The telephone calls marked the first formal contact between the new US administration headed by President Joe Biden and India’s top leadership. Biden is also expected to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of his ongoing outreach to world leaders.Singh had earlier congratulated Austin, the first African-American secretary of defence, on his appointment. Modi spoke to Biden in November after his election victory and discussed shared priorities and concerns, including the pandemic, climate change and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.In his conversation with Sullivan, Doval said that as “leading democracies with an abiding faith in an open and inclusive world order, India and the US were uniquely positioned to work closely on regional and international issues”, including combating terrorism, maritime security, cyber-security and peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond, the external affairs ministry said.Sullivan said the US is looking forward to working together on the bilateral agenda and common global challenges.The two NSAs agreed to work closely to advance India-US relations, “which are built on shared values and common strategic and security interests”, the external affairs ministry said. They also “highlighted the need to work collectively to address challenges in the post-Covid era and further expand the comprehensive global strategic partnership” between the two sides.Addressing the annual conference of the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, on Wednesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the US is coming to terms with the rebalancing of global power distribution, which has accelerated over the past decade.The US, as a pre-eminent power, will have to grapple with the challenges of the world, and this will require “smart applications of power and influence abroad as well as strong partnerships,” he said. “It is also necessary that solutions to current conflicts are arrived at through broader consultations,” he added.Referring to changes around the world, Jaishankar said: “Nowhere have the changes been sharper than in Asia, so presumably it would be reflected now in policy formulation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-leaders-dial-indian-counterparts-seek-cooperation-in-defence-indopacific-101611769571332.html
27-01-2021||World||Deforestation soars in Amazon forest in 2020, analysis finds||An area the size of Israel was deforested in the Amazon biome last year as destruction surged 21% in the region spanning nine countries that is home to the world's largest rainforest, according to the Amazon Conservation organization.A first look at deforestation in the full year of 2020 shows that roughly 21,000 square kilometers (8,108 square miles) of old-growth forest was cut or burned down, about the size of New Jersey, the US-based non-profit group found in its analysis of satellite data."These numbers are just mind-blowing," said Matt Finer, who leads the NGO's Amazon monitoring project.The Amazon biome is overwhelmingly dominated by rainforest but includes other ecosystems that share a similar set of plants and animals. Many parts of the Amazon experienced drier weather last year and were therefore more susceptible to fire.Bolivia accounted for the biggest increase in destruction compared to 2019 as enormous fires tore through its Chiquitano dry forests, Finer said. Many Bolivians use slash-and-burn tactics to clear land for cattle or soy, and the fires can get out of control and escape into the forest in dry conditions.Bolivia announced a state of emergency in October, saying that 600 families had been affected by the fires.After Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador saw smaller increases in deforestation.Brazil had the most deforestation, accounting for 61% of the hotspots in the Amazon overall, although 2020 forest destruction was similar to 2019, Finer said."I think 2019 is regarded as a really bad year for the Brazilian Amazon. 2020 got less press and attention but it was just as bad, if not worse," he said.The 2020 data is based on a preliminary analysis of deforestation alerts generated by the University of Maryland, with final figures to be confirmed later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deforestation-soars-in-amazon-forest-in-2020-analysis-finds-101611767135915.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden’s UN nominee urged to counter China, defend 2019 speech||President Joe Biden’s nominee for United Nations ambassador was pressed to counter China’s influence at the organization as well as defend a speech she gave in 2019 about Beijing’s strategy in Africa.Linda Thomas-Greenfield, speaking at her confirmation hearing Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pledged to restore American leadership at the UN and said China is trying to drive “an authoritarian agenda that stands in opposition to the founding values of the institution -- American values.”“When America shows up, when we are consistent and persistent, when we exert our influence in accordance with our values, the United Nations can be an indispensable institution for advancing peace, security, and our collective well-being,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “If instead we walk away from the table, and allow others to fill the void, the global community suffers -- and so do American interests.”Under the Trump administration, the US repeatedly clashed with the UN and its organizations, withdrawing from the Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. Critics argued that walking away allowed China to expand its influence, undermine human rights positions and sponsor resolutions that reflect its worldview.Signaling a concern of Republicans on the panel, Chairman James Risch of Idaho called on Thomas-Greenfield to explain a 2019 speech to a China-funded institute in Georgia at which he said she was too positive about Beijing’s role in Africa.“I can tell you that there isn’t a person sitting in this room who hasn’t given a speech that they don’t wish they had back” Risch said. “I personally am not going to hold one speech against somebody, but you are going to have to speak to that.”Thomas-Greenfield said she regretted giving the speech at a China-backed “Confucius Institute” at Savannah State University and vowed to push back on Beijing’s “parasitic” influence in Africa.“I truly regret having accepted that invitation and having had my name associated with the Confucius Institutes,” Thomas-Greenfield said, adding she accepted the invitation to speak at the historically-black university in order to help promote a career in foreign service to minority students.The issue comes after former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo ramped up pressure on U.S. universities to shut down the Confucius Institutes, saying they were a malign influence on higher learning, and ordering them to register as “foreign missions,” like embassies and consulates.Savannah State has since terminated its relationship with the institute, Democratic Senator Ben Cardin said. And Risch suggested that despite the controversy, he expected Thomas-Greenfield, 67, to be confirmed.As UN ambassador, Thomas-Greenfield will be leaning on her experience across four continents, including State Department assignments in Jamaica, Nigeria, Switzerland and Pakistan, as well as in Washington as assistant secretary of state for African affairs.Thomas-Greenfield, who would be one of the highest-ranking Black officials in Biden’s administration, plans to emphasize “old-fashioned, people-to-people diplomacy” while calling for making the UN more accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-un-nominee-urged-to-counter-china-defend-2019-speech-101611764005322.html

27-01-2021||World||Pakistan unveils plan to administer Covid-19 vaccine across country||Pakistan's top official body to deal with the coronavirus crisis on Wednesday announced a comprehensive plan to administer the COVID-19 vaccine across the country to curb the pandemic.The National Command and Control Centre (NCOC) has decided that the vaccine would be given through the National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) which will be operated by the National Vaccine Administration and Coordination Cell (NVACC), said officials.The plan was unveiled at a meeting of the top body in Islamabad chaired by Minister for Planning Asad Umar.The meeting was informed that the NIMS is fully digital and appointments for vaccinations to the masses would be done automatically. The masses will send an SMS to 1166 or visit the NIMS website for registration, which will generate a PIN code and send it to the applicant with the address of a vaccination centre closer to home.Special Assistant on National Health Services Dr Faisal Sultan said that the government will provide vaccines free of cost to the general public.He said that in the first phase, frontline health workers will be vaccinated, while in the second phase, senior citizens will be administered with the anti-pandemic medicine. So far 400,000 health workers have been registered for vaccination, according to Sultan.Pakistan has authorised the emergency use of three vaccines against coronavirus, including Russia's Sputnik V and Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm’s Covid-19.Meanwhile, the NCOC also decided to stick to an earlier decision to reopen primary and elementary schools as well as universities from February 1.Earlier, the secondary and higher secondary schools and colleges were reopened on January 18.The developments came as the 1,563 new patients were detected in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 537,477, according to the ministry of National Health Services.Another 74 people died in the last 24 hours, taking the Covid-19 toll to 11,450.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unveils-plan-to-administer-covid-19-vaccine-across-country-101611760170305.html

The embassy expressed “horror and anger” at the vandalism “on such a symbolic day.”Paris police said the graffiti was discovered Wednesday morning, as ceremonies were being held or planned around the world to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which is observed on the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp on Jan. 27, 1945.The graffiti was quickly cleaned off.While France sees persistent but scattered anti-Semitic vandalism or violence, the graffiti found Wednesday was not explicitly anti-Jewish. It included the message “Uighur Lives Matter” and appeared aimed at calling attention to China's treatment of mostly Muslim Uighurs.The Chinese government has detained an estimated 1 million or more members of ethnic Turkic minority groups in Xinjiang, holding them in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused. China has long suspected the Uighurs of harboring separatist tendencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-holocaust-memorial-vandalized-on-remembrance-day-101611765450726.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden admin scraps Trump-era rule ending work permit for some H-1B spouses||The Joe Biden administration has withdrawn a Trump-era rule rescinding work authorisation for spouses of some H-1B visa holders, a large number of whom are from India.The reversal comes as a huge relief for a community that had lived with mounting uncertainty as former President Donald Trump’s administration had sought to take away work their work authorisation purportedly as part of a larger effort to protect American jobs for Americans.“Withdrawn,” said a government regulatory posting from the Office of Management and Budget on Monday, for the order, “Employment Authorization for Certain Classes of Aliens With Final Orders of Removal.”Certain H-4 visa holders, spouses of H-1B visa holders with approved applications for green cards, were granted authorisation to work by president Barack Obama in 2015, primarily to help families cope with prolonged waiting time for applicants from India (because of an annual country-cap on green cards). It’s called H-4 Employment Authorization Document (H-4EAD). “Nearly 90% of H-4 workers are highly paid women from India with college degrees,” Cato Institute, a US think tank, said in a 2020 report.“It’s significant—though not unexpected—that the Biden administration wants to continue the Obama-era policy of allowing spouses of H-1B workers to apply for work permits,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration policy in the Obama White House and is now the co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship. “The 2015 Obama-era regulation, which the Trump administration opposed but failed to rescind, applies to H-4 visa holders who are spouses (not children) of H-1B visa holders with an approved green card petition.”Trump had wanted to rescind the order as part of his larger plan to reform the legal immigration system to ensure Americans had the first shot at American jobs and not foreigners, under his overarching “Buy American, Hire American” policy. His administration had joint a lawsuit challenging the Obama-era rule and later issued a rule rescinding it. The former president and other immigration hawks in his administration targeted the H-1B visa programme, for instance, alleging that it had been used by American companies to outsource American jobs to foreigners on lower wages. Indians have been the largest recipients of H-1B visas, accounting for more than 70% of the annual 85,000. And the former administration had rescinded work authorisation for H-4 visa holders, arguing they were taking away American jobs from Americans, despite bipartisan pushback from US Congress.“We commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administration’s disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to t United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.usa, a group founded by Facebook to “help fix our country’s harmful immigration system”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-scraps-trump-era-rule-ending-work-permit-for-some-h-1b-spouses-101611766678070.html

Analysts expect them to rise in a Reuters poll ahead of official inventory figures due at 1530 GMT.Brent crude slipped 37 cents or 0.7% to $55.54 a barrel by 1447 GMT, giving up an earlier gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 31 cents to $52.30."Demand concerns should remain with us for some time," Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank said.Brent on Jan. 13 hit an 11-month high of $57.42, having recovered from a 21-year low below $16 in April due to a demand recovery particularly in China and huge supply cuts by OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+."Oil continues consolidating," said Jeffrey Halley of brokerage OANDA. "The Saudi Arabian cuts, OPEC+ compliance above 85% and an insatiable demand from Asia means that oil has seen its cyclical lows for 2021."As well as the inventory report, in focus later on Wednesday will be the results of the U.S. Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Analysts expect the Fed to stick to its dovish tone to help speed the economic recovery.Still, the number of global coronavirus cases has surpassed 100 million as infections rise in Europe and the Americas, and Asia scrambles to contain fresh outbreaks.China, the second-largest oil consumer, has recently seen a coronavirus resurgence, but official Chinese data showed 75 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, the lowest daily rise since Jan. 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-slips-as-covid-19-demand-concerns-weigh-ahead-of-supply-report-101611760219074.html
27-01-2021||World||Man to plead guilty in plot to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer||One of six men charged in an alleged plot to snatch Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has agreed to plead guilty to a kidnapping conspiracy, according to a court document filed Wednesday.The filing was made by prosecutors ahead of Ty Garbin's appearance in federal court in Grand Rapids. The plea agreement signed by Garbin indicates that he will “fully cooperate” with investigators. There is no agreement on his sentencing guidelines.The FBI in October said it broke up a plot to kidnap the Democratic governor by anti-government extremists upset over her coronavirus restrictions. Six people were charged in federal court while eight others were charged in state court with aiding the alleged scheme.In the plea agreement, Garbin admitted to more than five pages of stunning allegations. He said he and others trained with weapons in Munith, Michigan, and Cambria, Wisconsin, last summer and “discussed the plan to storm the Capitol and kidnap the governor.”The plot, he said, switched to a summer home on Mackinac Island reserved for Michigan governors or Whitmer's second home in Antrim County.Garbin said he “advocated waiting until after the national election, when the conspirators expected widespread civil unrest to make it easier for them to operate.”In September, the six men trained at Garbin's property near Luther, Michigan, constructing a “shoot house” to resemble Whitmer's vacation home and “assaulting it with firearms.”Last fall, defense attorney Mark Satawa said Garbin had no intention to carry out a kidnapping, no matter what he might have said in recorded or online conversations. A “big talk” defense had emerged as a strategy.“Saying things like, ‘I hate the governor, the governor is tyrannical’ ... is not illegal, even if you’re holding a gun and running around the woods when you do it,” Satawa said in October.Garbin’s guilty plea would be a swift resolution for prosecutors, only about four months after the arrests.The other defendants are Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. A trial has been scheduled for March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-to-plead-guilty-in-plot-to-kidnap-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer-101611761249514.html
27-01-2021||World||UK plant producing Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine evacuated after receiving suspicious package||A British pharmaceutical manufacturing company producing coronavirus vaccines had to partially evacuate its factory Wednesday after receiving a “suspicious package.”The UK arm of Mumbai-based pharmaceutical company Wockhardt, which is producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in north Wales, said it notified authorities after receiving the package on Wednesday morning.“Upon expert advice, we have partially evacuated the site pending a full investigation. The safety of our employees and business continuity remain of paramount importance," the company said in a statement.North Wales Police said they were dealing with the “ongoing incident” at the Wrexham Industrial Estate, 42 miles (68 kilometers) south of Liverpool. They closed the surrounding roads and asked residents to avoid the area until further notice. The force did not provide further details.The Ministry of Defense said an ordnance disposal team had been called out and was assisting authorities at the plant. The BBC reported that there were no injuries.The company employs 400 people but did not elaborate on how many were evacuated Wednesday.Wockhardt UK had struck an agreement with the British government, which reserved a production line at the Welsh plant to guarantee the supply of the Covid-19 vaccines. The company recently hosted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hailed the agreement as a milestone in Britain's vaccine distribution program.Last week, emergency teams were deployed to protect supplies of the coronavirus vaccine following flooding at the Wrexham industrial area. Wockhardt said at the time that all precautions were taken to prevent a disruption in manufacturing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-plant-producing-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-evacuated-after-receiving-suspicious-package-101611764453794.html

Although it’s later than many advanced economies, South Korea has posted relatively low infection and death rates after it slowed the virus’s initial spread without a lockdown, relying instead on rapid testing and contact-tracing to mitigate flareups.South Korea ended the pandemic year of 2020 with a 1% contraction in gross domestic product, likely to be the smallest among OECD members. Government spending that included four extra budgets helped limit the damage from a slump in consumer spending, with exports powering the recovery from the second half of the year.Korea Economy Shrinks Just 1% in 2020 on Exports, Virus ControlThe Bank of Korea expects the economy to expand 3% this year. The government’s plan to increase housing supply is helping the construction industry, while policies to provide more pandemic relief are being mulled.The small annual contraction leaves South Korea in better shape than most developed economies. Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the country’s performance stood out when considering that the world’s 10 biggest economies probably shrank between 3-10%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-one-of-strongest-recoveries-among-major-economies-101611736734461.html

The FSCA has handed details of its probe into the failure of Mirror Trading International Ltd. to a top police unit after uncovering alleged fraud.“At the point something becomes a Ponzi scheme, we have lost our jurisdiction,” he said. “We need the police and the prosecuting authority to work fast and put people in jail.”MTI -- which in November claimed it had 260,000 members from around the world and 23,000 Bitcoin now worth about $740 million -- was placed in provisional liquidation last month after clients battled to withdraw funds. A surge in the price of the world’s best-known digital token has been accompanied by convictions abroad in scams tied to digital platforms and speculation that authorities globally will seek tighter controls.Liquidators Want More Power to Probe South African Bitcoin TraderFour temporary overseers must now begin tracing MTI’s investors to recover the firm’s assets, including money allegedly paid to some early players that runs into millions of rands. The FSCA investigation found that the company kept neither accounting records nor a comprehensive register of participants, apart from 170,000 unique email addresses found during an October raid.On Dec. 22, MTI’s management said in a letter posted on Telegram that they were misled and that the company’s Chief Executive Officer Johann Steynberg may have fled to Brazil. In July, the Texas State Securities Board issued a cease-and-desist order against the company.While the FSCA hasn’t received formal requests to assist law-enforcement agencies abroad, it is expecting queries, Topham said.‘Live Trades’The FSCA investigations hadn’t concluded MTI to be a Ponzi scheme and the regulator only noted it was trading without a license, Clynton and Cheri Marks, who joined the firm in August as head of the referral program and head of communications respectively, said in an email sent by their lawyer, Henry Selzer.“MTI set out to see what requirements are necessary to obtain a license,” they said. “When it became apparent that such a license would be impossible to obtain, Johann Steynberg moved MTI to crypto-trading for which apparently no license was required. The live trades were demonstrated to the FSCA during 2020 and MTI cooperated with every request from the FSCA.”While the Marks have had no contact with Steynberg, or knowledge of his whereabouts since the matter came to light, they are sure he “will repay to members their Bitcoin investments as that is the character of the Johann Steynberg they came to know,” their lawyer said.Bitcoin ‘Scam’ Has South Africa’s Police Chasing BillionsThe couple denied any negligence and also said there is “no connection whatsoever” between MTI and another failed cryptocurrency firm, BTC Global, other than that they were members of both companies. Regulators and liquidators were unable to supply contact details for Steynberg.‘Get in Quick’“It’s going to take a serious investigation to ascertain how much was involved,” Topham said. The FSCA is also looking into what transpired at two other firms believed to have a relationship with MTI, he said.Investors are drawn into potential scams because of South Africa’s persistently sluggish economic growth and greed, Topham said. The testimonials of sport-stars or other prominent figures are also a lure.Another alleged South African Ponzi scheme in 2009 snared about 800 investors across eight countries, including Qatar’s Barwa Real Estate Co. Barry Tannenbaum, who was accused of running the alleged 12.5 billion rand ($820 million) scam, moved to Australia and at the time said that some of the allegations against him are “drivel.”“I have been on radio shows where people say, ‘I am a professional Ponzi investor. You get in quick and get out and like with any business you have to risk money to make money,’” Topham said. “We need to make an example of MTI so that people understand that investing in a Ponzi is never a good idea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-cracks-down-on-bitcoin-after-alleged-ponzi-scheme-101611745081614.html
27-01-2021||World||Britain cracks down on travel to stop virus spread||Britain announced new measures to reduce travel in and out of the country on Wednesday, hoping that by tightening its borders it can reduce the risk of new variants of the coronavirus spreading and putting its vaccination programme at risk.Travellers arriving in Britain from high-risk Covid-19 countries will have to quarantine for 10 days in government-provided accommodation, while those wishing to leave will need to explain why in a process checked before departure, interior minister Priti Patel said on Wednesday.Further details on the "managed isolation process", where people quarantine in hotels, will be provided next week she said, adding that there would also be more police checks on arrivals from elsewhere."It is clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day," she told parliament."People should be staying at home, unless they have a valid reason to leave. Going on holiday is not a valid reason."The list of travel exemptions will also be urgently reviewed, she said, to crack down on movements and ensure only those people with exceptional reasons go abroad.More restrictions will mean further pain for airlines and the travel industry at a time when many companies are struggling after eleven months of the pandemic.Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, easyJet and others, repeated calls for government help."We can only help connect the UK to the world – and deliver the Global Britain agenda that is so important to our future prosperity – if we have a viable airlines sector," said Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-cracks-down-on-travel-to-stop-virus-spread-101611762402931.html

27-01-2021||World||Biden to target drilling, fossil fuel subsidies in new climate orders||The Biden administration will announce on Wednesday a new batch of executive actions aimed at combating climate change that will pause new oil and gas leases on federal land, reduce fossil fuel subsidies, and strengthen measures to protect poor and minority neighborhoods from pollution, according to the White House.The orders will set the direction for newly sworn-in President Joe Biden's climate change and environmental agenda and mark a drastic reversal from his predecessor Donald Trump, who sought to maximize the country’s oil, gas and coal output by removing regulations and easing environmental reviews.Biden's focus on climate change has cheered international partners and environmental advocates, but upset Big Oil, which has been arguing the moves will cost the United States millions of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue.In the orders, Biden will call for a pause on new federal oil and gas leases "to the extent possible" and direct the Interior Department to review the program's climate impacts and taxpayer benefits. He will also set a goal to conserve 30% of federal land and waters to protect wildlife by 2030.The orders will impact large swathes of acreage onshore in mostly Western states, as well as offshore drilling acreage located mainly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which combined make up about a quarter of the nation's oil and gas supply.Word of the measure has drawn criticism from some states that depend on drilling revenue and the oil industry, which has warned the move will costs jobs and economic growth.Biden will also direct federal agencies to "eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law", according to a White House fact sheet. It was not immediately clear which subsidies could be stripped away under this order, given many of the industry's tax breaks are Congressionally approved.The orders also include an announcement that Biden will host an international climate summit on Earth Day April 22, the creation of new climate change positions and an inter-agency task force within his government, and measures to boost government procurement of US-sourced clean energy and vehicles, boost science, and assist communities most affected by industrial pollution.The orders aim to make good on several of Biden's campaign promises to tackle climate change while also addressing racial and economic inequality.The US climate task force will be led by White House domestic climate policy advisor Gina McCarthy, while Biden's climate envoy, former Secretary of State John Kerry, will lead the administration's international work on global warming, according to Biden administration sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-target-drilling-fossil-fuel-subsidies-in-new-climate-orders-101611758801539.html
27-01-2021||World||Google opens Dublin hub to tackle harmful online content||Alphabet unit Google on Wednesday opened a centre to tackle harmful online content, in a move also designed to ease regulatory concerns about how the company and other tech giants police a growing problem on the internet.The world's most popular search engine, along with other US tech giants, has drawn criticism because of the spread of illegal and harmful content via their platforms, triggering calls for more regulatory action.The 27-country European Union has taken the lead in proposing tough new rules to curb their powers, protect smaller rivals and make them take more responsibility for removing harmful content from their platforms. The proposed rules are expected to come into force in the next two years.The Google Safety Engineering Center at Google's European headquarters in Dublin will focus on content responsibility and is the first in the world for the company, the company's Director of Trust and Safety Amanda Storey said in a blog."The new Dublin centre will be a regional hub for Google experts working to tackle the spread of illegal and harmful content and a place where we can share this work with policymakers, researchers, and regulators," she said.She added it would help everyone understand work with "trusted flaggers" and the way incidents are tackled, but she did not specify how many would be employed in the centre, whose staff will work from home for as long as lockdown restrictions require.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-opens-dublin-hub-to-tackle-harmful-online-content-101611759870993.html
27-01-2021||World||Proud Boys leader was ‘prolific’ informer for US law enforcement: Report||Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012, according to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding obtained by Reuters.In the Miami hearing, a federal prosecutor, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Tarrio’s own lawyer described his undercover work and said he had helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling.Tarrio, in an interview with Reuters Tuesday, denied working undercover or cooperating in cases against others. “I don’t know any of this,” he said, when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”Law-enforcement officials and the court transcript contradict Tarrio’s denial. In a statement to Reuters, the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”Read | Pro-Trump march: Who are ‘Proud Boys’ and ‘Three Percenters’?Tarrio, 36, is a high-profile figure who organizes and leads the right-wing Proud Boys in their confrontations with those they believe to be Antifa, short for “anti-fascism,” an amorphous and often violent leftist movement. The Proud Boys were involved in the deadly insurrection at the Capitol January 6.The records uncovered by Reuters are startling because they show that a leader of a far-right group now under intense scrutiny by law enforcement was previously an active collaborator with criminal investigators.Washington police arrested Tarrio in early January when he arrived in the city two days before the Capitol Hill riot. He was charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, and burning a Black Lives Matter banner during a December demonstration by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The DC Superior Court ordered him to leave the city pending a court date in June.Though Tarrio did not take part in the Capitol insurrection, at least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. The FBI previously said Tarrio’s earlier arrest was an effort to preempt the events of January 6.The transcript from 2014 shines a new light on Tarrio’s past connections to law enforcement. During the hearing, the prosecutor and Tarrio’s defense attorney asked a judge to reduce the prison sentence of Tarrio and two co-defendants. They had pleaded guilty in a fraud case related to the relabeling and sale of stolen diabetes test kits.The prosecutor said Tarrio’s information had led to the prosecution of 13 people on federal charges in two separate cases, and had helped local authorities investigate a gambling ring.Tarrio’s then-lawyer Jeffrey Feiler said in court that his client had worked undercover in numerous investigations, one involving the sale of anabolic steroids, another regarding “wholesale prescription narcotics” and a third targeting human smuggling. He said Tarrio helped police uncover three marijuana grow houses, and was a “prolific” cooperator.In the smuggling case, Tarrio, “at his own risk, in an undercover role met and negotiated to pay $11,000 to members of that ring to bring in fictitious family members of his from another country,” the lawyer said in court.In an interview, Feiler said he did not recall details about the case but added, “The information I provided to the court was based on information provided to me by law enforcement and the prosecutor.”An FBI agent at the hearing called Tarrio a “key component” in local police investigations involving marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, or ecstasy. The Miami FBI office declined comment.There is no evidence Tarrio has cooperated with authorities since then. In interviews with Reuters, however, he said that before rallies in various cities, he would let police departments know of the Proud Boys’ plans. It is unclear if this was actually the case. He said he stopped this coordination after December 12 because the DC police had cracked down on the group.Tarrio on Tuesday acknowledged that his fraud sentence was reduced, from 30 months to 16 months, but insisted that leniency was provided only because he and his co-defendants helped investigators “clear up” questions about his own case. He said he never helped investigate others.That comment contrasts with statements made in court by the prosecutor, his lawyer and the FBI. The judge in the case, Joan A. Lenard, said Tarrio “provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of other persons involved in criminal conduct.”As Trump supporters challenged the Republican’s election loss in often violent demonstrations, Tarrio stood out for his swagger as he led crowds of mostly white Proud Boys in a series of confrontations and street brawls in Washington, DC, Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.The Proud Boys, founded in 2016, began as a group protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity. It grew into a group with distinctive colors of yellow and black that embraced street fighting. In September their profile soared when Trump called on them to “Stand back and stand by.”Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of DC after Trump’s loss. Video shows him on December 11 with a bullhorn in front of a large crowd. “To the parasites both in Congress, and in that stolen White House,” he said. “You want a war, you got one!” The crowd roared. The next day Tarrio burned the BLM banner.Former prosecutor Johannes said she was surprised that the defendant she prosecuted for fraud is now a key player in the violent movement that sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden.“I knew that he was a fraudster – but had no reason to know that he was also a domestic terrorist,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-boys-leader-was-prolific-informer-for-us-law-enforcement-report-101611758160133.html

In a decision published Wednesday, the committee said Italy “failed to respond promptly” to distress calls after the vessel was shot “by a boat flying a Berber flag in international waters” some 113 kilometres south of the Italian island of Lampedusa.The committee of 18 experts says distress calls to Italian authorities were redirected to Malta, which was some 218 kilometers away. By the time a Maltese patrol boat arrived the boat had capsized. More than 200 people, including 60 children, drowned.Committee member Helene Tigroudja called it a “complex case” since the migrants' boat was in international waters within Malta's search and rescue zone, but she said a timely response might have averted the tragedy."Had the Italian authorities immediately directed its naval ship and coast guard boats after the distress calls, the rescue would have reached the vessel at the latest two hours before it sank,” Tigroudja said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-fault-italy-in-drownings-of-over-200-migrants-101611757464394.html

The measure is designed to help farmers hit by the coronavirus pandemic and economy’s slump with about 10% of borrowers qualifying.“USDA and the Biden Administration are committed to bringing relief and support to farmers, ranchers and producers of all backgrounds and financial status, including by ensuring producers have access to temporary debt relief,” Robert Bonnie, the department’s deputy chief of staff, said in a statement.The government is evaluating ways to improve and address borrowing to keep farmers “earning living expenses, providing for emergency needs and maintaining cash flow,” Bonnie said.The USDA will temporarily suspend non-judicial foreclosures and wage garnishments and halt referring foreclosures to the Justice Department. The department will also seek to stop foreclosures and evictions already in progress. The administration plans to keep the debt-relief measures in place until the Covid-19 emergency ends, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-give-debt-relief-to-12-000-farmers-101611756197828.html
27-01-2021||World||India takes up with Italy, Canada incidents outside missions in Rome, Vancouver||India is taking up with foreign governments, including those of Canada and Italy, the actions of pro-Khalistan elements in events linked to the farmers’ protest over three farm laws, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday.A sizeable group of protestors, including some carrying Khalistan flags and placards, converged on a veranda leading to the Indian consulate in Vancouver on Republic Day, and weren’t prevented by law enforcement from blocking the entrance.In Italy, unidentified persons painted the slogan “Khalistan Zindabad” on the facade of the Indian embassy in Rome and put up several pro-Khalistan flags and banners at the gate ahead of Republic Day. The Indian side took up the incident with Italian authorities and conveyed its concerns, the people said.India intends to formally complain to Global Affairs Canada (GAC), the country’s foreign ministry, over allowing the pre-planned blockade of the consulate in Vancouver by protestors ostensibly opposing the farm laws.Protests will also be lodged with the provincial government of British Columbia, where Vancouver is located, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), responsible for security of diplomats and diplomatic premises. While Vancouver Police Department is responsible for law and order in the city, missions deal with local law enforcement through RCMP.The people said they were incensed that the protestors in Vancouver were allowed to “violate the sanctity of diplomatic premises” and that they weren’t preventing from taking “direct action despite promises to the contrary”.The presence of a person who recently threatened India’s consul general Manish among the protestors is of particular concern to Indian authorities. Also believed to be present was Hardeep Singh Nijjar, among the main Khalistani figures in Canada.Plans for the blockade were announced in advance by the separatist Sikhs for Justice (SFJ). Despite the forewarning, lack of measures to prevent the obstruction has incensed Indian diplomats.The flag unfurling ceremony to mark Republic Day was held early in the morning, but protestors arrived and blocked the building at 8.30 am and remained in front of it for several hours.What disappointed Indian diplomats more is that the day had commenced on a positive note with a warm message from Canada’s new foreign minister Marc Garneau, which was shared on social media by his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.“On India’s Republic Day, we are reminded of the importance of strengthening current bonds as well as forging new ones in the years ahead,” Garneau said.He said the “challenges of the past year show that the links between our countries continue to grow stronger” and that “India’s leadership in sustaining global supply chains of critical medical supplies and pharmaceuticals has proven to be invaluable, helping a great number of Canadians”.The people cited above said India has been constantly raising its concerns about protests near the Indian embassy in Rome with Italian authorities and this was done again recently in view of Republic Day.“Safety and security of Indian diplomats and diplomatic premises is the responsibility of the host government. We are hopeful the Italian authorities will take action against the perpetrators and prevent such incidents from happening in future,” said a person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-takes-up-with-italy-canada-incidents-outside-missions-in-rome-vancouver-101611754523119.html

The treaty is the last remaining nuclear arms control between Washington and Kremlin which was signed by US President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Dmitry Medvedev in 2010.The New START was set to expire on February 5 but the newly-elected US President, Joe Biden, proposed extending the treaty for five more years, which was quickly welcomed by Russia. United Nations’ chief Antonio Guterres has also been encouraging the United States and Russia for a long time to extend their nuclear arms reduction treaty.Here’s all you need to know about the New START:The New START entered into force on February 5, 2011, and was expected to last at least until February 5, 2021, unless superseded by a subsequent agreement. The two parties are allowed to extend the treaty for a period of no more than five years.The treaty limits Russia and the US to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.It also limits both countries to 800 deployed and non-deployed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments.Read | US prez Biden, Vladimir Putin speak over phone, discuss nuke treaty, NavalnyIt further envisages sweeping on-site inspections, exhibitions, and data exchanges to verify compliance. It also provides for an annual exchange of telemetry on an agreed number of ICBM and SLBM launches.Each side is allowed to conduct ten ‘Type One’ inspections and eight Type Two inspections every year. The ‘Type One’ inspections focus on sites with deployed and non-deployed strategic systems, while the ‘Type Two’ inspections focus on sites with only non-deployed strategic systems.According to the US state department’s website, the US and Russia conducted two inspections in the tenth year of the treaty. The two parties have exchanged 21,403 notifications as of January 21, 2021. The treaty provides for 18 on-site inspections annually.The treaty doesn’t put a constraint on testing, development, or deployment of current or planned US missile defence programs or long-range conventional strike capabilities.New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the two countries after they withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-start-all-you-need-to-know-about-us-russia-nuclear-arms-control-treaty-101611755500309.html
27-01-2021||World||Who’s who on Joe Biden’s sprawling climate team||Past presidents—even progressive ones—have viewed climate change as a problem for the future. President Barack Obama, for example, “took the view that climate change was a moral issue,” said Jeff Burnam, an adjunct professor at American University who previously served as a senior legislative staffer in the US House and Senate. “At the time, that was the idea—what are we going to do about our children?”Especially following a year when wildfires caused record levels of destruction along one US coast while hurricanes pummeLled another, President Joe Biden doesn’t have that luxury. Already he’s assembled an unprecedented team of White House climate advisers and installed climate experts in roles that haven’t typically been thought to require environmental expertise, a sign that environmental policy will be central to his administration’s agenda.Here’s a brief guide to who’s on Biden’s team and what they’re doing there:John Kerry Special Presidential Envoy for ClimateIn 2015, as Secretary of State under Obama, Kerry helped secure passage of the Paris climate agreement. In his new role under Biden, Kerry will be back in the Cabinet—plus, he’ll have a seat on the National Security Council, a first for the group dedicated to advising the president on the nation’s biggest threats. As climate envoy, Kerry will be the global face of the US’s climate agenda, charged with making sure the world sees the US as a leader on climate again.Gina McCarthy National Climate AdviserAs head of the Environmental Protection Agency, McCarthy signed the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, which set the first national limits on carbon pollution from power plants but was blocked from going into effect by the Supreme Court and later became a bogeyman of the Trump administration. She’ll play the US counterpart to Kerry’s international efforts.Janet Yellen Treasury SecretaryDuring her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Yellen called climate change an “existential threat” to the US economy, which stands to take a 10.5% hit by 2100 if emissions keep increasing. She told senators she’d create a special hub within the department dedicated climate-related financial risk and appoint someone at a “very senior level” to lead it.Jennifer Granholm Secretary of EnergyGranholm’s climate track record is already long. In 2007, as governor of Michigan, she created the Michigan Climate Action Council, which was tasked with developing a set of recommendations for the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions gird its economy against the effects of warming. Two years later, she worked with the Obama administration to coordinate the auto industry bailout, which included a plan to cut greenhouse gases by steadily raising fuel efficiency standards to a target of 54.5 miles per gallon for new vehicles by 2025.Deb Haaland Secretary of the InteriorBarely off her freshman term in the House as a representative from New Mexico, Haaland will become the first Native American Cabinet secretary if she’s confirmed. As the top official for the country’s public lands, Haaland would oversee a key focus of the administration’s climate policy. Biden is expected to expand on a previous order suspending new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits for public lands and waters, directing his agencies to determine whether that could be made a permanent ban.Pete Buttigieg Secretary of TransportationWhile running for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Buttigieg said he’d restore Obama-era vehicle emissions standards; now, assuming the Senate approves his nomination as Transportation Secretary, he’ll have the power to do just that. The Department of Transportation governs many facets of US infrastructure, including public transit and road construction, putting him at the forefront of climate resilience efforts, as well.Michael ReganEnvironmental Protection Agency AdministratorAs head of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, Regan facilitated a multi-billion-dollar coal ash cleanup, ordered chemical companies to prevent so-called “forever chemicals” from contaminating the Cape Fear River, and established an environmental justice advisory board, all in a state that voted for Trump in 2020 by a margin of more than 100,000 votes. That determination and willpower will help him in his next job—if confirmed, he’ll be responsible for reenergizing the agency, which struggled with attrition and ideological clashes under Trump.Deanne CriswellFederal Emergency Management Agency AdministratorCriswell led New York City’s response to the coronavirus pandemic as its commissioner of emergency management. As of mid-December, FEMA had responded to 125 official declarations of emergency in 2020, up from 15 in 2019. Criswell must be confirmed by the Senate before starting work.Brian DeeseDirector of the National Economic CouncilDeese served in a number of roles in the Obama administration, including as a climate adviser and as deputy director of the NEC. After Obama left the White House, Deese became the global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, an association that rankles some environmentalists; despite Chairman Larry Fink’s pledge to put sustainability at the center of the firm’s investment strategy, it remains the world’s largest backer of fossil fuel projects. Deese will be in charge of the jobs part of Biden’s climate and jobs agenda.Brenda Mallory Chair of the White House Council on Environmental QualityMallory was most recently the director of regulatory policy for the Southern Environmental Law Center, an advocacy group aimed at protecting the environment and citizens of the south. Before that, she was acting general counsel at the EPA and helped lead the Climate 21 Project, a policy memo put together by more than 150 people with government experience giving recommendations to the Biden administration on tackling the climate crisis.Rich Glick Chairman of the US Federal Energy Regulatory CommissionGlick has already served on the FERC board; before that, he was vice president for government affairs for Spanish utility giant Iberdrola’s US renewables business and director of government affairs at US power giant PacifiCorp. As leader of FERC, once confirmed, he’d be responsible for approving natural gas infrastructure and overseeing electricity markets, making him a key player in Biden’s effort to achieve a clean electrical grid by 2035.Eric Lander Science Adviser and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology PolicyLander is best known for co-leading the Human Genome Project, the international research initiative that succeeded in building the first map of human DNA in 2003, and was co-chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology during the Obama years. The OSTP has in the past been primarily focused on nuclear technology, so the nomination of a life scientist to lead the office (he still has to be confirmed) is yet another demonstration of the Biden’s administration’s deliberate shift toward climate and related issues.Jeff Marootian Special Assistant to the President for Climate and Science Agency PersonnelAs Washington, D.C.’s one-time top transportation official, Marootian helped broker a joint agreement between Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia signed in 2020 to reduce pollution related to transportation over the next decade and invest in clean transportation. He also worked as the White House liaison for the Department of Transportation under the Obama administration.Frances Arnold and Maria Zuber Co-chairs of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and TechnologyArnold is a professor of chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology, and won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2018 for her work using direct evolution to design new enzymes.

Most Auschwitz survivors are in their eighties and nineties."Even if there was no pandemic, there would be fewer survivors at every anniversary," Turski told Reuters in a Zoom interview from his Warsaw home."People at my age who are already vulnerable to many other illnesses are also in the first line of fire for this virus."He declined an in-person interview, in part due to the pandemic risks.The Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial preserves the Auschwitz death camp set up on Polish soil by Nazi Germany during World War Two. More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers at the camp or from starvation, cold and disease.Wednesday's ceremony marking the camp's liberation will take place virtually starting at 1500 GMT, with speeches by survivors, Poland's President Andrzej Duda and Israeli and Russian diplomats, as well as a debate on the Holocaust's influence on children.Other virtual ceremonies will also take place to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.The Memorial has been closed to visitors for 161 days due to the pandemic. In 2019 it was visited by around 2.3 million people. In 2020 that number dropped to around 502,000.The Museum's director, Piotr Cywinski, acknowledged virtual events and education programmes were not as effective in passing on the lessons of the Holocaust and World War Two."Nothing will replace witnessing the place in its authentic state, because this isn't just about seeing and listening. This is about looking around, in your own steps, touching, experiencing different perspectives, understanding," Cywinski told Reuters.WARNING THE WORLDSurvivors emphasized the importance of finding ways to keep Auschwitz relevant after they can no longer tell their own stories, amid a rise in far-right movements and anti-Semitism.In Germany, former finance minister and now president of the lower house of parliament, Wolfgang Schaeuble, warned that "our culture of remembrance does not protect us from a brazen reinterpretation and even a denial of history".He added that racism and anti-Semitism were spreading through internet forums and conspiracy theories, stressing society's collective responsibility to honour the memory of the Holocaust.Pope Francis urged people to keep a close watch on ideological extremism, because "these things can happen again".He spoke three weeks after displays of anti-Semitism surfaced at the US Capitol riot on January 6 and two weeks after one of Montreal's largest synagogues was vandalised and almost set on fire.Speaking at his general audience, held inside the papal library because of coronavirus restrictions, Francis said it was imperative that the world did not forget."To remember ... means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity," he said.Some Auschwitz survivors, like Bogdan Bartnikowski, 89, said they were optimistic that the pandemic would not end their chances of returning to the memorial and telling their stories."I have hope that for sure there will continue to be groups of visitors to the museum," Bartnikowski said. "Us former prisoners will not be lacking."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/auschwitz-marks-anniversary-virtually-as-survivors-fear-end-of-an-era-101611753741968.html

27-01-2021||World||Russian parliament approves New START nuclear treaty extension||Russian lawmakers on Wednesday quickly approved the extension of the last remaining nuclear Russia-US arms control, a fast-track action that comes just days before it’s due to expire.Both houses of parliament voted unanimously to extend the New START treaty for five years, a day after a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin said they agreed to complete the necessary extension procedures in the next few days.The pact’s extension doesn’t require congressional approval in the US, but Russian lawmakers must ratify the move and Putin has to sign the relevant bill into law.Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told lawmakers that the extension will be validated by exchanging diplomatic notes once all the procedures are completed.Upper house Speaker Valentina Matvienko said after the vote that the decision to extend the pact shows that Russia and the US can reach agreements on major issues despite the tensions between them.New START expires on Feb. 5. After taking office last week, Biden proposed extending the treaty for five years, and the Kremlin quickly welcomed the offer.The treaty, signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.Biden indicated during the campaign that he favored the preservation of the New START treaty, which was negotiated during his tenure as U.S. vice president.Russia has long proposed prolonging the pact without any conditions or changes, but the Trump administration waited until last year to start talks and made the extension contingent on a set of demands. The talks stalled, and months of bargaining have failed to narrow differences.The negotiations were also marred by tensions between Russia and the United States, which have been fueled by the Ukrainian crisis, Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and other irritants.After both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries.Earlier this month, Russia announced that it would follow the US in pulling out of the Open Skies Treaty, which allowed surveillance flights over military facilities, to help build trust and transparency between Russia and the West.Before the Biden administration took office, Russia always had offered to extend New START for five years — a possibility that was envisaged by the pact at the time it was signed. But President Donald Trump charged that it put the US at a disadvantage. Trump initially insisted that China be added to the treaty, an idea that Beijing bluntly dismissed.The Trump administration then proposed to extend New START for just one year and also sought to expand it to include limits on battlefield nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-parliament-approves-new-start-nuclear-treaty-extension-101611748356451.html

27-01-2021||World||UK could save 1.5 million crisis-hit workers at a modest cost||The UK could offer help for over a million people currently left out of income support programs at relatively little cost, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.While the government’s aid programs have drawn praise for preventing a large spike in unemployment during the crisis, pressure to address the flaws in the system is mounting ahead of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s March budget.Excluded groups include the 1.3 million workers who get less than half of their income from self-employment and the 225,000 people who earn profits in excess of 50,000 pounds ($69,000), both of which could be added without much difficulty, the IFS said in a report Wednesday.Expanding existing government help to include the first group, as well as extending payments to people who have profits of as much as 90,000 pounds in a tapered manner, would cost around 1 billion pounds per quarter, the IFS found. That’s about 5% of the total spent helping the self employed so far.“It is hard to believe it would be significantly less well targeted than the current Self-Employment Income Support Scheme and it would certainly support a significant number of people facing financial difficulties,” the report said.While the government insists people can fall back on government welfare payments, the application process can be lengthy, and many miss out due to their existing savings, which have to be run down before the benefits, known as Universal Credit, can be claimed.Almost 4 million adults, or 7%, have been left out of income replacement programs and are not claiming Universal Credit, according to a separate YouGov survey commissioned by the Standard Life Foundation. Of those, 1.8 million have lost at least a third of their household income and 63% said they are struggling to pay their bills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-save-1-5-million-crisis-hit-workers-at-a-modest-cost-101611747314969.html
27-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine delivery talks with EU will go ahead: AstraZeneca||AstraZeneca says it has not pulled out of talks with the European Union and plans to meet with EU officials later Wednesday in Brussels.The comments came after EU officials said that the company had pulled out of the meeting to discuss delayed vaccine commitments to the bloc. The talks were slated to be the third in as many days.The spat between AstraZeneca and the EU has raised concerns about vaccine nationalism, as countries desperate to end the pandemic and return to normalcy jockey to make sure to obtain as many of the precious vaccine shots as possible.The latest disagreement between the two sides came after AstraZeneca rejected the EU’s accusation that the company had failed to honor its commitments for the delivery of coronavirus vaccine. The company says figures in its contract with the EU were targets that couldn’t be met because of problems in rapidly expanding production capacity.AstraZeneca said in a statement that they “understand and share in the frustration that initial supply volumes of our vaccine delivered to the European Union will be lower than forecast.”Chief Executive Pascal Soriot made the comments in an interview with the Italian newspaper La Repubblica following days of criticism from EU leaders furious about the news that initial shipments from AstraZeneca would be lower than anticipated. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said last week that it planned to cut initial deliveries in the EU to 31 million doses from 80 million due to reduced yield in the manufacturing process.“Our contract is not a contractual commitment,’’ Soriot said. “It’s the best effort. Basically we said we’re going to try our best, but we can’t guarantee we’re going to succeed. In fact, getting there, we are a little bit delayed.”On Monday, the EU threatened to impose tight export controls within days on Covid-19 vaccines made in the bloc.The EU, which has 450 million citizens and the economic and political clout of the world’s biggest trading bloc, is lagging badly behind countries like Israel and Britain in rolling out coronavirus vaccine shots for its health care workers and most vulnerable people. That’s despite having over 400,000 confirmed virus deaths since the pandemic began.The shortfall of planned deliveries of the AstraZeneca vaccine come at the same time a slowdown in the distribution of Pfizer-BioNTech shots as that company upgrades production facilities at a plant in Belgium is putting EU nations under heavy political pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-delivery-talks-with-eu-will-go-ahead-astrazeneca-101611747858449.html

She is a 35-year veteran of the US Foreign Service who has served on four continents, most notably in Africa."We know China is working across the UN system to drive an authoritarian agenda that stands in opposition to the founding values of the institution - American values," Thomas-Greenfield will say, according to excerpts from her statement."Their success depends on our continued withdrawal. That will not happen on my watch," she will say.Beijing has been pushing for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to traditional US leadership. Tensions between the two superpowers have hit a boiling point at the United Nations over the deadly coronavirus pandemic.Former President Donald Trump was critical of the United Nations and wary of the value of multilateralism. He announced plans to quit the World Health Organization (WHO), and pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency UNESCO, a global climate change accord and the Iran nuclear deal.On his first day in office last week, Biden rescinded the US decision to withdraw from the WHO and announced a return to the climate agreement."When America shows up, when we are consistent and persistent, when we exert our influence in accordance with our values, the United Nations can be an indispensable institution for advancing peace, security, and our collective well-being," Thomas-Greenfield will say."If instead we walk away from the table, and allow others to fill the void, the global community suffers — and so do American interests," she will say.If confirmed, Thomas-Greenfield will join counterparts with decades of experience in diplomacy from Britain, France, China and Russia - which along with the United States - make up the UN Security Council's five permanent veto-wielding members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-un-pick-to-warn-that-us-absence-allows-china-to-thrive-at-world-body-101611746173724.html

They issued videos of themselves in what looked like makeshift underground structures supported by wooden slats.A Reuters photographer on Wednesday saw some protesters in trees refusing to come down. The garden had been cordoned off and reporters were not being allowed inside to see the entrance to the tunnel.HS2 Ltd said the eviction was necessary because the protesters were trespassing on its land and certain works needed to take place on time."HS2 has taken legal temporary possession of Euston Square Gardens East in order to progress with works necessary for the construction of the new Euston Station," it said.The Reuters photographer saw personnel from the National Eviction Team, a private contractor that specialises in evicting protesters, squatters and travellers, according to its website.Police officers were also present. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were there to prevent any breach of the peace.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/environmental-protesters-tunnel-under-london-to-resist-eviction-101611744589718.html

The death of the actress who appeared in several television dramas was confirmed in a statement by her management company, Sublime artist agency, which said that the actress died suddenly and that her funeral was held quietly on Monday in accordance with her family's wishes. Although no cause of death was given by her agency, it has been widely alleged that the actress died by suicide.Song began her acting career at the age of 20 as a cosmetics model when she appeared in commercials for Estee Lauder skin products and for ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins. She made her K-drama debut in MBC's Golden Rainbow in 2013. In 2014, she also starred in the drama Make your wish. In 2017, she appeared in the drama School 2017. She also appeared in the music video Goodbye Road by the K-pop band iKON. Her breakout role was in 2019 in a web series called “Dear My Name.”Apart from her acting and modeling career, she was a vocal advocate for people with disabilities and also the ambassador for a South Korean group called Warm Accompaniment.The South Korean entertainment industry has seen deaths of a number of young stars in recent years.

COVAX has said it aims to deliver 1.8 billion doses to poorer countries this year.At least five countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region will benefit from the first wave of COVAX vaccines though the list of countries is yet been confirmed, said Richard Brennan, a second WHO official.Countries with larger populations, lower income and weaker health systems that are expected to make slower progress vaccinating will be prioritised in the COVAX vaccine rollout, officials said.Eight countries in the Eastern Mediterranean have started vaccination campaigns. Ten countries in the region have documented one or more coronavirus variants, though its likely that the variants have spread further, Brennan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-to-supply-355-million-vaccine-doses-for-eastern-mediterranean-this-year-101611744682602.html

To remember is a sign of civility. To remember is a condition for a better future of peace and fraternity," said Francis, who visited Auschwitz in 2016.The Nazis and their allies murdered around 6 million Jews, as well as others, in German-occupied Europe.More than a million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland, which was liberated by Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945. The vast majority were gassed to death.Francis said society should never let its guard down against the dangers of nationalism."To remember also means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity," he said."Be wary of how this path of death, extermination and brutality started," he said, referring to the Nazis' rise to power in the 1930s on a wave a extreme nationalism.At the U.S. Capitol riot, some supporters of former President Donald Trump wore clothes bearing anti-Semitic messages or displayed Nazi symbols.One wore a T-shirt reading "Camp Auschwitz" and another wore a T-shirt with the inscription "6MWE," a far-right acronym that stands for "6 Million Wasn't Enough".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-holocaust-remembrance-day-pope-warns-against-new-nationalism-101611744993625.html
27-01-2021||World||India, China vaccinations to stretch into late 2022, says study||Mass immunisation programmes against Covid-19 in China and India will likely stretch until late 2022 because of the sheer size of the populations, a new study has said, adding that over 85 poor countries will only have limited access to vaccines before 2023.The unusually rapid development of vaccines against the coronavirus had raised hopes for the pandemic to come to an end but limited production capacities, unequal distribution networks and massive demand for the shots are now sowing seeds of doubt.The WHO has pointed out that bilateral deals between rich countries and pharma companies are also a concern.The new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit says while production represents the main hurdle, “…vaccine diplomacy will play a big role to determine which developing countries get access to shots in the coming months.”“Most developing countries will not have widespread access to the shots before 2023 at the earliest, Agathe Demarais, director of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the research division of the Economist Group, said in its study.China and India, the study added, represent special cases. Both countries have developed their own shots and are pressing ahead with rollout plans, “but the sheer size of their population means that mass immunisation programmes will stretch until late 2022, in line with the expected timeline for most middle-income countries,” it said.Countries at the front of the queue—including the UK, the US and most European Union nations—are expected to have immunised their priority groups by end of March, with other wealthy countries catching up by June-end. “We therefore expect that global economic prospects will brighten from mid-2021, with the global economic rebound gaining speed in the third and fourth quarters. However, life will not be back to normal by then, as immunisation programmes for the bulk of the population will continue until mid-2022.”In an earlier report, the EIU had said that vaccine diplomacy will play a big role in determining which developing countries get access to a vaccine in the coming months, with Russia and China using the rollout of their own coronavirus shots to advance their interests. “The Economist Intelligence Unit believes that the bulk of the adult population in advanced economies will have been vaccinated by mid-2022. For middle-income countries, this timeline will stretch to late 2022 or early 2023. For poorer economies, mass immunisation will take until 2024, if it happens at all,” the earlier report said.China has administered a total of 22.77 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines by Tuesday, the National Health Commission said here Wednesday.The world’s most populous nation – with more than 1.4 billion people – has widened its targeted inoculation scheme since mid-December to include more priority groups facing higher risk of virus exposure, in a bid to prevent any outbreaks in winter and spring.“Overall, the work is progressing in a smooth and orderly manner,” Zeng Yixin, vice director of the national health commission, told a news conference on Wednesday.China aims to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year in February, state-backed tabloid Global Times said this month. “The nationwide vaccine scheme now prioritises essential groups such as workers in medical, transport and food services, employees and students going abroad. The elderly and others will have to wait,” Reuters news agency said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-vaccinations-to-stretch-into-late-2022-says-study-101611745055534.html

The spouses of H1-B visa holders receive H4 visas and only in certain cases, those spouses could apply for an employment authorisation document.The work permit was generally given to H4 visa holders when their H1-B spouses were on track to receive a permanent resident card, also known as a green card. But the decades of green card-backlog left thousands of families struggling to survive on a single income. The Obama administration introduced the H4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule in 2015 to resolve such issues.After the Trump administration started taking concrete steps to rescind the program, US vice president Kamala Harris, then a California senator, objected to the “outrageous” move. Calling on the DHS to withdraw the proposal, Harris had said that the decision will force immigrant doctors, scientists and academics to abandon their professional careers.“This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal & will continue to fight this,” she had tweeted in February 2019.This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to abandon their professional careers.

27-01-2021||World||Trump vs Biden: A comparison of cabinet picks||Almost a week after being sworn in as President of the United States, Joe Biden’s cabinet is beginning to come together. The Senate confirmed Antony Blinken as Secretary of State on Tuesday making him the President’s fourth nominee to be approved. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, defence secretary Lloyd Austin and director of national intelligence Avril have also been approved by the Senate.While Biden has focused on diversity and government experience in choosing his cabinet members, his predecessor Donald Trump was more anti-establishment. The difference between the approaches of both is stark.Here’s a comparative look at the top picks of Biden and Trump:1. Treasury secretaryFor treasury secretary, Trump’s choice was Steven Mnuchin, a financier with ties to Wall Street who bankrolled movies including “X-Men” and “Avatar.” Mnuchin had no government experience whatsoever and had spent nearly 20 years at Goldman Sachs later becoming part of a group of investors that purchased a bank which was seized during the financial crisis of 2008.Biden’s pick is Janet L Yellen, who has a long career in economics and almost two decades at the federal reserve. She was also a chairwoman of the council of economic advisers during the Clinton administration.2. Secretary of StateTrump’s pick for Secretary of State was Rex W Tillerson, who was then the chief executive of Exxon Mobil and had a very close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden has chosen Antony J Blinken, his longtime aide who also worked at the state department during the Clinton administration. Blinken was Biden’s national security adviser and was a key player in the Obama administration’s policy in Iraq and Syria.3. Secretary of CommerceTrump’s pick for the position was Wilbur Ross, an investor and Trump campaign donor, who made a fortune through private equity investments. He took on the role without any government experience.Biden’s pick is Gina M Raimondo, the governor of Rhode Island since 2015 who has experience in both government and finance. She was also the state treasurer and founded a joint venture firm that helped finance a number of start-ups.4. Secretary of department of housing and urban developmentTrump chose Ben Carson, a retired renowned neurosurgeon with no government experience for this post. The pick was widely criticised by the media and by the Democrats as well.Biden’s choice is Marcia L Fudge who has represented the state of Ohio in the House since 2008 and is also a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. She was also the mayor of Warrensville Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.5. Secretary of department of educationTrump chose Betsy DeVos, a wealthy philanthropist and a Republican fund-raiser for this position. She was highly criticised as she was a major supporter of private schools. Biden’s pick on the other hand is Miguel Cardona, the commissioner of Connecticut’s education department, who attended public schools as a child and taught in them as well during his teaching careers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-vs-biden-a-comparison-of-cabinet-picks-101611741124495.html

27-01-2021||World||Biden commerce pick Raimondo vows ‘aggressive’ China steps||The US must take “aggressive” steps to combat China’s “unfair” trade practices while also investing to bring manufacturing back to the country, said Gina Raimondo, President Joe Biden’s nominee for Commerce secretary.Raimondo pledged to respond to Chinese policies that hurt American workers, while stopping short of a specific game plan. The new administration will take time to review policies carried over from former President Donald Trump, including tariffs, she said.“China has clearly behaved in ways that are anti-competitive -- dumping cheap steel and aluminum into America, which hurts American workers and hurts the ability of our companies to compete,” Raimondo, who has served as governor of Rhode Island since 2015, said Tuesday at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. If confirmed, she said, “I plan to be very aggressive to help Americans compete against the unfair practices of China.”Her comments echo those of other Biden officials, who have signaled they will continue some of Trump’s hard-line China measures, though they’ve so far omitted specifics. Last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. is “prepared to use the full array of tools” to address actions such as “dumping products, erecting trade barriers and giving illegal subsidies to corporations.”Raimondo and her team will inherit numerous enforcement actions against Chinese technology companies. Most notably, the Trump administration instituted an export ban for Huawei Technologies Co. that requires American firms to obtain government licenses before they’re allowed to sell U.S. tech and intellectual property to the Chinese telecommunications-equipment giant.Raimondo, under questioning, didn’t specifically commit to keeping Huawei on the entity list that requires those licenses. She said she would consult on the matter and make an assessment based on national security.China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that it hoped the U.S. would “respect market economy and fair competition principles and work to provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for all countries’ businesses” in response to a question on Raimondo’s comments.“China will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard its businesses’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing.‘Back door’“We can’t have the Chinese or really anyone having a back door into our network and compromising in any way our national or economic security,” Raimondo also said Tuesday. “I will use the bold toolkit at my disposal to the fullest extent possible to protect Americans and our network from Chinese interference or any kind of back-door influence into our network -- and that’s Huawei, ZTE, or any other company,” she said, referring to China’s ZTE Corp., another telecommunications equipment firm.Raimondo also said that the U.S. will “need to invest in innovation and technology in our manufacturing sector.”Her stated objective of “reshoring” factory jobs to the U.S. is an echo of Trump, though his goal proved elusive. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs stood at 12.3 million in December, little changed from four years earlier. Two decades ago, the figure topped 17 million.Tapped to lead a department with wide-ranging international and domestic responsibilities, Raimondo also underlined the need for “bold” action to help America’s tourism, travel and restaurant industries recover from the pandemic social distancing that crushed business. She told senators that the U.S. needs to step back and devise a national spectrum strategy for transformative 5G communications airwaves.Raimondo said that social media companies need to be held accountable for the content on their platforms, and that she would work with Congress to make changes to Section 230, a liability waiver that the companies depend upon to allow relatively unfettered speech by users. Trump had demanded that the protections be revoked.“We need platform accountability, but of course that reform would have to be balanced against the fact that these businesses rely upon user generated content for their innovation and have created many thousands of jobs,” she said.She also pledged to work to expand broadband access.Raimondo, 49, has been in public office in her home state since 2011, when she was sworn in as state treasurer. Before that, she spent more than a decade working in venture capital, including co-founding Point Judith Capital.The Commerce Department comprises a variety of agencies including the Census Bureau, which runs the decennial count and compiles economic data; the International Trade Administration, charged with monitoring unfair global competition from dumping and subsidies, as well as enforcing U.S. trade laws; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, home to the National Weather Service; and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.Raimondo was national co-chairwoman of Michael Bloomberg’s 2020 presidential campaign. Bloomberg is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-commerce-pick-raimondo-vows-aggressive-china-steps-101611738214391.html
27-01-2021||World||Vaccination against Covid in Moscow now possible in shopping centres, theatres||Mass vaccination against coronavirus is taking place in the Russian capital Moscow where people can get vaccinated not only in hospitals and polyclinics but also in large shopping centres, as well as in opera theatres and other popular points where mobile medical teams work.According to TV BRICS, the first such team of doctors from city polyclinics began working in the main department store of the country, GUM. It is very convenient, as customers can visit the store and at the same time, without wasting time, get vaccinated against Covid-19.Nailaya Alibekova, a volunteer, said that she wanted to safeguard herself from getting the virus for the second time as she caught it the first time."We need to safeguard ourselves. In any case, you can catch it for the second time. I was sick once, I didn't like it, I don't want to be sick again, so I need to get vaccinated and protect myself," she said as quoted by TV BRICS.Vaccinations have been taking place at GUM for several days. The vaccination centre at the main department store in Russia is located on the third floor of the first line. And there is a queue there every day.The outlet, headquartered in Moscow, reported that doctors say that even foreigners came to get vaccinated. Everyone who wants to get vaccinated is first given questionnaires regarding their diseases and possible contraindications.Natalia Kuzenkova, Chief physician of Polyclinic No. 68, Moscow said, "Contraindications for vaccination are the following: age up to 18 years, pregnant women, lactating women, persons with serious allergic reactions, I emphasize, in serious condition; persons suffering from cancer and currently receiving immune-compression therapy."Kuzenkova said further, "In the third week after B-2, we expect the antibodies from the Gama-covid-vac vaccine to be safe in the body for about 2 years."It was further reported that on-site vaccination can now be done to older people and people with chronic diseases. In fact, they are in the highest risk group for the incidence of coronavirus. Roman Vasilkevich, one of the volunteers, decided to get vaccinated only after consulting a doctor. He has diabetes and a slight allergy."Almost all my relatives have been ill. I remained one of the few who have not yet had time to experience this disease. I do not want to be on the list of those who have been ill, so I try to avoid it as much as possible," Vasilkevich said.TV BRICS reported that six and a half million doses of the Sputnik vaccine have already been produced in Russia, and another 33 million will be released by the end of March. According to scientists, to bring the pandemic under control, it is necessary to vaccinate more than 60 per cent of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccination-against-covid-in-moscow-now-possible-in-shopping-centres-theatres-101611739987535.html
27-01-2021||World||Israeli army chief slams Iran Nuclear Deal as strategically unacceptable||Chief of the General Staff of Israeli Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi has described the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) as a deal that is unacceptable to Israel both on the strategic and operational levels.Israel itself is not party to the nuclear deal."If the 2015 nuclear deal came through, Iran would eventually be able to move towards getting a nuclear bomb, because the agreement did not include restrictions that could ultimately prevent it. Anything that looks like the current agreement or an improved version of it is bad and should not be allowed," Kohavi said in a lecture delivered at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies.The Israeli military said he had ordered for operational measures to prevent any such deal, contending that "the return to the 2015 agreement or even an improved version of its would be a bad deal from the operational and strategic points of view."The JCPOA was signed in 2015 by Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, stipulating the removal of international sanctions from Tehran in exchange for it scaling down its nuclear program.In 2018, the United States unilaterally withdrew from the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. Tehran responded by gradually abandoning its own commitments. This past December, the Iranian government passed a law aimed at achieving a full removal of sanctions via a boost of nuclear activities, specifically by increasing the levels of uranium enrichment and limiting the access of the International Atomic Energy Agency to its facilities.Last week, US State Secretary then-nominee Antony Blinken said that the United States would reciprocate Iran's resumed compliance with the nuclear deal, but would seek a broader agreement that also covers its missile program.Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded by ruling out any revisions to the original deal and insisting that Washington remove sanctions first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-army-chief-slams-iran-nuclear-deal-as-strategically-unacceptable-101611736829365.html
27-01-2021||World||China’s Zero-Tolerance Covid Approach Now Includes Anal Swabs||China is ramping up efforts to neutralize the coronavirus as new outbreaks test its already stringent pandemic strategy, with another weapon added to an arsenal of border curbs, mass testing and hard lockdowns: anal swabs.While there is no nationwide policy on use of the technique, some residents in China’s northern regions -- where the flare-up now amounts to more than 1,700 cases -- have been subjected to the anal swabs with little warning. It involves the insertion of a saline-soaked cotton swab about two-to-three centimeters into the anus, with the sample then tested for active traces of the virus.More than 1,000 schoolchildren and teachers in Beijing were given anal, throat and nose swabs last week, along with a separate antibody test, after one asymptomatic virus case was detected on campus, according to local officials.On Monday, passengers on a flight from Changchun, the capital city of Jilin province, to Beijing were told to disembark after officials discovered that someone from an area deemed as high risk for virus transmission was on board. They were then brought to a hotel where health workers took nose and anal swabs, said a passenger who asked to be identified only by his last name, Wang.Some people arriving into Beijing are being asked to undertake anal swabs as well, with one traveler who came from Hong Kong a few weeks ago telling Bloomberg News she was told to do the swab herself while in mandatory hotel quarantine. The person, who didn’t want to be identified citing privacy concerns, also had to do three nose and throat tests, one blood test and her hotel room has been tested twice.More AccurateUse of the new detection technique is based on research that traces of the virus found in the anus can last longer than in the respiratory tract, Li Tongzeng, deputy director of the respiratory and infectious disease department of Beijing You An Hospital said in an interview with state television last week. Anal swabs could be more accurate than throat and nose tests, he said, adding it was only being used on at-risk groups, including at quarantine sites.Still, there’s no evidence that virus transmission is any more common among patients who test positive in the anus area, and anal swabbing has not been conducted in other places that have successfully achieved near-elimination of the pathogen, like New Zealand.Since quelling its original outbreak in the central city of Wuhan last year, China has mounted a relentless drive to stamp out the coronavirus within its vast population, often deploying resources and powers that wouldn’t be viable or even countenanced in other countries.While Western nations like the US and UK still struggle with adequate virus testing, China is not just testing entire city populations every week, but also millions of frozen food imports and the containers that arrive in every day for minute traces of the pathogen. All incoming travelers are subject to multiple tests and lengthy quarantines.That zeal, driven in part by local government officials concerned about repercussions should their cities become the next Wuhan, has worked at keeping outbreaks in check, but the use of techniques like anal swabbing is being questioned by some experts -- even in the country’s state-run media. So far, it appears to be only being used in the north, including the capital.“I don’t understand why Beijing added anal swabs. It’s not like poking the throat. You need a certain place and the risk of such transmission routes is lower,” said Jiang Qingwu, a professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at Shanghai’s Fudan University. “Maybe they want to find remnants? It’s true that the virus can be detected there.”Scientists have found that some Covid-19 patients have active and prolonged gut viral infection, even if they don’t manifest gastrointestinal symptoms. For such people, stool samples often test positive even a week after their respiratory samples have gone negative, researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong found.Covid-19 May Cause Prolonged Gut Infection, Scientists SayTougher LockdownsChina’s capacity to endure disruption to business and everyday life in its ferocious fight against the coronavirus is a hallmark of its approach.It’s the only country that has repeatedly detected traces of the virus on frozen food imports, with efforts that include disinfecting packaging adding to delays at ports, where containers of produce have been piling up. Local consumers are shunning foreign food for fear of infection, and China’s meat imports are projected to plunge as much as 30% this year from a record in 2020.China’s lockdowns are also getting tougher, rivaling the severity of curbs placed on Wuhan a year ago even as case levels pale in comparison to elsewhere. China has reported just two Covid-19 deaths since April, and new infections at the height of the current flare-up number around 100 a day, compared with hundreds of thousands in the USCovid Lockdowns Are Spreading a Year After China Shocked WorldIn Tonghua, a city of 2 million people in Jilin province bordering North Korea, all residents have been banned from leaving their homes since Jan. 21 after 100 infections were detected. Some have complained on social media of insufficient food supplies after the sudden order, prompting an apology from local officials.There are signs that the central government is trying to encourage some moderation.An editorial from the Xinhua state news agency said Jan. 16 that local authorities should cease using the phrase “wartime measures” to describe their containment efforts. Such slogans could cause unnecessary panic, “paralyze people’s minds” and affect normal activities, the editorial said.But with the Lunar New Year holiday approaching in mid-February, when officials expect 1.7 billion trips to be taken despite pleas for people to stay home, the wartime footing is likely to continue. The country is also doubling down on vaccination, with plans to inoculate 50 million people by the holiday with locally-developed vaccines.“We don’t tolerate the virus circulating. Once we find it, we immediately quash it and outbreaks are not allowed,” said Lu Hongzhou, an infectious disease physician who advises both the central and Shanghai governments on Covid-19 treatment.“Our country has always pursued this strategy and it can’t be adjusted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-zero-tolerance-covid-approach-now-includes-anal-swabs-101611739508716.html
27-01-2021||World||Chinese vaccine trial in Dhaka fell through. Its state media blames New Delhi||Trials for Chinese Covid-19 vaccine Sinovac were halted in Bangladesh last year due to meddling by India, China’s state media has claimed in a report on Tuesday, accusing New Delhi of torpedoing Beijing's efforts to push its vaccine in Dhaka. The claim reported in the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid run by the Communist Party of China, is Beijing’s response to a report in the Hindustan Times that outlined how Bangladesh rescinded its decision to allow Covid vaccine trials last October after a last-minute demand by Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech that Dhaka co-fund the trials.The Global Times report said the trials, according to the agreement sealed in July, were to start in August. It also confirmed that according to the initial agreement, Bangladesh did not need to share the cost.“But the clinical trials were delayed until October due to the Indian government allegedly meddling in the two sides' cooperation during the period,” the report - one of the many that China’s tightly-controlled media has published to target vaccines made by India and western companies - said.According to Sinovac Biotech’s 22 September letter to the Bangladesh letter, the trials scheduled in August had to be pushed back due to delay in approvals from Dhaka.The company had, according to this letter seen by Hindustan Times, claimed that it had “reallocated our funds for the trial (in Bangladesh) to trials in other countries, since, at the time, we were uncertain about the ultimate approval of the trial in Bangladesh.”Sinovac Biotech also claimed that it had requested the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organisation set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, to fund the trials in Bangladesh but this application was rejected.“However, we are working on plans to partially rectify the funding situation by the end of October-early November, though we will still require co-funding to complete the entire trial in Bangladesh,” the company said in its letter to Bangladesh’s health minister Zahid Maleque.Maleque told news agency Reuters in October that Dhaka wouldn’t go ahead with the trial because the company’s demand for funding was contrary to their original agreement.“We are not co-funding the trial. That was not in the agreement. They never asked for money when they approached us… As per agreement, they’ll bear all expenses of the trial, they’ll give us 110,000 free vaccines and they’ll share the technology so that our pharmaceutical companies can make the vaccine,” the minister told Reuters on 13 October.In sharp contrast to the Chinese approach, New Delhi sent a gift of two million doses of Covishield vaccine to Dhaka on January 21 and facilitated a commercial contract of 30 million doses with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-meddling-torpedoed-china-s-vaccine-trials-in-bangladesh-chinese-media-101611737215412.html
27-01-2021||World||'Crazy and evil': Bill Gates surprised by pandemic conspiracies about him||Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates says he has been taken aback by the volume of "crazy" and "evil" conspiracy theories about him spreading on social media during the Covid-19 pandemic, but said on Wednesday he would like to explore what is behind them.In an interview with Reuters, Gates said the millions of online posts and "crazy conspiracy theories" about him and about top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci had likely taken hold in part because of the combination of a frightening viral pandemic and the rise of social media."Nobody would have predicted that I and Dr. Fauci would be so prominent in these really evil theories," Gates said."I'm very surprised by that. I hope it goes away."Gates, a billionaire who stepped down as chairman of Microsoft Corp in 2014, has through his philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed at least $1.75 billion to the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. That includes support for some makers of vaccines, diagnostics, and potential treatments.Since the pandemic began a year ago, millions of conspiracies have spread over the Internet, fuelling misinformation about the coronavirus, its origins and the motives of those working to fight it.They include claims that Fauci and Gates created the pandemic to try and control people, that they want to profit from the virus' spread, and that they want to use vaccines to insert trackable microchips into people."But do people really believe that stuff?," Gates asked."We're really going to have to get educated about this over the next year and understand .. how does it change peoples' behaviour and how should we have minimized this?"Excited about BidenGates praised Fauci and Francis Collins, head of the US National Institutes of Health, as "smart" and "wonderful people", and said he looked forward to seeing them able to work effectively and speak the truth under the new administration of President Joe Biden.During former President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, Gates said, it had "sometimes felt like they were the only sane people in the US government.""I'm excited about the team that Biden has picked" to tackle the health crisis, Gates said.Gates said he was also pleased that under Biden, the United States has rejoined the World Health Organization, and "that he's appointed smart people, and the fact that Dr. Fauci won't be suppressed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crazy-and-evil-bill-gates-surprised-by-pandemic-conspiracies-about-him-101611737018547.html
27-01-2021||World||China opposes retention of app ban, says move may damage bilateral cooperation||China on Wednesday opposed India’s decision to retain a ban on 59 Chinese-origin mobile phone applications, saying the move violated WTO’s non-discriminatory principles and had the potential to “further damage” bilateral cooperation. India’s electronics and IT ministry has informed the Chinese firms that the ban on 59 apps, including TikTok, would be retained following a review of the responses provided by them after the imposition of the ban last year. The ban was imposed last June on grounds of national security, months after the India-China military standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) emerged into the open. India subsequently took steps to ban a total of 267 Chinese-origin apps and to restrict Chinese investments in critical sectors of the economy. Responding to reports about the retention of the ban on 59 apps, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Ji Rong, contended that India was using national security as an “excuse” to impose restrictions on Chinese firms. “Since last year, the Indian side has repeatedly used national security as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background,” she said in a statement. “These moves in violation of WTO non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy severely damage the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. The Chinese side firmly opposes them,” Ji said. “We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation,” she added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the Chinese spokesperson’s comments.The Chinese government, Ji said, always asks Chinese companies to observe international rules and local laws and regulations when doing business overseas. “The Indian government has the responsibility to follow WTO rules and market principles and protect the legitimate rights and interests of international investors including Chinese companies,” she said. “These moves of the Indian government have also hindered the improvement of the Indian business environment and the innovative development of related Indian industries. China-India economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial by nature,” she said. Tens of thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are currently locked in a face-off in the Ladakh sector of the LAC, taking bilateral ties to an all-time low. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has said China’s unilateral efforts to alter the status quo along the LAC have significantly damaged the relationship. Earlier this month, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a minor scuffle at Naku La in Sikkim sector of the LAC, resulting in injuries on both sides. The incident highlighted the continuing tensions along the LAC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-opposes-retention-of-app-ban-says-move-may-damage-bilateral-cooperation-101611737374678.html
27-01-2021||World||Sanofi to make millions of BioNTech-Pfizer’s Covid vaccine doses||Sanofi agreed to produce millions of doses of BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc.’s coronavirus vaccine in an unusual collaboration to speed vaccination efforts.The French drugmaker will give BioNTech access to a production facility in Frankfurt, which will start to deliver doses this summer, Sanofi said in a statement Wednesday. The deal will produce more than 125 million doses of the messenger RNA vaccine for the European Union.Sanofi’s own effort to develop a vaccine with another big pharma firm, GlaxoSmithKline Plc, stumbled in clinical tests, meaning it won’t be ready by summer as expected. The production agreement allows the region to make up for some of the loss, accelerating the complex process of packaging and distributing a vaccine that needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures.Pfizer and BioNTech have been looking for ways to increase the supply of their immunization, from expanding existing plants to adding suppliers and contract manufacturers.Sanofi said that its own Covid-19 vaccine candidate will start another intermediate clinical trial in February, with the potential to reach the market in the fourth quarter. The experimental product was dealt a blow in December after a study showed it had failed to produce a strong enough response in older people, perhaps because of a formulation error.Sanofi also plans to start early clinical trials for its own messenger RNA vaccine candidate in February or March. The stock showed little change in early Paris trading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-to-make-millions-of-biontech-pfizer-s-covid-vaccine-doses-101611736159534.html
27-01-2021||World||Bill Gates outlines strategy to prevent the next pandemic||Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates outlined an ambitious plan to stop the next pandemic, calling for a global alert system, massive testing, a cadre of 3,000 “first responders” ready to spring into action and tens of billions of dollars of annual spending.“To prevent the hardship of this last year from happening again, pandemic preparedness must be taken as seriously as we take the threat of war,” Gates wrote in an annual letter Wednesday. “The world wasn’t ready for the Covid-19 pandemic. I think next time will be different.”Bill and Melinda Gates, who oversee the Seattle-based Gates Foundation, set their sights on the next crisis as the globe struggles to slow a pathogen that has infected more than 100 million people. Countries -- mainly wealthy ones -- are ramping up vaccine delivery in a race to catch up with the virus.By the time the next pandemic arrives, Gates said he hopes to see “mega‐diagnostic platforms, which could test as much as 20% of the global population every week.” The overall cost to defend the world sounds huge, though not compared with the $28 trillion estimated cost of Covid-19, he said.“The world needs to spend billions to save trillions,” he said.The success of messenger RNA vaccines in combating Covid-19 should pave the way for huge advances over the next five years in the development of new shots, he said. The technology shows potential to one day help overcome diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Gates Foundation has invested $1.75 billion in the fight against Covid-19, according to their letter.One of the significant concerns is the threat of “immunity inequality,” where only rich people have access to vaccines, Melinda Gates wrote.“Until vaccines reach everyone, new clusters of disease will keep popping up,” she said. “Those clusters will grow and spread. Schools and offices will shut down again. The cycle of inequality will continue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-outlines-strategy-to-prevent-the-next-pandemic-101611735592831.html
27-01-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccinations may be needed for cats, dogs as well: Scientists||Cats and dogs may need to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a group of scientists said in an editorial in journal Virulence, reported UK's Daily Mail.As per the scientists, the domesticated animals can become 'reservoirs' of the virus as they can get infected posing a 'significant long-term' threat for the humans with the virus continuously evolving during the transmissions.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19"It is not unthinkable that vaccination of some domesticated animal species might ... be necessary to curb the spread of the infection," the Daily mail quoted the scientists from the University of East Anglia, the Earlham Institute in Norwich and the University of Minnesota as saying in the editorial.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the US had earlier said even though some pets have reported to be tested positive for the coronavirus, the risk of animals spreading Covid-19 to people is considerably low. The CDC had warned people to be healthy around their pets and treat them as family members as close contact with humans can cause infections in pets.The minks farms in Denmark had too witnessed a surge in the number of coronavirus cases leading to mulling of the animals farmed for their fur."It makes sense to develop vaccines for pets... We really need to be prepared for any eventuality, " said Cock van Oosterhout, professor of evolutionary genetics at UEA, reported the Daily Mail.The author and expert had also pointed out that Russia has begun developing vaccines for the pets.Also Read | Health workers become 1st to get Covid-19 vaccine in NepalThe editor in chief, Kevin Tyler, was quoted as saying cats can be infected by the virus and they can be asymptomatic hence can infect the human too. "The risk is that, as long as there are these reservoirs, that it starts to pass as it did in the mink from animal to animal, and then starts to evolve animal-specific strains, but then they spill back into the human population and you end up essentially with a new virus which is related which causes the whole thing all over again," he had said.The scientists have asked the governments to take necessary actions in order to mitigate the risk of evolution of dangerous and more contagious virus mutants that will pose a greater risk for the human population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccinations-may-be-needed-for-cats-dogs-as-well-scientists-101611735265447.html
27-01-2021||World||Haqqani Network discussed forming new unit with al-Qaeda: US document||Pakistan-based Haqqani Network, blamed for the terror attack on Sikhs in Kabul in March last year, has discussed the formation of a new joint unit with al-Qaeda, according to the US treasury department. In an assessment of its work to counter terror financing and money laundering, the treasury department also provided information of close links maintained by the Afghan Taliban with al-Qaeda, even after the signing of the agreement with the US in February last year. The Haqqani Network, once famously described by former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff Admiral Mike Mullen as a “veritable arm” of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, was blamed along with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) for last year’s attack on the Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed almost 30 people.Also Read: Pak govt decides to amend Constitution for Senate election“Senior Haqqani Network figures have discussed forming a new joint unit of armed fighters in cooperation with and funded by al-Qaeda,” the treasury department informed the Pentagon in a document dated January 4 but didn’t give further details. The Haqqani Network has often been accused of targeting Indian interests in Afghanistan. Some reports have suggested the attack on the Sikhs in March last year was carried out after the terrorists were unable to target the Indian embassy in Kabul. The document described the Haqqani Network as an “organisation primarily based in North Waziristan, Pakistan” that conducts “cross-border operations into eastern Afghanistan and Kabul”. In May last year, Afghan security forces had arrested eight members of a network grouping the Haqqani Network and the Islamic State in Kabul for the attack on the Sikhs. The National Directorate of Security or the Afghan spy agency had said at the time that the group was also responsible for attacking a gathering of the Shia Hazara minority, and rocket attacks on President Ashraf Ghani’s swearing-in ceremony and on Bagram airbase. Asked specifically about any changes in financial relationships between the Taliban and terrorist groups since February 29, 2020 – the date when the Taliban and the US signed a deal – the treasury department said that as “of May 2020, the Taliban and al-Qaeda maintained a strong relationship and continued to meet regularly”. The treasury department also said that, during the past year, al-Qaeda was “gaining strength in Afghanistan while continuing to operate with the Taliban under the Taliban’s protection”. The assessment assumes significance in light of the new US administration’s decision to review the deal with the Taliban to establish whether the Afghan group has cut its ties with al-Qaeda and other terror groups and is taking steps to reduce violence. The treasury department concluded that al-Qaeda “capitalizes on its relationship with the Taliban through its network of mentors and advisers who are embedded with the Taliban, providing advice, guidance, and financial support”. It further said that “elements of al-Qaeda, including affiliate al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan, such as Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), continue to use the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region as a safe haven”. AQIS, which has sought to focus on India and Jammu and Kashmir, “likely receives funding from al-Qaeda senior leadership”, the treasury department said. The treasury department further concluded that the core of the Islamic State has used hawala networks to transfer funds from overseas, and that the Khorasan unit of Islamic State or ISIS-K, which is based in Afghanistan, has “cultivated relationships with particular hawaladars who store tens of thousands of dollars for the group”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haqqani-network-discussed-forming-new-unit-with-al-qaeda-us-document-101611734314505.html

If we will not take, then who will take this vaccine? We can’t say we will not take this as we are doctors,” said Dr. Poonam Sharma.Hospital director Dr. Dinesh Kafle said 300 staffers were set to get the vaccine on Wednesday and the remaining 2,000 within a week.Nepal received as a gift from neighboring India 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine manufactured under license by the Serum Institute of India.It's aiming to get 72% of its 30 million people vaccinated within three months and is making the two-dose vaccine free to citizens.On the first day, 12,000 doctors, nurses, custodians, ambulance drivers and other health workers will be vaccinated, with the number increasing in the next few days, Health Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said. The 120 vaccination centers in use will be doubled.It plans to vaccinate 430,000 health workers in the next 10 days before expanding the campaign and is working to get more shipments.Nepal has reported 270,092 cases of coronavirus infection and 2,017 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-workers-become-1st-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-nepal-101611734086530.html
27-01-2021||World||Green shift brings blackout risk to world’s biggest power grid||As biting cold caused power demand to surge across western Europe on January 8, the continent’s power network came close to a massive blackout.Europe’s grid, which is usually connected from Lisbon to Istanbul, split into two as the northwest and southeast regions struggled to keep the same frequency. The problem originated in Croatia and led to the equivalent of 200,000 households losing power across Europe. Supply to industrial sites was cut in France and Italy.While this event hasn’t been linked to a surge in renewable electricity, as Europe replaces big coal and nuclear stations with thousands of smaller wind and solar units -- just as sectors electrify to reduce emissions -- incidents like this will become more frequent.“It is not a question about if a blackout in more than one European region will happen, it is only a question of when it will happen,” said Stefan Zach, head of communications at Austrian utility EVN AG.Transmission grids need to stay at a frequency of 50 hertz to operate smoothly and any deviations can damage equipment that’s connected. Had the frequency swings not been reduced within minutes, it could have caused damage across the entire European high voltage network, potentially causing blackouts for millions.A fault at a substation that caused overloading on other parts of Croatia’s grid has been identified as the cause of the issue, network operators concluded Tuesday.Large amounts of intermittent electricity create huge swings in supply which the grid has to be able to cope with. The issue isn’t confined to Europe. Australia has had teething problems in the transition to a cleaner grid. Wind power was blamed for a blackout in 2016 that cut power to 850,000 homes. The nation is looking to batteries as a solution and was the first country to install a 100 megawatt megabattery in 2017.Read more about the race to build megabatteries hereCalifornia gets about a third of its generation from renewables. Last summer record-breaking heat gripping the state and electricity supplies grew strained in the evenings, as solar plants stopped generating for the day. Grid managers resorted to rolling blackouts for the first time since the state’s electricity crisis in 2000 and 2001. Utilities had begun installing big batteries to take up some of the slack, but not fast enough.“The problem isn’t posed by growing green electricity directly but by shrinking conventional capacity,” said Eglantine Kuenle, chief electricity systems modeler at the EWI Institute of Energy Economics at Cologne University. “The upshot is a gap in secure power generation and grid balancing that must be fixed.”Europe hasn’t come this close to a major blackout since 2006 when more than 15 million households were plunged into darkness for hours. Since that, Europe’s grid operators have put in automatic responses like splitting the grid and triggering standby generation or demand reduction.Spinning turbines of thermal plants connected to the grid create kinetic energy called inertia which helps keep the grid at the right frequency. This spinning can’t be created by wind turbines or solar panels and policy makers need to find ways to incentivize other forms of energy storage or flexible output.Germany is the biggest producer of green power in Europe. The nation is culling a quarter of coal and nuclear power capacity next year, a gap it will need to plug. Instead of building a huge fleet of batteries, Germany plans to rely more on more its neighbors, importing power along huge cables.The event shows that problems in one nation will rapidly cascade between states as they become more reliant on their neighbors for power, said Wolfgang Kroeger, a professor at the ETH university’s Risk Center in Zurich.Continental Europe was separated into two areas due to “outages of several transmission network elements in a very short time,” according to Entsoe, the association of grid operators. “Further detailed investigation” is ongoing.“Longer, harder to fix disturbances that rip across countries are a real threat,” said Kroeger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-shift-brings-blackout-risk-to-world-s-biggest-power-grid-101611733610410.html
27-01-2021||World||Pak govt decides to amend Constitution for Senate election||The Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote.The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan.“The government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,” Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting.He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes.Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past.“The government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,” he said.Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court.Awan said the government had already laid two bills — Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill — in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot.The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament.It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper.Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-govt-decides-to-amend-constitution-for-senate-election-101611731086729.html

It is the most active of dozens of Indonesian volcanoes and has repeatedly erupted with lava and gas clouds recently.Merapi's last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people.Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-volcano-unleashes-river-of-lava-in-new-eruption-101611728421894.html

Officials believe the insurgents would not target vaccine teams as they would not be going door-to-door.Announcing the funding, an Afghan health official said the programme would cover the 20% of the country's 38 million population.The COVAX programme is a global scheme to vaccinate people in poor and middle income countries against the coronavirus. It aims to deliver at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 to cover 20% of the most vulnerable people in 91 poor and middle-income countries.Afghanistan's Deputy Health Minister Waheed Majroh told journalists it was going to take six months to get the vaccines but authorities were in discussions to get them earlier.Afghanistan has registered 54,854 infections and 2,390 deaths - but experts say cases are significantly underreported due to low testing and limited access to medical facilities in the war-torn country.Aside from COVAX, the country has also received a pledge of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, Dr Ghulam Dastagir Nazari, head of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation at Afghanistan's health ministry, told Reuters."The AstraZeneca brand which is manufactured in India will arrive soon in Afghanistan," Nazari said, adding that the government was only concerned about the WHO approval of the vaccine and that the pre-qualification process has already started.An Indian government source confirmed that 500,000 doses had been set aside for Afghanistan and another official said the first batch of vaccines would land in February, though Kabul had not yet adopted the protocols to administer them.The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also said they would finance vaccines for another 20% of the population by the end of 2022, health ministry spokeswoman Masouma Jafari told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-backs-vaccine-drive-as-afghan-govt-receives-112-million-funding-pledge-101611727912243.html

By late evening, he had spoken to foreign ministers of Mexico, Japan and South Korea, according to his tweets and state department readouts.In calls with Japan’s Toshimitsu Motegi and South Korea’s Kang Kyung-wha, Blinken said US relations with their countries were the “cornerstone” and “linchpin” of “peace, security, and prosperity for a free and open Indo-Pacific region” and across the world, according to state department readouts.Canada and Mexico were also first calls placed by President Joe Biden to his counterparts, reflecting a pattern.But President Biden also called Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, and broached subjects his predecessor Donald Trump had refused to. Biden conveyed strong US support for Ukraine’s sovereignty, raised recent hacking of US government computer networks (for which intelligence agencies suspected Russia), interference in the 2016 US elections, and reports of Russian bounties on American soldiers in Afghanistan.“President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,” the White House said in a statement on their call.Upon assuming office, Blinken tweeted, “American leadership matters, and we have a unique ability to bring other countries together to meet the challenges and opportunities of our time.”He wrote in another post: “We will revitalise American diplomacy to advance our interests and values in the world as it is – not as it was.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-secretary-of-state-blinken-says-committed-to-a-free-indopacific-101611727893981.html
27-01-2021||World||Republicans signal support for Trump in Senate impeachment trial||US Senate Republicans on Tuesday signalled they were ready to hand former president Donald Trump another acquittal when most of them rallied behind a motion that argued his impeachment trial was unconstitutional.The proposal, moved by Republican Senator Rand Paul, was defeated in a 45-55 vote in the Democratic-led 100-member Senate, which cleared the way for the trial to proceed. But the voting pattern revealed that Trump may eventually be acquitted, as a conviction requires a supermajority.Paul had argued that the trial of Trump as a private citizen violated the constitution.“Forty-five votes means the impeachment trial is dead on arrival,” Paul told reporters after the vote. “We’re excited about it. It’s one of the few times in Washington where a loss is actually a victory.”At least 17 Republicans senators will have vote with the 50 Democrats in the impeachment trial in the evenly divided Senate to achieve a two-third supermajority to convict the former president, who is charged with incitement of insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6.In a possible sign of things to come, only five Republican senators — Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Pat Toomey and Lisa Murkowski— broke with the party on Tuesday and voted against Paul’s motion. The remaining 45 voted in support of the proposal, including Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate who has been among the most outspoken of Trump’s critics since January 6, saying the rioters had been “provoked by the president and other powerful people”.They may choose to vote differently in the trial, experts have warned, but chances of that were said to be slim.The vote took place shortly after the 100 senators had been sworn in as jurors for the impeachment trial, which is slated to start on February 9.Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on January 13, a week after the storming of the US Capitol, on the solitary charge of incitement of insurrection. He is the only US president impeached twice and the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office. Trump was acquitted the last time by a Republican-led Senate, in January 2020. If he was convicted, he would have had to leave office. This time, as he is out of power already, a conviction would disqualify him from holding a public office in future.Later Tuesday, Senator Patrick Leaky, the Democrat who is presiding over the impeachment trial, was taken briefly to hospital “out of an abundance of caution” after he felt unwell, spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-signal-support-for-trump-in-senate-impeachment-trial-101611726813868.html
27-01-2021||World||China, India's Covid-19 vaccinations to stretch to late 2022: Study||Covid-19 vaccination programmes in China and India will stretch until late 2022 due to the sheer size of their population, and more than 85 poor countries will not have widespread access to vaccines before 2023, a study showed on Wednesday.While rapid development of vaccines has raised hopes for an end to the year-long pandemic, concerns over unequal distribution have also mounted due to production problems and large bilateral deals between wealthy countries and drug makers.US President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that the United States aims to secure an additional 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech and Moderna Inc by summer.In Europe, the European Commission is setting up a proposal to restrict Covid-19 vaccine exports amid frustration over delays in deliveries of AstraZeneca's vaccine and other supply problems."Most developing countries will not have widespread access to the shots before 2023 at the earliest," Agathe Demarais, director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, the research division of the Economist Group, said in its study."Some of these countries—particularly poorer ones with a young demographic profile—may well lose the motivation to distribute vaccines, especially if the disease has spread widely or if the associated costs prove too high."Most countries in Africa are unlikely to get widespread vaccination coverage until early 2023, while many Asian countries will have broad access to vaccines by late 2022.The report said vaccine deliveries to poor countries by global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX, backed by the World Health Organization, may be slow due to delays in delivery to wealthy nations first and poor infrastructure in the developing world.COVAX said 1.8 billion doses would be supplied to 92 poorer countries in 2021 and that would correspond to approximately 27% coverage of populations in those countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-india-s-covid-19-vaccinations-to-stretch-to-late-2022-study-101611723110430.html
27-01-2021||World||UK could introduce hotel quarantine for high-risk arrivals||The UK government will introduce a limited hotel quarantine system for passengers arriving from the highest-risk countries, according to a person familiar with the matter.The move is aimed at curbing the spread of new variants of coronavirus that could prove resistant to vaccines, but is expected to apply to arrivals from countries with new forms of the virus, such as South Africa and Brazil.Boris Johnson’s government has so far stopped short of imposing a blanket quarantine system on all arrivals, amid concern about a lack of hotel space near airports and the consequences for a travel industry already on its knees.The decision was made by ministers at a meeting Tuesday night, where they discussed a range of options for tightening border controls. It came as the UK recorded more than 100,000 deaths from coronavirus, the first European country to reach the milestone.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Sunday the government wanted to ensure that new, more virulent variants would not derail Britain’s vaccination program -- which has so far seen more than 6.8 million people receive a first dose.The new hotel quarantine policy will only affect Britons arriving from high-risk countries, as travel bans are already in place for non-UK visitors.The Labour opposition party said the move didn’t go far enough and would leave “gaping holes in our nation’s defences against different strains of the virus emerging around the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-could-introduce-hotel-quarantine-for-high-risk-arrivals-101611709423759.html
27-01-2021||World||No local Covid-19 cases in Australia for 10 days in a row||Australia is on track for a 10th day of no new local COVID-19 cases on Wednesday with its most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) hoping to ease coronavirus restrictions this week after controlling a fast-spreading cluster.Australia's most populous state NSW has recorded no local cases for 10 days after low single digit numbers earlier in January.Victoria state, which is hosting the Australia Open tennis tournament, has gone three weeks without a local case.Other states and territories which have mostly been COVID-free, some for months, will report daily case numbers later on Wednesday, but are expected to report zero local infections.Australia's success in curbing small outbreaks, with a total 22,000 local cases since March 2020 and 909 deaths, comes at a time when global coronavirus cases are edging towards 100 million with the death toll surpassing 2 million.An advertising campaign will be launched later on Wednesday to encourage people to take the COVID-19 vaccine after the country's regulator this week approved the Pfizer-BioNtech shot. A rollout is expected in late-February.NSW made masks mandatory in indoor venues such as shopping centres and cinemas, imposed a cap on public gatherings while suspending dance floors even for night clubs to successfully curb outbreaks in Sydney's northern beaches and western suburbs.The outbreaks saw other states and territories close borders or restrict travel from NSW.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklien told the Australian Broadcasting Corp she hoped to receive medical advice later in the day that would allow her to ease restrictions this week."In New South Wales our policy always is don’t keep restrictions or burden our citizens a day longer than you need to. I'm hoping to have confirmation of advice that allows us to announce that later this week," she said.Despite its relative success in handling the pandemic, Australia's international borders will likely remain shut to non-citizens this year although there may be exclusive travel arrangements called "bubbles" with its South Pacific neighbours.Australia had a one-way "travel bubble" with New Zealand where those arriving from the latter didn't have to quarantine, but that arrangement was suspended for 72 hours on Monday after a highly infectious coronavirus strain was found in New Zealand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-local-covid-19-cases-in-australia-for-10-days-in-a-row-101611708796428.html

With these additional doses, the US will have enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of this summer."The Biden-Harris Administration will increase overall, weekly vaccine supply to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses."This increase of 1.4 million doses per week will allow millions more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated. The Administration is committing to maintaining this as the minimum supply level for the next three weeks," the release further said.Earlier in the day, US President Joe Biden announced that further measures would be undertaken to ramp up the vaccination campaign in the country."After review of current vaccines supplies and manufacturing plans, I can announce that we will increase overall weekly vaccination distributions to states, tribes and territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses starting next week," Biden said during a White House press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-buy-200-million-additional-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101611706538940.html
27-01-2021||World||Joe Biden targets housing, private prisons in first equality moves||President Joe Biden took a series of high-profile measures intended to improve racial equity across American society, including combating discrimination in housing policies and ending the use of private prisons.In a package of four directives on Tuesday, Biden delivered his first policy response to nationwide protests over institutionalized racism. The measures joined a growing list of executive actions aimed at advancing his campaign promises and rolling back former President Donald Trump’s policies.“Advancing equity has to be everyone’s job,” Biden said Tuesday in remarks at the White House before signing three memoranda and an executive order. Systemic racism, he said, has “plagued our nation for far, far too long.”One memo directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to review and change policies from the Trump administration that undermined protections under the Fair Housing Act, the White House said.Biden wants to end mass incarceration, which disproportionately affects people of color, according to the White House. He ordered the attorney general not to renew contracts with privately operated detention facilities -- reversing the Trump administration’s approach -- saying those prisons profit from keeping inmates in less safe conditions.The move may affect the country’s two largest operators of private prisons, GEO Group Inc. and CoreCivic Inc., which saw their share prices gain significantly after Trump was elected in 2016. Trump ended an Obama-era prohibition on the Justice Department’s use of private prisons and also expanded detention by federal immigration authorities.Both companies slipped on the news. GEO Group fell about 8%, to $7.41, its lowest since March 11, 2009. CoreCivic fell about 6% to $6.26, its lowest price since Nov. 12, after Trump lost re-election.GEO and CoreCivic have sought to diversify from federal contracts by signing deals with states to build and operate prisons.Another Biden memo aims to empower Native American tribal self-determination, and another targets xenophobia against Asian Americans. The action directs the Department of Health and Human Services to consider issuing guidance to advance language access to the Asian American community in the federal government’s response to Covid-19.The director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, Susan Rice, said at a briefing earlier Tuesday that Biden also intends to address moves by Republican-led state legislatures to roll back voting expansions that contributed to Trump’s loss.“It’s a matter of real concern because we ought to be in the business of encouraging and enabling all Americans who are eligible to vote, to be able to vote,” she said.The killings last year of Black people at the hands of law enforcement -- including George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky -- sparked protests that swept the country, drawing more attention to deep-seated racial disparities.Biden said Floyd’s death was “the knee on the neck of justice.”“In my view, it marked a turning point in this country’s attitude toward racial justice,” he said.Biden also has indicated he wants to close the racial wealth gap in the U.S., and his economic team includes officials with experience on that issue. He hasn’t proposed specific policies on how to narrow the gap.The coronavirus pandemic has drawn more attention to health and economic disparities that are affecting Black, Latino and Native American populations.The end of 2020 brought the sharpest rise in the U.S. poverty rate since the 1960s, and disproportionately affected Black Americans, according to a study released Monday Economists Bruce Meyer, from the University of Chicago, and James Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame. The poverty rate for Black Americans is estimated to have jumped by 5.4 percentage points, or by 2.4 million individuals.By focusing on racial discrimination, Biden is taking steps to deliver for the people who helped him win the White House. Black voters in particular helped Biden secure the Democratic party’s nomination and then the presidency in November, as well as two Senate seats for Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-targets-housing-private-prisons-in-first-equality-moves-101611704926877.html
27-01-2021||World||US 'actively looking' at mandating Covid-19 testing for domestic air travel||The Biden administration is "actively looking" at expanding mandatory Covid-19 testing to travelers on US domestic flights, a senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said on Tuesday.On a call with reporters, Dr. Marty Cetron, director for the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at CDC, was asked about whether new domestic travel testing requirements might be employed. Cetron replied that there were "conversations that are ongoing and looking at what the types and locations of testing might be... We're actively looking at it."Last week, President Joe Biden directed U.S. agencies to make recommendations to "impose additional public health measures for domestic travel" and to consider new requirements for people crossing land borders. Reuters reported Friday that administration officials said that could include requiring negative Covid-19 tests before flying domestically."We realize that there's been a dramatic evolution and increase in both testing platforms and testing capacity. I think this is a really important part of our toolkit to combat this pandemic," Cetron said.On Tuesday, new CDC rules took effect requiring nearly all international air travelers aged 2 and older to present a negative coronavirus test taken within three calendar days of travel or proof of Covid-19 recovery to enter the United States.In discussions with airline officials, the CDC has said it is considering requiring domestic testing, too. Some airline officials worry such requirements could curtail already weak demand for air travel.The CDC said Sunday it would not grant waivers to exempt travelers from some countries with limited testing capacity. Numerous U.S. airlines had sought waivers.Acting Assistant Secretary of State Ian Brownlee told reporters CDC was "not at this time issuing federal quarantine orders" but recommends self-quarantining for seven days after returning from a trip and getting post-arrival Covid-19 tests.Brownlee said the "main message to U.S. citizens considering travel abroad remains the same: Seriously reconsider going overseas right now. If you're overseas right now, it's going to be harder to come home for a while."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-actively-looking-at-mandating-covid-19-testing-for-domestic-air-travel-101611704276870.html

Strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance."Tirumurti said that the world needs to consequently prioritise our specific aspect of peacebuilding which will have the highest impact in the post-conflict situations so that the funds are utilized to the optimum.Further talking about India's role at the world stage, he said, "India has always played a constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership with developing countries particularly with Africa and Asia. India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pledges-usd-150-000-for-un-peacebuilding-101611704350860.html
27-01-2021||World||100 million cases worldwide, as US seeks to reset its Covid fight||More than 100 million Covid-19 cases have now been recorded worldwide, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday, as newly-inaugurated President Joe Biden pledged to ramp up the United States's struggling vaccine program.The number of cases, compiled from data provided by national health agencies, represents just a fraction of the real infections as the coronavirus has spread around the globe.The United States, which passed 25 million confirmed cases last weekend, remains the country with the largest outbreak -- and the largest death toll of over 420,000.Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump's presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask-wearing and socializing.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected.""This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole," he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire population -- by early fall.In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was "hard to compute" the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 Covid-19 deaths.But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, "did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life."- 'Drastic measures' -The UK has struggled to counter a brutal third wave blamed on a new variant that emerged there before Christmas before spreading to dozens of countries around the world.Neighboring Ireland said Tuesday it would enact mandatory travel quarantines for the first time, as well extending its third national lockdown until March 5.Among other European nations looking to strengthen border controls was Germany, which said it is considering almost completely halting flights into the country."The danger from the numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures," Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild newspaper.Iceland meanwhile started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses.The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday.More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down."You don't capitulate to people who smash shop windows," Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters "scum."Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures.With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified.Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries."Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF). "And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations."- 'Vaccine nationalism' -Europe's vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments -- a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes.AstraZeneca's CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit.The widening gap for vaccine supplies between rich and poor countries led both South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to lash out at "vaccine nationalism."Ramaphosa told the WEF that low- and middle-income countries were being shouldered aside by wealthier nations able to acquire "up to four times what their population needs."The row over access to vaccines at the WEF -- normally held at the Swiss ski resort of Davos -- comes as the pandemic compounds economic inequality.Despite Lebanon being under one of the world's strictest lockdowns, father-of-six Omar Qarhani told AFP he was still selling vegetables on the side of a road in Tripoli because he is desperate to support his family."I'm not scared of corona -- what scares me is being in need and poverty," he said.Brazil banned flights from South Africa -- both countries have their own new variants -- while virus deaths in Mexico passed the 150,000 mark on Monday just a day after President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he tested positive.The IMF now predicts a "cumulative output loss" of $22 trillion -- the equivalent of the entire US economy -- over 2020-25.Nevertheless, optimism that vaccines will bring the pandemic under control and allow economic activity to resume, coupled with stimulus in major economies, boosted the IMF's growth forecast this year to 5.5 percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-million-cases-worldwide-as-us-seeks-to-reset-its-covid-fight-101611704384843.html
27-01-2021||World||Britain readies for painful lessons as Covid-19 death toll crosses 100,000||(Bloomberg) -- It’s almost exactly a year since coronavirus made its first impression on the UK, when a government-chartered plane flew 83 British passengers home from Wuhan to a wind-swept military airfield west of London.Now in the midst of its third national lockdown, the UK has hit the devastating milestone of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19.For Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the country he leads, it’s a sobering moment. Fatalities are now already five times the 20,000 figure Johnson’s chief scientist once said would represent a “good outcome” for Britain.“It’s hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic,” Johnson said in a televised press conference on Tuesday evening. “I am deeply sorry for every life that has been lost.”While Johnson vowed to learn lessons once the virus is beaten, he offered few answers to the question of what went so wrong over the past year. How did the UK end up with the fifth highest death toll in the world, despite its state-run health service, renowned scientists, and the natural advantages of an island for managing the flow of people?More pressingly, the prime minister faces questions over the future. The government will need to make the most of the head start it has gained over other European nations in vaccinating its people.The political stakes are high: Johnson will be put to the test in local and mayoral elections later this year. He also faces a showdown with Scottish nationalists, and with his own increasingly jumpy Conservative colleagues over the restrictions.The choices confronting Johnson on when to turn off state support for businesses, and how to pay the bill, will determine what kind of an economy is left to revive once the lockdown wreckage has been cleared away.Much of it will come back to the premier’s character. In private his colleagues remark how he makes fewer jokes nowadays, and has struck a more serious tone since the start of the year. Stung by criticism that he has over-promised on when the crisis will be over, he’s now more cautious about a timetable for easing the lockdown.Last March, Johnson breezily brushed aside the threat, openly joking about shaking hands with staff in a hospital treating Covid patients. In April, he was admitted into intensive care with the virus.Major events such as soccer matches and the Cheltenham horse races went ahead, and the premier – a libertarian and a crowd pleaser by nature – was reluctant to curtail individual freedoms.Slow startOfficials argued that locking down the country too soon would be a mistake – people would get tired of the restrictions and start to break the rules, they said. Yet at the same time, countries such as Australia and New Zealand – which are now almost Covid-free with comparatively low fatalities – quarantined all passengers on arrival.“We just dithered too much and didn’t take it seriously enough at the beginning,” Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist at Warwick Medical School, said in an interview. Other countries “went in hard, they went in fast, they didn’t prevaricate.”One of the biggest problems was the UK’s inability to run an effective test and trace operation to keep track of infections and ensure patients didn’t spread the disease.In the early months of the pandemic, the UK had to give up trying to test people because its maximum testing capacity of just 2,000 a day was nowhere near enough as the virus spread exponentially.A 22 billion-pound ($30.2 billion) mission eventually ramped up the testing and tracing capacity to rates that are among the highest in the world. Earlier this month, 665,000 Covid tests were carried out in one day in the UK But the essential follow-up process of tracing contacts didn’t reach enough people to be effective, although it has improved.British officials insist they simply did not know how helpful mask-wearing would be – even though other countries adopted the policy far earlier. Nor was it clear to the government how easily coronavirus spread among people without symptoms.Even as the death toll passed 100,000, a policy to isolate arriving passengers in hotels was still being debated.Almost 3.7 million people in the UK have tested positive – the fifth largest caseload worldwide and about half a million more than France. The UK has suffered almost twice the number of deaths as Spain and Germany. According to analysis from Johns Hopkins University, the UK ranks fourth in deaths per 100,000 people in the population of any country.Economic carnageIn the early days, Britain won praise from economists for its comprehensive and coordinated approach to supporting the economy.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak rolled out about 300 billion pounds of measures to support companies and prop up workers’ wages, while the Bank of England slashed interest rates to a record low 0.1% and doubled its bond-buying program.None of this stopped the UK suffering its deepest recession since the Great Frost of 1709. Recent figures show the British economy is the worst performing among the Group of Seven nations, with output still about 9% below its pre-Covid level. Most economists and the Bank of England expect the economy to contract again.Now Johnson is pinning his hopes on an ambitious vaccination program. A successful rollout would give the government a shot at political redemption, too, and so far the progress has been rapid.“There is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccines,” Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, told Bloomberg. With a comprehensive test-and-trace program, and assuming the vaccines are as effective as they seem, “you would hope we would be in a much better position next winter.”The UK has administered 6.85 million first doses of the AstraZeneca Plc and Pfizer Inc. vaccine. That puts it largely on target to offer the shot to 15 million of the most vulnerable people by mid-February, and far ahead of the U.S. and Europe. Only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have deployed more vaccines per capita.But there’s another cloud hanging over Britain’s battle with the pandemic: Its own mutant strain of the virus.The recent wave of hospitalizations has been linked to the new variant B.1.1.7 of coronavirus that appears to spread more quickly and officials now believe may be more than 30% deadlier than the original strain. On Tuesday, the government’s medical experts warned the death toll will continue to mount and will only start to fall slowly.Johnson, when pressed on the government’s missteps at Tuesday’s press conference, said: “We truly did everything we could, and continue to do everything we can, to minimize loss of life and to minimize suffering.”Chaand Nagpaul, from the British Medical Association, said the UK “must not and will not forget this day” and needs to understand what went wrong. “As the first nation in Europe to have reached this dark death toll, we must learn the lessons of this tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-readies-for-painful-lessons-as-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-100000-101611702026345.html
27-01-2021||World||Biden says US will have enough Covid vaccines for entire population||The US government is buying an additional 200 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine and will have enough to inoculate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire US population -- by the end of summer or early fall, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.An additional 100 million doses of vaccine are being bought from Pfizer and an additional 100 million doses from Moderna, the two companies whose vaccines have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, Biden told reporters at the White House."Not in hand yet, but ordered," he said. "We expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer."The latest purchase would take the total number of Covid-19 doses ordered by the government to 600 million, he said."This is enough vaccine to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of the summer, beginning of the fall," the president said.Biden has pledged to provide 100 million Covid vaccine shots in his first 100 days in office and he said the administration was increasing its overall weekly vaccine supply to states and territories.It is increasing the supply from 8.6 million doses a week to a minimum of 10 million doses."This is going to allow millions of more Americans to get vaccinated sooner than previously anticipated," he said.Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge and the vaccine program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected."Ending the coronavirus pandemic would require a "war-time effort," he said."More than 400,000 Americans have already died," he said. "This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole."Biden also said "things are going to continue to get worse before they get better.""The death toll, experts tell us, is likely to top 500,000 by the end of next month, this February. And cases will continue to mount," he added."We didn't get into this mess overnight. It's going to take months for us to turn things around. But let me be equally clear. We're going to get through this. We will defeat this pandemic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-us-will-have-enough-covid-vaccines-for-entire-population-101611701742867.html
27-01-2021||World||US prez Biden, Vladimir Putin speak over phone, discuss nuke treaty, Navalny||US President Joe Biden spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday for the first time since taking office and raised concerns about Russian activities including the treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, the White House said.A White House statement said the two leaders agreed to have their teams work urgently to complete the extension of the New START arms control treaty between the United States and Russia by Feb. 5, when the current pact expires.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki announced the phone call between the two leaders at her daily briefing. It came as Biden adjusts US policy in a more robust way toward Russia after his predecessor, Donald Trump refused to take on Putin directly.At the same time, Biden sought to repair the strained alliance between the United States and Europe by stressing in a phone call with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Washington would abide by the NATO treaty's mutual defense pact."President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to collective defense under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and underscored his commitment to strengthening transatlantic security," a White House statement said.In the Putin phone call, Psaki said, topics included Biden's proposal to extend the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia for five years and "strong (US) support for Ukraine sovereignty" in the face of ongoing Russian aggression.The arms control treaty limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each.Psaki said Biden also raised the case of Navalny, who was jailed after his return to Moscow from Germany last week, a case that has raised tension between Russia and the United States.Biden further voiced concern to Putin about what the White House called interference in the 2020 presidential election, as well as the massive Solar Winds cyber hack blamed on Moscow and reports that Russians offered bounties to Taliban insurgents for killing US troops in Afghanistan.Biden's phone call with Stoltenberg came a day after he spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel."The president thanked the (NATO) secretary general for his steadfast leadership of the alliance, and conveyed his intention to consult and work with allies on the full range of shared security concerns, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and Russia," the White House statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-biden-vladimir-putin-speak-over-phone-discuss-nuke-treaty-navalny-101611692792461.html

27-01-2021||India||Covaxin effective on UK virus strain of Covid-19, says ICMR||An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study on Covaxin shows a comparable neutralization activity of the vaccinated individuals against UK-variant strain.The ICMR's National Institute of Virology scientist performed the plaque reduction neutralization test using sera collected from the 26 recipients of Bharat Biotech's coronavirus vaccine (COVAXIN) against UK-variant strain."A comparable neutralization activity of the vaccinated individuals sera showed against UK-variant and the heterologous strain with similar efficiency dispel the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape," stated document appeared in bioRxiv in a pre-print version."We successfully isolated and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 from UK returnees in India with all signature mutations of the UK-variant," noted the NIV- Pune scientist."We present the neutralizing antibodies (Nab) titers to underline the efficacy of Covaxin vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 UK-variant and one of the heterologous strains. Sera collected from 38 vaccine recipients, who received Covaxin vaccine-candidate in phase-II trial had equivalent NAb titers to homologous strain and two heterologous strains with the characteristic substitution of the UK-variant," said the authors."The median ratio of 50 per cent neutralization of sera was found to be 0.8 and 0.9 when compared with earlier detected SARS CoV-2 strains against mutant UK strain," they said."Our study evidently highlighted comparable neutralization activity of vaccinated individuals sera against variant as well as heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains.""Importantly, sera from the vaccine recipients could neutralise the UK-variant strains discounting the uncertainty around potential escape. It was reassuring from the neutralizing antibodies data generated in our laboratory that the indigenous Covaxin following its rollout in the vaccination program, could be expected to work against the new UK-variant. It is unlikely that the mutation would be able to dampen the potential benefits of the vaccine in concern," it said.The ICMR scientist mentioned that they have reported the development of an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Covaxin) which elicited remarkable neutralizing antibody response in phase I clinical trial against homologous, and two heterologous strains from the unclassified cluster.In phase II clinical trial, the vaccine candidate showed noteworthy results with plaque reduction neutralization test. The sero-conversion rate with neutralizing antibodies following vaccination with Covaxin was 99.6 per cent.It is pertinent to note that the rapid surge in SARS-CoV-2 cases due to the Variant of Concern (VOC) in the United Kingdom (UK) raised concerns in several countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-effective-on-uk-virus-strain-of-covid-19-says-icmr-101611737406620.html
27-01-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee to meet select TMC leaders amid dissent among section of MLAs||Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee has called the party’s Parliamentarians and a section of legislators and district leaders for an important meeting at her residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata on Friday, party leaders said Wednesday.The closed-door meeting is being described by party leaders as crucial in view of the dissent among a section of lawmakers. Some have spoken against the TMC while a few have joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the run up to the assembly polls due in April-May.The most prominent among those who switched allegiance is former transport minister Suvendu Adhikari. Two more ministers, Rajib Banerjee and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, a former Indian cricketer, have quit the cabinet. Both were elected from Howrah district. Shukla left the TMC as well. A third lawmaker from Howrah, Vaishali Dalmiya, was expelled last week on disciplinary grounds.Over the past few days, Banerjee made fresh organizational changes in some district units and frontal organisations. Significant among these is the appointment of coordinators for the five assembly constituencies in East Midnapore district, the home turf of Adhikari who joined the BJP on December 19 with six sitting MLAs, the Lok Sabha MP from Burdwan East and around 20 district TMC leaders.“On January 25, Banerjee appointed coordinators for Tamluk, Panskura East, Kanthi North, Khejuri and Egra assembly segments,” a TMC leader said on condition of anonymity.“On the same day, she appointed 16 vice-presidents, 25 general secretaries and 15 secretaries for the revamped East Midnapore district committee,” he added.Although Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari has been removed from the post of president of the district committee he and his elder son Dibyendu are still Lok Sabha members from the district. In a bid to counter any move by Adhikari to induct more leaders from the TMC, Banerjee has revamped 30 community block committees as well.Since Banerjee will contest the Nandigram seat from where Adhikari was elected in 2016, the TMC has started making preparations. Banerjee has asked senior state leader and panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee to camp in Nandigram next month and carry out a survey of the party's organizational strengths and weaknesses in every community block.“By convening the meeting at her residence Banerjee has made it clear that she wants to send a message. The party’s most crucial decisions have been taken at her residence. Had she intended to address all leaders she would have called them somewhere else. Her residence does not have the space to accommodate all MLAs and district leaders,” said a TMC MP who has been asked to attend the meeting.The BJP is also busy making preparations for the month-end visit of Union home minister Amit Shah. He will visit two districts, North 24 Parganas and Howrah, on January 30 and 31.In North 24 Parganas, Shah will lead a roadshow at Thakurnagar where the headquarters of the Dalit Matua community is located. He will also visit the temple of the Matuas who have demanded implementation of the new citizenship law. BJP’s Shantanu Thakur, a Matua leader, won the Bangaon Lok Sabha seat in 2019, defeating his relative and TMC’s then sitting MP Mamata Bala Thakur. The chief minister has sworn that she will not let the citizenship law be implemented in Bengal.In Howrah, Shah is scheduled to address a rally at Domjur, the constituency of former forest minister Rajib Banerjee. He has won the seat twice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-to-meet-select-tmc-leaders-amid-dissent-among-section-of-mlas-101611769533785.html
27-01-2021||India||Jagan Reddy announces cash incentives for unanimous polls to gram panchayats||With the Supreme Court refusing to stall the elections to local bodies in Andhra Pradesh, the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government has now turned its attention on capturing as many gram panchayats as possible unanimously without having to conduct the elections.As part of the strategy, the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday issued an order announcing hefty cash incentives to be given to gram panchayats where sarpanches and ward members are elected unanimously without any contest.According to the order (GO No. 34), the state government will pay a cash incentive ranging from a minimum of ₹5 lakh for a gram panchayat with population of less than 2,000 to a maximum of ₹20 lakh for each gram panchayat with a population of more than 10,000, if the elections are unanimous.“This is not a new practice. It has been there in Andhra Pradesh since 2001. Even in other states like Telangana, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, it exists. We have only increased the quantum of cash incentive to encourage unanimous elections, so that the political interference is reduced, violence would be decreased and peace and harmony would exist in the villages,” state panchayat raj and rural development minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said.Since the elections of sarpanches and gram panchayats are held on a non-party basis, the incentive would help the elected bodies strengthen the administration at the village level, he said.Though the elections are held on a non-party basis, the YSRC has roped in all the MLAs and MPs into the electioneering to see that ruling party supporters get elected unanimously in a majority of the gram panchayats.Senior YSRC leader and advisor to the state government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy and party general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy held teleconferences with party seniors to ensure that majority of gram panchayats witnessed unanimous elections.Telugu Desam Party president N Chandrababu Naidu called upon party leaders at the grassroot level to see that there is a strong contest in the gram panchayat elections. Naidu, who addressed a meeting of party leaders, asked them not to get scared by threats or intimidated by YSRC leaders.He reminded party workers that during the initial phase of elections to Block Parishads and Zilla Parishads in March 2020, the ruling party had created terror and made attacks on the opposition candidates, forcing them to withdraw from the contest. “Over 25 per cent of the seats in these local bodies were declared unanimous in favour of the YSRC and now in the gram panchayats, it wants to use the same tactics,” he alleged.State election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, who held a video conference with district collectors and other officials in the morning, said unanimous elections in gram panchayats were welcome as long as they were voluntary and not forced.“We shall ensure that there would be no forcible unanimous elections. We have appointed a special officer Sanjay Singh, who will look into the prevention of forced unanimous elections,” he said.Political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said announcement of cash incentives to the gram panchayats was ridiculous. “Elections are part of the democratic process and people should have a choice to elect their representative,” he said.He said going by this practice, there was no need to conduct the elections to the state assembly as well. “Why should there be elections to the state assemblies? The Centre can announce an incentive of ₹25 crore or ₹30 crore to each assembly constituency and see that the MLAs are elected on a non-party basis unanimously. Does it make any sense?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-announces-cash-incentives-for-unanimous-polls-to-gram-panchayats-101611767305126.html

We reiterated our firm commitment to deepen India-US defence cooperation. We exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest to strengthen our strategic partnership."We reiterated our firm commitment to deepen India-US defence cooperation. We exchanged views on regional and global issues of mutual interest to strengthen our strategic partnership," he said.It is not immediately known whether the eastern Ladakh standoff between India and China was discussed in the talks.Three days back, Austin spoke to his Japanese counterpart Nobuo Kishi during which China's growing activities in East China Sea figured prominently.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years and in June 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner".The two countries have also inked key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides have also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for sale of high end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties. The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-speaks-to-us-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-discusses-regional-and-global-issues-101611768859150.html

State NCP president and Maharashtra water resources minister Jayant Patil said that the yatra will involve discussions and meetings with party workers.Patil will be travelling to every assembly constituency and all the districts in phases during the tour starting with the Maoist-infested Gadchiroli district. He said that the objective of the rally is to strengthen the organisation by having a dialogue with party cadres and also create better coordination with Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partners - Shiv Sena and Congress - at the local level.In the first phase, Patil will be covering 82 assembly constituencies situated in 14 districts covering Vidarbha region and parts of north Maharashtra and by travelling around 3,000-km in 17 days. During the tour, he will cover Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Yavatmal, Washim Nagpur, Wardha, Amravati, Akola, Buldhana, Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon district, where the first phase is going to culminate.Patil is considered one of the most trusted aides of the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and was also appointed as head of the state NCP unit in April 2018 in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections.The MVA in Maharashtra comprises Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress. The three parties forged an alliance post-Assembly elections in 2019 to keep the BJP away from power. The Shiv Sena, which had contested the Assembly election together with the BJP, decided to end the alliance after the saffron party refused to accept their demand for the chief ministe's chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-to-launch-rashtravadi-parivar-samwad-yatra-on-thursday-101611767953014.html

27-01-2021||India||India extends restrictions on flights from UK till February 14||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Wednesday extended the restrictions of limited flight operations between India and the UK imposed in a bid to contain the spread of a new strain of coronavirus.“The competent authority has further extended the restrictions of flights between India and UK up to February 14, 2021. The other terms and conditions of the said letter shall remain unchanged,” DGCA wrote in an order to airlines operating between the two countries.On December 21, India joined a growing list of countries to seal off access to people who have been to the UK, suspending all flights to and from the country between December 23 and December 31 in order to stop the spread of a new strain of the coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 feared to spread more rapidly.On December 30, India extended the suspension of flights from UK till January 7. The government earlier this month announced it will allow flights to operate between United Kingdom and India from January 7 but with restrictions that include limiting flight operations to 15 weekly flights each per country till January 23.The Centre has put a cap of 30 weekly flights between the two countries with 15 flights each allowed for carriers between the two countries.Before the restrictions were imposed, nearly 70 flights per week were operating between the two countries, according to DGCA with 10 flights operating per day. Airlines including Air India, British Airways, Vistara and Virgin Atlantic were operating on these routes.India has been operating international flights through bilateral transport bubbles with 24 countries including Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), since calling off scheduled overseas flight operations when it announced the nationwide lockdown in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-extends-restrictions-on-flights-from-uk-till-february-14-101611766183131.html
27-01-2021||India||RJD eyes Bengal, Assam assembly polls, considers pacts with TMC, Congress-AIUDF||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will contest the upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam for which the party’s senior leaders will hold talks with Trinamool Congress and Congress–AIUDF alliance, party leaders said Wednesday.The RJD is looking to contest seven to eight seats in West Bengal and 12 seats in Assam.Sources said the RJD’s top leadership has taken a decision to contest the West Bengal polls following much deliberation in the last few weeks after initially being skeptical about the idea. Many within the party had felt that the RJD should not contest the election and rather support secular parties in their fight against the BJP which is the main challenger to the ruling TMC in that state“We want an alliance with TMC as it is our first choice. Our primary goal is to defeat the BJP in Bengal and also in Assam,” said a senior leader, wishing not to be quoted.A delegation of party’s senior led by national principal secretary general Abdul Bari Siddiqui and national general secretary Shyam Rajak will meet TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC’s youth leader Abhishek Banerjee during their visit to Kolkata from January 30 to February 2.“We will meet TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee and then the West Bengal CM to talk of an alliance and seat sharing. We will also hold talks with RJD’s West Bengal unit and all aspiring candidates,” said Shyam Rajak. He said the state unit’s views would be a deciding factor in forging an alliance with like- minded parties.The RJD’s top leaders feel that the TMC, which is facing a big challenge from the BJP, could benefit from an alliance with their party as there are sizable Bihari voters from different caste groups in Kolkata and other districts. “Both the TMC and BJP are eyeing voters from UP and Bihar. In this scenario, RJD’s alliance with secular parties could benefit the secular bloc,” said Siddiqui.Insiders said the RJD, which had contested three to four seats in previous polls, is eyeing seven to eight seats in an alliance with the TMC. Some of the seats identified are in Asansol including Raniganj, a few seats in Kolkata and few in south Bengal in Kharagpur. Sources said in case talks with TMC on seat arrangement does not materialise, the RJD would then approach the Left-Congress alliance.A senior TMC leader, who did not want to be named, said, "In the past the RJD contested seats in Bengal, but as a partner of the Left Front. The same was done by the Samajwadi Party of Uttar Pradesh. Only Mamata Banerjee can take a decision on this."Insiders said the RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav may visit Kolkata in the coming weeks based on the response the party’s delegation gets from the TMC on seat adjustment.The delegation will leave for Guwahati on February 2 to meet representatives of AIUDF (All India United Democratic Front) led by Badriuddin Ajmal on seat sharing and possible alliance.“We want to contest 10-12 seats in Assam. It will be the first major foray of the RJD. In the past the party had contested polls but it did get the desired results,” said another senior leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-eyes-bengal-assam-assembly-polls-considers-pacts-with-tmc-congressaiudf-101611766331292.html
27-01-2021||India||Congress stoking unrest due to poor show in polls, says Javadekar||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday blamed the Congress for wanting to create a “situation of unrest” in the country and said the party has been provoking the farmers agitating against the farm laws.A day after violence broke out in the Capital after a section of protesting farmers marched to the Red Fort, Javadekar said, the government has already held 10 rounds of talks with the farmers and offered to put in abeyance the farm laws for 18 months, but the Congress does not want a resolution to the stalemate.“These laws make an effort to give the farmers an option but the Congress does not want this to happen. I feel those who have lost elections, they are all getting together to spoil the atmosphere in the country,” Javadekar said.To bolster the BJP’s claims that the farmer protests are being stoked by the Congress, the minister said, barring Punjab where the Congress is in power, farmers elsewhere are not agitating against the laws.The Congress, however, pinned the blame for the violence on the BJP. Addressing the media, party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said it was a conspiracy to malign farmers and discredit them. “The facts (that) have unfolded over the last 24 hours, a concerted conspiracy, aided and abetted by the Modi Government took place to malign the entire farmers’ movement. A set of people with premeditated motive of violence, who have nothing to do with the ‘Samyukt Kisan Morcha’, they were permitted to enter the premises, the sanctum sanctorum of the Red Fort, the pride of India, climb on to its columns and put a flag there, this is sacrilege. This is unacceptable and those who did it, Deep Sidhu and Gang, they have been seen in the past cohabiting with the Prime Minister of India and Home Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Shri Amit Shah, ample evidence of which is now available in the public domain. Instead of arresting them, then and there, they were permitted to go back.”The BJP retaliated by alleging that that the Congress is stoking unrest because of its poor electoral performance. Javadekar said just as the popularity of the BJP and Prime Minister Modi is continuing to increase, the Left parties and the Congress continue to face rejection in elections.“The Congress is disappointed, it has been losing elections and the Communists are also losing (in elections), therefore in West Bengal they are trying to forge a relationship. They just want to create unrest through violence so that police have to take action or fire and there should be destruction of life and assets. The Congress is following provocative politics now,” he said.The minister who holds the portfolios of information and broadcasting and environment and forests praised the Delhi Police for its handling of the situation on the ground. He said, “The Delhi Police showed exemplary restrain. They were attacked with swords, sticks, stones but the police showed restraint and this is admirable. The whole situation was brought under control within a short span of time.”“Congress and Rahul Gandhi should apologise because such kind of negative politics is not good for the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-stoking-unrest-due-to-poor-show-in-polls-says-javadekar-101611763791237.html
27-01-2021||India||Govt extends restrictions on flights between India and UK till Feb 14||The government on Wednesday extended the restrictions in flights between India and the United Kingdom till February 14 to control the spread of the new variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The flight services between the two countries had resumed earlier this months, but with restrictions. The flight services had resumed with limited capacity - 30 flights are operating including 15 each by Indian and UK carriers.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri had tweeted the frequency of flights between India and the UK saying the government will keep reviewing it.After the rapid spread of the new mutant strain of Covid-19 in the UK, India had put an embargo on flight services between the two countries in December last year. Initially, the ban was till December 31, but was later extended to first week of January.The flights from India to the UK started on January 6, while operations from the UK to India began on January 8.After India resumed regular flights to the UK under its air bubble agreement, 70 flights per week have been operated. But the number has been brought down to 30 in the wake of the new Covid-19 strain. The reduced number will stay after civil aviation ministry's order on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the UK variant of the disease has spread to 70 countries.This comes after recent announcement by a group of researchers that the coronavirus strain sweeping Britain could be more deadly as well as more transmissible. Initially, British experts said that their evidence suggested the new strain circulating in the UK - one of several to have emerged internationally in recent months - was between 50 per cent and 70 per cent more transmissible.Last week, however, the government said the new variant could also be 30-40 per cent more deadly, although it stressed the assessment relied on sparse data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-restrictions-on-flights-between-india-and-uk-till-feb-14-101611764998747.html

Amit Shah is the target||The Congress on Wednesday sharpened its attack on the central government for the violence and vandalism on the streets of Delhi during the tractor parade in the national capital a day earlier, accusing the government of conspiring to malign the farmers’ protest.“It is clear that this is a concerted conspiracy, aided and abetted by the Modi government that took place to malign the entire farmers’ movement,” Congress national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said at a press conference on the vandalism during the tractor parade.Thousands of farmers, demanding that the government scrap three new farm laws, drove tractors into the city, defying police orders to stick to the pre-approved routes in breach of the agreement between the police and the farm unions. There were sporadic clashes between the police and the protesters at several locations.Police Commissioner SN Srivastava told reporters on Wednesday that 300 police personnel were injured in the clashes and vowed that he would spare no one found responsible for the violence. He also rejected suggestions that there was an intelligence failure, accusing leaders of the protesting farm unions of breach of trust.Scores of farmers breached the Red Fort too and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, at the first available flag post. Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar called it an insult to the tricolour and blamed the Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi for instigating farmers.Surjewala said what had happened was “unacceptable”.Also Read: Farm leaders postpone February 1 march to Parliament“A set of people with the pre-meditated motive of violence, who have nothing to do with the ‘Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’, they were permitted to enter the premises, the sanctum sanctorum of the Red Fort, the pride of India, climb on to its columns and put a flag there, this is a sacrilege.”“Those who did it, Deep Sidhu and gang, have been seen in the past cohabiting with Prime Minister of India and Home Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi and Shri Amit Shah, ample evidence of which is now available in the public domain. Instead of arresting them, then and there, they were permitted to go back,” he added.Surjewala said that this was the second time in less than a year that the national capital had been pushed to the brink of unabated, unchecked, uncontrolled violence under the leadership of Shah.“It is a huge, colossal security lapse and intelligence failure on the part of none less than the Home Minister of India, Shri Amit Shah,” he said.He added that an FIR needed to be registered against Sidhu, but instead the city police was wrongly targeting farm unions.“How can police remain a mute spectator as 500-700 people occupied the Red Fort,” Surjewala said. “Can such a Home Minister, who is the weakest Home Minister in the history of India in the last 73 years, be permitted to stay in office even for a single day? Shri Amit Shah must be sacked and if the Prime Minister does not sack him, it will be apparent that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a part of this concerted conspiracy to malign the farmers’ movement,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-sharpens-attack-on-centre-for-violence-in-delhi-amit-shah-is-the-target-101611764040787.html
27-01-2021||India||Congress, Rahul Gandhi instigated farmers protest, claims Prakash Javadekar||Blaming the Congress for instigating farmers' agitation which resulted in violence in the national capital on Republic Day, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Wednesday said party leader Rahul Gandhi was fueling the protest."Congress constantly tried to instigate the farmers' agitation. Rahul Gandhi wasn't only supporting protest but also instigating it. It was the same during CAA," claimed Javadekar.The Union minister for information and broadcasting said that the Congress holds rallies, they instigate people to take to streets and agitation begins next day. "It happened during this agitation too. They instigated farmers," he said.The Punjab government should have monitored the tractors leaving the state and made preventive arrests of habitual criminals, Javadekar said at a press conference.Referring to the unfurling of a flag from the ramparts of Red Fort, Javadekar said, "India won't tolerate the manner in which the Tricolour was insulted at the Red Fort. The manner in which there was violence in Delhi yesterday, the more it is condemned, the less it is."Pointing to an alleged political motive, Javadekar said that the Congress wants to stoke disturbance in the country."Congress wants to create a situation of unrest in the country. This is what is left of Congress' politics. They are worried as to what will happen to the family-based politics? Thus, Congress is trying to fire up every situation of violence," Javadekar said.The Union minister lauded the Delhi police and said, "Delhi Police displayed remarkable restraint yesterday. They were attacked by swords and even stones were thrown, but they did not retaliate. They brought the situation under control with patience."Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava addressed a press conference on Wednesday where he said that farmer leaders made inflammatory speeches and were involved in the violence during the tractor parade by agitating farmers that left several cops injured and warned that no culprit will be spared.Srivastava also said that farmer unions did not follow conditions set for the tractor rally that was supposed to be held from 12 pm to 5 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rahul-gandhi-instigated-farmers-protest-claims-prakash-javadekar-101611761379438.html
27-01-2021||India||Congress to field mix of youth and experience for Kerala polls: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the party-led United Democratic Front (UDF) will sweep the upcoming assembly elections in Kerala and the party will field a mix of youth and experienced candidates to achieve this.Addressing a meeting of party office-bearers in Nilambur, part of his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad, he said winning this election was important to the party and the leaders will go all out in the coming days. He said the party will field more youth and women, but experienced people won’t be left out and it will be a proper mix of both.“We will devise a new election strategy. Manifesto committee is a step towards this. Manifesto panel members will meet a cross section of people and it will reflect aspirations of people. If we work systematically we can sweep the election. I am sure we will achieve this,” he said while addressing a meeting of the UDF block office-bearers. Senor leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor heads the manifesto committee with the assembly elections being due in April-May.On a two day visit to his constituency, he will kick-start the party’s election campaign in the state and meet many leaders. There are reports that he will campaign extensively in the state-- his candidature in Wayanad and 2018 Sabarimala stir protesting against the Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women of all ages at the hilltop shrine are considered the main reasons for the landslide win of the UDF in the last Lok Sabha polls in which it bagged 19 out of 20 seats.Earlier in the day, Gandhi interacted with girl students in Wandoor after inaugurating a new block of the Government girls’ higher secondary school. He asked students to be independent, financially and psychologically, and open up to knowledge around them.After the local body election debacle in December, the party had summoned three top leaders of the state-- former CM Oommen Chandy, state president Mullapally Ramachandran and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala to Delhi to formulate a fresh strategy for assembly elections. It also named a 10-member panel to supervise elections in the state.As the polls draw near, many youngsters have started flocking to the party offices seeking seats. Party national spokesperson Shama Mohammad, a woman TV personality, Kerala Students Union state president K M Abijith are some of the names doing the rounds. There are reports that Shama Mohammad will be fielded from one of the seats in Kannur in north Kerala. A doctor by profession, she hails from north Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-to-field-mix-of-youth-and-experience-for-kerala-polls-rahul-gandhi-101611762922636.html
27-01-2021||India||Odisha govt fails to file charges, IFS officer, son get bail in corruption case||In a major embarrassment for Odisha vigilance department, a vigilance court in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday granted bail to senior Indian Forest Service officer Abhay Kant Pathak and his son Akash Pathak by ‘default’ after the department failed to submit the charge sheet within the mandatory period of 60 days.Pathak, a 1987-batch Indian Forest Service officer, working as Odisha’s additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Plan, Programme and Afforestation), was arrested on November 27 last year after vigilance officials raided his official residence in Bhubaneswar, his office, his apartment and a clutch of other locationsHis son Abhay Pathak who had vehicles like Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier as well as high-end motorcycles registered in his name, was also arrested. The agency which had accused Pathak of amassing disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore ( 435 % of his total income), had claimed that it was the biggest case of disproportionate assets in its history.Though it was incumbent upon the vigilance department to submit fie charge sheet in the case within 60 days of arrest, the agency failed to do it."As per the SC judgment in the case of Rakesh Paul vs state of Assam in 2017, in cases involving Prevention of Corruption Act, the prosecuting agency has to submit the charge sheet within 60 days. That the vigilance department officials failed to submit it by January 25, the due date, shows that the case was a malafide attempt to tarnish the reputation of the senior IFS officer," said Pitambar Acharya, lawyer of Pathak.Acharya said the vigilance department kept the IFS officer and his son behind bars for 60 days without any shred of evidence. "The vigilance department curtailed the liberty of my clients by keeping them in custody on flimsy evidence for 60 days. The entire operation against the Pathaks smacked of vendetta. The department does not have sufficient evidence to file a charge sheet," he alleged.The vigilance department, however, said the disproportionate assets case is not a conventional crime involving private individual."It is an offence committed by a public servant, investigation is based on records and documents and it requires detailed investigation for collection of information relating to assets, income and expenditure from multiple sources. In this case, it is a multi-State investigation, involving major investigation outside the State, which is time consuming. It also requires prosecution sanction from government for submission of charge sheet and cognizance of offence by the court to prosecute accused public servant," the department said in a statement.The vigilance department had alleged that Pathak and his family had made at least 20 trips to different cities of the country through chartered planes at an expenditure of over ₹3 crores during Covid lockdown last year. The vigilance sleuths found hotel bills of more than ₹90 lakhs at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and advance booking amount of ₹20 lakh at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan for the marriage of Pathak's son with the daughter of former BJD minister Pradeep Panigrahy. The marriage was scheduled for December 11 last year.Following his arrest, the Indian Forest Service officer was suspended from service and subsequently, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik also recommended his compulsory retirement. The recommendation is awaiting the Centre's approval.However, Abhay Pathak and his son Akash Pathak may not get out of jail as they are accused in more cases. The IFS officer and his son are accused in a case of cheating over non-payment of money to a travel agency in Bhubaneswar. The father-son duo had booked chartered flights, five-star hotels and air tickets through the agency which cost around ₹2.78 crore. However, they have paid ₹2.13 crore while an outstanding bill of ₹65,16,233 is yet to be cleared.Akash, who has been accused of conspiring with expelled BJD leader and Gopalpur MLA Pradeep Panigrahy and cheating several job seekers of crores of rupees on the pretext of giving jobs at Tata Motors, has been separately charged by the Crime Branch of Odisha Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-fails-to-file-charges-ifs-officer-son-get-bail-in-corruption-case-101611762235043.html

Have you heard? Whenever talks are held, we will let you know," Javadekar said.The government has so far held 11 rounds of talks with the farmers who have been protesting since November 26 last year. All the rounds of talks have failed to break the impasse. The farmers are insisting on repeal of the three laws passed in September, which the government has categorically ruled out. It has instead suggested putting their implementation on hold for 18 months, saying this is the "best offer".Meanwhile, the agitating farmers took to the streets on Tuesday, and a faction of them broke away to protest at the historic Red Fort where clashes between the on-duty police personnel and protestors broke out.When reporters asked the minister about his views of yesterday’s clash the minister said, "I feel the same way as you are feeling.", reported news agency PTI.Many opposition parties criticised the violence, but were quick to blame the Centre for not handling the situation maturely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-said-doors-for-dialogue-are-closed-prakash-javadekar-on-farmers-protest-101611760435044.html

27-01-2021||India||Day after violence, farm leaders postpone February 1 march to Parliament||A day after tractor rally called by farmers spiralled out of control and led to violence and chaos in the national capital, farmer leaders on Wednesday decided to postpone their proposed February 1 march to Parliament.The farmers had decided to march to Parliament to mark their protest against the three contentious farm laws passed by the government in September last year.The farmers have now said they will hold jan sabhas (public meetings) and a one-day fast on January 30 to mark their condemnation against Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. The protests will be against the forces that killed Gandhi, the farm leaders said.Stating that most of the farmers were peaceful and a government conspiracy was designed to sabotage the rally, the farm leaders said that despite attempts to break it, 99.9% farmers were peaceful."The rally fell prey to government conspiracy. Some incidents took place. The government put the Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee members in front of blockade put for us but there was no blockade for them," Balbir S Rajewal, Bhartiya Kisan Union (R) said minutes after Delhi Poluce held the presser.However, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha has maintained that agitation against three farm laws will continue and has not been called off.Carried out peacefully for nearly two months, the protest called by thousands of farmers turned violent after the tractor rally called by them took unapproved routes to enter into the national capital on Republic Day. This, in turn, halted the city-state till evening, crippling several traffic junctions and forcing the government to snap internet connections in parts of Delhi. The protesters also breached India's Mughal-era monument Red Fort and unfurled a flag of their own atop one of the poles, inviting serious flak from citizens and leaders.The Delhi Police on Wednesday filed at least 25 FIRs in cases related to the violence and chaos.A majority of these cases have been registered under sections of rioting, causing hurt by dangerous weapons, obstructing police from doing their duty, police have also filed some cases under heinous sections of attempt to murder and attempt to culpable homicide in clashes reported from the Red Fort, ITO and Ghazipur. In one FIR, police are also probing protesters for destroying CCTV cameras on the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-violence-farm-leaders-postpone-february-1-march-to-parliament-101611759066653.html
27-01-2021||India||India to send 5 lakh Covid-19 vaccines to Sri Lanka as part of ‘Vaccine Maitri’||India will on Thursday despatch 500,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Sri Lanka as grant assistance under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, which has already delivered nearly five million doses to seven countries in the neighbourhood.The delivery of vaccines made by the Serum Institute of India will fulfil Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa during their virtual summit last September for all possible support to minimise the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.When external affairs minister S Jaishankar made his first foreign visit this year to Sri Lanka during January 5-7, Colombo had reiterated its request for urgent delivery of vaccines.Since the launch of the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative on January 20, India has provided vaccines to Bhutan (150,000 doses), the Maldives (100,000 doses), Bangladesh (two million doses), Nepal (one million doses), Myanmar (1.5 million doses), Seychelles (50,000 doses), and Mauritius (100,000 doses).Commercial supplies of Covishield have been sent to Brazil, Morocco (two million doses each) and Bangladesh (five million doses), and more supplies are planned for South Africa and Saudi Arabia.Nepal rolled out its vaccination drive on Wednesday, using the made-in-India vaccines. Officials said some 430,000 frontline health workers, security personnel, senior citizens in care homes and prisoners will be covered in the first phase of the drive.“This humanitarian gesture amid the pandemic showcases India’s commitment to its Neighbourhood First policy and the SAGAR doctrine, in which Sri Lanka has a prominent position,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.SAGAR or Security and Growth for All in the Region is the doctrine framed by the Indian government for boosting cooperation across the Indo-Pacific.The Sri Lankan government has finalised its priority list of vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and armed forces personnel, who will be first to receive the vaccine. Sri Lanka approved the emergency use of Covishield, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine, on January 23.The delivery of vaccines as grant assistance is in line with India’s role as the first responder in the region and other efforts to help Sri Lanka overcome the impact of the pandemic. Last year, India extended a $400-million currency swap facility to Sri Lanka to ensure financial stability and gifted about 26 tonnes of essential lifesaving medicines and equipment.India also facilitated the repatriation of several hundred Sri Lankan citizens from Indian cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-send-5-lakh-covid-19-vaccines-to-sri-lanka-as-part-of-vaccine-maitri-101611758590625.html

While the other was Inder Sai Mandavi (75), a resident of Kamkheda village who was beaten to death by the Maoists. Both were killed on the suspicion of being police informers,” said D Shravan, SP Rajnandgaon.The police officials claimed that Maoists are under pressure in the Manpur area of Rajnandgaon district because of anti-naxal operations going on in the region.As per intelligence sources, there are about 200 armed cadres of CPI (Maoist) working in this zone since the last three years. Police believe that since the operations in Bastar increased over the last year, the Maoists were moving towards the MMC zone.On Monday, a contractor, who was engaged in construction work in Maoist-affected Bijapur district of Bastar range was killed by unidentified people.On Sunday, a deputy sarpanch was killed allegedly by Maoists in Kondagaon district of Bastar region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-maoists-kill-2-villagers-in-rajnandgaon-101611759236861.html

Since Dhannipur village falls under the jurisdiction of the Ayodhya Development Authority (ADA), there is a need to submit the layout and get clearance from the development authority,” said Athar Hussain, spokesperson of Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), the trust set up by UPSCWB to look after the construction of the Dhannipur complex.The complex is coming up on five acres of land allotted to the board in compliance with the Supreme Court directives in the Ayodhya title case in which the apex court paved the way for construction of Ram temple at the disputed site on November 9, 2019.The Dhannipur project includes a mosque, hospital, museum, library, community kitchen, Indo-Islamic Cultural Research Centre and a publication house. Board officials said the trust was also preparing the list of NOCs needed while initiating the layout clearance process.“There are more than a dozen NOCs from fire, environment, administration, education departments and others for which clearance is required,” an official said.On January 26, the Board launched the Dhannipur project by hoisting the national flag and planting saplings to mark Republic Day celebrations.A team of architects also carried out soil testing to assess the nature of the soil and the density. On December 19, 2020, the trust had released the blueprint of the mosque and other structures designed by Professor SM Akhtar, a Lucknow-based architect and town planner, whom the trust has hired to design the mosque that would come up in Dhannipur in place of the Babri Masjid.

27-01-2021||India||Bihar amps up Covid vaccination drive, enrols close to 2 lakh frontline staff||The Bihar state government has enrolled 1.94 lakh frontline workers for vaccination against coronavirus disease as it stepped up efforts to complete the exercise of inoculating 4.64 lakh healthcare workers by asking medical colleges to vaccinate on all days, except holidays.Frontline workers are those under the ministry of home affairs, ministry of housing and urban affairs and revenue staff of department of health.The health department had earlier fixed four days a week - Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday - for vaccination against Covid-19.It also asked government facilities like district hospitals and below to try and saturate the vaccination of its healthcare workers as soon as possible.The change in vaccination days was done because medical colleges had a larger cohort, said a health official.At the same time, the low vaccination footfall at district and sub-divisional hospitals, community and primary health centres (PHCs) had prompted the government to reduce the number of vaccination days to twice a week.The Guru Gobind Singh Hospital, an urban health centre in Patna City, had 33% footfall, Maner primary health centre (PHC) 36%, Phulwarisharif PHC 39%, Masaurhi sub-divisional hospital (SDH) 40%, Dhanarua PHC 43%, Danapur SDH 44% and Fatuha community health centre (CHC) 49% among the 17 session sites (vaccination centres) in Patna on January 23.In contrast, barring the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (33% footfall), other medical colleges in Patna received better response. The Patna Medical College Hospital registered 85% footfall, All India Institute of Medical Sciences 79% and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences 52% footfall the same day. The day’s overall vaccination percentage in Patna was 64%, which was more than on January 21 (50%).Health facilities have now been asked to speed up the process so that inoculation of frontline workers, which is the next priority group for vaccination, can be taken up soon, said the officer.“To speed up vaccination, 12 new government session sites have been identified for vaccination in Patna. Besides, 22 private healthcare facilities have also been shortlisted where smaller private health facilities will be tagged for vaccination of its healthcare workers,” said Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh.Only three private facilities in Patna - Paras HMRI, Ruban Memorial Hospital and BIG Apollo Hospital - have so far been chosen as session sites for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-amps-up-covid-vaccination-drive-enrols-close-to-2-lakh-frontline-staff-101611757992841.html

Air travel was being allowed as of now under the Air Bubble agreements with various countries and the Vande Bharat scheme.The government also removed the capping on the number of people who could be part of a social, cultural, religious, and political or sports gathering, which until now were limited to a maximum of 50% of the hall capacity, with a ceiling of 200 people in closed spaces; and keeping of the size of the ground/ space in view. The states and union territories have been given freedom to prepare their own SOPs in this regard.Similarly, the government said that now all kind of exhibitions can be held anywhere for which the department of commerce will issue new procedures. Earlier, only B2B exhibitions were given permission by the government.“The main focus of the guidelines (to remain in force till February 28) is to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19 which is visible in the steady decline in the number of active and new cases in the country over the last four months. It is, therefore, emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy focussed on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/SOPs issued by MHA and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MOHFW),” the MHA said.The previous guidelines, issued in December and currently in force, had asked all the authorities to be cautious in view of a global surge in the number of infections and emergence of a new variant in the UK.In a letter to all the states and UTs, Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said “As you are aware, the number of active cases in the country has been declining steadily over the past four months. However, there is a need for maintaining caution and strict surveillance so as to fully overcome the pandemic”.He further said, “All activities have already been permitted except for a few which have been permitted with certain restrictions. In view of the improved situation in the country and requests from various stakeholders, those restrictions in the new guidelines are being removed subject to revised SOPs”.Activities like - movement by trains, metro trains, schools, higher educational institutions, hotels and restaurants, shopping malls, multiplexes and entertainment parks, yoga centres and gymnasiums, etc were already allowed by the Centre last year. The states were also given freedom to make rules on any night curfew or other restrictions.Swimming pools had been kept closed for the public due to the fear of the spread of Covid-19 cases. “Now swimming pools will be permitted for use of all, for which a revised SOP will be issued by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports (MoYA&S) in consultation with MHA,” the order said on Wednesday.The cinema halls, facing huge losses, had also been demanding that the number of seats be increased. The government has said that they can have more people watching the shows for which revised SOPs will be issued by information and broadcasting ministry.Bhalla said, “The essence behind the graded re-opening and progressive resumption of activities is to move ahead.”Containment zones will continue to be monitored carefully and state governments have been asked to take all necessary measures to promote Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and ensure wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.There will be no restriction on any inter-state and intra-state movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mha-s-new-guidelines-swimming-pools-open-for-all-more-people-in-theatres-101611757319448.html

27-01-2021||India||India sticking to S-400 deal with Russia despite threat of possible US sanctions||India is sticking to its guns on the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems despite reports of possible US sanctions, an issue with the potential for becoming an early irritant with the new Biden administration.India’s decision to acquire the S-400, instead of other air defence systems offered by the West, was based on a thorough evaluation and national security requirements, including already delayed plans to create a ballistic missile defence shield over key cities, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The lingering standoff with China in Ladakh has seen India deploy a raft of weapons and systems in the sector, including hardware bought from the US, Russia and France, to strengthen its military deployments.“India’s strategic interests are supreme and it is for us to decide what weapons we buy and from whom to pursue those interests. If the US has concerns about procurements from Russia, the latter is also upset over military equipment we are importing from the US,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.“We buy platforms factoring in the security threats we face,” the official said, adding the US and Russia understand India’s complex security challenges.A second official, who too declined to be named, acknowledged India is walking a fine line in defence cooperation with Russia and the US, which are both strategic partners.“But the more important point is the country’s independent foreign policy and strategic autonomy to decide defence purchases in line with national security interests,” the second official said.Though India has been procuring US military hardware in growing numbers, including Apache and Chinook helicopters and P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft, about 60% of the inventory of the three services continues to be of Russian-origin.The US has sanctioned its NATO ally Turkey under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for taking delivery of the S-400, and this was mainly due to concerns that Western platforms operating in the same environment as the S-400 would provide Russia valuable data on how to defeat those systems, said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.“The fact that Turkey didn’t escape CAATSA sanctions suggests the US is very concerned about the S-400 system, and it's probably not just junk. India's insistence to take delivery of its first S-400 batteries later this year therefore sets the Biden administration potentially on a collision course on the sanctions question with India,” Narang said.Russia is set to train the first group of Indian military specialists in operating the S-400 and the first batteries are expected by September.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur of the Centre for Airpower Studies said no other country, no matter how friendly, can have a veto on India’s defence purchases. “The US is a valued partner and would, rather should, understand India's interests. Washington's geo-political necessities cannot override India's imperatives and one is sure no action would be taken that hurts New Delhi's position,” he said.There are also concerns that US sanctions, even if seen as a slap on the wrist, will revive old concerns about America’s reliability as a defence partner and bring back memories of punitive sanctions after India’s 1998 nuclear tests that set back several defence programmes, including one to develop the light combat aircraft (LCA). The US had then held back engines to power the LCA.Narang said it may be “very hard” for the US to apply different standards to India than it did to Turkey, which hosts American nuclear weapons. “If India does not receive a waiver, it is possible the basket of sanctions – over which there is some leeway – may be simply symbolic, and not painful,” he said.“Applying even symbolic sanctions, it seems to me, would be counterproductive. It would not only fail to deter India from purchasing Russian military equipment, it would likely accelerate it and empower those in Delhi who have been sceptical of the reliability of the US as a defence partner,” Narang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sticking-to-s-400-deal-with-russia-despite-threat-of-possible-us-sanctions-101611754305999.html

It asked states and union territories to mandatorily enforce containment measures and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on various activities and Covid appropriate behaviour.The home ministry allowed swimming pools for everyone and higher seating in cinema halls. It further said that revised SOPs will soon be issued by ministry of information and broadcasting.Cinema halls and theatres were earlier allowed to operate with 50 per cent seating capacity.The home ministry guidelines say that persons above 65 years of age, persons with co-morbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years are advised to take necessary precautions.All the district magistrates have been asked to strictly enforce the above measures for the enforcement of social distancing. "State governments may, as far as possible, use the provisions of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)," the MHA said in the guidelines.Meanwhile, the government has asked civil aviation ministry to further open up international air travel in consultation with the home ministry.In the last extension in December 2020, the government had cautioned against the emergence of a new variant of the virus in the United Kingdom.The home ministry had said that containment zones will have to be demarcated carefully and prescribed containment measures must be strictly followed within these areas.

27-01-2021||India||Telangana may raise retirement age of government employees to 60||The retirement age of all government employees will be raised to 60 years from 58, if the Telangana government implements the recommendations of the Pay Revision Commission.The three-member PRC headed by retired IAS officer CR Biswal, constituted by the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government in May 2018 to look into the revision of salaries of employees and pensioners, submitted its report to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the first week of January, but it was made available to the employees only on Wednesday.Incidentally, it is the first PRC constituted by the Telangana government after the formation of the state in June 2014. The earlier pay revision was done in 2015, based on the recommendations of the PRC constituted during the combined Andhra Pradesh government in 2013.In his party’s election manifesto, KCR, as the chief minister is popularly known, promised to the employees that he would enhance the age of superannuation of the state government employees from 58 to 61 years.After coming to power, the chief minister entrusted the issue to the PRC. The panel has recommended that the retirement age could be raised to 60 years, on par with the Central government employees.The PRC also recommended a fitment of 7.5 per cent on basic pay. Since the DA had been merged with effect from July 1, 2018, the revised pay scales come into operation from the same day. “The government may take a view on the date from which the financial benefit would accrue keeping in view its resource position and the various demands thereon,” the report said.While continuing the existing practice of following the Central government in sanctioning DA twice a year, the PRC recommended that the release of DA instalments would also be done along the lines of the Centre.“For every one per cent increase in DA sanctioned by the Central government, the DA to be sanctioned by the state to its employees would be 0.910 % for the DA starting from January, 2019,” the panel said.The PRC, however, suggested a decrease in the percentage of house rent allowance from 30%, 20%, 14.5% and 12% in case of four categories of places of posting (based on population) to 24%, 17%, 13% and 11%, respectively.The body recommended that the Child Care Leave (CCL) be enhanced from 90 days to 120 days in the case of normal children. In case of disabled children, the CCL will be enhanced from 90 days to two years, on par with the Central government. This leave will be granted with 100 per cent of the salary for the first 365 days and 80 per cent of the salary for the next 365 days.For cashless treatment under EHS,it has recommended collecting 1% of basic pay from employees and 1% of basic pension from the pensioners and creating a ‘separate reserve’. The expenditure shall be met from the above reserve initially and the same shall be recouped from the reimbursement by the Government, after scrutiny of bills as per the existing rules, it said.The panel also recommended removal of the facility for reimbursement of tuition fee to the children of the employees. However, an incentive amount of ₹2000 per annum per pupil, subject to a maximum of two children only be allowed to the employees who have admitted their children in government schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-may-raise-retirement-age-of-government-employees-to-60-101611754205249.html

The father of the accused was also arrested for allegedly feigning ignorance about his son’s act and subsequently pressurising the victim to opt for religious conversion.A relative of the victim alleged that one Abdul Rahman aka Golu, 22, had raped the girl when she was alone at her house on January 11 and also filmed the act. The following day, the accused allegedly blackmailed the victim into having physical relations by threatening to upload the video clip on social media if she didn’t agree, police said.According to the police the girl told her parents about the incident a few days ago after which they filed a complaint against Abdul as well as his father Mohammad Kalim on January 25.The survivor’s parents alleged that the father of the accused tried to save his son and also tried to convert their daughter.In his complaint, the father of the girl alleged that when they requested Kalim to ask his son (accused) to delete the video clip, he reportedly told him that his son would marry the girl after her religious conversion.Additional superintendent of police, Ballia, Sanjay Kumar said that a case against accused Abdul Rahman had been registered under section 452 (trespass), section 376 (rape) of IPC and 3/4/17/18 Protection of children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance.“He has also been booked along with his father under section 3 and 5 of Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance.

27-01-2021||India||Tractor rally violence: Rakesh Tikait, 6 other farmer leaders named in FIR||At least seven farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, VM Singh, Jagtar Singh Bajwa, Tejender Singh Virk and Rishipal Singh Ambawat, have been named in a first information report (FIR) registered at the Ghazipur police station on Wednesday in connection with Tuesday’s violence near the Ghazipur-border during the “Kisan Tractor Parade”.The FIR has been registered under 11 different Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), two Sections of Prevention to Damage to Public Property Act, two sections of Disaster Management Act and Section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act. The charges in the FIR pertain to rioting with deadly weapons, attempt to murder, stopping public servant from performing their duties and criminal conspiracy apart from violations of Covid-19 guidelines. A sub-inspector (SI) of the Ghazipur police station, Sanjeev Kumar, is the complainant in the case.According to Kumar’s complaint, farmers under the leadership of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait, Tejender Singh Virk, VM Singh, national organiser of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samnvaya Samiti, BKU’s Jagrat Singh Bajwa, Rishipal Singh Ambawat, Harpal Singh, Vinod Kumar, president of Jat Mahasabha, and other were protesting against the farm laws at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad (UP Gate) border since November 26. To stop them from moving into Delhi, barricading was done at the Delhi border and Delhi Police personnel along with paramilitary forces staff remained deployed round-the-clock, he has said in the FIR.“These people (leaders) along with their supporters were involved in pushing and shoving, sloganeering and forcibly entering Delhi. However, we maintained patience and controlled the situation by urging them to remain calm. Whenever Rakesh Tikait used to go for meetings with the government, the police staff of the Ghazipur police station escorted him,” the FIR says.According to the FIR, the farmer unions declared that they will carry out a tractor rally on January 26 in Delhi if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. They had also asked their supporters in nearby states to reach Delhi and because of that the number of protesting farmers was increasing every day. The number of those involved in ruckus was more, the FIR said.“Farmer unions were given conditional permission for their proposed tractor rally. The conditions included a specific number of tractors and farmers, routes to follow, timing and that they will not carry weapons and damage public property. The agreed timing was between 12 pm and 5 pm,” the sub-inspector has said in the FIR.SI Kumar further says in the FIR that his duty was at Ghazipur chicken market from 6 am on January 26 and senior officers sent him and other police staff onto the flyover at 9 pm. The protesters in a well-thought out conspiracy began breaking the barricades on the road with their tractors from 9 am, much before the scheduled time, in order to enter Delhi. Some barricades were damaged, he said.“The protesters on the tractors were carrying sticks, iron pipes and swords, and shouting slogans. Station House Officer (SHO), Ghazipur, through loudspeaker made announcements but the farmers ignored his directions and started moving ahead by breaking the barricades with their tractors. The deployed security personnel tried to stop them but the farmers with intent to kill us rammed the barricades and in the process some personnel suffered injuries. As per their conspiracy, the protesters had pasted papers on the registration numbers of their vehicles,” Kumar has said in the FIR.“The protesting farmers on the directions of their leaders, and in a well-planned conspiracy deliberately defied the conditions of the tractor rally permission, and tried to kill me and other police staff by ramming the barricades with their tractors and entered Delhi with deadly weapons. A legal action should be taken against the hooligans and the farmer leaders. They also violated the Covid-19 guidelines by not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing,” it further says in the complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tractor-rally-violence-rakesh-tikait-6-other-farmer-leaders-named-in-fir-101611751451652.html

The protestors were not Khalistanis and Pakistanis, they were government officials selected by Amit Shah.”“One of the accused was found to be close to BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Sunny Deol and has pictures with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was a sponsored programme of the Central government to derail the farmers’ protest in Delhi,” said Singh.The ruling BJP hit back at Singh and accused him of playing politics with Tuesday’s events.“Anti-social elements created havoc in the name of farmers. Police personnel were beaten up brutally. They insulted our country. Rather condemning the act of protestors, Digvijaya Singh is doing dirty politics,” Madhya Pradesh’s medical education department minister Vishwas Sarang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-of-orchestrated-violence-in-delhi-s-tractor-rally-says-digvijaya-singh-101611751089561.html

Deol, who is now a BJP MP, had distanced himself from Sidhu in December last year after he joined the farmers' agitation.Amid a massive outrage over protesters hoisting a religious flag at the Red Fort during the tractor rally on Republic Day, Sidhu defended their action, saying they did not remove the national flag and had put up the 'Nishan Sahib' as a symbolic protest.The 'Nishan Sahib' flag, a symbol of Sikh religion, is seen at all gurdwara complexes.In a video posted on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Sidhu had claimed that it was not a planned move and that they should not be given any communal colour or dubbed as fundamentalists or hardliners.He had also stated that the national flag was not removed from the flagpole at the Red Fort and that nobody raised a question over the country's unity and integrity.Sidhu, who had been associated with the farmers' agitation for the last many months, said "anger flares up" in a mass movement like this when the genuine rights of people are ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-planted-stooge-deep-sidhu-to-create-chaos-in-tractor-rally-aap-101611750072576.html

He faces charges of rioting, attempt to murder and assault."BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait's name mentioned in an FIR by Delhi Police. The FIR mentions multiple IPC sections, including Sec 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (punishment for rioting) & 353 (assault/criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty)," Delhi Police was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."FIR by Delhi Police mentions the names of farmer leaders Darshan Pal, Rajinder Singh, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Buta Singh Burjgil and Joginder Singh Ugraha for breach of NOC issued regarding farmers' tractor rally. FIR also mentions the name of BKU spokesperson Rakesh Tikait," Delhi Police said in a statement on Wednesday.Responding to the reports of the FIR, Tikait told PTI that an "FIR against any farmer leader is FIR against farmers of the country".After a stormy protest on India's 72nd Republic Day which brought the city-state's traffic to a standstill, forced snapping of internet connection in several regions and claimed one life, Delhi Police have filed at least 25 FIRs to nab the culprits.The police force claims that FIRs cite the names of several farmer leaders who have been caught on tape instigating people to resort to force and break barricades in a bid to enter the national Capital on the 72nd Republic Day. Some of the FIRs on violence at Red Fort and ITO will be sent to the Crime Branch, Delhi Police officials said.A majority of these cases point to sections of rioting, causing hurt by dangerous weapons, obstructing police from doing their duty. The police has also filed some cases under heinous sections of attempt to murder and attempt to culpable homicide in clashes reported from the Red Fort, ITO and Ghazipur. In one FIR, police are also probing protesters for destroying CCTV cameras on the road.The police officials claim that at least 86 officials were injured in the clashes with protesting farmers.The cops have also detained 200 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-named-in-fir-over-violence-in-tractor-parade-says-delhi-police-101611746630510.html

Security forces launched operations at a number of locations to nab those involved."The spokesman said that preliminary investigation revealed that a rudimentary IED with low powered explosive and ball bearings was planted in an abandoned building inside the school premises."24 RR personnel would come and use the verandah of the said building on a regular basis for various purposes. The IED was most probably planted in the night before the incident and it is evident that the attack was planned well in advance after observing troop movement for a sustained period of time," the spokesman said.He said a case has been registered in Qaimoh police station and investigation has started.The army had earlier said that four soldiers who were part of the road opening party were injured in a grenade attack."Terrorists lobbed a grenade on the Army's road opening party during the sanitisation drill in the general area Shamshipura, Khanabal, Kulgam.

27-01-2021||India||Withdrawing support from farmers' stir, says farmer leader; he doesn't have authority, says AIKSCC||A day after the violence in Delhi by protesting farmers, a leading group spearheading the farmers’ agitation, has said that it is withdrawing from the stir."We can't carry forward a protest with someone whose direction is something else. So, I wish them the best but Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan is withdrawing from this protest right away," said Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (RKMS) and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) leader VM Singh, according to news agency ANI."I have nothing to do with the protest which is being led by them and over here being represented by Rakesh Tikait on their behalf," added Singh.He also said that the protest will continue, but not in this form. "We have not come here to get people martyred or beaten up," said the RKMS leader.However, minutes after Singh's announcement, AIKSCC national secretary Avik Saha said that the organisation has not withdrawn support from farmers' stir."AIKSCC has not withdrawn support to the farmers’ agitation as stated by AIKSCC ex-convenor VM Singh to a section the media. VM Singh has no authority to issue such a statement," said Saha.The farmers who had the permission from Delhi Police to take out a tractor rally deviated from the approved route of the parade and marched towards central Delhi from various border points. Hundreds of tractors were seen on the roads of Delhi, with farmers riding them clashing with the police deployed in the area due to Republic Day.The farmers broke the police barricades, attacked the cops with sticks and damaged the buses parked on the street. According to Delhi Police, 86 cops were injured in Tuesday's violence. The police have registered 25 FIRs which have names of various farmer leaders.Leaders cutting across political spectrum had condemned the violence, but many of them blamed the central government for not listening to the farmers, who have been protesting near Delhi for more than two months now.Punjab chief minister Amarinder appealed to the farmers on Tuesday to return to their sit-ins at border areas. He also said that the violence will "negate the goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers".Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) - the umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting at the Delhi border - had also regretted the "undesirable and unacceptable events" and dissociated ourselves from the violence. It had also said that some "anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement".The farmers have been protesting against three central farm laws since November 26. The farmers say that the laws, which have been projected as historic by the Centre, will prove to be detrimental for them.These laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-here-to-get-people-martyred-farmer-body-rkms-leader-withdraws-from-stir-101611747436293.html

27-01-2021||India||No need to assess Mollem projects’ cumulative impact: Goa minister||Goa Minister for Environment Nilesh Cabral has said that there is no provision to cumulatively assess the potentially damaging effects of the three linear infrastructure projects that are cutting through the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park as the projects are “independent” in nature. Replying to a question by legislator Rohan Khaunte, Cabral also said that there was no question of reviewing the projects because the projects were being proposed and admitted “by following all rules and guidelines of [the] Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.”“There is no provision to assess the cumulative impact of the projects, as they are independent in nature and proposed by different user Agencies at different time intervals,” Cabral said in his reply before the Goa Legislative Assembly. Also Read: Goa infra projects: Members of wildlife board allege incorrect minutesCabral’s reply comes even as environmentalists and activists, including the independent non-official expert members of the Goa State Wildlife Board, demanded that the impact of the projects be cumulatively assessed rather than individually owing to the concurrent execution.In a letter to the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court, the expert members of the Wildlife Board had demanded that the Board review the clearances to the projects since they were dubiously granted clearance without studying the cumulative impact of the projects. “Wildlife clearance was sought for every individual project to dilute the figurative requirement of diversion of forest within the same protected area network. Thus, the impact of these projects, especially the cumulative impact on biodiversity does not find mention. The State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire state,” the members had written in their letter to the CEC. “The three proposed linear projects will further fragment the already fragmented area, most of which is pristine and virgin in nature. The State Board for Wildlife needs to demand an assessment of the cumulative impact of these linear developments impacting the entire State,” the members had said. In reply to a separate question asked by Khaunte, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, who holds the forest portfolio, has said that the projects were being implemented by following “the complete procedure as prescribed by the MoEF&CC while obtaining the forest clearance and wildlife clearance.”The proposed projects now only need a Forest Clearance under FCA, 1980 which is yet to be realised.“All three proposals for diversion of forest area for non-forestry purposes as per the provisions of Forest Conservation Act, 1980 are still under process. There is no land acquisition in the protected area,” Sawant said. The standing committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests in April last year granted its approval to the diversion of forest land from notified wildlife sanctuaries in Mollem along Goa’s eastern frontier with Karnataka for three projects -- the doubling of an existing railway line between Hubli in Karnataka and Vasco da Gama in Goa, the expansion of the national highway 4A between Belgaum in north Karnataka and Goa and a power line. The approvals were met with protests demanding that the projects be scrapped for environmental reasons and because it is believed that the completion of the projects will facilitate the transport of more coal. These clearances have been challenged before the Bombay high court and the Central Empowered Committee on grounds that they have been cleared in haste and threaten the rich biodiversity of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-to-assess-mollem-projects-cumulative-impact-goa-minister-101611746735424.html

The leopard was shot dead by forest department appointed hunter Ramesh Chauhan in Jaurasi forest range of the division.”The forest official said the leopard's teeth and claws were worn out signifying old age and it probably started attacking humans because they are easier to catch.

Villagers later found her remains in the forest, 300 metres from the village.This leopard ha previously attacked three women, including two in Almora and one in neighbouring Pauri Garhwal district. After these attacks, furious locals demanded that the leopard be shot.The forest official said that this is the first man-eater leopard to have been killed this year.According to forest department records, over 75 leopards were declared dangerous to human life (or declared man-eater) last year.

Also, as the lone farmer who died during Tuesday's episode in Delhi hailed from the neighbouring district of Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, we didn't want any law and order situation in US Nagar," said Kumar.He also said that all the district police departments have been asked to take stringent action against anyone found indulging in any violence."There was an incident earlier in US Nagar in which some farmers on tractors tried to crush our personnel. We had then registered a case and nabbed the accused in it without sparing anyone. We will follow the same line if anyone tries to break law and order," he said.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) US Nagar district, Daleep Singh Kunwar warned of strict action against rumours mongers who claimed that the 27-year-old farmer who died in Delhi on Tuesday was from the district.Kunwar issued the warning after some social media posts about the dead farmer, which the officer said posed a threat to the law and order situation in the district.Kunwar said, “Rumours were spreading that the farmer who died during tractor parade hailed from Rudrapur and had been killed in police firing. This kind of rumours could have spoiled the peace of the district, hence we decide to issue an appeal to the public to stay away from such rumours and warning to rumour mongers on social media.”“Apart from this, our social media cell is monitoring the social media platforms round the clock. Any person involved in such crime will be dealt with strictly,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-police-on-alert-in-4-districts-after-violence-in-delhi-tractor-rally-101611744013405.html

He is doing so because if I resign his government will not be sustained in the state," the Haryana MLA had said.The Haryana MLA has staunchly backed farmers in their protest as he also carried out a tractor rally from Punjab's Ambala earlier this month.The legislator said his party was continuously participating in this protest and had assigned duties to all party workers to help the agitating farmers be it from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh or Maharashtra. "Our tents have been set up everywhere to assist farmers," he said.The protests - longest such demonstration in decades of independent India - have entered their third month and are showing no signs of abating. The farmers are protesting against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year which essentially change the way India’s farmers do business by creating free markets, as opposed to a network of decades-old, government marketplaces, allowing traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and laying down a national framework for contract farming.These laws are: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inld-legislator-abhay-singh-chautala-resigns-over-farm-laws-speaker-accepts-101611742587232.html

The SKM’s statement came a day after massive violence broke out in Delhi during the farmers’ tractor parade against the laws on Republic Day.“Most of farmer organisations who are part of the ongoing farmers’ agitation today held a meeting under chairmanship of Balbir Singh Rajewal. Sincere appreciation was conveyed to struggling farmers for extending an unprecedented response to Kisan Republic Day parade,” news agency ANI quoted the SKM as saying, in a statement.Most of farmer orgs who are part of the ongoing farmers' agitation today held a meeting under chairmanship of Balbir Singh Rajewal. Sincere appreciation was conveyed to struggling farmers for extending an unprecedented response to Kisan Republic Day Parade: Samyukt Kisan Morcha“The concerned organisations discussed the violent incidents in New Delhi and concluded that the Union government has been severely shaken by this peasant agitation. Therefore, a dirty conspiracy was hatched with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and others against the peaceful struggle of other farmer organisations who had set up their own protest site after 15 days of the beginning of this farmers’ agitation. They were not part of the organisations which jointly undertook the struggle,” the statement further said....against the peaceful struggle of other farmer organizations, who had set up their own separate protest site after 15 days of beginning of this Farmers' agitation. They were not part of the organisations which jointly undertook the struggle: Samyukt Kisan MorchaThe SKM is an umbrella organisation of several farmers’ unions which have been leading protests against the farm laws since last November. The tractor parade on Republic Day was announced on January 2 and, last week, the Delhi Police gave a go ahead after several rounds of talks with farmers’ leaders, who repeatedly assured that the march would be a “peaceful” one. The permission was given with several restrictions, including march from one route each from the three borders - Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur - which have emerged as the epicentre of these protests.However, the KMSC leaders insisted on carrying out the rally on Delhi's Outer Ring Road, as demanded originally by the SKM. The night before the rally, they decided to march on the Ring Road, despite not getting permission from the police.The SKM has also pointed fingers at actor Deep Sidhu, who was reportedly present at the KMSC meeting on Monday night. Sidhu, once an aide of Bollywood actor and now BJP MP Sunny Deol, was among the protesters who unfurled a religious flag at the Red Fort on Tuesday. His photo with Deol and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also went viral post the Republic Day violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dirty-conspiracy-farmers-leaders-accuse-centre-of-sabotaging-peaceful-stir-101611741514594.html
27-01-2021||India||Gurnam Charuni: The firebrand behind the farmers’ protests||The political challenge to the Modi government on three new agricultural laws would not have been possible without the staunch efforts of one man -- 60-year-old Gurnam Singh Charuni, the leader of the Haryana unit of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a popular farmers’ organisation.The two-month-long agitation by farmers, who say the laws will help corporate giants at the expense of growers, has morphed into a mass movement due to the grit of many well-organised farm unions, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. But Charuni has played an outsized role in it.A firebrand, Charuni organised one of the first meetings in September in Haryana’s Pipli village to protest against the three laws. The next milestone came when the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 200 farmer unions, gave a call for a march to Delhi on November 26-27.The decision to forge a larger alliance took place at a meeting a month earlier, on October 27, at Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, which was attended by several farm union leaders, including VM Singh, a former convenor of the AIKSCC, 78-year-old Balbir Singh Rajewal, a veteran farmer leader from Punjab and Charuni, who was the face of the farmers’ agitation in Haryana.“It was Charuni who went from village to village, day and night, and explained the need to make the agitation bigger and bigger. This was after it was clear that thousands of farmers would move to Delhi,” said Sandeep Topra, an aide to Charuni who leads the BKU’s youth wing.Also read | Akhilesh Yadav accuses BJP of turning resentment of farmers into angerCharuni contested the 2019 Assembly election from Ladwa constituency in Haryana’s Kurukshetra region, campaigning on a mix of farmers’ issues and matters of local development but had lost. His wife Balwinder Kaur had also fought and lost the 2014 Lok Sabha polls as an Aam Aadmi Party candidate.Charuni’s election affidavit, a statutory requirement, described him as a farmer and a commission agent dealing in trade of farm produce.Charuni’s native village, Charuni Jattan, lies in the Shahbad area of the Kurukshetra district. His derives his surname from his native village, a customary practice.Charuni is an iconoclast. In the middle of the march to Delhi on November 25, farm unions had decided unanimously to sit peacefully on the Punjab-Haryana border due to resistance from the government and a harsh crackdown by Haryana police.Charuni gave a war cry, defied the sit-in plan, and instead pulled apart barricades in Ambala to reach Delhi with thousands of followers.On January 18, he broke ranks with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the organiser of the protests, to mobilise political parties in favour of the agitation, much to the chagrin of other unions, who wanted to keep the agitation apolitical.This prompted the Samyukt Kisan Morcha to issue a statement, saying efforts by Charuni to organise an all-party meeting on the farm laws were not “unauthorised” by it and this didn’t figure in its official agenda.Charuni’s spokesperson Sandeep Topra said Charuni had not violated any protocol of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha. “If political parties reach out and come to Charuni for a meeting, how can he say no? He hasn’t shared any stage with political parties.”The firebrand farm leader had no qualms in breaking away from the consensus, as long as it strengthened the farmers’ cause.Thousands of farmers are demanding that the government scrap three laws to ease restrictions on farm trade, allow traders to stockpile large quantities of food stock for future sales and lay down a national framework on contract farming based on written agreements.“These laws will break the backbone of farmers. They will lead to distress sale of farm produce and make us bow to big corporations,” Charuni said.After thousands of farmers reached the borders of Delhi on November 27, the Union government asked the protestors to move to Burari, a designated site on Delhi’s outskirts before official talks on the farmers’ demands could begin.Charuni staunchly opposed it, likening Burari to an open jail. Charuni is popularly described as a fearless farm leader adept at winning street battles on farmers’ issues. He has been at the forefront of a long agitation for timely payment of cane prices to sugarcane farmers.Charuni was responsible for bringing Haryana’s farmers into the ongoing agitation, without which the protests could not have moved out of Punjab and grow into a mass uprising. The agitation has put to test the Modi government’s ability to push through economic reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gurnam-chaduni-the-firebrand-behind-the-farmers-protests-101611741694846.html

I think no one should do politics and it is not right to do politics on this kind of violence," Fadnavis said just before meeting Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.He was responding to a query on NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar blaming the Centre for violence during the farmers' tractor rally in Delhi.Asked if the farmers' protest has lost its credibility after the violence witnessed in Delhi here, the senior BJP leader said, "Those who are leading the protest should introspect why such an incident happened."Fadnavis called on Tomar and discussed Maharashtra-related issues.Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary was also present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-should-do-politics-over-violence-fadnavis-on-r-day-farmers-protest-101611738469721.html
27-01-2021||India||Farmer unions blame KMSC for digressing from route, taking rally to Red Fort||The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC), which has a considerable hold in Punjab’s Majha region and some districts of Malwa and Doaba regions, has been under fire for choosing Delhi’s Outer Ring Road to conduct its tractor march on Republic Day. KMSC is the only farmer union which remained adamant on holding the march on the Outer Ring Road despite the agreement of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)—the umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting at the Delhi border—with the Delhi Police to take out the marches on four other routes. SKM blamed the KMSC for misguiding the farmers and resorting to violence. SKM’s founding member Darshan Pal said the KMSC was responsible for the chaos. Several leaders of other farmer organisations, which have been protesting at the Delhi borders, have also condemned the KMSC. Also Read: Many Delhi routes restricted day after farmers’ tractor rally violence“Only KMSC was responsible for diverging from the route. It was this organisation’s announcement to go inside the national capital. This organisation is not a part of 32 unions belonging to Punjab. They came to protest at the Delhi border several days after our agitation started,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) President Balbir Singh Rajewal. KMSC’s president is Satnam Singh Pannu. A group of farmers led by Pannu had parted its way from Kisan Sangharsh Committee (KSC) around one-and-a-half decades ago. Pannu along with other members of Communist Party of India (Marxist) had formed KSC. Pannu formed KMSC after his differences emerged with KSC’s state convener Kawalpreet Singh Pannu in 2007.Kawalpreet Singh Pannu said, “KMSC, Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana have left no stone unturned to defame the peaceful agitation of farmers. KMSC deliberately diverted the route and allowed the protestors to reach the Red Fort. Two farmers have died at the Red Fort and we hold KMSC responsible for this.”The KMSC has also been flayed on social media for distancing itself from the decision of the other farmer unions. A mob which stormed the Red Fort and hoisted two flags—one of a farmer union and another of saffron colour—was reportedly diverted from the march held by the KMSC at the Outer Ring Road. KMSC’s general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said, “When we went towards the Ring Road, we broke three or four barricades. Tear gas was used by the police. We are thankful to Delhi’s people who spent lakhs of rupees to serve food to the protestors. We are also thankful to those who have returned to the Delhi borders after the march.”He said, “Through video messages, we had already been creating awareness that some outsiders would do mischief. Our organisation had no intention to move towards the Red Fort. It was our programme to hold the march peacefully on the Ring Road. Some of the farmers were coaxed by some anti-social elements. But, if they had gone there, what have they done? Our national flag was unfurling there and they didn’t disrespect it. Only Nishan Sahib (Sikh triangular flag that is hoisted outside most gurdwaras) was installed there. When we came to know that some of our farmers had gone there, we appealed to them and ensured their return. The small thing is being exaggerated to defame the agitation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-unions-blame-kmsc-for-digressing-from-route-taking-rally-to-red-fort-101611737434692.html
27-01-2021||India||BJP MLA blames Sonia Gandhi, Rahul for tractor parade violence, Cong hits back||BJP MLA Surendra Singh has alleged that violence during the farmers' tractors parade in the national capital had taken place on the directions of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and demanded that a case of sedition be lodged against those involved in the violence.Hitting back, Uttar Pradesh Congress media coordinator Lalan Kumar charged that the BJP government was responsible for the violence and said the BJP MLA's statement shows his "mental bankruptcy".The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.Speaking with reporters on Tuesday night, the BJP MLA said, "The act of violence during tractor parade is condemnable. A case of sedition should be lodged and strict action should be taken against those involved in the act".Asking the party leadership to take strict action against those involved, Singh alleged, "There is foreign hand behind the violence. The incident had taken place on directions of Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Congress leaders not expressing any regret over the incident proves that."Reacting strongly to the allegation, Kumar charged "The BJP government, Home Ministry, police and intelligence agencies were responsible for whatever happened during the tractor parade"."For bringing bad name to the agitation some persons intruded in the guise of farmers. Deep Sidhu is an example. Sidhu was representative of BJP MP Sunny Deol...BJP should tell how Sidhu is related with it and what punishment will he be getting for whatever he did at Red Fort," Kumar said.Deol has said he has no link with Sidhu.Expressing anguish over the violence in the national capital during the farmers' tractor parade, the Congress had said on Tuesday that there is no place for such incidents in a democracy, even as it urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "shun arrogance" and repeal the three farm laws.UP Minister for Backward Welfare, Anil Rajbhar had said on Tuesday that "those protesting in Delhi are not farmers but middlemen-type people, who stand exposed after the incident.""The work of farmers is not to protest on roads with their tractors. They always work in their fields. They are protesting laws passed in Parliament," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-mla-blames-sonia-gandhi-rahul-for-tractor-parade-violence-cong-hits-back-101611734729719.html

The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border site that killed 20 Indian troops.TikTok had committed to spend $1 billion in the region. Before the ban it had become one of the fastest-growing social media apps in India, once its largest market in terms of users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-tiktok-ban-bytedance-says-cutting-india-workforce-unsure-of-comeback-101611734497947.html

Let IB's stand be filed on record before this court categorically stating whether any report was prepared by it in 2009 or shortly thereafter (regarding the Mumbai train blasts case) and placed before the then Minister of Home Affairs. Affidavit be filed in four weeks and rejoinder thereto in two weeks thereafter," the court said and listed the matter for hearing on April 13.In the earlier matter, the high court had said the Central Information Commission (CIC) "erroneously" concluded that the information sought by Siddique did not pertain to allegations of corruption or human rights violation and asked it to consider his request afresh.However, before the CIC, the IB stated that there was no such report as claimed by the convict and the commission, thereafter, dismissed his plea on June 11, 2019.Siddique, in his plea filed through advocate Arpit Bhargava, has sought setting aside of the June 11, 2019 order of CIC claiming that the CIC took the decision by "blindly" trusting IB's statement that there was no report of 2009.Bhargava told the court that the IB filed an affidavit in July 2019 before CIC stating no such report existed only after the plea was dismissed.The IB, represented by central government counsel Rahul Sharma and advocate C K Bhatt, opposed the plea saying Siddique's claims were based on news reports.They also told the high court that the CIC had accepted the IB stand that there was no such report.Siddique, presently lodged in the Nagpur Central Jail, has claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case which amounts to violation of his human rights and therefore, he needed the IB report which purportedly called for review of the evidence in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-there-is-no-2009-report-on-2006-mumbai-train-blasts-case-hc-to-ib-101611733699013.html

Attorney General KK Venugopal mentioned the judgment passed by a single judge of Nagpur bench of Bombay HC on January 19. By this order, the court acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year old girl. The HC on appeal acquitted him of this charge and held him guilty only under molestation punishable with one year under IPC Section 354.The three-judge bench headed by CJI SA Bobde issued notice to the accused and Maharashtra government to reply within two weeks. “Meanwhile, we stay the acquittal of accused in regard to Section 8 of POCSO,” said the bench also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian. Also read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, others on plea against electronic mediaThe AG said, “The order is very disturbing and is likely to set a dangerous precedent.” He requested the court to take suo motu cognizance as he was in the process of filing a petition against the order.The bench permitted the AG to file a petition and stayed the acquittal of the man.The HC had held that no offence under Section 8 of POCSO was made out as there was no physical contact. The man was accused of groping the girl and removing her salwar.The AG said, “It is an unprecedented order as it will mean that if a cloth is touched, no case under Section 8 is made out. This court must take notice of the judgement.”The accused was earlier convicted by a trial court under Section 8 of POCSO and sentenced to three years.

The judgment sets a dangerous precedent, the advocate general has said.The stay order came as attorney general KK Venugopal mentioned the judgment in front of a CJI-led bench on Wednesday. The bench permitted the AG to file an appropriate petition against the order.The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court observed that pressing of the breast of a child does not constitute "sexual assault" under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act as there was no skin to skin touch. The verdict drew flak from activists and the National Commission for Women challenged the verdict in the Supreme Court.The verdict was passed on January 19 by Justice Pushpa Ganediwala where it was said that there must be skin-to-skin contact with sexual intent for an act to be considered sexual assault.Here is all you need to know about the order and the controversy surrounding it> The order said as per the definition of sexual assault, a 'physical contact with sexual intent without penetration' is an essential ingredient of the offence.> The order said the act of groping falls under the definition of offence but not a sexual assault as there was no specific data as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast etc.> The National Commission for Women said the judgment will not only have a cascading effect on various provisions involving the safety and security of women in general but will also subject all women to ridicule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-bombay-hc-s-no-skin-touch-no-assault-verdict-101611732122097.html
27-01-2021||India||Sasikala released; AIADMK puts up show of strength at Jayalalithaa’s memorial||Late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s close aide and expelled AIADMK leader VK Sasikala is formally free after serving her four-year prison sentence in the disproportionate assets case in the Bengaluru Parappana Agrahara Central Jail but she remains hospitalised for Covid-19 at the Victoria hospital. Prison authorities were in the hospital on Wednesday morning to complete the formalities of Sasikala’s release. Her family is in Bengaluru and her return to Chennai is yet to be decided based on her health condition. Meanwhile, even as Sasikala completed prison formalities, her party--the AIADMK from which she was expelled in 2017-- put up a huge show of strength in Chennai with a sea of party cadre and senior leaders while chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami inaugurated a 80-crore phoenix-themed memorial for Jayalalithaa on the Marina beach where she is buried. AIADMK has decided not to take Sasikala back and the inauguration was strategically timed with her release. Also read | Stalin accuses AIADMK govt of putting on hold projects brought during DMK ruleIt is being seen as a way to boost cadre morale and send a political message to Sasikala, Opposition parties and the public that the AIADMK is united under the dual leadership of Palaniswami and his deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam with assembly elections slated for April-May. “We have to work hard to win a third term as our tribute to Amma (Jayalalithaa),” Palaniswami said at the inauguration. Incidentally, when Sasikala was on her way to the prison from Chennai to Bengaluru in February 2017, she had stopped at Jayalalithaa’s burial place, thumped her palm on the ground thrice and dramatically taken a vow.Palanisami is the chief minister candidate for the AIADMK-led NDA alliance in Tamil Nadu. He reiterated earlier this month, in Delhi after meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that Sasikala has ceased to be an AIADMK member and will not be re-inducted. While a section of Sasikala’s supporters expect her back, another section wants the status quo to remain. Though Sasikala has never campaigned or contested, she was a powerful behind-the-scenes operator during her three-decade association with Jayalalithaa. After the latter’s death, she briefly held the reigns of the party as interim general secretary and was set to become chief minister before she was convicted. Saisikala appointed her then loyalist Palaniswami to be chief minister. But he joined hands with O Paneerselvam who had revolted against her and the two factions under them merged and the AIADMK expelled Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran in 2017. Dinakaran got elected as an independent MLA from Jayalalithaa’s seat left vacant with her death. Subsequently, he floated the AMMK which has a 4% vote share in the 2019 elections.

There will be gaping gaps in the different translations," he claimed and added that even the Constitution does not say that the notification has to be translated in all the languages.The court, however, did not agree with the stand, saying "in modern day it cannot be a factually impossible task", but asked the government to indicate the difficulties it has in translating the draft EIA in all the languages.The bench, during the hearing, also said that the Constitution says the final notification may not be translated in all the languages, but it does not say anything about the draft which is put out for receiving public opinion."We don't understand why the Union government is resisting vehemently an order of this court for translating the draft into all the languages so that everyone can understand it and respond to it," it further said.The court gave the government time till February 25, the next date of hearing, to place on record its difficulties in translating the draft in all the languages.The bench was hearing the government's plea seeking review of its June 30, 2020 direction to the Environment Ministry to translate the draft EIA notification in all the 22 languages within 10 days of the order and had also extended till August 11 the time for receiving remarks from the public.The June 30, 2020 order had come on a PIL by environmental conservationist Vikrant Tongad seeking publication of the notification in all vernacular languages and also extension of the time to receive public comments on it.The June 30 order was initially challenged by the ministry in the Supreme Court which allowed the government to withdraw its appeal and instead file a review before the high court.The apex court also put on hold the proceedings in the contempt plea filed by Tongad for non-compliance of the June 30 direction.Subsequently, the ministry filed a plea seeking review of the June 30 order on grounds that official documents are required to be published only in Hindi and English. During the hearing on Wednesday, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Tongad, told the court that while the draft has been translated in all the languages by the government, it was not publishing the same and wanted to argue on whether such translations was required under the law.The draft EIA 2020, according to Tongad's plea, provides for post facto approval of projects and does away with public consultation in some cases.The petition by Tongad had claimed that the draft EIA 2020 completely supersedes and replaces the existing environmental norms."This draft notification proposes significant changes to the existing regime, including removing public consultation entirely in certain instances, reducing the time for public consultation from 45 days to 40 days, and allowing post facto approvals for projects," it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-questions-centre-s-resistance-to-draft-eia-in-all-vernacular-languages-101611730545971.html

However, other union leaders v passed the blame on to outsiders.Tourism minister Prahlad Patel visit Red Fort, condemns action of farmers'Deep Sidhu-BJP connection'The name of Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu, who was a former aide of BJP MP Sunny Deol, has cropped up in the aftermath of the violence. Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait has put the blame on Deep Sidhu. "Deep Sidhu is not a Sikh, he is a worker of the BJP. There is a picture of him with the Prime Minister. This is a movement of farmers and will remain so. Some people will have to leave this place immediately- those who broke barricading will never be a part of the movement," he said.'Unfurling flag not our plan'Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee's SS Pandher said unfurling the flag at the Red Fort was not part of the farmers' programme. "Some miscreants joined the protest to defame farmers' movement. We did not plan to unfurl the flags at Red Fort, this was not our program. Deep Sidhu's photo with the PM has floated, we had already expressed doubt over him," he said.What is the photo that farmers leaders are referring to? The photo dates back to the time when Deep Sidhu was a close associate of Sunny Deol. Several verified Twitter handles shared those photos on Wednesday.Deep Sidhu, meanwhile, has accepted putting up the flag but asserted that it should not be given any communal colour as it was not a planned move.

One person died in the incident.Secretary-General Guterres’ spokesman Stephane Dujarric, in his response to a question on the violence in New Delhi during his daily press briefing on Tuesday, said: “As we say in many of these cases, I think it's important to respect peaceful protests, freedom of assembly and non-violence”.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 41 farmer unions, is leading the protest against the three central farm laws at several border points of Delhi.The Kisan Morcha has disassociated itself from those who indulged in violence during the tractor parade and alleged that some "antisocial elements" infiltrated their otherwise peaceful movement.It has called a meeting later on Wednesday to discuss the violence that broke out during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/important-to-respect-peaceful-protests-un-chief-s-spokesman-on-farmers-stir-101611729591826.html
27-01-2021||India||Security tight at Red Fort after clashes with farmers||Hundreds of police guarded the historic Red Fort in the heart of the Indian capital on Wednesday following violent clashes between farmers and authorities in which one person was killed and at least 80 injured.Tens of thousands of farmers, protesting against reforms of the agriculture sector that they say benefit big private buyers at the expense of growers, have been camped on the outskirts of the city for two months to demand the reforms be scrapped.A protest parade of tractors around the city's fringes to coincide with Tuesday's Republic Day celebrations turned to chaos when some farmers diverged from agreed routes, breaking through barricades and clashing with police, who used tear gas and batons to try to restrain them.Some farmers carrying ceremonial swords reached as far as the Red Fort, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives an annual speech, where they scaled outer walls and hoisted flags.By Tuesday evening police, had removed protesters from the fort complex but a heavy security presence remained on Wednesday.Agriculture employs about half of India's population of 1.3 billion, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest tests Modi has faced since coming to power in 2014.While the protests are beginning to undermine support for Modi in the countryside, he retains a solid majority in parliament and his government has shown no sign of bending to farmers' demands.The government says agriculture reform will open up new opportunities for farmers.Police said they had registered 22 cases against protesters including "rioting, damage to public property and assault on public servants with deadly weapons" in several locations.Roads across the New Delhi remained closed while extra police, including paramilitary were at protest sites on the outskirts.The government blocked the internet in some parts of the capital, and mobile speeds were low.Tuesday's violence was condemned by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the group of farm unions organising the protests, who they have promised to press on with their sit-ins on the outskirts."They have to listen to us," said protester Baljeet Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-tight-at-red-fort-after-clashes-with-farmers-101611728864748.html

27-01-2021||India||India’s unusual Covid vaccine problem: Shots in abundance, but few takers||Most of the world is struggling to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their populations. India has the opposite problem: Plenty of shots, but a shortage of people willing to take them.As India rolls out one of the world’s biggest inoculation programs, some health-care and other frontline workers are hesitating because of safety concerns over a vaccine that has yet to complete phase III trials. As of Monday, only about 56% of people eligible to get the shot have stepped forward in a nation with the world’s second-worst Covid-19 outbreak.Unless the inoculation rate significantly increases, India will fall far short of its target of inoculating 300 million people -- or about a quarter of the population -- by July. That will setback global efforts to contain the virus and snuff out optimism that a recovery is taking root in an economy set for its biggest annual contraction in records going back to 1952.“At least 40% of doctors here are unsure and want to wait,” said Vinod Kumar, a resident doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences of Patna, in the eastern state of Bihar. “Carrying out a vaccine trial on us when India is short of doctors, health-care workers doesn’t make sense.”While vaccine hesitancy has surfaced in places like Japan and Brazil, and China’s candidates have also faced questions over data, the scale of the problem in India is by far the biggest. The major difficulties facing places like the U.S. and Europe are mostly due to scarce supplies rather than vaccine acceptance, and some countries are turning to New Delhi for help: India says it can produce 500 million shots per month for export, and countries such as the U.K., Belgium and Saudi Arabia have sought to buy them.India’s domestic vaccine program administers one of two shots: the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Ltd., or the Covaxin shot developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd., a private company based in Hyderabad. India’s approval of the Bharat Biotech shot, which was developed with government-backed research groups, was met with widespread criticism from scientists because of the lack of complete data.“Many in our institute aren’t comfortable with Covaxin because we don’t know how effective it is,” said Adarsh Pratap Singh, a member of the Resident Doctors Association at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. “To build trust among people the government must come out with the data, evidence of the trials, and encourage free and fair discussions.”Both the company and the government have defended the shot. Krishna Ella, Bharat Biotech’s chairman, said earlier this month that the company carried out “200% honest clinical trials” and had a track record of producing 16 safe and effective vaccines. “Indian scientists want to bash on other Indian scientists,” he said while dismissing criticisms in a virtual press briefing on Jan. 4. A spokesperson for Bharat Biotech didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The government, meanwhile, has urged health-care workers to get vaccinated. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has sent tweets imploring “#CoronaWarriors” to take the shot, while dispelling rumors that the vaccine could cause infertility. A federal health ministry spokesperson wasn’t immediately available to comment.“Vaccine hesitancy among health workers should end -- I am pleading on behalf of the government, that please adopt it, because no one knows how this pandemic will take shape in the future,” said V. K. Paul, a member of the planning body Niti Aayog, noting that he’s taken the Covaxin shot without any adverse effects.“These two vaccines are safe,” he said. “We have a system to track it and if there is an unusual signal, it will be responded to the way it should be.”Initial apprehension and doubt at the start of any vaccine rollout is normal, said Preeti Sudan, former secretary at the federal ministry of health and family welfare. India was successful in its polio immunization program, she noted, after launching a massive campaign involving children, mothers and opinion leaders to help dispel vaccine fears.Low Vaccination RatesAs of Monday, India distributed about 2 million shots nationwide. In Madhya Pradesh, the largest state in central India, about 75% of enrolled people turned up for vaccination on Jan. 21, while two days later in Bihar the rate was much lower at 51.6%. On Jan. 19, about 55% of those eligible were vaccinated in Rajasthan and 54% in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, according to state government data.While the hesitation relates to both vaccines, people are most wary about Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. In Tamil Nadu, for example, only 23.5% of those allocated Covaxin received the shots on Jan. 19, compared with 56% for the Serum Institute’s Covishield, the data show.Nirmalya Mohapatra, a doctor at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in New Delhi, plans to “wait and watch” for more clarity before getting vaccinated with Bharat Biotech’s shot. If given a choice now, he would opt for Covishield, as its efficacy data was reviewed by leading medical journals.“Covaxin could turn out to be a better vaccine in the future,” said Mohapatra, who is also vice president of the resident doctors’ association at the hospital. “But for now there is some apprehension because of the lack of a complete trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-unusual-covid-vaccine-problem-shots-in-abundance-but-few-takers-101611724716011.html

27-01-2021||India||SC to hear plea by ‘Tandav’ actor, makers against FIRs today||The Supreme Court will today hear petitions filed by actor Zeeshan Ayyub, Amazon Prime (India) creative head and the makers of the web series ‘Tandav’, seeking protection from arrest in the seven FIRs registered against them over allegations of hurting religious sentiments and telecasting objectionable content.A bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, will take up three petitions, filed separately by Ayyub, Amazon Prime creative head Aparna Purohit and another one moved jointly by the producer and director of the Over The Top (OTT) series. Other judges on the bench include justices R Subhash Reddy and MR Shah.The petitions are likely to be argued by a team of senior advocates led by veteran lawyer Fali S Nariman. The petitions have requested the top court to club all the seven FIRs and transfer them to a court in Mumbai. Out of seven FIRs, three FIRs are pending in Uttar Pradesh at Lucknow, Greater Noida and Shahjahanpur – for the alleged inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, deities, and adverse portrayal of a character playing the role of prime minister in the show. Also read | Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, others on plea against electronic mediaTwo FIRs have been registered in Madhya Pradesh while one FIR each was lodged in Karnataka and Bihar. Apart from the FIRs, at least three other criminal complaints are pending in Maharashtra, Delhi and Chandigarh respectively.The petitions coming up for hearing today have maintained that it would cause severe harassment to those associated with ‘Tandav’ to face prosecution in various states and that it would be just and fair to club all the cases at one place, preferably in Mumbai which is the ordinary place of residence for the petitioners.Seeking protection from arrest till all the FIRs are clubbed and sent to one court, the petitions have added that the apex court should stay all the coercive action against them for the time being. Earlier, the Bombay high court had granted a transit pre-arrest bail to series director Ali Abbas Zafar, producer Himanshu Mehra,writer Gaurav Solanki, and Purohit against whom a case was registered in Lucknow for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through the web series. ‘Tandav’, a nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Ayyub, started streaming recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-plea-by-tandav-actor-makers-against-firs-today-101611719553765.html

27-01-2021||India||Centre plans to map and assess anganwadis, shelters for women||The Union women and child development ministry plans to map and assess anganwadis (rural child care centre) and swadhar grehs (shelters for distressed women) to address any functional problems through focused interventions, officials familiar with the matter said.The proposed move comes after the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS) showed an alarming rise in the number of children with stunted growth across 11 states. Meghalaya (46.5%) recorded the steepest rise, followed by Bihar (42.9%). The population of underweight children has also increased.The government is yet to decide which body will conduct the survey. Officials said that organisations affiliated to the UN were earlier considered but the idea was later dropped.According to government data, there are over 1.3 million anganwadis and other child-care centres with a strength of over 1.2 million workers and more than 1.1 million helpers. There are 419 shelters for distressed women with 12,608 workers. These centres are run under centrally sponsored schemes, but the state governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) manage them.“The assessment was approved last November,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “It will help us identify the problem areas and to resolve them.”Also read | Gross enrolment ratio of girls in schools improved from 2014-15 to 2018-19: WCDThe official added that the assessment of the anganwadis could lead to the restructuring of the funding system to focus on the vulnerable areas. “...we can also identify which states and centres need more help.”HT reached out to a ministry spokesperson and the office of women and child development minister Smriti Irani for comments but did not receive any responses immediately.Anganwadis were set up in 1975 to tackle malnutrition. They provide supplementary nutrition, pre-school, non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-ups and referral services to children under six, adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating mothers.Women in distress can stay at swadhar grehs for a maximum of three years or before they turn 60. The ministry’s website cites an over-dependence on NGOs and state governments among the challenges the swadhar grehs face.Enakshi Ganguly, a co-founder of HAQ Centre for Child Rights, said anganwadis often face issues related to space and accessibility. “There are proper and mini anganwadi centres. We do not have an idea of how anganwadis centres are run. It would be good to do a 21st-century assessment. The NFHS is a signal for us to look at the anganwadi programme.” Gaguly added it is better if a sort of an audit is done.” How the survey will be conducted will be a challenge as all the centres are run in different ways, with food needs being different for different states. The study must take all of these challenges into account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-to-map-and-assess-anganwadis-shelters-for-women-101611717453575.html
27-01-2021||India||Mumbai locals: Why Maharashtra govt is taking time to resume trains for all||From January 29 onwards, the number of Mumbai local trains in operation will return to its pre-Covid figures, but the services will be limited to only those who have been allowed to travel by the suburban railways during various phases of unlocking.APPEALPassengers as permitted by Ministry of Railways & Govt of Maharashtra are ONLY allowed to travel by the suburban trains.Others are requested not to rush to the Rly stations.Please adhere all norms, SOPs related to COVID19 during boarding, travel & at destination.Here is all you need to know:> From Friday, there will be 2,985 services on Mumbai Suburban network. The existing number is 2,781. Out of these, Central Railway will increase the suburban services from the existing 1,580 to 1,685 services and Western Railway will increase the existing 1,201 suburban services to 1,300 services.> The decision was taken on Monday after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray reviewed the situation and gave a go-ahead to the railways.> The augmented service will help in ensuring that there is no crowding.> Who all can travel? There has been no new relaxation in this regard. Emergency staff, women, lawyers who have been allowed to travel by Mumbai metro in the past few months will only travel.> Since the number of passengers is increasing with the gradual unlocking and the ongoing vaccination drive, the move is aimed at ensuring there is no overcrowding.When will Mumbai local trains be open for the general public?> However, the move is being seen as a precursor to open the locals for all in the coming days as the chief minister has also said that the locals will be open for all soon.> The decision to reopen local trains for all rests with the state government which is not rushing though pressure has been mounting from commuters.As the state became an epicentre of Covid-19 infections last year, the state government is taking measured and cautious steps in unlocking. Mumbai locals are the lifeline of the metropolitan and as most of the offices have opened, the number of passengers has been on the rise.Local train services for essential staff resumed on June 15 after it was completely shut in March. From October, Mumbai locals allowed women passengers between 11am to 3pm and after 7pm till the last train. In October, the railway authorities also permitted lawyers to travel in local trains except during morning peak hours between 8am and 11am and from 4pm to 7pm in the evening. In November, teachers, as well as non-teaching school staff, were allowed to board suburban trains. In December, practising lawyers and registered clerks of advocates were permitted to travel even during morning peak hours.

27-01-2021||India||Actor Deep Sidhu blamed for violence||Senior farm leaders and politicians on Tuesday evening blamed 36-year-old Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu for inciting violence during the Republic Day tractor rally in Delhi.Sidhu was summoned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) two weeks ago in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice.Farm leaders alleged Sidhu — who earlier publicly aired his differences with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha — tried to defame the farmers’ stir. “We condemn this act of Deep Sidhu in strong words and we think that he was working as a government agent. We didn’t have any plans to go to Red Fort but he did not follow our guidelines and even misled some youth,” said Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni.Other leaders said Sidhu attempted to wrest back the limelight after being sidelined by farm unions. “He [Sidhu] posted a video claiming responsibility and justifying the act. Those who hoisted the flag at Red Fort were allowed a free passage as part of a conspiracy,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan.The controversy began with a Facebook video posted from the actor’s account around 2pm in which Sidhu could be seen along with his supporters at the Red Fort. Many of them held the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and a young man could be seen climbing a flagstaff in the background, with the ‘kesari’ flag in hand.“He is the front face of Khalistan and the role he played on Republic day has made it clear,” said Ravneet Singh Bittu, Congress parliamentarian from Ludhiana.Sidhu posted another video on Facebook at 5.40pm, where he admitted to hoisting the Nishan Sahib flag but said that he had done nothing wrong.But farm leaders were not convinced. “Deep Sidhu, who was the election agent of Bharatiya Janta Party candidate Sunny Deol and whose picture with Narendra Modi went viral on social media, led the charge at Red Fort [on Tuesday], according to TV visuals. This clearly points to an element of sabotage,” said Hannan Mollah, the leader of All India Kisan Sabha and a member of Samyukt Kisan Morcha.In 2019, Sidhu campaigned for BJP candidate Sunny Deol, who went on to win the Gurdaspur constituency. He was very close to Deol’s family, but later, Deol dissociated himself from Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-deep-sidhu-blamed-for-violence-101611704249786.html
27-01-2021||India||Law student writes to CJI to take cognisance of Red Fort violence||A law student on Tuesday wrote a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde urging him to take suo motu cognisance of the violence that took place at the Red Fort during the farmers’ protest in the national capital on Republic DayHundreds of farmers climbed the ramparts of Red Fort and hoisted religious flags (the Nishan Sahib of Sikhs), vandalised almost anything they could lay their hands on, fought a pitched battle with the police, throwing some of them into trenches, and tried to ram tractors into others.Requesting a Special Investigation Committee inquiry, Mumbai University student Ashish Rai said in the letter:“The way the flag of another community has been waved in place of the national flag of India, hurting the honour and dignity of the country, is a shameful event. And the whole country is also hurt by this incident, as the national flag has been insulted.”Rai stated that the incident has hurt the “country’s devotional spirit” and an inquiry is essential to determine how anti-social elements managed to enter the tractor rally.“It is, therefore, a humble request to the Supreme Court that a Special Investigation Committee be formed on this entire matter to conduct a rigorous inquiry against the anti-social elements involved in this unconstitutional activity so as to punish the accused,” Rai stated in his letter.It will be open for the Court to take note of the letter and convert it into a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) or take suo moto cognisance of the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-student-writes-to-cji-to-take-cognisance-of-red-fort-violence-101611702807349.html
27-01-2021||India||Home minister takes stock of situation in urgent meet||As groups of stick-wielding farmers on Tuesday clashed with the police and forced their way inside the iconic Red Fort to hoist a flag, Union home minister Amit Shah convened an urgent review meeting with senior officials, including home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar to assess law and order in the National Capital Region.Shah directed that additional central paramilitary forces be deployed in Delhi with immediate effect and individuals and groups behind the Red Fort seize be brought to justice, people familiar with the development said. The home minister was supposed to join his colleagues at the President’s ceremonial At Home event, which is a biannual gathering of ministers, diplomats, top bureaucrats in the lawns of Rashtrapati Bhawan after Republic Day and Independence Day, but had to skip it due to the situation that was unfolding.One of the officials cited above said intelligence agencies as well as the foreign ministry are particularly concerned over farmers hoisting a flag from the staff of Red Fort, from where India’s Prime Minister usually unfurls the national flag every year on Independence Day. In particular, the concerns were triggered by several Pakistani twitter accounts celebrating the incident. One of the handles purportedly belonged to All Pakistan Muslim League (APML), founded by former Pakistan President Pervez Musharaff, which said the flag hoisted by farmers was as a ‘Khalistani flag’. The claim could not be verified but agencies began monitoring social media.The government also decided to suspend internet for 12 hours at the five border points where protesters gathered - Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri, Mukarba Chowk and Nangloi.One of the officials said that additional 1,500 to 2,000 paramilitary forces’ jawans are being deployed in Delhi. Around 4,500 paramilitary personnel were already deployed for law and order duties before the Republic Day along with the Delhi Police.Delhi Police had given permission to the farmers protesting against Centre’s three farm laws to conduct their tractor rally on some pre-selected routes but several groups deviated, determined to reach the heart of the Capital.The umbrella body of 41 farmers union, protesting against the laws since November 28 at Delhi borders, distanced itself from what they said were acts by anti-social elements.According to a second security official, the challenge for them was to move farmers out of the Red Fort and from their protest points inside the city to acceptable areas of protest. They wanted to achieve this in a manner that would be firm and yet peaceful. When asked if there had been any laxity in security, an official of the Intelligence Bureau said farmers had backed out of undertakings they had given. “This wasn’t the first time that the farmers had resorted to a form of violence. When they were first trying to come to Delhi at the beginning of the agitation, they had broken barriers then too,” said the official, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-minister-takes-stock-of-situation-in-urgent-meet-101611701224423.html
27-01-2021||India||Smaller crowd, masks mark Republic Day celebrations||Mandatory masks, a smaller crowd, fewer participants, shortened route, and contactless formations were some of the changes observed during the 72nd Republic Day held in the wake of Covid-19 on Tuesday.While more than 100,000 people attended the parade during the previous years, with Covid-19 norms in place on Tuesday, the crowd was limited to 25,000.As per the advisory, children below the age of 15 were also not permitted at the parade. The size of the marching contingents from the armed forces and the paramilitary were also smaller. The route of the parade was also shortened and ended at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort.For the first time in at least five decades, the Republic Day celebrations, seen as a high point in India’s diplomatic calendar, did not have a chief guest. The last time the parade did not have a chief guest was in 1966. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson – the dignitary invited this year – had cancelled his planned visit to India to focus on countering a recent surge in Covid-19 infections in Britain.From sanitiser dispensers at multiple entrances to security personnel donning PPE kits, the venue of the parade at Rajpath ensured Covid-19 protocols were followed. Special Covid-19 booths with beds and emergency medical equipment were also present at the spot. Security officials deployed at the spot ensured that people maintained distance while standing in queues or while speaking to one another.Dr Sarath Kumar, 28, who works at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said he had come for the parade for the first time. “They are enforcing Covid-19 protocols like physical distancing strictly and even the seats are stationed at a 6 ft distance. There were multiple entry points to avoid overcrowding and the entire arrangement was good. The interesting part of the parade was the air force formations and the participants exercising precaution,” he said.Another visitor Harshita Malik, 30, a PhD student from Rohtak, said it was important to maintain traditions. “Celebrating the Republic Day was important as it is a part of our tradition. The Covid-19 risk can be mitigated if we follow all protocols. The arrangements here ensured that we sat at a distance from one another so I think it was a good idea to not cancel the parade.”In the absence of the motorcycle stunts, which received the maximum applause from the audience in previous years, the loudest cheers this year were reserved for the National Security Guard (NSG) commandos and the Rafale jets, which participated in the parade for the first time.Ranjan Kumar, 37, whose brother was CRPF personnel who lost his life in the 2017 Sukma attack, said, “Seeing the Rafale jet was the best part of the parade. Experiencing it in person is different from seeing it in videos.”Another popular attraction during this year’s parade was the “Atma-Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan: Covid” tableau put up by the department of biotechnology, which depicted the process of vaccine development through five steps. From virus isolation to vaccine production and clinical trials, the tableau showcased various stages of vaccine development bringing in cheers and applause from the audience.This is also the first time a tableau from the Union Territory of Ladakh was displayed at the parade.The tableau from Uttar Pradesh (which showed Ayodhya and the Ram Mandir) and the one from Delhi (which showed the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk) also received massive cheers from the crowd.Flight lieutenant Bhawana Kanth was the first woman fighter pilot to take part in the Indian Air Force’s (IAF’s) tableau at this year’s Republic Day parade and Captain Preeti Choudhary was the only woman army officer to lead a contingent. She led the upgraded Schilika weapon system, which also featured at the Republic Day Parade for the first time.Meanwhile, Delhi recorded 157 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, the fifth time the daily incidences’ count stood below the 200-mark in January, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.24 per cent.The infection tally in the city stood at 6.34 lakh and the death toll mounted to 10,820 with seven new fatalities, the authorities said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/smaller-crowd-masks-mark-republic-day-celebrations-101611701009857.html
27-01-2021||India||Leaders condemn violence, Opposition seeks repeal of laws||Opposition parties on Tuesday sought to mount pressure on the Union government after violence erupted during a protest by farmers who are opposing three new agricultural laws, but a section of the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) maintained that the chaos on Delhi’s streets hinted at the role of “vested interests”.Senior BJP leaders went into a huddle with party chief JP Nadda, general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and other senior leaders, including Rajya Sabha member and party general secretary Arun Singh, attending a meeting at the BJP headquarters in the Capital, said a person who did not want to be named.No details were shared about the meeting, but the functionary cited above said party leaders found similarities between the Republic Day protests and those against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, or CAA, in late 2019 and early 2020 that turned violent on occasions.A second senior leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the protests “corroborated” what the party had been alleging — that “anti-national elements” infiltrated the demonstrations. This functionary said there was a sense in the party that the protests were being fuelled by those with “vested interests”, and that the government’s outreach efforts were being “stonewalled”.The Opposition, including the Congress, alleges that the government rushed the farm laws without proper discussion in Parliament. The Centre, however, says the reforms will lead to new opportunities in agriculture trade.Former BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao tweeted: “In Indian democracy u can have a mobilisation challenging govt on policies...sometimes it may appear as humiliating for d leaders who’re at helms but u can’t have a situation where its challenging d sovereignty of country n questioning d spirit of Indian Republic.”The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) condemned the violence. In a statement, RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi said: “The violence and disturbances unleashed in Delhi today, the sacred Republic Day, are extremely painful and deplorable...RSS appeals to all countrymen to rise above political and ideological differences & to strive for peace as a priority.”In the Opposition camp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was not the solution to any problem, but asked the Centre to meet the demand of the farmers by repealing the laws. “...No matter who gets hurt, the country will suffer a damage. Take back the anti-agricultural laws in national interest,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.A statement by his party said: “The Congress party and the entire country is pained by today’s violence and unruly incidents in Delhi.”Former Union agriculture minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar took a potshot at the Centre.“No one will support such violence, but then the question arises: who forced them to indulge in such acts? It was the responsibility of the central government to talk to the farmers and solve this impasse,” he told the media in Mumbai.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted: “Deeply disturbed by worrying and painful developments that have unfolded on the streets of Delhi. Centre’s insensitive attitude and indifference towards our farmer brothers and sisters has to be blamed for this situation.”Punjab CM Amarinder Singh tweeted: “Shocking scenes in Delhi. The violence by some elements is unacceptable. It’ll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. Kisan leaders have disassociated themselves & suspended #TractorRally. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi & return to borders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leaders-condemn-violence-opposition-seeks-repeal-of-laws-101611700790308.html
27-01-2021||India||House canteen dishes out new menu, hikes prices||A buffet lunch for ₹700 to aloo bonda for ₹10—Indian parliament’s canteen will dish out an elaborate menu this budget session for every palate and budget.The parliament canteen, now run by ITDC will offer as many as 58 items, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, from January 27, an internal circular said. The price tags, however, don’t smell of subsidy. For many years, the parliament canteen had tried to strike a balance between quality and price but for the first time, the food will not be subsidised.While vegetarian biriyani is priced at ₹50, chicken biriyani will cost ₹100. A vegetarian meal (thali) will now be available for ₹100, mutton biriyani at ₹150 and fish and chips at ₹110.The menu is new, and the prices are higher. While the chicken biriyani will cost ₹30 more than the current rate and its mutton counterpart, ₹50 more, the new items include fish and chips, medu vada, mutton cutlet, omelette, masala poori and uttapam. A small plate of green salad, earlier available for ₹10, will now cost ₹25.Last year, the contract with the Northern Railways to run the canteen was scrapped. Top officials indicated that cost control and a better menu were the prime reasons for such a move.“The northern railways people in the parliament canteen were paid nearly ₹1 lakh each monthly by Parliament to run the canteen. We felt that the cost should be reduced,” said a parliament official who asked not to be named. Northern Railway has been serving food in the canteen since 1968.During a normal session, an average 4,500 people eat at Parliament every day. According to data available with officials, out of ₹17 crore annual subsidy, only ₹24 lakh is spent on MPs. The rest goes towards underwriting food for security personnel, officials, even visitors.A Lok Sabha MP, preferring anonymity, welcomed the Speaker’s decision to rationalize food prices and said, “It’s a good move and it will help shed the misconception that we, lawmakers, eat subsidized food in Parliament.” “The fact is most legislators eat at home as they live near the Parliament complex,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-canteen-dishes-out-new-menu-hikes-prices-101611699738629.html
27-01-2021||India||Discussing a possible route for Amarnath via Kargil: Prahlad Patel||Union minister for culture and tourism Prahlad Patel spoke to Deeksha Bhardwaj about the Central government’s plans to address the development imbalance between Leh and Kargil, and talks on mapping a new Amarnath Yatra route via Kargil instead of Srinagar, among other issues. Edited excerpts:There is large gap between development in Leh and Kargil. How does the government plan to address that?You have caught the core issue. The difference in development existed when Jammu & Kashmir was a state. It is true that it has been discriminated against. Ever since it has become a UT, we have addressed many problems such as a weak bureaucracy an easing clearance norms. We are setting up a branch of the Indian Institute of Skiing and mountaineering, Gulmarg, here as well. The institute may be named after Subhas Chandra Bose -- talks are on.Opposition parties have accused BJP of playing vote-bank politics using Bose ahead of the Bengal elections. Your response to that?We celebrated Netaji’s 125th birth anniversary. Those making these allegations, whether it is Congress, TMC or the Left, should answer why they never honoured Bose. It is Prime Minister Narendra Modi who spearheaded the move to celebrate his anniversary as Parakram Diwas every year, and inaugurated its first edition. No other PM has become a chairman for any board other than the one set up for Mahatma Gandhi. This is the first time. The Opposition should tell us what they have done so far.The government talks about making Kargil an adventure sports destination, but locals say they face an equipment crunch?The government is addressing the lack of equipment in Kargil. I met Mohammed Mehdi, the 10-year-old who wishes to play in the Winter Olympics. The government will fully sponsor his training. It is true that it will take some time to reach international standards, but we are working in that direction.Are there plans to promote tourism in Kargil?Once the Zojila tunnel is completed, Kargil’s situation will be completely altered. We are also discussing a possible route for the Amarnath pilgrimage via Kargil, instead of Srinagar. It is a more scenic and comfortable route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/discussing-a-possible-route-for-amarnath-via-kargil-prahlad-patel-101611698124960.html
27-01-2021||India||Rally to langar: Peaceful stir held across 20 states||Farm bodies and unions across the country carried out protests, including tractor rallies, that were largely peaceful on Tuesday, in contrast to the violence seen in Delhi where farmers deviated from previously agreed-upon routes, broke through barricades, and stormed the Red Fort.Around the country, protests were reported from at least 20 states as farmers took out rallies and held gatherings in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and even Himachal Pradesh, among others, to protest against the three farm laws passed by the Centre in September last year.In Punjab, farmers held a tractor parade in districts such as Patiala and Sangrur, which caused traffic jams , especially on highways leading into and out of Punjab, but there were no reports of violence.According to farmer bodies in Punjab, villages on the route organized food (langar) for the farmers and volunteers provided free medical services.Jang Singh, district president of Krantikari Kisaan Union, said Tuesday would be remembered across the country as a day when a huge number of people took to the streets to fight for their rights.“The farmers are not going to relent till the government repeals these three acts, which will destroy the livelihoods of the farmers if are implemented,” he said.Farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been at the border points of the national capital since November 26, 2020, demanding legal backing for minimum support price (MSP) as well as a complete repeal of the three newly-enacted farm laws — Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — which they contend, will allow multinational companies to use the sector to maximise their profits at the expense of the farmers.The Centre has however held that the laws will not be repealed, but the government is willing to sit with the farmers to discuss the problematic clauses. The 11th round of negotiations between the state and farmers took place on January 22 ended in a deadlock.Farmer leaders said at least one person from each of the around 12,000 villages in Punjab was in Delhi to participate in the protests.In Haryana, farmers across the state carried out peaceful tractor marches and raised slogans against the Central government.Except Faridabad, where the police had to baton charge farmers trying to enter Delhi, no untoward incident was reported from anywhere in the state, said director general of police, Manoj Yadava. In many places, there was festive fervour at the tractor parades in which women from villages participated in large numbers, farmer leaders said.In Mumbai, the farmers concluded their protest at Azad Maidan, which began at noon with the unfurling of the flag, which was attended by farmers from across Maharashtra.Farmer leaders described the agitation as successful saying they were able to send a message that the state’s farmers are united against the farm laws.“The Mumbai agitation sent a message to the agitating farmers at Delhi’s borders that we are firmly behind them and will not relent till these regressive farm laws are withdrawn,” said Ajit Navale, convenor, Samyukt Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM) which organised this protest. The protest in Mumbai was supported by the state government.On Tuesday, 73-year old farmer Yamunabai hoisted the tricolor along with Maharashtra assembly speaker Nana Patole. later in the day, farmers started leaving Mumbai for their homes.In Karnataka, protestors managed to enter Bengaluru in support of agitating farmers in Delhi. The Karnataka police on Monday afternoon agreed to allow around 125 tractors to enter the city.Social media was flooded with videos of farmers sloganeering after they were restricted from entering Bengaluru, where protestors planned to carry out a rally . “We are organising vehicles for all those who have gathered here to be taken into Bengaluru by other modes of transport,” said a farmer, who is coordinating efforts on the Mysuru highway.In Tamil Nadu, farmers and workers belonging to labour unions of the DMK and its allies including the Left parties participated in the tractor rally across various districts. While the rallies ended peacefully by afternoon, there were some minor clashes between the police and farmers in a few districts. No injuries were reported.The state’s main opposition party, DMK and its allies have protested and launched hunger strikes in support of the agitating farmers in Delhi in the recent months. However, the ruling AIADMK government, which is allied with the NDA, is in favour of the laws.In West Bengal, farmers and political parties held big rallies at several parts of the poll-bound state to show their strength.The biggest rallies of Left parties were in East Burdwan, Hooghly, Murshidabad and East Midnapore districts. “More than 600 tractors and two thousand motorcycles participated,” said Amal Haldar, senior peasant’s front leader of the CPIM.In Madhya Pradesh, farmer bodies claimed that tractor rallies were organised in at least 20 of the state’s 55 districts. Farmers also took out a 15-km long tractor and motorcycle rally in state capital Bhopal.Jagrut Kisan Sangathan convenor Irfan Jafri said that the Bhopal administration did not allow a tractor rally in urban areas, protestors took out the vehicle parade in the rural areas of Bhopal. In Barwani district, a 16-km bullock-cart parade was carried out.Rallies were also taken out in Raisen, Shivpuri, Bhind, Morena and Gwalior districts. “Farmers took out peaceful rallies even in Vindhya and Chambal regions,” said Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh leader Subhash Pandey.In Jharkhand, the All India Kisan Sabha, Left parties, the Congress and RJD took out tractor and motorcycle rallies in different parts of the state.Farmer leaders also read the preamble of the Constitution and urged the Central government to respect it by withdrawing the three farm laws. Farm leaders said they would continue the protest till January 30.Farmer protests were also reported from Uttarakhand, Himachal, parts of Odisha, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rally-to-langar-peaceful-stir-held-across-20-states-101611696650066.html
27-01-2021||India||At Rajpath, many firsts in the shadow of a pandemic||e participation of a woman fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s tableau, and the appearance of Rafale fighter jets were among several significant firsts in the 72nd Republic Day celebrations on Tuesday as the country showcased its military might and exhibited its cultural hues at festivities held under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Capital.From T-90 tanks and BMP-II infantry combat vehicles rumbling down Rajpath to fighter jets performing some breathtaking manoeuvres in the skies, to indigenous rockets and missiles, India put on display its war machines at a time when the country is locked in a tense border stand-off with China.Besides, 17 tableaus from states and Union Territories (UT) depicted the cultural heritage of the country in curtailed celebrations organised in adherence to strict safety protocols and social distancing norms in view of the pandemic. The tableau of Uttar Pradesh showcased the heritage of the ancient town of Ayodhya, and the replica of the Ram temple that is being built there, as well as stories from the epic Ramayana. The Delhi tableau had an image of the Red Fort and the redevelopment of Shahjahanabad in the Old City.Another highlight was a 122-member contingent of the Bangladesh Armed Forces that took part in the march at Rajpath as part of the celebrations linked to 50 years of that country’s liberation. Also, the tableau of UT Ladakh made its first appearance this year. There was no chief guest at the Republic Day parade this time — a first since 1966. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was to be the chief guest, cancelled his visit to India owing to rising Covid cases in his country.While nine tableaus from different Union ministries and paramilitary forces took part in the Rajpath parade, six from the defence ministry, too, attended the event. Rafales, Sukhoi-30s and MiG-29s — fighters that are part of the IAF’s muscular posture in the Ladakh theatre — were among the 42 aircraft in the fly-past, a key attraction. The Rafale jets took part in the parade for the first time.Other military equipment displayed included the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile, Pinaka multi-launcher rocket system, bridge layer tank T-72, Samvijay electronic warfare system and Schilka weapon system.The IAF tableau featured one of India’s first women fighter pilots — another first in the high-profile event. Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth was part of the tableau that showcased mock-ups of the light combat aircraft, light combat helicopter and the Sukhoi-30. Also, among those who flew the Mi-17 V5 choppers that showered petals at the parade was Flight Lieutenant Swati.This year, the parade was shorter and involved fewer participants because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The shortened route of the parade meant it ended at National Stadium, instead of Red Fort. Only a fourth of the usual number of spectators were allowed at Rajpath — not more than 25,000 spectators, compared to over 100,000 people who usually turn up for the parade. Children below the age of 15 and those above 65 were not allowed among the visitors at the venue.Before the parade began, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to India’s fallen heroes by placing a wreath at the National War Memorial at India Gate. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh were present at the memorial.President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and several cabinet ministers were among the dignitaries who witnessed the parade.The parade was led by Lieutenant General Vijay Kumar Mishra, general officer commanding, HQs Delhi Area. The march past included Param Vir Chakra and Ashok Chakra awardees (India’s highest wartime and peacetime gallantry awards, respectively), an army mounted column of 61 Cavalry, and marching contingents of the Jat Regiment, the Garhwal Rifles, the Mahar Regiment, the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles and Bengal Sappers.The Indian Navy’s tableau depicted the navy’s role in the 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Photos of Maha Vir Chakra awardees were displayed on the rear part of the trailer, while the sides showed murals depicting the surrender ceremony.The fly-past featured a vintage Dakota aircraft — used for dropping paratroopers during the 1971 war — that flew in formation with two Mi-17 V5 helicopters, marking the golden jubilee celebrations.The IAF’s C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, C-130J Super Hercules special operations plane, Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission choppers, too, took part in the fly-past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-rajpath-many-firsts-in-the-shadow-of-a-pandemic-101611689502682.html
27-01-2021||India||Farmers' tractor rally violence: Dark day for the Republic||This is how it ends, not in order, but chaos, not peacefully, but violently; and not as a concerted display of farmer power, but a descent into chaos best exemplified by images of tractors being driven at high speed, in circles, at ITO in the centre of the national capital, threatening to run over anyone in the way.This was not how it was supposed to be. The 62-day-long farm protest, seen by many as a fight of the small man against the State, was expected to reach a climax of sorts with a tractor rally through three designated routes in Delhi. Farm unions that hammered out a compromise with Delhi Police that made this possible, promised a display of pageantry that would rival the morning’s Republic Day parade.This was how it actually was: one of the groups from Ghazipur deviated from their agreed-upon route, and reached ITO, where they ran riot; another, from Singhu border, deliberately took a turn they were not meant to, and stormed the Red Fort, where one of the protesters climbed the first available flag post (it was empty and not the one where the national flag always flies) and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and subsequently engaged in a violent clash with policemen who were trying to disperse them.This was how it actually was: one of the groups from Ghazipur deviated from their agreed-upon route, and reached ITO, where they ran riot; another, from Singhu border, deliberately took a turn they were not meant to, and stormed the Red Fort, where one of the protesters climbed the first available flag post (it was empty and not the one where the national flag always flies) and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the flag of the Sikhs, and subsequently engaged in a violent clash with policemen who were trying to disperse them.As much as the Union government can be blamed for letting things come to such a pass, as much as Delhi Police can be faulted for intelligence failure for not anticipating the events of the day, the ultimate blame has to lie with the farmers, and their leaders, who are now saying how certain unions did not agree with the plans for the tractor rally decided mutually with Delhi Police and took matters into their own hands.Darshan Pal, one of the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body coordinating the protests, condemned the violence, and tried to dissociate himself from it. “Undesirable and unacceptable events have taken place today. We dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts,” he said. But it won’t be easy to blame the rampage on fringe elements or others embedded among the protesters as part of a conspiracy (although theories to this effect are already doing the rounds). This was simply a protest that got horribly out of hand; a march where the leaders were either absent or not able to control the crowd.The protesters may have genuine concerns about the farm laws, but images of tractors being used to ram through buses and barricades, armed men with swords on horses trying to run down policemen, and the police rushing containers, buses and barriers to block key roads in central Delhi meant that the immediate concern was not the laws but law and order.A protesting farmer died after his tractor overturned at ITO during the rally on Tuesday, police said. A video showed the tractor ramming into a police barricade.The police fired tear gas shells and resorted to baton charges at several poiseveral points where clashes broke out. Delhi Police said 83 personnel were injured after being attacked by agitating farmers. “Protesters turned violent at some places. Many police personnel were injured and public property also damaged. I appeal to protesters to return through the designated routes and maintain peace,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal.Some groups of farmers began returning to their respective sit-in sites in the evening after hours of clashes, but thousands could still be seen in several areas including ITO, Nangloi and Mukarba Chowk. Visuals also showed people gathered at the Red Fort. Mobile internet services were suspended in three Haryana districts of Sonipat, Jhajjar and Palwal for 24 hours ending 5pm Wednesday, the state government said on Tuesday evening, as violent protests rocked Delhi. Mobile internet was restricted by the police in some parts of the national capital and several Metro stations were also shut down temporarily through the day.Several questions remain.Will the farmers continue their protest?The Samyukt Kisan Morcha called off the “Kisan Republic Day Parade” in the evening and appealed to all participants to return to their respective protest sites. The organisation announced that the movement will “continue peacefully” and further steps will be discussed and decided soon.Will the government continue to hold out its offer of deferring the laws by 18 months while talks continue?Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday said that farmers should accept the government’s proposal to suspend the laws. Tomar did not speak about the government’s next move on Tuesday evening.Will Delhi Police and the home ministry act against the farm groups?Delhi Police said that legal action will be taken against those who assaulted police personnel during the farmers’ rally. Union home minister Amit Shah held a review meeting with senior officials, including home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava and Intelligence Bureau director Arvind Kumar, to assess the law and order situation. The Union home ministry will deploy additional paramilitary forces in the national capital after the clashes, people aware of the developments said.And will the Supreme Court, which has sidestepped the issue thus far, finally deal itself a hand to resolve the crisis?India’s 72nd Republic Day, it was expected, would be a celebration of the soldier in the morning and the farmer in the afternoon, a real-life display of Lal Bahadur Shastri’s popular slogan Jai Jawan; Jai Kisan. Instead, it ended up showcasing ugly scenes of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-tractor-rally-dark-day-for-the-republic-101611688709228.html
27-01-2021||India||Union leaders make appeal, divert blame after anarchy reigns||Leaders of farm unions protesting three new agricultural laws, shaken by the events of the day, took recourse to the cliche of “anti social elements” among the protestors, as they desperately sought to deflect the blame for the violent actions of thousands of protesters, who knocked down barricades, clashed with police, and breached the Red Fort as they drove through the nation’s capital in tractors on Republic Day.The chaos and violence have raised questions about the future of the two-month-long agitation of farm unions. Leaders offered conflicting explanations of what happened. Only at dusk, by which time farmers had run riot through parts of the Capital, did the main organiser of the protests, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, deem it fit to call off the tractor march, asking all farmers to return to their camps on Delhi’s borders.Samyukt Kisan Morcha insisted a majority of the protesters stuck to agreed routes and were peaceful, and dissociated itself with a large section of farmers who broke ranks to unleash chaos in the heart of the Capital.Thousands of farmers drove tractors from the borders of Delhi into the city for a massive tractor rally on Tuesday. Soon, they defied police orders and turned towards important institutions in the centre of Delhi, creating a security nightmare on Republic Day.They hoisted Sikh religious flags atop the Red Fort from where the Prime Minister delivers his Independence Day speech. Riot police beat protestors with batons and fired tear gas to scatter mobs at several places in Delhi. In return, the protesters tried to run down policemen with their tractors.By noon, top leaders of the farm unions, who repeatedly appealed for a peaceful march, appeared to have lost control over large breakaway factions of farmers as mobs left routes approved for their to march and reached central Delhi, which they were supposed to avoid according to an agreement reached between police and the farm unions. As mobs infiltrated the Red Fort and the ITO area, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha hurriedly issued a statement.“Despite all our efforts, some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts. Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement,” the unions’ statement said, without providing any evidence of such infiltration. The farm unions described the events as “unacceptable”. Their leaders said they “dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts”. Cracks have appeared in the unions over the violence. Some farm leaders blamed one farmers’ organisation, the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, for not accepting an agreement between the farm unions and Delhi Police on routes. “The first group that broke the set routes was not part of the Punjab platform, and since yesterday, farmer leaders from Samyukt Kisan Morcha were pleading with them not to do this,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm leader. Kuruganti was referring to the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, a farmers’ organisation led by SS Pannu and SS Pandher. Pandher blamed police for beating farmers first. Kuruganti blamed the organisation for breaking rules to start the parade two hours earlier than scheduled and breaking routes, leading to the first clashes at Mukarba Chowk, a major junction. “We still don’t know who all went into the Red Fort,” Kuruganti said.HT’s reporting shows that groups from Singhu border and Ghazipur reached Red Fort.Several farmer leaders blamed actor Deep Sidhu for the chaos at Red Fort. Sidhu, who acted in Punjabi films before campaigning for candidates in the 2019 general elections, was summoned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) two weeks ago in connection with a sedition case against US-based banned pro-Khalistan outfit Sikhs For Justice.Darshan Pal, a key organiser of the protests, admitted some farmer organisations broke ranks. “It is unfortunate. We have appealed to everybody to return to their bases. Those who stay put in the Capital will have to face the law.” A senior farm leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, alleged that the faction that broke away in the Ghazipur area was led by the Rashtriya Lok Dal. Pal said the Samyukt Kisan Morcha would probe the “unexpected” turn of events, which could weaken the farmers’ agitation, but said the peaceful protests would continue.“It is deeply embarrassing and anguishing for us. It has definitely dented our image. We will have to reassess our strategies,” one farm leader said, requesting anonymity. “Peace is our strength. If peace is broken, then our strength is broken,” said Yogendra Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-leaders-make-appeal-divert-blame-after-anarchy-reigns-101611686912418.html

27-01-2021||India||1.12 million PM Kisan fund transfers failed during lockdown: RTI data||Over 1.12 million fund transfer failures were reported across the country under the PM-Kisan scheme during the Covid lockdown between March 23 and July 31. As many as 63,30,00, or over 56% of the failed transactions as of July 31, were successfully reprocessed but beneficiaries in the remaining 44% may not have received the money, according to information obtained from the agriculture department under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.PM-Kisan cash transfer scheme was launched in February 2019. Under the scheme, income support of ₹6,000 is annually provided in three equal instalments to small and marginal farmer families with combined landholding of up to 2 hectares.Also read | Some people in Delhi are trying to teach me democracy every day, says PM ModiMadhya Pradesh accounted for the largest--64.55%--of failed transactions (72,90,00) followed by Maharashtra with 85,000 (7.54%). Karnataka reported over 55,000 failures, Bihar 51,000 and Uttar Pradesh 48,000 failures. “Together these five states accounted for almost 86% of the total fund transfer failures during the Covid-19 lockdown,” said activist Venkatesh Nayak, who filed the RTI application for information on fund transfers.As many as 96% or 61,20,00 of failed transactions were reprocessed in Madhya Pradesh followed by Maharashtra 12,810 and Uttar Pradesh 1,986.Nayak said the data given to him was until July 31. He added it may have been updated but is not publicly accessible.An agriculture department statement issued after this report was first published said that the overall payment success to the beneficiary accounts under PM-KISAN scheme has been 98% since inception.“The transaction failures which happen may be due to numerous reasons such as network failure, closure of bank account or death of the beneficiaries etc. Hence, in order to ensure that all the beneficiaries receive their instalments, standard operation guidelines are devised to reprocess the transaction failure cases and attempt sending the failed payment again,” the department said.Venkatesh Nayak said the funds involved were not indicated in the response. “...if one were to assume that each case of transfer failure pertains to one instalment of ₹2,000, the total amount involved is more than ₹22.58 lakhs. However, how many beneficiaries were affected is also not known.”Nayak said almost 44% of the failed transactions remained to be reprocessed. “...all of them might have been reprocessed successfully at the time of writing of these findings.”(This report has been updated to reflect the response of the agriculture ministry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmkisan-scheme-around-44-of-funds-failed-to-reach-beneficiaries-during-lockdown-101611125403935.html
27-01-2021||Today's||In a post-pandemic world, a green budget as a vaccine for nature||Our relationship with nature has seldom taken centre-stage in the cold harsh world of Gross Domestic Product, balance sheets and the temperamental stock exchange. But even hard-nosed economists will accept now that a stable economy must have a resilient ecological system as its bedrock. As the finance minister gets ready to present the budget, it may be appropriate to ask whether we are investing in our natural green capital so that it continues to give us the benefits of clean air, water and other ecosystem services. Take a look at the funds allocated to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) — a statutory authority of Project Tiger for ensuring better management of tiger reserves across India. The funds allocated may have increased marginally from year to year, but the fact is that the number of tiger reserves, too, has gone up — starting from just nine in 1973 to more than 50 in 2020. And so have the problems in their management. For instance, they need more boots on the ground to patrol and protect them.Rajesh Gopal, who has served as the member secretary of the NTCA, argues that an investment in tigers is also an investment in ecosystem services such as clean air or water, and tourism is not the only revenue the animal generates. For instance, in 2016, nearly 2.5 million man-days worth of daily wages were dispensed to local people who are employed to patrol the forest. The nearly 350 rivers that originate from tiger reserves and tiger habitats play a major role in carbon sequestration.Forest officers complain that while budgets are announced with great fanfare, how much reaches the states and when is crucial. Due to the delay in disbursement of funds, salaries to frontline staff and daily wage workers also get delayed.Still, wildlife experts hope that the budgetary allocations will move beyond tigers and elephants to many species in need of attention. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has identified more than 20 critically endangered species that need support. Wildlife conservationist MK Ranjitsinh, who was one of the key architects of India’s Wildlife Protection Act, hopes that funds are allocated for each of these species such as the Great Indian Bustard or the Gangetic dolphin.Another aspect of a green budget is how much money is being spent on providing clean air to cities suffering from high levels of pollution. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) was launched in 2019, aimed at reducing key air pollutants across 102 cities in India. A detailed analysis was conducted by Legal Initiative on Forest and Environment of the funds dispersed by the environment ministry to state pollution control boards to tackle air pollution. The study found that funds were allocated on an ad hoc basis to the states and the amounts allocated were not enough. For instance, ₹1 crore has been allocated to Varanasi for one mechanical sweeper, whereas Patna has got a budget allocation for three mechanical sweepers. Just one mechanical sweeper is not sufficient to cover the entire city of Varanasi. Additionally, just this one intervention, in lieu of other technology, is questionable as mechanical sweepers have been unable to remove smaller dust particles, ie, particulate matter.The same analysis found that cities such as Agra, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Kanpur and Lucknow have specific budgets for construction and demolition waste (C&D) management facilities, whereas other cities do not. It’s not like the other cities don’t have the problem of construction and demolition waste. Therefore, budgetary allocations for clean air have to be guided by sound science if any of the targets are to be metAs Ranjitsinh points out, the question is not just of finding the money, but finding the political will to protect nature. And perhaps, if the finance minister is listening, a green budget may be just the vaccine that nature needs in a post-pandemic world.Bahar Dutt is an award-winning environmental journalist teaching at the Shiv Nadar UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-a-post-pandemic-world-a-green-budget-as-a-vaccine-for-nature-101611668964809.html
27-01-2021||Today's||Reshape spending, at the Centre and in states||Modern monetary theory, which has garnered some support among United States (US) politicians, brings a new perspective on the relation between money and the government. Its principal proposition is that governments that issue their own money can’t go broke, for they have the power to issue more. Its adherents go on to argue that the role of taxation is not to enhance the spending power of governments, for they can always issue money, but to enforce acceptance of the government’s paper as legal tender. This is because taxes must be paid in legal tender, and not in any other medium. While this is an interesting perspective, it does not have a view on why governments spend at all. Public spending is very large in the most successful economies of the world, namely in Europe and the US.It may be justified on the grounds that we need public goods to make us more productive and to have a better life. Roads and bridges would fall in the first category and parks and sanitation in the second. These goods are termed “public” for they are accessible to all. Now, precisely because access to them cannot be denied, they are unlikely to be provided by the private sector.In addition to public goods, there are some private goods which attract public expenditure as they give rise to positive externalities, or favourable spillovers for the social good. Health and education are examples of such goods. Think of educated individuals enhancing the productivity of those with less education or healthier individuals reducing the possibility of transmission of communicable diseases. For these reasons, governments tend to provide health and education, even though they are not strictly public goods. I shall refer to health and education as the social sector of the economy. With this understanding of public expenditure, turn to the situation in India. Studying the expenditure pattern of the Government of India, we find that for close to a decade now, its combined spend on capital goods and the social sector has hovered around 20%. It is remarkable that this has been a practice common to both the United Progressive Alliance and National Democratic Alliance governments, suggesting that, in an important area of economic policy, there has been little difference between these two ostensibly rival political formations.Now, it should be a matter of concern to us that only about a fifth of public expenditure goes towards capital spending and the social sector. This needs reconfiguration, with the allocation tilted towards these sectors, away from subsidies and public administration among other items.Since 2003, the fiscal, nay economic, policy of the central government has been guided by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act. This has involved focusing on the volume of spending, with the requirement that the fiscal deficit be taken towards the figure of 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is not just that this figure is arbitrary, perhaps borrowed from the figure adopted by the European Union for its member countries, the trouble is that with our eyes riveted on the fiscal deficit, we lose sight of where public expenditure is going.Indeed, we had not given enough thought to the question of expenditure on health till the Covid-19 pandemic erupted, exposing our total unpreparedness, particularly in terms of health infrastructure.When on the question of public expenditure on health, our focus shifts to the states of India, for health is a state subject and there are startling results. While the composition of public expenditure of the states has received little attention at the national level, it is perhaps more crucial than the Centre’s public expenditure as it has greater impact on our everyday life.The average share of health expenditure in the total budgetary spending of the states was barely 5% in 2018-19. This was a slightly higher share than that of the Centre in that year but not much more, and nowhere near what it should be given both the importance of health and that it is a state subject. While there is no clear definition of what the right level of expenditure on health should be, we have good reason to believe that the states have neglected it in their budgetary allocation for decades.How do we know this? There is a substantial variation in the mortality from Covid-19 across the states of India. Sreenath Namboodhiry and I have shown that mortality is inversely related to public expenditure on health as a share of the State Domestic Product. In addition, we found to our surprise that there is an inverse relation between this measure and state per capita income. That is, the richer states of India have chosen to spend less in relation to their capacity than the poorer states, with deadly consequences.In the season of budget presentations, with the economy reeling under the impact of Covid-19, we will, of course, expect the Centre to step up its expenditure. However, states must play a significant role too. They could start by reconfiguring public expenditure to strengthen their social sectors.Pulapre Balakrishnan is a professor of economics at Ashoka University, SonipatThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/reshape-spending-at-the-centre-and-in-states-101611668484799.html
27-01-2021||Today's||The roots of the BJP’s unilateralism||With farm unions refusing to engage with the committee set up by the Supreme Court to examine farm laws, rejecting the government’s offer to suspend laws for 18 months and engage in talks, and holding a parallel tractor rally which turned violent on Republic Day, the standoff between the Centre and farm groups has intensified. Notwithstanding the merits and demerits of the farm laws, there is an emerging consensus that the Centre did not engage in enough consultation with states and farm groups, underestimated the mobilisational capacity of these unions, and adopted a unilateral approach. It was this unilateral approach and the accompanying communication gap that has resulted in the prevailing precarious situation, in which both sides believe that blinking first is a costly strategy.This is part of a recurring pattern, in which the Narendra Modi government finds itself on a collision course with various interest groups. For instance, trading classes were alienated by demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax; students protested in many parts of the country after Rohith Vemula died by suicide; Dalit groups mobilised against the dilution of the legislative framework against atrocities; labour unions began a movement against changes in labour laws; and religious minorities stood up against the proposed Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens. While the government backtracked on some occasions after vehement opposition, it doubled down on its stand at other moments.What explains the increasing number of standoffs of various interest groups with the Centre in recent years? The government’s unilateral approach is the primary reason for growing disquiet. And this unilateralism is a result of the hard-nosed political approach and cold-minded electoral calculations of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2014. The party under the leadership of Modi and Amit Shah has acquired a distinct style of dealing with friends and foes alike — what some would describe as the Modi-Shah doctrine — to negotiate from a position of strength.One part of this unilateralism comes from the political socialisation of the BJP’s new leadership. The key difference between the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-LK Advani era and the Modi-Shah moment in Indian politics is that the top BJP leaders in the past were creatures of the Central Hall of the Parliament. They could reach out across the aisle. The new BJP leadership is not deeply embedded in the Central Hall culture, and there is an acute trust deficit between the government and the Opposition.The BJP in the Modi-Shah era is also missing interlocutors. After the demise of Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, there are hardly any leaders, except Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, who can play the role of conciliators. There are a handful of Opposition leaders who could warm up to Modi and Shah. All of this has compounded the BJP’s inability to hear the other side.But the root cause of its unilateralism is more likely shaped by political events and experiences of the BJP leadership in power. My conversations with several BJP leaders and sympathisers suggest that the Modi-Shah doctrine, for right or wrong reasons, is rooted in the belief that opposition to their regime is not based on principled positions.The vehement opposition the party faced inside the Parliament and on the streets between 2014 and 2016 — remember the protests against the amendment to the land acquisition legislation, the award wapsi marches, electoral losses in Delhi and Bihar, the suit-bootki sarkar jibe, among others — led them to conclude that despite the party’s historic win, there is an obstructionist cabal that thinks that the BJP has no right to govern India.The BJP believes that there is a network of academics, activists, journalists and few Opposition leaders (the Khan Market gang in its lingo) that keeps scheming to delegitimise the Modi government in the public eye. It is because of this intractable nature of the Opposition, the party suspects, that the protests against government policies are not restricted to a specific clause or point, but often seek a complete reversal of the government’s position or a reversion to the status quo.And, therefore, in order to neutralise this cabal, the BJP is also pushed to assume a maximalist position to mirror and counter the maximalist position of the Opposition. In its calculation, this ensures that even a mid-point reached through negotiations changes the equilibrium in the BJP’s favour.Many have argued that given the weakness of Opposition parties, especially the Congress, the BJP does not have to fear any political backlash. The BJP, however, will do well to realise that it is increasingly becoming a prisoner of its own propaganda. Once the die is cast, even the most sophisticated players cannot control all the pieces in the game. Similarly, electoral dominance leads to hubris, and it is easy to lose sight of the plot.This unilateralism has already marred the BJP’s relations with its allies, including long-standing partners such as the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal, to the point that there now remains only one non-BJP minister at the Centre. The BJP doesn’t invest enough in wooing them because it considers these allies as electoral deadweight riding the coattails of Modi’s popularity.While this uncompromising approach may not lead to an outright defeat at the polls, there is an electoral cost associated with bypassing major social forces in any political set up. It erodes the political legitimacy of the governing regime, which can then begin to have electoral implications. The BJP must start building bridges across the political divide and minimise the backlash if it wishes to sustain its dominance over Indian politics for a long period.Rahul Verma is a fellow, Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-roots-of-the-bjp-s-unilateralism-101611668065118.html
27-01-2021||Editorials||Farm protests turn anarchic | HT Editorial||On Republic Day, even as India displayed its cultural diversity and military might on Rajpath, farm groups — which had been permitted to hold a tractor rally after the official ceremony concluded, on specific routes, peacefully — violated each of their promises and unleashed anarchy on the streets of Delhi. Protesters stormed into the Capital earlier than stipulated; they deviated from agreed routes; they displayed their swords and sticks and used tractors to ram through barricades; they engaged in violence and vandalism and destroyed public property; they attacked the police as authorities sought to impose order; and they stormed into the Red Fort and hoisted the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag, although not at the spot where the national flag always flies.This newspaper has consistently warned against maximalism shown by farm groups — and their unwillingness to reciprocate even as the government has stepped back, substantially, on the farm laws. But this maximalist approach descended into unacceptable behaviour on Tuesday. And this deserves harsh condemnation from all quarters. Instead of celebrating what democracy offered them — a chance to register their protest in the Capital within reasonable boundaries — farm groups mocked every democratic tenet by flouting the understanding with authorities and undermining the rule of law.Farm unions, which now claim they had no control over the miscreants, can’t run away from their responsibility. They have displayed poor political leadership of a mass movement — and have been led by the crowd, instead of educating and moderating, the crowd. And if they didn’t have control, they should not have organised Tuesday’s protests in the first place. The episode is also a lesson for those believe that street protests are an effective antidote to policies with which they disagree. Protest is a fundamental right, but radical, uncompromising politics from the streets, based on appropriating law-making powers, sets off the wrong precedent for the future and can turn volatile. The Delhi Police must also introspect about intelligence failures and absence of operational preparation that led to the situation on Tuesday and hold culprits accountable. But the ultimate responsibility lies with the farm protesters. With violence, their protests have now lost legitimacy. They must express genuine remorse for Tuesday’s violence, cooperate with the investigation, accept the government’s offer of an 18-month suspension of laws, if it is still available, and call off the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/farm-protests-turn-anarchic-hteditorial-101611669505294.html
